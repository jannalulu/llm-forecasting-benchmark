Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: [relieved] Another day passes without nuclear catastrophe. Our models had it at 0.8%.

Philip: [nodding] The probability was remarkably low, despite tensions. The safeguards held.

Nate: Though there were moments... Remember that false alarm in August?

Philip: Yes, but our models accounted for historical close calls. Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we've had dozens of near-misses - the '62 Cuban Missile Crisis, the '79 NORAD computer glitch, the '95 Norwegian rocket incident. Yet safeguards prevailed.

Nate: [examining data] The model weighted heavily on institutional safeguards and mutual deterrence. Even with current global tensions, the probability of actual detonation remained fractional.

Philip: That's the thing about low-probability, high-impact events - they're rare for good reason. The systems work.

[Both turn back to their monitors, continuing their analysis]

Nate: [relieved] Another day passes without nuclear catastrophe. Our models held true.

Philip: [studying data on his screen] Indeed. Given the historical data from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, plus all those close calls during the Cold War, our models had it at 0.23%.

Nate: The probability was remarkably low, despite some concerning factors. Nuclear deterrence and international safeguards have proven effective.

Philip: [nodding] Exactly. While there have been close calls throughout history, the actual probability of a non-test detonation has remained extremely low. The Cuban Missile Crisis taught us valuable lessons.

Nate: [standing] It's sobering to think about those accidents we've narrowly avoided, though. Each incident has led to better failsafes.

Philip: And that's reflected in our probability assessment. Sometimes the best forecasts are the ones that don't come true.

Nate Silver: [removing his glasses, looking exhausted] Another close call yesterday.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding solemnly] The models had it at 2.15%. Low probability, but not negligible.

Nate: Those tensions in August between Russia and NATO had everyone on edge. Remember those false radar readings in Finland?

Philip: [pulling up data on his tablet] Yes, but our models factored in the fail-safe protocols that prevented escalation. Still, it was the closest we've come since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Nate: The diplomatic breakthrough on August 20th was crucial. Without that...

Philip: [interrupting] Without that, our probability would've been closer to 15%. Thank god for back-channel diplomacy.

Nate: [standing, walking to window] Sometimes being right about these low-probability events isn't comforting. Each percentage point represents millions of lives.

Philip: And that's why we do this work.
