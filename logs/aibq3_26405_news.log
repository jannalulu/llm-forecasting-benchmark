**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024 OT**
The Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024 is predicted to be very active, with 17-25 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes expected. Although there is no way to predict how many storms will make landfall, the warm waters in the Gulf and Caribbean are already conducive to storm formation. The official start of hurricane season is June 1st and lasts until November 30th. To prepare for a storm, it is recommended to have essentials such as bottled water, non-perishable foods, portable phone power banks, batteries for flashlights and fans, and a power generator if possible. Dr. Levi Cowan has also posted a preview of the season, explaining why it is likely to be very active due to the transition from El Niño to La Niña waters in the Atlantic.

**When Does the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season End?**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and has already seen three named storms, including Beryl, the most destructive so far. According to the Colorado State University (CSU), the season will end on November 30, 2024, and is expected to be 'hyperactive' with 25 named storms, 12 of which will become hurricanes, and six of those will be major hurricanes. The CSU updated its forecast in early July, increasing the prediction from 'extremely active' to 'hyperactive'. The reasons for this hyperactivity include warmer ocean temperatures, which provide more energy to tropical cyclones, and the end of the El Niño phenomenon, which had been present throughout 2023 and had been breaking up tropical cyclones. Alberto, Beryl, and Chris are the three named storms that have occurred so far this season.

**NOAA Predicts 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season to be One of the Most Intense on Record**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be one of the most intense on record, with over 20 tropical storms expected in the next five months. The season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, has an 85% chance of being more active than usual. NOAA expects 17 to 25 named storms, a record in the organization's 154-year history. Of these, 8 to 13 are expected to become hurricanes with winds of 74 mph or more, and 4 to 7 could reach major hurricane categories, including categories 3, 4, or 5 with winds of 111 mph or more. The main causes of this high activity include the La Niña phenomenon and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. According to NOAA scientists, the transition from El Niño to La Niña favors the development of cyclones. Other factors include reduced trade winds and less wind shear, which facilitate the formation and strengthening of storms. Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, said, 'There are reasons to be concerned, but not alarmed. Yes, it's the highest number, but it's about being prepared. So, now is the time to be prepared.'

**2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season Expected to be Most Significant in Decades**
According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be the most significant in decades. The WMO has announced that the season will be above average, with 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The increase in sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic and the development of La Niña in the Pacific are contributing factors to this prediction. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has also announced the names for the tropical storms that will form in the Atlantic. For Mexico, the forecast indicates that 15 to 18 systems with names will occur in the Pacific and 20 to 23 in the Atlantic. However, not all of these systems will impact Mexico. At least five could affect the country. The preparation is essential for those living in areas vulnerable to hurricanes, particularly around the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Long-term forecasts cannot determine with certainty when individual storms will form or their paths. If a tropical storm system forms in this region, there is a possibility of rapid intensification, possibly near the coast. Therefore, it is crucial that people be aware and have their hurricane plans ready.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024: How Many Tropical Waves Will There Be?**
The 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season will begin on June 1 and end on November 30, with authorities issuing an alert due to the presence of three tropical waves in the area. According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) of the United States, these tropical waves are located in separate points of the Atlantic Ocean. The first wave is located east of the Windward Islands, moving westward. The second wave is located in the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, moving west-northwest. The third wave is located off the west coast of West Africa, moving westward. Although none of them show signs of developing into storms or hurricanes, local and national meteorological experts are monitoring them to detect any changes that could lead to the generation of cyclonic activity in the coming days. Authorities recommend taking measures such as keeping drains, roofs, and gutters clean, having an emergency plan, and having a supply kit with important documents, food, water, and a first-aid kit.

**John Morales: The signs for hurricane season are troubling. Is there any hope?**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be extremely active, with up to 38 tropical storms forecasted, which would break the previous record of 31 set in 2020. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Colorado State University (CSU) are projecting up to seven major hurricanes, more than double the normal number. The main driver behind this hyperactive hurricane outlook is ocean heat content, with the Atlantic Ocean being unusually warm. However, a La Niña phenomenon is expected to occur this year, which could lead to weaker westerly winds aloft, allowing tropical storms to intensify into hurricanes. The signs are troubling, but there is hope. While no one can predict where the storms will hit, the Miami & Ft. Lauderdale area gets hit about once every 3 years, and it's essential to be prepared. The author advises taking action by knowing your home's vulnerability, getting covered, and making a plan for evacuation zones.

**Why the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season Will Be 'Extraordinary'**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting an extraordinary season with an increase in the number of tropical storms and hurricanes. The forecast indicates 17 to 25 named tropical storms, 8 to 13 hurricanes, and 4 to 7 major hurricanes of category 3 or higher, which is more than double the historical average. The factors behind this forecast include above-normal sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic tropical region, regional climate change to La Niña conditions by the end of the year, and the recent weakening of El Niño. These combined elements increase the probability of tropical storm and hurricane formation and intensification. The predicted impacts of this season are significant, with warmer waters leading to more intense and dangerous hurricanes, generating intense rainfall, coastal flooding, and more impactful storm surges. Additionally, there is a higher risk of rapid intensification, which poses an additional threat to vulnerable coastal regions. The NOAA highlights that the average Atlantic season has 14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, demonstrating the gravity of the forecast for 2024.

**Extremely Active 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season Predicted**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be extremely active, with up to 13 hurricanes predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency forecasts an 85% chance of a season above normal, with 17-25 named storms and 8-13 hurricanes, including 4-7 major hurricanes. This is the highest forecast ever issued by NOAA. Climate factors such as high ocean temperatures and the return of La Niña in the Pacific are contributing to the increased activity. Scientists are concerned about the potential for one or two major hurricanes to make landfall in the United States, causing significant damage. The combination of La Niña and warm Atlantic waters could be catastrophic for the Caribbean, Central America, and North America. The NOAA also warns of the possibility of a strong monsoon in West Africa that could generate powerful storms in the Atlantic. Climate change is also expected to increase the risk of coastal flooding and storm surges. In contrast, the Governor of Florida has signed a law eliminating most references to climate change from state legislation, claiming it is a response to 'radical green fanatics'. Historically, similar hurricane seasons to what is expected in 2024 were in 1973, 1983, 1998, 2010, and 2016, with an average of 16 named storms, almost 10 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.

**This Atlantic hurricane season could look like 2020's as La Niña and warmer ocean fuel fierce storms**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be exceptionally active, with forecasters predicting 17 to 25 named storms, 8 to 13 hurricanes, and 4 to 7 major hurricanes. The warm tropical Atlantic Ocean and a cool tropical eastern Pacific Ocean are the main factors contributing to this forecast. The warm Atlantic Ocean provides heat energy for hurricanes to form, while La Niña conditions in the eastern Pacific promote upward motion and reduce wind shear, making it easier for hurricanes to form and intensify. The combination of these two factors is expected to lead to a highly active hurricane season, similar to 2020, which saw a record 30 named storms. Climate scientists are warning of a busy hurricane season, with ocean temperatures already high and expected to remain so throughout the summer.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season Expected to Show Above-Normal Activity**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, is expected to show above-normal activity with an 85% probability. The NOAA predicts a range of 17 to 25 named storms, with 8 to 13 becoming hurricanes, including 4 to 7 major hurricanes. The forecasters have a 70% confidence in these ranges. The expected increase in hurricane activity is due to a combination of factors, including record-breaking warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic, the development of La Niña conditions in the Pacific, reduced trade winds in the Atlantic, and a decrease in wind shear. As one of the strongest El Niño events on record comes to an end, scientists predict a rapid transition to La Niña conditions, which favor hurricane activity in the Atlantic. Additionally, the abundant ocean heat content in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean creates more energy for storm development. This hurricane season also presents the possibility of an above-normal monsoon in West Africa, which could produce some of the strongest and most persistent Atlantic storms. Finally, light trade winds allow hurricanes to strengthen without interruption from strong wind shear and also minimize ocean cooling.
