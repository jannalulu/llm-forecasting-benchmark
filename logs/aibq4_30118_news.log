**Trends for the New Year 2025: Successful Shades for Meeting the Green Wooden Snake**
The upcoming year 2025, under the patronage of the Green Wooden Snake, is a time for people to choose a new year's outfit that will bring them good luck and harmony. The snake, as an ancient symbol of wisdom and elegance, combined with its wooden element, represents a desire for nature, sustainability, and vitality. Therefore, the choice of color and style of new year's clothing becomes particularly important, as it can be a guarantee of success in the new year. According to piterburger.ru, the key colors for 2025 are green, yellow, turquoise, and metallic shades. Each of these colors has its own significance, making them important for both fashion and interior design. Green, the main color, is associated with life and harmony, representing nature and renewal. It is ideal for creating a calm and stable atmosphere. Shades of green, from bright emerald to soft pastel, will help create a space filled with freshness and vitality. Yellow, symbolizing the sun and warmth, will be a bright accent in the 2025 palette, bringing joy and prosperity, especially on New Year's Eve. Combining yellow with green and gold shades will create an atmosphere of celebration and positive change, attracting good luck and happiness. Turquoise, representing calmness and creativity, will help create balance and harmony in personal life. It can reveal creative potential, which is especially important during a period when people strive for self-expression. A turquoise outfit or accent in the interior will create a sense of freshness and tranquility. Metallic shades, such as gold, bronze, and silver, will add a touch of luxury and elegance. These shiny details symbolize success and material well-being, making them ideal for festive accessories. They will help complete the look, adding sophistication and shine. However, it is essential to remember that in 2025, it is recommended to avoid dark blue and black colors, which may conflict with the energy of the Wooden Snake. These colors are associated with the water element and may block positive changes. A proper color palette will help create a mood that corresponds to expectations and aspirations for the new year. For women, this year offers unique opportunities for experimenting with festive fashion. Stylists recommend choosing shiny fabrics and accessories that will emphasize elegance and add magic. Evening dresses made of velvet or silk with varying lengths from medium to maxi will be a successful choice, and decorations made of rhinestones and crystals will add a special shine. Dresses with drapery or flared sleeves will create an unforgettable style. In addition, jumpsuits with wide pants and bright decorative elements are a fashionable and original option for those who want to look impressive, especially in rich burgundy and emerald colors. Women's suits in non-standard colors, decorated with rhinestones or embroidery, will be perfect for a New Year's Eve. Accentuating skirts and tops with rhinestones, asymmetrical cuts, or lace will add romance and sophistication to the look. For men, it is worth paying attention to the choice of color and style of clothing that will correspond to the symbolism of the year of the Snake. Classic silhouettes, combined with lucky colors, will be an excellent choice. Elegant suits in emerald, burgundy, or gray shades will emphasize status and style. Fabrics such as velvet or tweed will add respectability to the look. Quiet chinos or slacks in beige or brown will perfectly match bright shirts and cardigans. A velvet jacket in a smart casual style will look great with dark jeans. For an accent, you can use a green tie or a brooch on the lapel, which will also symbolize good luck.

**Tintas Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**
The Tintas Suvinil, a Brazilian paint company, has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature). According to Bruna Galliano, the company's creative director and color consultant, 'In a complex and multifaceted time, a single color would not be able to summarize the sentiment of the time. Choosing more than one is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can coexist and create new possibilities that benefit everyone.' The company's research showed a sense of community, a new tomorrow, and a new today, which led to the selection of these three colors. The Coral paint company, on the other hand, has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and lively yellow) as its color for 2025, which is meant to transform any space and help people step out of their comfort zone. The Pantone Color Institute has not yet announced its color for 2025, but the WGSN, a company that specializes in consumer trends, has chosen Future Dusk (a blue-purple tone).

For example, you can combine a matte black polish with a green glaze, creating an effective contrast. In addition, the use of various effects, such as 'cat's eye', will give the nail design a mysterious look. Such a nail design will be perfectly suited to the New Year.

After preparing your nails and applying polish, it is extremely important not to forget about moisturizing. Use special oils or creams to prevent dryness and cracks. To avoid damaging your nails, try to avoid sudden movements, such as opening tin cans or working with tools that can damage the coating. Proper nutrition plays a significant role in the health of your nails. Make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals, such as biotin and zinc, which help to strengthen the nail plate. Regular nail corrections will help keep your nail design in perfect condition. Even if you made a nail design for New Year's, don't forget about its condition during the holidays.

**The colour palette for 2025 – these are the shades paint experts say we’ll see everywhere next year**
The colour palette for 2025 has been announced by major paint brands, and it's all about darker, autumnal shades paired with occasional pops of lightness. Mandy Rippon, product manager at Frenchic Paint, says 'There is currently an eclectic mix of colours of the year and paint palette predictions for emerging colour trends... In 2025, we will see neutrals getting warmer and earthier and deeply serene, nature-inspired colours continuing to grow in popularity.' Earthy tones are set to dominate, with rich jewel shades like purple and brown leading the way. Lick's colour palette for 2025 includes both dark jewel tones and earthy tones, as does Benjamin Moore's colour palette accompanying its COTY of 2025, Cinnamon Slate. Dulux's colour of the year for 2025, True Joy, is a vibrant, sunny yellow that can be used as an accent colour or as part of a wider colour scheme. 'Whilst yellow is one of the bolder colours on the spectrum, True Joy is complementary to a vast range of palettes, it brings out the positivity in even the most neutral of shades and is the figurative glue that binds more daring colour stories together,' says Marianne Shillingford, creative director and colour expert at Dulux. The cultural mood for 2025 is nostalgia, which has trickled down into interiors, impacting how we decorate our homes. Lick's colour palette of 2025 features eight different shades that decorators would be familiar with, that would encapsulate that feeling of nostalgia and inspire decorators to think about the colours of their childhood.

**Colors and Styles for Good Luck in 2025: A Guide to the Year of the Wooden Snake**
According to astrologers and feng shui experts, the colors and styles that will bring good luck and prosperity in 2025 are green, yellow, beryl, and metallic tones. Green is the main color of the year, symbolizing nature, renewal, and harmony. Yellow represents the sun and prosperity, while beryl promotes creativity and balance. Metallic tones, such as gold and bronze, will attract wealth and luxury. On the other hand, dark blue and black should be avoided as they may conflict with the energy of the Wooden Snake and create tension. For women, the recommended styles include evening dresses in velvet, silk, or satin, and combinations of wide pants with bright decorative elements. For men, the suggested styles include suits in green, bordeaux, or gray tones, paired with bright shirts or cardigans. Each zodiac sign has its own unique colors and styles that will bring good luck and prosperity in 2025.

The upcoming spring-summer 2025 season will bring a vibrant explosion of colors, moving away from the neutral tones that dominated the past seasons. The key colors of the season are soft pink, bright yellow, and metallic silver. Soft pink is associated with femininity, sweetness, and serenity, but in this season, it's presented in a more subtle and relaxed way.

It's perfect for those who enjoy a more audacious approach to fashion and can be worn in a variety of pieces, from metallic pants to jackets, tops, and chalecos. To balance the bold colors, neutral tones like white, black, and beige will continue to be essential.

**The Symbol of 2025: Green Wooden Snake and Its Influence**
The year 2025 will be marked by the influence of the Green Wooden Snake, according to the Eastern tradition. This symbol is associated with wisdom, intuition, and the ability to adapt. The Green Wooden Snake is the sixth sign of the Chinese zodiac and is believed to bring people a tendency to deep self-awareness, intuitive understanding, and strategic thinking. This year will be a time for self-reflection and seeking new perspectives, as the Snake is said to embody the ability to adapt and build long-term plans. The element of the year will be Wood, which emphasizes the need for growth and development, like a young, green tree that grows and adapts to its surroundings. Green is a symbol of harmony and fertility, and psychologically, this may manifest as a desire to create and strengthen new relationships, build personal resources, and find sustainable solutions to old problems. The lucky colors of the year will also be white, black, yellow, and gold, which are associated with the tree and symbolize different aspects of success and inner growth: white - purity and new beginnings, black - wisdom, and gold and yellow - joy, prosperity, and warmth.

**We're Calling It: the Official Color Trends of 2025**
According to ELLE Decor, the official color trends of 2025 are: brown, purple, muted red, chartreuse, dusty blue, and a pink with brown undertones. Brown, specifically Truffle, a rich chocolate-meets-taupe, is expected to dominate the design world, complementing a wide range of styles. Purple, including Digital Lavender and Mauve Finery, is predicted to be the new neutral in interiors. Muted red, such as Paprika, is expected to add drama to spaces without being overwhelming. Chartreuse, a neutral when paired with darker tones, is poised to go supernova. Dusty blue, a versatile color with universal appeal, is expected to become central to creating personal and curated spaces. A pink with brown undertones, such as Mochi, is also on the radar, delivering cocooning, restful, and charming spaces. 'Complex muddier pink, purple, green, and yellow tones that have earthy, grounded bases' is what ELLE DECOR A-List designer Ghislaine Viñas anticipates. 'Earthy and moody tones that are, well, muddied' is what Etsy trend expert Dayna Isom Johnson echoes. 'I foresee a shift toward introspective colors, tones that feel familiar yet nuanced, with a subtle complexity that invites reflection' is what architect Hannes Peer says. 'Everyone is saying that brown is back and going to become the new millennial pink,' Viñas says. 'Personally, I am more drawn to complex muddier pink, purple, green, and yellow tones that have earthy, grounded bases.'

**'Rishabh Pant met MS Dhoni in Delhi, someone will be wearing Yellow jersey soon...', says THIS CSK legend**
Rishabh Pant, the 27-year-old Delhi Capitals wicketkeeper-batter, was not retained by the team on IPL 2025 Retention Day. Pant had a remarkable comeback in IPL 2024 after a car crash in 2022, scoring 446 runs in 13 matches. According to an IPL source, Pant had a cordial relationship with the team owners but struggled to find a common vision for the team. Pant will now enter the IPL 2025 mega auction, with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) being one of the teams interested in signing him. CSK legend Suresh Raina said, 'I met MS Dhoni in Delhi, Pant was also there. I think something big is to happen. Someone will be wearing a yellow jersey soon.' Raina's comments come amid reports that Pant is headed to CSK, where he could be the next big-selling face for the franchise.

**IPL 2025: Rishabh Pant to play for Chennai Super Kings? Ex-CSK star Suresh Raina drops major hint | Mint**
Former India cricketer Suresh Raina hinted that Rishabh Pant may join Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Raina, a former CSK stalwart, revealed that Pant will be wearing a yellow jersey soon, indicating a possible move to the five-time champions. Pant, who led Delhi Capitals in IPL 2024, was released by the franchise on Thursday. Raina's statement comes after CSK retained Ruturaj Gaikwad, Matheesha Pathirana, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, and MS Dhoni for IPL 2025. Pant enjoys a cordial relationship with Dhoni, and the former captain and the franchise want a smooth transition under the 43-year-old. 'Someone will be wearing a yellow jersey soon,' Raina said, dropping a major hint on the retention day. With Pant's skills and experience, he is likely to fetch a huge amount in the mega auction, which is set to be held at the end of November in Saudi Arabia. Pant has 446 runs under his belt from 14 matches and played a crucial part in India's title-winning campaign in the T20 World Cup.

Suresh Raina hinted that Rishabh Pant could join Chennai Super Kings (CSK) soon, saying, 'I think something big is to happen. Someone will be wearing a yellow jersey soon.'

Pant has scored 3,284 runs at an average of 148.93 in 111 matches for DC, making him the franchise's leading run-getter. He has also led the team to the playoffs in 2021, but they failed to progress beyond the league stages in 2022 and 2024 under his leadership. DC has retained several players, including Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Tristan Stubbs, and Abishek Porel, ahead of the next IPL season.

**Biniam Girmay Aims for Yellow Jersey in 2025 Tour de France**
Eritrean cyclist Biniam Girmay, who won three stages and the green jersey in the 2024 Tour de France, has set his sights on the yellow jersey in the 2025 edition. 'This year I had an incredible experience in the Tour de France, with three magnificent stage wins and the green jersey. In 2025, the Tour will be one of my main objectives, where I will try to be at my best level to win again,' Girmay said after the presentation of the 2025 route. The route, which features a mix of flat and mountain stages, has a 'classic' feel with a challenging final week, including a time trial and finishes on iconic mountains like Hautacam and Mont Ventoux. Girmay believes that the first stage, which could be won by a sprinter, is a great opportunity for him to take the yellow jersey. 'I think there's a good balance between stages for pure sprinters and others with more elevation that suit me better,' he said. Intermarché-Wanty, Girmay's team, will be participating in the Tour for the eighth time and director of performance Aike Visbeek is optimistic about their chances. 'At first glance, the 2025 Tour de France offers a balanced route, and the presence of several finishes for fast men and 'puncheurs' should lead to exciting and great opportunities for our riders,' he said.

**Tour de France 2025: Sprinters' Chance in the Nord Region**
The official route for the 2025 Tour de France has been announced, featuring three stages in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region from July 5-7. The first stage, from Lille to Lille, is expected to be a sprinter's opportunity, with Jasper Philipsen saying, 'It's evident that this will be an objective, it's a chance for us all to wear the yellow jersey, and that doesn't happen every year.' The region's flat plains will provide another chance for sprinters on the second stage, from Valenciennes to Dunkerque, but Christian Prudhomme warns, 'You'll need to be careful of the wind.' Thierry Gouvenou, the architect of the route, says they decided not to include cobblestones in the first stage, 'We really hesitated, we didn't want to add unnecessary stress, and the first stage at Lille will allow the sprinters to dream of a yellow jersey.'

The fashion world is eagerly awaiting the announcement of Pantone's 2025 color, a trend that will set the tone for upcoming collections and styles worldwide. Although Pantone has not officially announced the color, rumors and predictions are circulating among experts, with one of the tones that sounds strong being Future Dusk, a shade that combines blue and purple, evoking the serenity and freshness of cloudy landscapes. This color projects calmness and tranquility, and its versatility will allow it to be the protagonist in both daytime and nighttime looks, depending on how it is combined with other tones and textures. Future Dusk recalls the Very Peri of 2022, but with a greater inclination towards blue, making it colder and more serious. It is an elegant and contemporary option that adapts to a wide range of styles and occasions. The article also mentions previous Pantone colors, including Ultimate Gray and Illuminating (2021), Very Peri (2022), Viva Magenta (2023), and Peach Pink (2024). For 2025, the color is expected to be widely used in formal suits and dresses, elegant shirts, and accessories, and will be a great option for those looking for a refined and timeless look.

**8 Color Trends to Expect in 2025**
Experts predict that in 2025, the interior design world will see a mix of unexpected and traditional colors. According to them, the following 8 color trends will be popular next year: 'Deep, bold shades that really stand out' will be used as accents in rooms to emphasize a brighter and lighter palette. These saturated tones bring depth, elevating the space with a sense of elegance and sophistication. Neutral honey-like shades will continue to play a balancing role in offsetting bold accents and adding warm notes to the room. A designer notes that 'soothing and warm neutral colors have replaced cool, harsh whites.' For example, a soft terracotta brown, reminiscent of sun-baked clay, underlines the rise of earthy and warm tones. A vibrant purple hue, reminiscent of eggplants, grapes, and jam, is expected to make a splash in 2025. This bright color brings a sense of warmth and energy to interior spaces. One expert calls purple basil the color of the year 2025. This bold and striking shade not only pays homage to the plant but also inspires people to make a bold color choice for their interior. Brown tones have become 'sweeter' compared to their outdated look in 1970s interiors, and designers predict that in 2025, shades inspired by desserts, from chocolate and coffee to caramel and macarons, will dominate. Blues of medium tones have been in the spotlight for a few years, but it's time for deeper and more enchanting shades to shine. A bright ultramarine hue is highlighted for its ability to provide an captivating yet soothing atmosphere. A sky blue cobalt tone shows a connection to nature in your home, whether the walls are painted in such a tone or you have a couch in such a shade. Earthy and saturated yellow colors, reminiscent of umbers and ochres, are expected to become more popular as people prefer tones that create comfort and relief. Saturated warm colors based on umbers and ochres create cozy, peaceful, and charming spaces, says an expert. The color of ochre in the interior of a room / Photo Nathan Schroder. The shade of ruby and nostalgic red colors will play an important role in 2025. One expert mentions a 'hot' ruby shade, reminiscent of the fiery tones of the 90s, as one that will be in trend next year. Candy colors will be the accents in 2025. These bright tones create an electric feeling in the room, while serving as a departure from the gray tones often used in interior design in recent years.'
