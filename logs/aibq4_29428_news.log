**South Dakotans to vote on recreational marijuana**
South Dakotans will vote on Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational marijuana use for adults. According to the Attorney General's explanation, the measure would allow adults to possess, grow, ingest, and distribute marijuana or marijuana paraphernalia. Rhonda Milstead opposes the measure, citing concerns about the risks associated with marijuana use. Matthew Schweich supports the measure, arguing that it would replace unregulated dealers with a regulated system and protect kids from drug dealers. Schweich said, 'Measure 29 is good public policy, it supports the principles of personal freedom and individual responsibility.' Milstead countered, 'They'll talk about freedom, okay let's just make everything free. You drive as fast as you want. You take as many drugs as you want. Is that how we want life to be? Freedom is about living together, and living together in a good way.' The measure would not legalize the sale of marijuana, which would have to be done separately.

**Recreational marijuana is on the South Dakota ballot this November. What to know:**
Recreational marijuana is on the ballot in South Dakota this November as Initiated Measure 29 (IM-29). If passed, the measure would allow those aged 21 and older to possess, grow, ingest, and distribute marijuana. Proponents argue that IM-29 is a 'common-sense policy' that would boost revenue and allow law enforcement to focus on 'real crime.' Opponents, however, claim that it would lead to increased public health risks, especially among teens, and impaired driving. Matthew Schweich, sponsor of IM-29, says that voting yes would protect personal freedom and restore the will of the people. According to a fiscal note, IM-29 would reduce incarceration expenses by $581,556 per year. No changes would be made to the medical marijuana program.

**IM 29 would legalize recreational marijuana in SD**
Initiated Measure 29 (IM 29) is a ballot question in South Dakota's 2024 General Election that would legalize recreational marijuana for those 21 years of age or older. The measure would allow individuals to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to 6 plants, and distribute marijuana paraphernalia. However, possession and use would remain illegal for those under 21, and driving under the influence of marijuana would also be prohibited. The measure would not impact hemp or the state's medical cannabis program. Proponents argue that IM 29 would 'protect personal freedom, improve public health and safety, and restore the will of the people,' while opponents claim that it would lead to increased crime, suicide rates, and other negative consequences. 'A 'Yes' vote on IM 29 is a vote to approve access to recreational marijuana in South Dakota, while a 'No' vote is a vote to reject allowing access to recreational marijuana in South Dakota.'

**Recreational marijuana ballot measure organizers hold press conference in latest campaign effort**
The Yes on 29 campaign, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana in South Dakota, held a press conference to promote their effort. According to campaign manager Brad Jurgensen, the campaign is optimistic about this year's vote, despite previous failed attempts. A former South Dakota Highway Patrol Trooper, Alan Welsh, spoke about his experiences policing marijuana and stated that it is not a gateway drug. Rep. Kadyn Wittman (D) Sioux Falls emphasized that legalizing marijuana would not only benefit citizens but also the state, citing the estimated $37,000 per person per year that could be saved by releasing non-violent drug offenders and expunging their records. The state is currently budgeting for a new prison to address staffing issues at the South Dakota Men's Penitentiary.

**Déjà vu all over again: Marijuana on the SD ballot**
South Dakota voters have previously considered marijuana legalization, with Amendment A passing in 2020 but being later deemed unconstitutional, and Initiated Measure 27 failing in 2022. Now, Initiated Measure 29 is on the ballot, aiming to legalize marijuana for those 21 and older. Supporters, like Brad Jurgensen, argue that regulation is key to safety, while opponents, such as Rhonda Milstead, express concerns about the potential harm to children and the state's way of life. Both sides are optimistic ahead of the election, with Jurgensen predicting a 50% plus one result and Milstead confident that voters will recognize the potential risks. Absentee voting for the 2024 general election begins on September 20.

**Rapid City leaders share pros and cons of recreational marijuana legalization**
Rapid City leaders gathered to express their views on South Dakota Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational marijuana use, possession, and distribution for those aged 21 and older. Mayor Jason Salamun, Pennington County Sheriff Brian Mueller, and Rapid City Police Chief Don Hedrick all expressed opposition to IM 29, citing concerns about increased accidents, work-related injuries, and the potential effects of THC on children's and young adults' brains. They argued that communities where recreational marijuana has been legalized have seen negative consequences. In contrast, proponents of IM 29, including Kittrick Jeffries and Andrew Cisneros, argued that a well-regulated market would prevent users from being exposed to more dangerous substances and that sales tax benefits could bring in around $70-$80 million annually for South Dakota. Cisneros, who initially opposed recreational marijuana legalization, changed his mind after working in prisons for over 20 years and seeing the root causes of addiction.

**A look at Measure 5: Legalizing recreational marijuana in North Dakota**
North Dakota voters will decide on Measure 5, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana. Opponents, including Patrick Finken, chairman of Brighter Future Alliance, argue that it would increase depression rates and worsen the mental health crisis in the state. Kristie Spooner of the Soul Solutions Recovery Center also opposes the measure, citing marijuana's negative effects on memory and mental health. Supporters, such as Mark Freise, an attorney at the Vogel Law Firm, argue that marijuana is safer than other legal substances like alcohol and painkillers. Jack Hankenson, a veteran, supports the measure, stating that it would help him manage chronic pain and mental health issues, and that the stigma surrounding marijuana as a gateway drug should be ended. If passed, North Dakota would become the 25th state to legalize recreational marijuana use.

**Voters in 5 states will decide whether to legalize marijuana or psychedelics next week**
Next week, voters in five states will decide on ballot initiatives related to marijuana and psychedelics. In Florida, Amendment 3 aims to legalize recreational marijuana, which would be a significant step given the state's large population and demographics. The initiative has majority support, with 60% of voters in favor, according to recent polls. However, opponents, including Governor Ron DeSantis, argue that the measure is too permissive and would lead to increased marijuana use in public spaces. In contrast, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump supports the initiative, citing the need to end unnecessary arrests and incarcerations for small amounts of marijuana. In South Dakota, voters will consider Initiated Measure 29, which would allow adults to possess and grow marijuana at home, but not authorize commercial production. Polls suggest that the initiative will not fare better than previous attempts. In North Dakota, voters will consider Initiated Measure 5, which would allow adults to possess and grow marijuana at home and authorize commercial production. A recent poll suggests that the initiative has a better chance of passing than the South Dakota measure. In Nebraska, voters will consider Initiative 437, which would allow patients to use medical marijuana to alleviate medical conditions. A recent poll suggests that the initiative has majority support. In Massachusetts, voters will consider Question 4, which would decriminalize noncommercial production, sharing, possession, and use of five psychedelics, including psilocybin and DMT. Polls suggest that voters are evenly divided on the issue, with a substantial share of voters undecided.

**US Voters to Decide on 147 State Measures in Upcoming Elections**
In the upcoming US elections on November 5, voters will not only be deciding on high-profile positions such as the presidency and vice presidency, but also on various state measures that will have a significant impact on their communities and the rights they enjoy. In addition to voting for the next US president, citizens will be choosing governors, mayors, judges, prosecutors, as well as all members of the House of Representatives and a third of the available Senate seats. Several important topics will be up for grabs, including the legalization of abortion, salary adjustments, and reforms to drug legislation. In total, 41 territories of the nation will be voting on 147 legal measures to appear, or not, in their state codes. In various states, citizens will have the option to modify their constitutions to protect reproductive rights. For example, in Arizona and Nevada, there is a push to enshrine the right to abortion up to fetal viability. NBC News notes that these issues 'have captured national attention in a year dominated by the presidential campaign.' Furthermore, over 39 measures will be on the ballot related to democratic procedures, including voting and elections. Eight states are considering constitutional amendments that limit voting exclusively to US citizens, highlighting that their approval could consolidate existing local and federal regulations. In Nevada, there is a proposal to require identification for in-person voting, which would require approval in two consecutive elections. Regarding the economy, several states are preparing to decide on increases to the minimum wage and other economic issues. California proposes to gradually raise it to $18 per hour by 2026, while states like Alaska and Missouri are debating increases to $15 per hour by 2027. 'This trend towards economic justice is clear,' said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a center that supports citizen-driven measures. In terms of drug legislation, proposals aim to legalize recreational cannabis in states like Florida and South Dakota. In some states, even the legalization of psychedelic substances for medical and investigative purposes is being debated. Additionally, the use of medical marijuana will be evaluated in states like Nebraska, moving towards a more inclusive and regulatory policy in the cannabis field. Other notable topics include immigration, with a measure in Arizona aimed at increasing the use of federal databases to verify the eligibility of immigrants for work and allowing local agencies to apply federal regulations. However, for many Democratic and progressive groups, this proposal has been perceived as a resurgence of the controversial anti-immigrant legislation of 2010 and is considered to stimulate conservative voting. Other highlighted topics include state measures in Colorado to impose special taxes on the sale of firearms to finance services for victims of crimes. In Georgia, voters will decide on the creation of a state fiscal court, with the goal of improving the state's financial administration.

**What happens to medical cannabis if IM29 passes in South Dakota?**
If Initiated Measure 29 (IM29) passes in South Dakota, allowing adults to use marijuana, medical cannabis businesses in the state will need to adapt. Kittrick Jeffries, owner of 1889 Farms and Puffy's dispensaries, recommends that lawmakers look at Ohio's experience, where voters approved adult-use marijuana after previously legalizing medical marijuana. The Ohio report suggests preserving a supply of reasonably priced marijuana products for medical patients, enhancing access to medical marijuana, and ensuring needed potency is available for patients. According to IM29's official explanation, the ballot measure would allow adults to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to six plants, and ingest and distribute marijuana. However, issues such as taxation and how adult-use marijuana would be grown or distributed are not addressed. IM29's sponsors say the measure was written in open-ended fashion to give the Legislature room to choose a path. Recent polls show mixed results, with some showing a majority of voters would vote against IM29, while others show a majority would vote for it.

**Psychedelics and Marijuana on the Ballot: How Should Employers Prepare for Potential Legalization?**
Several states will vote on ballot measures regarding the legalization of marijuana and psychedelics in the upcoming November 5, 2024 general election. Employers should be aware of these measures and prepare for potential changes to workplace policies. The measures include: Florida's 'Adult Personal Use of Marijuana' which allows adults 21+ to use marijuana for non-medical purposes, Massachusetts' 'Legalization and Regulation of Psychedelic Substances Initiative' which decriminalizes the personal use of natural psychedelic substances, Nebraska's 'Nebraska Medical Cannabis Patient Protection Act' which allows qualified patients to use cannabis for medical purposes, North Dakota's 'Cannabis Legalization Initiative' which allows for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis, and South Dakota's Initiated Ballot Measure 29 which legalizes the recreational use of marijuana. None of these measures require employers to permit or accommodate the use of marijuana or psychedelics in the workplace. However, employers should be prepared to update their employment policies and communicate any changes to employees.

**Letter - Opp 10-25-24**
South Dakota has a medical cannabis program since 2020, making recreational marijuana unnecessary. The main reasons for recreational marijuana, as proposed by Initiated Measure 29, are to make money and to get 'high.' However, the marijuana industry's high profits do not translate to tax windfalls for states, as seen in Colorado where $4.50 is spent on social costs for every $1 raised in taxes. Furthermore, recreational marijuana use has devastating effects, including a 138% increase in traffic deaths with drivers positive for marijuana in Colorado. The potency of marijuana has also increased, with concentrated forms reaching up to 99% THC, leading to accidental poisoning, teen suicides, workplace accidents, addiction, and psychosis. Black markets, cartel involvement, and human trafficking also increase with recreational marijuana. As reported by government sources, including www.rmhidta.org and https://www.samhsa.gov/, it is recommended to vote No on reckless IM 29. 'We need to think of the consequences of this decision and the impact it will have on our state,' said the author. 'It's not just about making money, it's about the well-being of our citizens.'

**Our view: No on IM 28, send Dusty back to Washington and more endorsements**
The Mitchell Republic is endorsing several measures for the November election, citing their importance to South Dakota's way of life. They recommend a 'no' vote on IM 28, which would prohibit taxing consumable items, due to its vagueness and potential impact on local budgets. The newspaper also endorses Dusty Johnson for Congress, citing his common-sense approach and commitment to South Dakota's values. Additionally, they support Amendment H, which would establish a top-two primary election, allowing all registered voters to participate. Finally, they endorse IM 29, which would authorize the recreational use of marijuana, citing its potential to alleviate the state's court system and allow law enforcement to focus on more pressing issues. 'We want to see Dusty Johnson continue making an impact for South Dakota in Congress,' the newspaper states. 'This will alleviate an already busy court system that should focus more on the state's meth problem rather than spending any extra time on small amounts of marijuana.'

**South Dakota voters divided over ballot measures on abortion, marijuana**
A recent poll in South Dakota found voters closely divided on two key ballot measures: legalizing recreational marijuana and protecting abortion access. The poll, conducted by Emerson College Polling/KELO-TV/The Hill, showed that 50% of respondents oppose legalizing marijuana, while 45% support it. Similarly, 48% oppose the measure to create a right to abortion in the state constitution, while 45% support it. The poll found significant partisan splits, with 84% of supporters of Vice President Harris in favor of the abortion measure and 72% in favor of the marijuana measure. Young voters were the most supportive of legalizing marijuana, with 68% of votes under 30 in favor. The poll's close results demonstrate the crossover appeal of the measures in a state where Trump leads Harris by 27 points.

**South Dakota medical cannabis operators hope adult-use legalization would bring sales plan**
South Dakota voters will decide on Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize marijuana possession and small-scale home cultivation for adults 21 and older. However, the measure does not establish a market for regulated sales. Medical marijuana operators in the state are hoping for adult-use legalization to reverse a decline in patient numbers, which dropped from 13,500 in March to 12,500 as of September. If IM 29 passes, lawmakers will be under pressure to pass laws legalizing and regulating commercial cannabis activity. Industry operators believe that the proliferation of unregulated hemp in South Dakota will put more pressure on lawmakers to legalize commercial marijuana sales. 'I'm very optimistic' that lawmakers will do so in 2025, said Kittrick Jeffries, the founder and CEO of Puffy's Dispensary in Rapid City. 'Leadership in the Republican Party has already come out and said that was the right thing to do if it passes, whether they believe it or not,' Jeffries said. 'I believe that the intent is very clear from the voters that it's up to the Legislature to create guardrails.'

**Poll: Support slips for abortion, open primaries, grocery tax measures**
A recent poll in South Dakota has shown a decline in support for several ballot measures, including Amendment G, which aims to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, Amendment H, which proposes open primaries, and Initiated Measure 28, which seeks to repeal the state's 4.2% sales tax on groceries. The poll found that 50% of registered voters support Amendment G, 40% support Amendment H, and 49% support IM 28. Meanwhile, opposition to these measures has increased, with 47% opposing Amendment G, 56% opposing Amendment H, and 45% opposing IM 28. The poll also found that support for recreational marijuana, as proposed by Initiated Measure 29, has increased slightly, but remains opposed by a slim majority of 51%. Additionally, Amendment E, which aims to change outdated male-only references in the state constitution, has been met with strong opposition, with 66% of registered voters opposing the measure.

In South Dakota, Measure 29 would legalize personal use and possession of cannabis for adults 21 and over, while in North Dakota, Measure 5 would allow adults to use cannabis at home without punishment. In Florida, Amendment 3 would allow operating medical cannabis dispensaries to sell cannabis to adults over 21, and in Nebraska, Initiative Measures 437 & 438 would establish a medical cannabis program and regulate its use for patients with serious health conditions.

A new poll co-sponsored by South Dakota NewsWatch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at USD shows that the proposed constitutional amendment on abortion in South Dakota (Amendment G) is now too close to call, with 47% opposing it and 47% supporting it. The poll also shows that Initiated Measure 28 to repeal the state sales tax on consumable items is favored by a 49 to 45 percent margin, and Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational use of marijuana, would be defeated by a 51 to 44 percent margin if the election were held today.

**ND VOTERS SPOTLIGHT – What is Measure 5?**
North Dakota voters will decide on November 5 whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Initiated Measure 5, the Marijuana Legalization Initiative. A 'yes' vote would allow adults aged 21 and over to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, four grams of concentrate, and other specified amounts. Supporters argue that legalization could boost the economy by creating jobs and generating tax revenue, while opponents express concerns about public health and safety risks. North Dakota voters have previously rejected marijuana legalization in 2018 and 2022, but 24 states and Washington, D.C. have already legalized recreational marijuana. Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, stated, 'We need to prioritize community well-being, advocating instead for prevention and education.'

**Commentary: Make the effort, register by the deadline, and vote in this vital election**
The upcoming election in South Dakota is crucial, with several key ballot issues and candidates vying for positions. Voters will decide on Amendment G, which would either restore abortion rights or subject the unborn to uncertain abortion laws. Initiated Measure 28 aims to eliminate the state sales tax on groceries, but critics argue it could lead to a significant shortfall in state revenue. Constitutional Amendment H would introduce a single primary ballot, while Initiated Measure 29 would legalize recreational marijuana use. Referred Law 21, passed as a Landowner Bill of Rights, has been referred to a vote of the people. With a potential influx of new, conservative lawmakers, voters must carefully consider the candidates and ballot issues. As the author notes, 'Good citizenship takes some effort, but it’s worth it.'

**Sinuous Roads To Cannabis Legalization Ahead For 4 States 2024**
Four states - Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska - are gearing up to vote on cannabis legalization measures in the 2024 election. Florida's Amendment 3, which would legalize adult-use cannabis, is facing opposition from Governor Ron DeSantis and Attorney General Ashley Moody, and recent polls show it may not reach the 60% approval threshold required for passage. In South Dakota, Initiated Measure 29 would decriminalize possession and use of up to 2 ounces of cannabis, but a recent statewide survey found that 52% of respondents oppose the measure. North Dakota's Measure 5, which would legalize recreational cannabis, has 45% support, with 40% opposed and 15% undecided. Meanwhile, Nebraska's medical cannabis initiatives are facing legal challenges, with accusations of fraudulent signature gathering. Polls show overwhelming support for medical cannabis in Nebraska, with 70% of Nebraskans in favor.

**Map shows states where legalizing drugs is on the ballot in November**
Six states in the US are putting measures to legalize either cannabis or psychedelics to a public vote in November. Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska are voting on recreational marijuana, while Massachusetts is voting on the legality of natural psychedelics. According to polling, support for the measures is split, with 45% of North Dakota voters in favor of recreational marijuana and 42% of Massachusetts voters in favor of natural psychedelics. Donald Trump has come out in support of Florida's Amendment 3, which would legalize recreational marijuana, while Gov. Ron DeSantis has come out against it. Emily Oneschuk, the grassroots campaign director for Massachusetts for Mental Health Options, argues that natural psychedelics can be effective for helping people with mental health challenges and should be treated as a public health issue, not a criminal issue.

**Every State Voting On Marijuana Initiatives Next Month**
Several states are preparing to vote on marijuana initiatives in the upcoming November 5, 2024 election. The measures, if passed, could significantly change marijuana laws in these states. Arkansas' Medical Cannabis Amendment of 2024 would allow patients to cultivate marijuana, remove restrictions on smokeable products, and introduce the potential legalization of recreational marijuana. Florida's Amendment 3 would allow those 21 and older to purchase and possess up to three ounces of cannabis. Nebraska's medical marijuana measures would provide legal safeguards for patients and healthcare providers, and establish a commission to oversee the registration and regulation of medical cannabis. North Dakota's Measure 5 would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older, while Oregon's Measure 119 would ensure cannabis workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. South Dakota's Measure 29 would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and grow up to 12 plants for personal use.

**IM 29: If voters decriminalize marijuana, lawmakers would make the call on sales**
Initiated Measure 29 (IM 29) in South Dakota aims to legalize the possession, use, and free distribution of up to 2 ounces of marijuana for adults 21 and older. The measure does not establish a retail market, leaving it to lawmakers to decide on sales. According to Matthew Schweich of South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws, this approach is similar to measures passed in other states. The measure is expected to save counties $581,556 per year in prosecution, defense, and incarceration costs. However, opponents like Rhonda Milstead of Protecting South Dakota Kids argue that legalization would lead to increased costs for law enforcement and addiction treatment, and that the state's existing medical marijuana program is sufficient. A recent poll showed 52% of voters opposed, 42% supportive, and 7% undecided.

**Recreational marijuana battle heats up**
The campaign for legalizing recreational marijuana in South Dakota is heating up, with an ad war between supporters and opponents. Matthew Schweich, sponsor of Initiated Measure 29, claims that opposition ads have crossed a line by suggesting that other drugs would also be legalized if the measure passes. However, Rhonda Milstead, Executive Director of 'Protecting South Dakota Kids,' disputes this claim, saying it isn't true. 'Protecting South Dakota Kids' is a group opposing the legalization of recreational marijuana.

**How two different law enforcement outlooks see IM 29**
Two former law enforcement officials, Ed Moses and Alan Welsh, have differing views on Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational marijuana in South Dakota. Moses, who served over 25 years with the Missouri highway patrol, expressed concerns about the potential impact of marijuana on health and law enforcement time. He argued that alcohol is a bigger problem and that marijuana legalization would not alleviate law enforcement's workload. In contrast, Welsh, a former South Dakota highway patrol officer and owner of a medical marijuana dispensary, believes that individuals should have the freedom to choose whether to use marijuana. He also questioned whether police officers would prefer to deal with someone who is drunk or high, suggesting that the latter is less of a problem. Welsh's perspective is that people should have control over their own choices, as long as they are 21 or older.

**State-Tribal Relations Committee weighs impact of ballot measures on tribal nations**
The State-Tribal Relations Committee met to discuss the potential impact of four ballot measures on tribal nations. The committee determined that Initiated Measure 28, which would eliminate state sales taxes on items for human consumption, and Referred Law 21, which would alter and implement new laws on carbon dioxide pipelines, could negatively impact state-tribal relations. However, they determined that Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize a limited form of adult recreational marijuana use and possession, and Constitutional Amendment E, which would update gender references for officeholders in the state constitution, could positively impact state-tribal relations. Committee co-chair Sen. Michael Rohl said, 'We wanted to make sure we're highlighting potential impacts these measures have for them and then let them decide whether they agree with that.' Nathan Sanderson, executive director of the South Dakota Retailers Association, stated that the elimination of food taxes and potential elimination of tobacco taxes would reduce revenue for eight tribal nations by about $3.5 million a year. Crow Creek Tribal Chairman Peter Lengkeek spoke against Initiated Measure 28, saying that the tribe relies on the tax revenue. Committee members voted 5-2 to adopt a positive determination regarding the recreational marijuana ballot question, Initiated Measure 29. They also unanimously passed a determination that Constitutional Amendment E would positively impact state-tribal relations.

**South Dakota's initiated measures offer lessons for future elections**
South Dakota's recent election cycle offers several lessons for future elections. Medical marijuana appears to be popular among voters, and it would have been a shame to ban it after the state legislature had already established regulations for a medical marijuana program. Running multiple ballot campaigns at once can be problematic, as seen with Dakotans for Health's efforts to legalize abortion and eliminate the state sales tax on groceries. If a ballot initiative is in doubt, it may be better to take it to court rather than the ballot box. The state legislature's decision to cut the state sales tax from 4.5% to 4.2% in 2023 may come back to haunt them if Initiated Measure 28, which would eliminate the state sales tax on groceries, passes. The initiated measure concept is under siege, with conservative Republicans like Chris Larson expressing concerns about its impact on the state. Larson stated, 'I think the initiated ballot system we have is not great for South Dakota,' and believes it shouldn't be used to change the constitution. However, the process is enshrined in the state constitution, making it difficult to eliminate altogether.

**'Nope on Dope' campaign targets North Dakota's Measure 5**
The 'Nope on Dope' campaign, launched by American Experiment North Dakota, aims to oppose Measure 5, a proposition on the November ballot that would legalize recreational marijuana use in North Dakota. According to the organization, allowing recreational marijuana would harm children, grow the black market, distract law enforcement, and not return revenue to the state treasury. The campaign is advertising online and directing voters to an informational landing page at www.nopeondope.com. This is not the first time voters have been asked to consider recreational marijuana legalization, as similar measures were defeated in 2018 and 2022.

**Legal marijuana advocates call opponents' ad “false and deceiving”**
Matthew Schweich, president of South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws, has called out Protecting South Dakota Kids for their ad 'Measure 29, Meth, Fentanyl, Opioid Abusers', saying it is 'demonstrably false and deceptive'. Schweich claims the ad is intended to deceive voters into thinking Measure 29 legalizes or decriminalizes hard drugs. However, Protecting South Dakota Kids' president, Jim Kinyon, denies that the ad lies or is intended to deceive voters. Kinyon says the ad is meant to highlight the potential consequences of legalizing marijuana, such as increased use of other substances. The two groups have been at odds over the issue of recreational marijuana, with South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws pushing for legalization and Protecting South Dakota Kids opposing it. The issue is set to be decided by voters in 26 days, with Measure 29 on the ballot.

**What you need to know about Initiated Measure 29**
Initiated Measure 29, a South Dakota ballot issue, would legalize the use of cannabis for adults 21 years or older. According to Brad Jurgensen, a member of the Yes on 29 committee, a yes vote would allow individuals to possess, grow, ingest, and distribute marijuana or marijuana paraphernalia. However, Attorney General Marty Jackley explained in August 2023 that the measure would not decriminalize the sale of cannabis, as the sale and criminal penalties would remain unaffected. Jurgensen stated that the measure is written in a way that simplifies the issue and allows the legislature to decide how South Dakotans can buy cannabis and how the state will get paid for it. The measure would still prohibit the possession, ingestion, and distribution of marijuana for those under 21 and would not affect state laws dealing with hemp or medical marijuana programs.

**IM 29 proponents upset with negative ads**
Supporters of Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize cannabis for adults in South Dakota, are upset with negative ads run by opponents. Matthew Schweich, Executive Director of South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws, says the ad leads voters to believe IM 29 would legalize or decriminalize hard drugs, stating, 'This ad in question states: ‘measure 29 doesn’t just legalize marijuana.’ This statement is made on the screen in large text (and) it is included in the voiceover.' Schweich claims the initiative 'only legalizes marijuana and marijuana products.' Opponents, however, argue that marijuana is not healthy and can lead to other drug use, saying, 'The truth is that marijuana is not healthy, marijuana will lead to other drug use, drug abuse and it’s going to harm our communities that’s the truth.' Schweich believes the ad could violate FCC regulations and plans to ask TV stations in South Dakota not to run it.

South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws (SDBML) held a press conference to address a deceptive advertisement by opponents of Initiated Measure 29, which aims to legalize cannabis for adults 21 and older in South Dakota. SDBML Executive Director Matthew Schweich called upon opponents to take down the ad, stating, 'This ad in question states: ‘Measure 29 doesn’t just legalize marijuana.’ This statement is made on the screen in large text. It is included in the voiceover. The question of what Measure 29 legalizes is not a matter of opinion. It is crystal clear, based on the text of the initiative, that Measure 29 only legalizes marijuana and marijuana-related products.' Schweich also warned South Dakota media outlets that running the ad would violate Federal Communication Commission rules, citing, 'Broadcasters are responsible for selecting the broadcast material that airs on their stations, including advertisements. The FCC expects broadcasters to be responsible to the community they serve and act with reasonable care to ensure that advertisements aired on their stations are not false or misleading.'

**Recreational marijuana is on the South Dakota ballot this November. What to know:**
Recreational marijuana is on the ballot in South Dakota this November as Initiated Measure 29 (IM-29). If passed, the measure would allow those aged 21 and older to possess, grow, ingest, and distribute marijuana. Proponents argue that IM-29 is a 'common-sense policy' that would boost revenue and allow law enforcement to focus on 'real crime.' Opponents, however, claim that it would lead to increased public health risks, especially among teens, and impaired driving. Matthew Schweich, sponsor of IM-29, says that voting yes would protect personal freedom and restore the will of the people. According to a fiscal note, IM-29 would reduce incarceration expenses by $581,556 per year. No changes would be made to the medical marijuana program.

**‘Food tax’ measure on November ballot**
South Dakota voters will face several ballot questions in the upcoming general election, including Initiated Measure 28, which would prohibit taxes on 'human consumption', and Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational marijuana use. Proponents of IM 28 argue that it would help low-income families by reducing the burden of grocery taxes, while opponents say it would lead to significant cuts in local budgets and essential government functions. Proponents of IM 29 say it would improve public health and safety, strengthen the economy, and generate new tax revenues, while opponents argue that it would increase crime rates and harm children. Referred Law 21 would provide new statutory requirements for regulating linear transmission facilities, allow counties to impose a surcharge on certain pipeline companies, and establish a landowner bill of rights. Proponents say it would protect landowners, hold pipelines accountable, and deliver property tax relief, while opponents argue that it would benefit pipeline companies at the expense of South Dakotans.

North Dakota voters will decide on five ballot measures in November. Measure 1 aims to update outdated terminology in the state constitution, replacing phrases like 'deaf and dumb' with more modern language. Measure 2 seeks to tighten requirements for citizen-initiated measures, including limiting ballot measures to one subject and increasing the required signature amount. Measure 3 would reduce the amount of Legacy Fund money available to lawmakers from 15% to 5%. Measure 4 would abolish the current property taxation system and replace it with a yearly payment from the state to local governments. Measure 5 would legalize recreational marijuana, allowing adults to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis flower and grow up to three plants per household. Proponents of Measure 5 argue that regulation would provide additional state revenue and shield users from black market contamination.

**2024 initiated measures offer lessons for future elections**
The 2024 initiated measures in South Dakota offer lessons for future elections. A petition effort to ban medical marijuana failed, while medical marijuana has gained popularity. Dakotans for Health faces a lawsuit over its handling of two ballot issues: Amendment G, which would legalize abortions, and Initiated Measure 28, which would eliminate the state sales tax on groceries. Lawmakers are faced with the potential passage of Initiated Measure 28, which would result in an estimated $134 million in lost revenue. The Legislature had previously cut the state sales tax from 4.5% to 4.2% in 2023, but this cut is set to expire in 2027. Conservative Republican activist Chris Larson has expressed concerns about the initiated ballot system, stating that it 'is not great for South Dakota' and should not be used to change the constitution. However, the process is enshrined in the state constitution, and opponents can only try to limit it through legislation.

**Port: Let's stop pretending like we're prohibiting access to recreational marijuana**
The author argues that North Dakotans should approve Measure 5, a ballot measure that would legalize access to marijuana for recreational purposes. They believe that most people buying medical marijuana in the state are healthy and using it as a pretense, and that the existing medical marijuana industry is financing the campaign to drop the 'medicinal marijuana' label and gain a return on their investment. The author notes that many people are already accessing marijuana through various means, including prescriptions, friends, or the black market, and that legalizing recreational access would not be a disaster, but rather allow law-abiding business people to enter the market. As the author states, 'I'm not interested in telling a cancer patient they can't have a joint to help them cope with chemotherapy.'

**Vote South Dakota forum aims to shed light on 'complicated' election**
A Vote South Dakota forum will take place on September 19 at Dakota Wesleyan University, where students will team up with journalists to ask questions to candidates and representatives of ballot measures. The event, presented by South Dakota Public Broadcasting and South Dakota News Watch, aims to shed light on the 'complicated' election, which includes seven ballot measures, including abortion rights and recreational marijuana.

Joel Allen, director of the McGovern Center, noted, 'This is going to be a complicated election, so when I heard about this event, it was a no-brainer.' The forum comes at a time of declining trust in democratic institutions, with a recent survey finding that more than 6 in 10 South Dakotans are dissatisfied with how democracy is working in the United States. Cara Hetland, director of journalism at SDPB, said, 'It's our duty to hold accountable those who are running for office and standing for these (ballot measures).'

**IM 29 would legalize recreational marijuana in SD**
Initiated Measure 29 (IM 29) is a ballot question in South Dakota's 2024 General Election that would legalize recreational marijuana for those 21 years of age or older. The measure would allow individuals to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to 6 plants, and distribute marijuana paraphernalia. However, possession and use would remain illegal for those under 21, and driving under the influence of marijuana would also be prohibited. The measure would not impact hemp or the state's medical cannabis program. Proponents argue that IM 29 would 'protect personal freedom, improve public health and safety, and restore the will of the people,' while opponents claim that it would lead to increased crime, suicide rates, and other negative consequences. 'A 'Yes' vote on IM 29 is a vote to approve access to recreational marijuana in South Dakota, while a 'No' vote is a vote to reject allowing access to recreational marijuana in South Dakota.'

The Yes on 29 campaign, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana in South Dakota, held a press conference to promote their effort. According to campaign manager Brad Jurgensen, the campaign is optimistic about this year's vote, despite previous failed attempts. A former South Dakota Highway Patrol Trooper, Alan Welsh, spoke about his experiences policing marijuana and stated that it is not a gateway drug. Rep. Kadyn Wittman (D) Sioux Falls emphasized that legalizing marijuana would not only benefit citizens but also the state, citing the estimated $37,000 per person per year that could be saved by releasing non-violent drug offenders and expunging their records. The state is currently budgeting for a new prison to address staffing issues at the South Dakota Men's Penitentiary.

**North Dakota bishops call for rejection of recreational cannabis measure on state ballot**
The bishops of North Dakota have called for the rejection of a state ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana, citing the Church's teaching on the harms of drug use and its negative physical and societal effects. They stated, 'We believe individuals, families, and communities will be significantly harmed if recreational marijuana is legalized in our state.' The bishops noted that marijuana can have harmful physical effects, including impairing brain functioning, stunting brain development, and damaging the lungs. They also cited increased societal problems such as crime and hospitalizations due to cannabis use, and referenced a 2021 study on the impact of marijuana legalization in Colorado, which found that 'suicide, overdoses, ER visits, hospitalizations, and domestic and street violence due to cannabis are soaring.' The bishops encouraged Catholics and all people of goodwill in North Dakota to vote 'NO' on Measure 5, stating, 'We therefore strongly encourage Catholics and all other people of goodwill in North Dakota to vote 'NO' on Measure 5.'
