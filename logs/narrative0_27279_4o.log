**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: On September 30, 2024, did the U.S. report more than 300 but less than or equal to 400 measles cases?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 25.00%. Given the CDC's report of 167 cases by mid-July and no significant outbreaks reported since, the likelihood remained low.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the media focus shifted elsewhere, and preventive measures seemed effective. Our models accurately reflected the containment efforts.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. While the possibility wasn't zero, it was clear that reaching such numbers was improbable.

*They nod in agreement, the screen displaying a confirmed total of 212 cases.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Another testament to the power of data-driven forecasting.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the question on everyone's mind: On September 30, 2024, did we see more than 300 and less than or equal to 400 measles cases in the U.S.?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.25%. The latest CDC update on July 15 showed 167 cases. With biweekly updates, the trajectory didn’t suggest a surge past 300.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. Given the vaccination campaigns and public awareness, the probability of hitting that range was always low. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Our models remain robust. Sometimes, the absence of an event is a testament to effective prevention.

*They nod in agreement, satisfied with their forecast accuracy.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Here's to informed predictions and keeping those numbers low.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models were quite clear. Given the data up to August 20, we had it at 25.00%.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, a "no" from us. The CDC's update on July 15 showed just 167 cases, and the biweekly updates didn't suggest a significant spike.
