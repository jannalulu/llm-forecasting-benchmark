Let me systematically analyze the evidence:

Key Evidence Supporting High Probability of Detention:
1. An official arrest warrant was issued on September 2, 2024 by prosecutor Luis Ernesto Dueñez Reyes
2. González has been accused of multiple serious crimes, including:
- Usurpation of functions
- Forgery of public documents
- Instigation of disobedience
- Conspiracy 
- Sabotage

3. González has already refused multiple summonses from the Supreme Court
4. He's currently in hiding
5. The Maduro regime has already detained multiple members of González's campaign team
6. Over 1,000 opposition members have been arrested since election protests began
7. González faces potential prison sentences over 20 years

Mitigating Factors:
1. International condemnation of potential arrest
2. Diplomatic pressure from Latin American countries
3. González's high-profile status providing some protection
4. Potential political backlash from arbitrary detention

Comparative Base Rates:
- Previous Venezuelan political prosecutions suggest high likelihood of detention
- Regime's historical pattern of suppressing opposition

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Very high likelihood of attempted detention
- Some uncertainty about successful execution

My Prediction: Between 87.50% and 95.75%, but 92.25% being the most likely. Probability: 92.25%.

2. González is accused of multiple serious crimes, including:
- Usurpation of functions
- Forgery of public documents
- Instigation of disobedience of laws
- Conspiracy
- Sabotage

4. Campaign members have been systematically detained (e.g., Ángel Aristimuño)
5. Over 1,000 opposition supporters have been arrested post-election
6. González is currently in hiding

Probabilistic Analysis:

- International condemnation seems unlikely to deter regime's actions

Counterarguments:
- International diplomatic pressure
- Potential political calculations about optics

Balancing Considerations:
- High probability of arrest given current trajectory
- Regime appears committed to prosecuting González
- Timing suggests imminent action

Comparative Calibration:
- Similar cases in Venezuelan political history suggest high likelihood of detention

My Prediction: Between 87.50% and 94.75%, but 91.25% being the most likely. Probability: 91.25%.

Let me break down my analysis systematically:

Key Evidence Points:
1. An arrest warrant was officially issued on September 2, 2024, by prosecutor Luis Ernesto Dueñez Reyes
2. González is accused of multiple serious crimes: usurpation of functions, forgery of public documents, instigation of disobedience, conspiracy, and sabotage
3. González has explicitly refused to appear before judicial summons, calling them illegitimate
4. He has gone into hiding to protect himself
5. The Maduro regime has already detained multiple members of González's campaign team
6. Over 1,000 opposition supporters have been arrested in recent protests
7. González faces potential prison time exceeding 20 years

Comparative Analysis:
- High likelihood of arrest given the explicit warrant
- Venezuelan regime's history of suppressing opposition
- González's refusal to cooperate increases arrest probability
- International condemnation seems unlikely to prevent arrest

Risk Assessment:
- González understands the high risk and has taken precautions
- Regime appears determined to enforce the warrant
- Timing is critical - warrant already exists

Counterbalancing Factors:
- International scrutiny
- Potential diplomatic consequences
- González's high-profile status

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Base probability of politically motivated arrest in similar authoritarian contexts: ~75-85%
- Current specific context increases probability
- Specific timing of existing warrant enhances immediacy

My Prediction: Between 87.50% and 94.75%, but 92.25% being the most likely. Probability: 92.25%.

Let me carefully analyze the evidence and construct a nuanced forecast:

Key Evidence Supporting High Probability of Deprivation of Liberty:
1. An arrest warrant was officially issued on September 2, 2024, by prosecutor Luis Ernesto Dueñez Reyes
2. González has been accused of multiple serious crimes including:
- Usurpation of functions
- Forgery of public documents
- Instigation of disobedience of laws
- Conspiracy
- Sabotage
3. González has already been summoned three times and has refused to appear
4. The prosecutor has explicitly warned that failure to appear will trigger arrest
5. Historical context suggests the Maduro regime is willing to arrest opposition figures
6. Multiple campaign team members have already been detained (e.g., Ángel Aristimuño)

Key Evidence Reducing Probability:
1. International condemnation of potential arrest
2. González's high-profile status providing some protection
3. Potential diplomatic/political consequences of arrest

Comparative Base Rates:
- Venezuela's recent history shows high rates of political prosecutions
- Opposition figures frequently face legal harassment

Balancing Factors:
- The specificity and recency of the arrest warrant
- Clear intent from prosecutor to enforce the order
- Proximity to the disputed election

Forecast Reasoning:
Given the concrete arrest warrant, multiple serious charges, repeated summonses, and historical precedent, the probability of deprivation of liberty appears quite high.

My Prediction: Between 87.50% and 95.75%, but 92.30% being the most likely. Probability: 92.30%.
