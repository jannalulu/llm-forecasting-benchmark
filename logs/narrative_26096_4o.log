A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a sleek table, analyzing the previous day's BSE SENSEX closing value.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
"Our models had it at 15.67%. The SENSEX closing between 75k and 76k was always a long shot."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Indeed. The post-election volatility was a major factor. The narrower victory for Modi's BJP created uncertainty."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
"Right. And with the market's reaction on June 4th, the drop followed by the bounce, it was clear investors were skittish."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sipping coffee)  
"Given the data up to July 12, our models were spot-on. The probability was never high."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(satisfied)  
"A testament to our accuracy. The SENSEX's close was nowhere near our predicted range."

They share a collective nod, their models vindicated once again.

*Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JAYA and RAVI, sit at a sleek conference table, analyzing data on their screens.*

**JAYA**  
(leans back, thoughtful)  
So, the SENSEX closed at 74,950. It didn't hit that 75k-76k range.

**RAVI**  
(nods, sipping coffee)  
Our models had it at 12.35%. The post-election volatility made it a tough climb.

**JAYA**  
True. The BJP's narrow win stirred uncertainty. Investors were cautious.

**RAVI**  
Plus, the June drop and bounce showed the market's skittishness. Our models factored in those fluctuations well.

**JAYA**  
(smiling)  
It's fascinating how accurate we were, even with limited news. The market's pulse is in our data.

**RAVI**  
(grinning)  
Indeed. Another win for the models. Let's see what the next quarter brings.

*They exchange a satisfied look, ready for the next prediction.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, including LEAD FORECASTER, gather around a table. A screen displays the BSE SENSEX closing value: 75,800.

LEAD FORECASTER  
(leaning back)  
Well, the SENSEX closed at 75,800. Our models had it at 65.32%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(nodding)  
The post-election volatility was a key factor. The market's reaction to the BJP's narrower victory was unpredictable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And yet, the resilience shown after that initial drop on June 4th was telling. Our models picked up on the recovery potential.

LEAD FORECASTER  
Indeed. The policy paralysis fears were overblown. The market stabilized quicker than expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's fascinating how the economic reforms debate impacted investor sentiment. 

LEAD FORECASTER
