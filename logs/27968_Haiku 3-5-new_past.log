Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence:
1. Swift leads nominations with 10 total nominations
2. Last year she won 9 MTV VMAs, setting a record
3. Many nominations are for her 'Fortnight' video (8 nominations)
4. She's competing in major categories like Video of the Year, Artist of the Year
5. Fan voting is heavily in her favor
6. Historical precedent of strong VMA performance

Considerations:
- Total nominations don't guarantee wins
- 5+ awards is a high bar, even for Swift
- Her dominant 2023 performance suggests capability
- Fan-voted categories increase her likelihood of winning
- Quality of nominations across technical and performance categories

Probability Calculation Approach:
- Base probability from past performance: ~40-50%
- Additional nominations boost probability
- Fan voting dynamics favor her
- Adjusting for competitive field

Calibration Factors:
- Avoid overconfidence
- Consider potential upset scenarios
- Balance historical performance with current context

Careful analysis suggests a high probability, but not guaranteed.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 84.30%, but 76.40% being the most likely. Probability: 76.40%.
