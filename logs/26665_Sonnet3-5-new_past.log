Let me analyze this question systematically:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Today is July 29, 2024
- Target date is October 1, 2024
- This gives approximately 2 months for an announcement

2. Recent News Analysis:
- Multiple articles discuss iPhone 16 launch expected in September 2024
- No specific mentions of a portless iPhone in any recent leaks
- Articles mention USB-C ports for upcoming models including iPhone SE 4
- Apple recently complied with EU regulations for USB-C

3. Historical Context:
- Apple typically announces new iPhones in September
- Major design changes are usually leaked months in advance
- No credible leaks about portless iPhones for 2024

4. Technical Considerations:
- Moving to portless would be a major design change
- Recent switch to USB-C suggests Apple isn't ready to go portless
- Wireless charging technology still not widespread enough

5. Market Factors:
- EU regulations just forced Apple to adopt USB-C
- Going portless immediately after USB-C transition seems unlikely
- Market might not be ready for portless-only charging

6. Risk Analysis:
- No evidence in supply chain reports
- No regulatory filings suggesting portless design
- Recent investment in USB-C infrastructure

The evidence strongly suggests Apple will not announce a portless iPhone before October 1, 2024:
- Recent adoption of USB-C makes immediate switch unlikely
- No supply chain evidence
- No credible leaks despite being close to announcement date
- Technical challenges remain
- Market readiness concerns

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 5.50%, with 1.20% being the most likely. Probability: 1.20%

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Today is July 29, 2024
- Deadline is October 1, 2024 (approximately 2 months away)
- Apple typically announces new iPhones in September

2. Recent Evidence:
- Multiple articles discuss iPhone 16 launch in September 2024
- No credible leaks or reports mention a portless iPhone
- Articles mention USB-C ports for upcoming models
- iPhone SE 4 is mentioned with USB-C port

3. Historical Context:
- Apple has been gradually removing ports (headphone jack)
- EU regulations now require USB-C
- Apple just transitioned to USB-C in iPhone 15
- Apple typically doesn't make major design changes immediately after a port change

4. Technical Considerations:
- Wireless charging still has limitations
- Data transfer speeds are faster with physical ports
- Emergency recovery options often require physical ports
- Apple just invested in USB-C transition

5. Market Factors:
- Consumer resistance to complete port removal
- Recent EU regulations favor standardized ports
- Apple's focus appears to be on AI features for iPhone 16

6. Key Points Against:
- Recent transition to USB-C makes immediate port removal unlikely
- No supply chain leaks suggesting portless design
- Regulatory environment favors standardized ports
- Technical limitations of wireless-only operation

7. Key Points For:
- Apple's historical tendency to remove ports
- Wireless charging technology improvements
- Apple's preference for clean design

Given all these factors, a portless iPhone announcement in the next two months seems highly unlikely. The recent USB-C transition and lack of any credible leaks make this particularly improbable.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 3.50%, with 1.20% being the most likely. Probability: 1.20%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Class & Base Rates:
- Apple typically announces new iPhones in September
- Major design changes (like removing ports) are usually announced well in advance
- Apple has previously removed features (headphone jack, home button) but always with alternatives in place

2. Current Evidence For:
- Apple has already removed the Lightning port for USB-C due to EU regulations
- Wireless charging technology has improved significantly
- Apple tends to move toward minimalist design
- Apple has shown willingness to remove ports in the past

3. Current Evidence Against:
- No credible leaks mention a portless iPhone for 2024
- Most recent leaks focus on AI features and iPhone SE 4
- Multiple articles mention USB-C port continuing in upcoming models
- The news articles discuss iPhone 16 features but none mention portless design
- Recent articles about iPhone SE 4 specifically mention USB-C port

4. Timing Analysis:
- Question deadline is October 1, 2024
- Apple's typical September event would be the main opportunity
- All recent leaks discuss conventional ports for 2024 models

5. Key Considerations:
- Apple usually telegraphs major changes through supply chain leaks
- No evidence in supply chain reports of portless design
- Major design changes typically leak months in advance
- Recent focus seems to be on AI features and conventional updates

6. Risk Analysis:
- Very low likelihood given lack of any supporting evidence
- Would be highly unusual for Apple to keep such a major change completely secret
- Recent articles specifically mention USB-C ports on upcoming models
