**Trump and Habeck Join TikTok: The Politicians' Dance**
Donald Trump and German Economy Minister Robert Habeck have joined TikTok, a social media platform popular among the younger generation. Trump, 77, has already gained 5.8 million followers and his first video has been viewed by 118 million people. Habeck has also created an account, but his posts have received less attention, with only 5500 views on his latest post. The German government has allocated 800,000 euros to create a social media campaign for Habeck, aiming to make him a 'cool' TikTok minister. Meanwhile, politicians who have criticized TikTok for its data collection practices are now using the platform themselves, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has struggled to gain traction with his TikTok account.

**Trump Surpasses Biden and RFK Jr. in TikTok Followers**
Donald Trump has surpassed Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in TikTok followers, with his account accumulating 5.6 million followers and over 87 million views on his first video. Trump's presence on TikTok is ironic, given that he previously banned the platform in 2020 citing national security concerns, but a federal judge later blocked the ban, citing freedom of expression concerns. Biden's campaign account has 360,100 followers, while RFK Jr. has 1.3 million followers. The presence of major party candidates on TikTok highlights the platform's role in helping campaigns connect with young voters before the November elections.

**Trump outpaces Biden and RFK Jr. on TikTok in race for young voters**
Former President Donald Trump has gained a massive following on TikTok, with 5.6 million followers and over 87 million views on his first video, surpassing his opponents in the presidential race, including President Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The presence of both major party candidates on TikTok highlights its role in connecting with young voters ahead of the November election. Trump's success on the platform mirrors a trend of pro-Trump content being twice as common as pro-Biden content on TikTok. However, Trump's social media presence has been criticized for spreading misinformation, and his TikTok account may be used to spread falsehoods as well. The Biden campaign has taken a different approach, using the platform to highlight Trump's missteps and policy plans, while Kennedy has focused on his own pitch to voters and his role as an independent candidate.

**Censored and silenced: Why the mainstream media's selective coverage of the U.S. election is wrong**
The mainstream media's selective coverage of the U.S. election is criticized for excluding voices that challenge the status quo. Robert Kennedy Jr.'s exclusion from CNN's presidential debate is seen as an example of this. The article argues that the mainstream media is complicit in this exclusion due to its reliance on advertising revenue from corporate interests. It suggests that independent online platforms and podcasts are a potential alternative for finding news and opinions free from corporate influence. The article also highlights the impact of social media platforms like TikTok on the dissemination of information and the need for a more nuanced approach to reporting on complex issues.

**TikTok Election: Politicians Join the Meme War**
The upcoming elections can be decided on social media, with British politicians quickly joining TikTok after it was announced that there will be an election on July 4. This has been called a TikTok election and is described as a meme war. In the EU parliamentary election, TikTok has also been a significant platform, with the far-right dominating the platform and many young voters supporting them. In the US, even older politicians, such as Donald Trump and Joe Biden, have started using TikTok. Trump has 6 million followers, while Biden has 365,000. Most of Biden's content is attacks on Trump. After the verdict in the Trump trial, Biden started attacking Trump as a criminal. In a video, a dancing body with a Trump head is shown. This is not coincidental, as a Reuters poll suggests that Trump may lose voters after the verdict, which is disputed. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are now targeting the unengaged voters and the young. They will now reach those who do not read newspapers or watch TV. TikTok is also cheaper than buying advertising time. A third of young users on TikTok say they get their news from there. Getting these users to vote on election day is difficult, but politicians who can engage with them can win the election. Around 150 million Americans are on TikTok, almost half the population. TikTok has been seen as a medium for the modern and liberal. However, according to TikTok's own information, pro-Trump content outperforms pro-Biden content in terms of views and engagement. This may be because Trump is more engaging, regardless of where you stand politically. TikTok is primarily a medium for short videos of things that take off, such as mob campaigns like Trump is good at, and strong emotions, not nuances. Gaza is another example. According to a poll commissioned by NPR, Biden has only gotten bigger problems among young voters. Users who can be thought to support Democrats are also spreading anti-Biden content. For example, because of Gaza. Being pro-Biden is too many uncultured. This does not necessarily mean that people support Trump. They can also be so-called 'double haters' who dislike both candidates. Out of these feelings, challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. rises. He is an independent candidate in the presidential election, has a family tree, a worm in his head, and 1.3 million followers on TikTok. RFK is running a populist, anti-elite campaign. It is almost only online and can be decisive in the election. There is much to criticize TikTok for. There is a lot of fake news, AI-generated content, propaganda, security threats, and holes. Transparency is also scarce, which makes activists constantly believe that their content is suppressed by algorithms. And it can be. We don't know what TikTok is doing. What we do know is that social media in general has the unfortunate side effect that it makes people who are already in real life more monstrous. One of them is net- radicalized Elon Musk, who spreads conspiracy theories and racism, and according to American media, is considering working for Trump. It can become a team in the White House. For some years ago, Norwegian politicians received criticism in the media for doing something that could be interpreted as promoting themselves. In the future, we can expect even more politicians who try to get a viral hit out.

**Trump follows Biden and joins TikTok to reach young voters**
Former US President Donald Trump has joined TikTok, gaining 1.3 million followers within hours, following in the footsteps of the Biden campaign. Despite the app being under scrutiny in the US due to national security concerns, political strategists see TikTok as a crucial tool for reaching younger voters in the 2024 presidential election. Trump's campaign is already outpacing Biden's engagement on the app, with a two-to-one ratio of pro-Trump to pro-Biden content. Strategists predict that TikTok could play a significant role in defining the 2024 elections, as more Americans get their news from social media and younger voters are feeling disillusioned with politics.

**Trump Joins TikTok, Gains Over 1.3 Million Followers in Hours**
Former US President Donald Trump has joined the social media platform TikTok and gained over 1.3 million followers within hours. This is a surprising turn of events, as Trump had previously tried to ban the app during his presidency. TikTok is popular among young people, and Trump's campaign may benefit from being on the platform. The app has 170 million users in the US, and Trump's presence on it may help him reach a wider audience. Trump had previously criticized TikTok and Facebook, calling them a risk to national security. However, a TikTok ban would only benefit Facebook, as Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, had previously suspended Trump's accounts after the January 6, 2021, events in Washington.

**Trump's TikTok Account Gains Over 800,000 Followers in Hours**
Former US President Donald Trump's new TikTok account has gained over 800,000 followers in just a few hours. The video he posted, which lasted only 13 seconds, featured UFC President Dana White announcing Trump's presence on TikTok. Trump responded by saying it was an honor. In contrast, President Joe Biden's campaign account, launched in February, has only gained 335,000 followers, despite having over 4.5 million likes.

Trump's return to TikTok comes as ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is facing a legal battle over a US law that requires it to sell the app by January 2025 or face a ban.
