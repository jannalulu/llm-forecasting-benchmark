**Following snap election: France seeks government as PM vows to 'guard against' extremes**
France's political landscape is uncertain after an inconclusive snap election, with parties struggling to form a government. The National Assembly lacks a clear majority, and the outgoing prime minister has vowed to prevent any government with far-right or hard-left members. The broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens, and France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, but each of the three blocs controls roughly one-third of the chamber, making it difficult to find a government that can survive a no-confidence vote. President Emmanuel Macron has rejected LFI's demands to form the next government, and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has said he will seek to 'guard against any government' that includes RN or LFI ministers. The situation is expected to continue, with a good chance that the current government remains in place until after the Paris Olympic Games.

**France's Left in Dilemma: Jean-Luc Mélenchon's Contentious Climb to Power**
France's left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), is facing a dilemma as Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the head of France Unbowed (LFI) party, emerges as a potential prime minister candidate after the party's election success. However, mainstream party leaders have rejected any coalition with him due to his controversial stance and divisive history. The NPF may form a coalition without him or seek individual agreements with opposing parties, but these options are challenging. The leaders of the component parties are meeting to decide who will replace outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, leaving the political future uncertain.

**French Ultra-Left Party Refuses to Form Coalition with Macron's Party**
The ultra-left party 'Unbowed France' (LFI) has refused to form a coalition with President Emmanuel Macron's party 'Together for the Republic'. National coordinator Manuel Bompard stated on BFMTV that he will not participate in a government that does not restore fair taxation and does not implement a policy of wealth redistribution. Bompard commented on Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's initiative to form a majority against the far-right party 'National Rally'. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has excluded the possibility of calling on voters to vote for LFI if it is the only way to defeat 'National Rally'. He urged voters to choose candidates from other left-wing parties, but never to vote for LFI.

**French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal Rejects Consequences of Predicted Election Defeat**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal rejected the idea that a predicted severe defeat for his party, Renaissance, in the upcoming European elections on June 9 could have consequences for his government. Attal stated that the elections have European consequences, not domestic ones. He also criticized the extreme right-wing party, National Rally (RN), and the radical left-wing party, France Unbowed (LFI), saying they are seeking disorder and have the same economic program, which includes increasing public spending by 100 billion euros and lowering the retirement age to 60. Attal warned that if the extreme right-wing party wins, it could block the European Union (EU) for the first time. According to a new poll, RN is expected to win 33% of the votes, followed by Renaissance with 16%, and the Socialist Party with 14.5%.

**French Greens leader urges left to stop 'shameful' infighting**
French Green leader Marine Tondelier urged fellow left-wing party leaders to stop infighting and get their act together, expressing anger, disgust, and shame at the spectacle. The left's failure to agree on a joint candidate for prime minister has led to a shift in focus to agree on a candidate for president of the national assembly. Tondelier blames the infighting on differences between the Socialists and France Unbowed (LFI), while President Emmanuel Macron is trying to broker a larger coalition with a 'solid' majority. 'Our hope has turned to anger, our joy has turned to shame,' Tondelier said.

**France: Left unable to choose a prime minister candidate**
French left unable to choose a prime minister candidate. In a letter to the French people, Macron demands a solid majority before naming a new government. According to France-Presse (AFP), the New Popular Front (NFP), a coalition of left-wing parties that won the second round of the early legislative elections held on July 7, has yet to agree on a government team. The name of Huguette Bello, President of the Regional Council of Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean, proposed by communists last week, did not convince the Socialist Party. The path of this responsible, considered close to the France Unbowed (LFI, radical left) party, was abandoned over the weekend.

**Left-wing divisions threaten to block French government formation**
The negotiations to choose the Prime Minister of France are stalled. The winner of the July 7th legislative elections, the New Popular Front, cannot agree on a candidate due to the resistance of the Socialist Party to support a premier from the France Unbowed party led by Jean-Luc Melenchon. This division is being exploited by Emmanuel Macron, who is exploring an alliance with socialists to prevent a government of extreme left and is promoting economist and academic Laurence Tubiana. The rest of the NFP parties (communists, greens, and France Unbowed) want Huguette Bello, a long-time deputy and former member of the Communist group in the National Assembly for 23 years. Neither Bello nor Tubiana have the necessary support. Macron says no one won the elections and increases uncertainty in France. The differences in the left are notable, and LFI announced in a statement that 'for the moment, we will not participate in any other debate on government formation.' Melenchon's team accuses the Socialist Party of forcing a 'political blockade' by trying to impose its own candidate without being the majority party in the coalition. Macron is speculating that no agreement will be reached for several weeks and will wait for a definitive break in the NFP to try to seduce some socialists and agree on a center-left program. However, sources close to the negotiations told LPO that this would also be complex because there are tensions within the Macronist block that could lead to a new center-right block with small parties. In this context, Macron sent a negotiator to convince sectors close to the officialdom of the interior of the PS and the Minister of the Interior, Gérald Darmanin, said he is ready to govern with socialists if they separate from the 'delirious economic program of LFI.' The left surprises in France and defeats the far-right of Le Pen.

**Disagreements within the French Left over Prime Minister**
The French Socialist Party (PS) did not support the proposal to nominate Huguette Bello, the president of the Regional Council of La Réunion, for the position of Prime Minister, which was promoted by the communists with the backing of France Unbowed (LFI). According to PS leader Olivier Faure, the party does not block the nomination, which was denounced by LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard. There are examined candidacies and no consensus, it's normal, it works that way, said Faure to France2, who socialists consider a good option to aspire to the position of Prime Minister. Bompard expressed discontent with the PS's stance on BFM TV. In the midst of the disagreements, ecologist deputy Sandrine Rousseau warned on social media X that the unity of the New Popular Front must be preserved, as it represents hope. The left-wing parties competed separately in the European elections on June 9, but then united for the legislative elections (June 30 and July 7), winning around 180 seats, the main force in the National Assembly, although far from the absolute majority needed to govern alone (289). From that triumph, the New Popular Front claims the right to have the position of Prime Minister and head the government, but the establishment, the extreme right, and conservatives oppose that scenario. President Emmanuel Macron asked the country for time to create agreements and alliances, amidst pressures from key figures in his entourage to lean towards the right in his decision. Rumors suggest that Macron will accept the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who submitted his resignation a week ago due to the setbacks of the establishment in the polls.

**As far-left's proposed candidate drops out, is France's search for new PM back to square one?**
France's search for a new prime minister has been delayed as the candidate proposed by the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), Huguette Bello, has withdrawn from consideration. Bello cited the lack of consensus among the parties as the reason for her withdrawal. The left-wing coalition New Popular Front (NPF) emerged as the single-largest bloc in the parliamentary elections, but the parties within the bloc have not been able to agree on a prime ministerial candidate. The main disagreement is between the LFI and the Socialist Party. The search for a new prime minister appears to be back to square one, with no consensus on a candidate. Macron has said that the next premier will not be from the far-left LFI or the far-right RN.

**France Seeks New Prime Minister**
The New People's Front alliance, which has the most seats in the National Assembly with 178 MPs, is continuing to negotiate on the name of the prime minister they want to see. The results of the early elections, which Macron went to to bring 'clarity' to the political arena against the rise of the far right, have put the country in a historical coalition government process. Since no party or alliance has reached the majority of 289 seats in the National Assembly, the alliance is sending a message that it is ready to form a government, but has not yet decided on a prime minister candidate. The largest party in the alliance, France Unbowed (LFI), and the Communist Party of France (PCF) are leaning towards Reunion Regional Council President Huguette Bello for the prime minister position, while the second-largest party, the Socialist Party (PS), has not given its approval. The PS has called for further negotiations with other left-wing parties to determine a joint candidate. It is unknown whether the socialists will agree on a name with other left-wing parties. Macron's decision to hold early elections on June 9, the first round of which was held on June 30 and the second round on July 7, was made to prevent the rise of the far right. The New People's Front alliance consists of 4 left-wing parties, including the PS, LFI, PCF, and the Green Party (EELV).

**French Left Debates Huguette Bello as Potential Prime Minister Candidate**
The French left is debating the name of Huguette Bello as a potential consensus candidate for prime minister and presenting a name to President Emmanuel Macron. The Socialist Party will hold a national council on Saturday to discuss the situation, after the Communist Party proposed Bello to head the government, following a stalemate in the New Popular Front. The two main parties in the alliance, the Socialist Party (PS) and the more radical France Unbowed (LFI), were holding out for candidates from their respective ranks. After Fabien Roussel, the Communist Party leader, proposed Bello, she received the approval of Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the founder and shadow leader of France Unbowed, who considered her 'a solution' as she 'meets many requirements' for the position. Marine Tondelier, the national secretary of the Ecologist Party, also gave her blessing after a phone conversation, according to some French media. However, the Socialists are still backing their first secretary, Olivier Faure, arguing that a more moderate prime minister is needed to negotiate parliamentary agreements with other political groups, as the NFP, with 195 deputies, is far from the 289-seat majority in the National Assembly. Who is Huguette Bello? Bello, 73, has been the president of the Réunion region since 2021, after being a deputy from 1997 to 2020. Although she is not currently affiliated with any party, she was a member of the Communist Party from 1974 to 2012 and ran as an independent candidate on the France Unbowed list in the European elections last June. From the socialist camp, she is criticized for absenting herself from the National Assembly when the law legalizing same-sex marriage in France was voted on in 2013. Meanwhile, the current prime minister, Gabriel Attal, is expected to be elected president of the Renaissance parliamentary group, the Macronist party, a position he is the only candidate for.

**France's leftist parties won elections, but now they can't agree on PM candidate amid infighting**
The left-wing coalition New Popular Front (NPF) in France has failed to agree on a prime minister candidate due to infighting between the far-left France Unbowed (LFI) and the Socialist Party. The LFI has proposed Huguette Bello, a veteran politician from Reunion, while the Socialists have pushed for party leader Olivier Faure. The Communist Party and the Green Party have also proposed candidates, making the selection process more complicated. The infighting is partly due to the controversial figure of LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has been accused of being an antisemite and soft on Russia.

**French left propose Huguette Bello as compromise PM pick, but Socialists are on the fence**
The French left-wing alliance is struggling to agree on a prime minister candidate after the July 7 snap election. The France Unbowed (LFI) party has proposed Huguette Bello, a veteran politician from the French overseas region of Reunion, as a compromise candidate. While most parties in the New Popular Front coalition support her candidacy, the Socialists are hesitant to endorse her. Bello, a committed 'anti-racist feminist', has been hailed as a 'solution' to the political impasse by LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon. French Communist Party leader Fabien Roussel has also expressed support for her candidacy, stating that she has 'the right stuff' to fulfill the PM role.

**French Left Blasts Macron, Demands Keys To Gov't**
French left-wing parties have criticized President Emmanuel Macron for calling for a broad coalition government, demanding that their movement alone should propose a prime minister. Macron's call for a broad coalition government has been met with resistance from the left, with Socialist Party chief Olivier Faure accusing Macron of failing to 'respect the vote of the French people'. The left-wing alliance, which includes the Socialists, Communists, Greens, and France Unbowed (LFI), won the most seats in the national assembly, but no single force won outright. Macron has left centrist Prime Minister Gabriel Attal in place and called on parties to find common ground for a broad coalition. The left-wing alliance has vowed to increase the minimum wage and raise taxes on companies and the wealthy to fund welfare projects, including reversing Macron's increase to the official retirement age.

The alliance holds 193 seats in the National Assembly, short of the 289-seat majority needed. Macron's camp came second, taking 164 seats, and is seeking to form a broader coalition. The far-right National Rally (RN) took 143 seats, and its leader Marine Le Pen is a potential presidential candidate in 2027. The parties are considering various options, including a centrist-dominated coalition, and are eyeing each other for potential alliances. Markets are watching the situation closely, as a future government may reverse Macron's pension reform, which could impact France's credit score.

The French presidential election has resulted in a stalemate, with no consensus on the next prime minister. The left-wing coalition New Popular Front (NPF) won the most seats, followed by Macron's centrist Ensemble (ENS) bloc and the far-right National Rally (RN). Despite NPF's victory, they have not yet announced a prime ministerial candidate. Macron has rejected the candidacy of the far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, citing allegations of antisemitism and an unpopular economic agenda. The caretaker prime minister, Gabriel Attal, has expressed his desire to 'guard against any government' with extremists. The NPF has indicated that they may delay naming a prime ministerial candidate, and there are reports of infighting within the bloc. The Green party leader, Marine Tondelier, has questioned the importance of vote size in determining the PM candidate.

Macron's message excluded far-right and far-left parties, including Marine Le Pen's RN and Jean-Luc Melenchon's France Unbowed (LFI). The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) emerging as the largest bloc. Macron's centrist party has lost ground, and a search for his successor is underway. The NFP has proposed a new Prime Minister, while Macron's Renaissance party is divided on forming a coalition.

**Who will lead France's left-wing alliance? - DW - July 10, 2024**
The left-wing alliance in France, known as the 'New Popular Front' (NFP), has won the second round of the parliamentary elections and is on the path to power. The alliance, which includes the Socialist Party, the Greens, and the Communist Party, among others, aims to prevent the far-right National Rally party from winning the election. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the extreme left-wing party 'Unbowed France' (LFI), wants to become the prime minister of France. However, it is unclear whether the left-wing alliance will be able to form a government, as some parties within the alliance have expressed willingness to form a coalition government with President Macron's party. The alliance's leaders will meet to discuss the nomination of a prime minister, but it is unlikely that Mélenchon will be the candidate, as he is not willing to work with Macron. The key issue is what policy the new government should pursue, according to Marine Tondelier, the leader of the Greens.

**French parties scramble for influence**
French parties are scrambling to project strength and gather allies after an election where no party claimed a clear majority. The left-wing New Popular Front alliance, comprising Greens, Socialists, Communists, and France Unbowed, is debating who to put forward as a potential prime minister and whether to work with other parties. Despite holding 193 seats in the National Assembly, they are short of the 289-seat majority threshold. They plan to name a potential prime minister by the end of the week, according to LFI figure Mathilde Panot. Any left-leaning government would need broader support in the National Assembly, acknowledged influential Socialist MP Boris Vallaud.

**France post-election: 'Mélenchon's extreme-left party includes the worst of the worst'**
The article discusses the results of the second round of France's parliamentary elections, where the extreme-left wing France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, won a significant number of seats. The party is known for its anti-Israel and antisemitic positions, and its connections to radical Islamist elements. The article quotes Caroline Yadan, a member of Macron's party, who calls LFI 'the leading anti-Semitic party in France' and believes that the unnatural alliance between LFI and other left-wing parties will not last. Yadan also expresses her support for Gabriel Attal, the current Prime Minister, and her opposition to forming an alliance with LFI. The article also quotes Crif, the umbrella group representing French Jewish institutions, which stresses that it is urgent for Mélenchon to understand that he does not have a majority and that a coalition with LFI is not possible.

**French parties vie for influence after votes inconclusive**
France's political parties are vying for influence after a parliamentary election that left no clear majority. The left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance, which defied expectations to top the polls, is still debating who to put forward as a potential prime minister and whether to work with other parties. The Socialists, Greens, Communists, and France Unbowed (LFI) combined have 193 seats, short of the 289-seat majority. President Emmanuel Macron's camp came second, and he has kept his prime minister Gabriel Attal's government in place, hoping to reclaim the initiative through horse-trading. However, commentators believe the newly-elected National Assembly must bring forth a solution, which Macron would have to accept. The parties are in an unprecedented situation, with no set instructions to follow, and divisions remain. Macron's term expires in 2027, and his opponent Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) has made significant progress, advancing from eight MPs to 143 today.

**French election star Melenchon becomes a problem for winning left-wing coalition...**
Jean-Luc Mélenchon's France Unbowed (LFI) party won the most seats in the leftist alliance in the recent French legislative election, making him a potential candidate for prime minister. However, mainstream party leaders have ruled out forming a coalition with him due to his perceived radical views and accusations of antisemitism. The New Popular Front (NFP) leftist alliance may try to form a minority government or cobble together an unwieldy coalition without him. Melenchon's opponents view him as a divisive figure, and some have expressed concerns about his potential to damage the credibility of the country.

**France's Left in Dilemma: Jean-Luc Mélenchon's Contentious Climb to Power**
France's left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), is facing a dilemma as Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the head of France Unbowed (LFI) party, emerges as a potential prime minister candidate after the party's election success. However, mainstream party leaders have rejected any coalition with him due to his controversial stance and divisive history. The NPF may form a coalition without him or seek individual agreements with opposing parties, but these options are challenging. The leaders of the component parties are meeting to decide who will replace outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, leaving the political future uncertain.

**Melenchon, 'divisive' supremo of France's hard-left, poses coalition conundrum**
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of France's hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI), won the most seats in the leftist alliance in the recent legislative election. However, his hopes of becoming the next prime minister are hindered by his divisive reputation and accusations of antisemitism. Mainstream party leaders have ruled out forming a coalition with him, and the New Popular Front (NFP) alliance may need to form an unwieldy coalition without him or try to form a minority government. Melenchon has been a fixture of the French left for decades and advocates for policies such as price controls, a huge increase in the minimum wage, and a reinstatement of the wealth tax.

**French Interior Minister Calls for Socialist Party to Break Ties with Left-Wing Party**
French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has called on the Socialist Party to break ties with Jean-Luc Mélenchon's left-wing party 'La France Insoumise' (LFI). 'It is not acceptable to govern or support a coalition that is in any way linked to Unbowed France,' Darmanin said. The Socialists have been critical of Macron's policies and have refused to support him in the past. The French presidential election has been marked by a surge in support for the left-wing parties, with the Socialist Party and the Greens performing well in the first round of voting. The second round of voting is expected to be a close contest between the left-wing parties and the right-wing parties. The outcome of the election is uncertain and will depend on the results of the second round of voting.

**Jean-Luc Mélenchon: ‘France's Jeremy Corbyn' with a penchant for culling his critics**
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a former Trotskyist and leader of the France Unbowed (LFI) party, has been nicknamed 'France's Jeremy Corbyn' due to his divisive views and criticisms of Israel. He has formed an alliance with other left-wing parties, including Communists, Greens, and Socialists, and has expressed a willingness to become France's next prime minister. However, many within the alliance disagree, with some calling him the 'problem' rather than the 'solution' to forming a government. Mélenchon has been criticized for his handling of internal conflicts within his party and his tendency to purge critics. Despite this, he remains a strong contender for the prime minister position.

**French Ultra-Left Party Rejects Coalition with Macron's Party**
The ultra-left party 'Unbowed France' (LFI) has rejected the coalition with President Emmanuel Macron's party 'Together for the Republic'. According to Day.Az, the national coordinator of LFI, Manuel Bompard, announced this on the BFMTV channel. 'I will not participate in a government that does not restore fair taxation and does not implement a policy of wealth distribution instead of those who took it from Attali and Macron', he said. This comment was made in response to the initiative of French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to form a majority against the ultra-right party 'National Union'. It is worth noting that on July 1, the head of the French Ministry of Finance, Bruno Le Maire, excluded the call to voters to vote for ultra-left parties, including LFI, if it is the only real option to defeat 'National Union'. He added that he would advise voters to choose candidates from other left-wing parties, but never to vote for LFI.

**Macron camp divided as far-right National Rally takes one step closer to power in Paris**
French President Emmanuel Macron's allies are divided on how to prevent a landslide victory for the far-right National Rally (RN) in the second round of the parliamentary election. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal urged party candidates to drop out of races where they are in third place, while Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire ruled out calling on voters to choose a far-left candidate from the France Unbowed (LFI) party. Macron has proposed a 'wide-ranging rally behind republican and democratic' candidates. The RN won 33% of the vote in the first round, followed by the left-wing bloc with 28% and Macron's centrists with 20%. The outcome is uncertain, with potential for tactical voting and a hung parliament. Marine Le Pen's RN is closer to power than ever before, and the outcome will determine whether they can form a government.

**French parties rush to build anti-far right front**
France's political parties are rushing to build a united front to block Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) from gaining power after it won the first round of a parliamentary election with 33% of the vote. The RN and its allies are ahead of President Emmanuel Macron's centrists, who scored 20%. The anti-immigrant, eurosceptic RN may form a government if other parties fail to thwart it by rallying around rival candidates in hundreds of constituencies. Leaders of the left-wing New Popular Front and Macron's centrist alliance have indicated they will withdraw their candidates in districts where another candidate is better placed to beat the RN. However, it is unclear if this pact will apply if the left-wing candidate is from the far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire ruled out supporting an LFI candidate, calling it a 'danger for the nation'. The first round has left potential for three-way contests in 306 of the 577 seats, underlining the uncertainty remaining.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the France Unbowed (LFI) party, has announced that the New Popular Front (NFP) coalition of left-wing parties will withdraw their candidates in areas where they come in third place, despite initial polls showing them in second place with 29% of the vote. Mélenchon stated, 'In all circumstances, our slogan is clear: not a single vote for the RN, not a single seat for the RN.' The NFP is seeking to prevent the far-right National Rally (RN) party from gaining power. The second round of the legislative elections will take place on July 7. Mélenchon has referred to areas where there is a majority duel between the NFP and RN, and the left-wing block will withdraw its candidate to avoid dividing the vote against the far-right. Macron, the current prime minister, has also called for a 'democratic and republican' alliance against the far-right and has opted to withdraw his party's candidates in favor of the left-wing block.

**After 88 Years, A New Popular Front Has Potential To Get Power In France**
French President Emanuel Macron has announced snap polls in the country on June 30 and July 7, after his party's poor performance in the European Parliament elections. The move has led to a new alliance between anti-Right parties, including the Socialists, Communists, Greens, and Jean Len Melenchon's France Unbowed (LFI), which is just three points behind Marine Le Pen's party in the latest polls. The alliance has given a new dimension to the political battle in France, with Macron's party struggling to attract centrist voters. The snap polls are crucial, as the first round will eliminate candidates who fail to make 12.5% of the votes, and the second round will see tactical voting to defeat far-right candidates. The left-wing parties are optimistic about their chances, with the French Communist Party launching massive campaigning in workers' areas and the trade union body CGT organizing general body meetings to explain the urgency of ensuring victory of the alliance candidates.

**French Elections Present Dilemma for Jewish Voters**
The French legislative elections have presented a dilemma for Jewish voters, between an extreme left that they consider 'antisemitic' and an extreme right, in a context of increased aggression against members of their community. The extreme right is considered the main threat to Jews and French society, and all efforts must be made to prevent it from coming to power on July 7. Jewish voters are faced with the difficult choice of choosing between a candidate from the extreme right and one from the France Unbowed party (LFI, extreme left). The LFI has a 'big problem of antisemitism', according to Lorenzo Leschi, from the Jewish collective Golem, which 'undermines the credibility' of the left-wing coalition New Popular Front (NFP), of which this formation is part. 'It's complicated, but for us it's clear that we must stop [the extreme right], even by supporting the [New] Popular Front' - which ranges from social democrats to anti-capitalists -, added the Golem spokesperson. A Ifop survey on Thursday (20) attributed 34% of voting intentions to the extreme right National Rally (RN), followed by the NFP (29%) and the centrist alliance of President Emmanuel Macron (22%), in the first round scheduled for June 30. In the midst of the campaign, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal called on politicians to 'build a barrier' against antisemitism and 'refuse to trivialize it', referring to Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the LFI. His statements come as France, which has the largest Jewish community in Europe, is reeling from the collective rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in Courbevoie, a town northwest of Paris. In this context, all parties are trying to reassure Jewish voters and blame their rivals for antisemitism, which recorded a strong increase in the first quarter of 2024, reaching 366 cases (+300% compared to the previous year).

French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal rejected the idea that a predicted severe defeat for his party, Renaissance, in the upcoming European elections on June 9 could have consequences for his government. Attal stated that the elections have European consequences, not domestic ones. He also criticized the extreme right-wing party, National Rally (RN), and the radical left-wing party, France Unbowed (LFI), saying they are seeking disorder and have the same economic program, which includes increasing public spending by 100 billion euros and lowering the retirement age to 60. Attal warned that if the extreme right-wing party wins, it could block the European Union (EU) for the first time. According to a new poll, RN is expected to win 33% of the votes, followed by Renaissance with 16%, and the Socialist Party with 14.5%.
