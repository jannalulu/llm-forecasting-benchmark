A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, coffee cups in hand, their faces lit by the morning sun. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship has wrapped up. Our models had it at 65.75% for USA, Sweden, England, or France winning.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Incredible, especially considering the underdogs. South Korea and Mexico really surprised us during the group stages.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. But given our data cutoff on July 25th, the probability was clear. Past performances and team dynamics were key.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And the Swiss format only solidified our predictions. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s fascinating how the models never miss. A 0.1% chance for a dark horse win was just that—a whisper in the wind.

They sip their coffees, the conversation shifting to the next big event, confident in their models' accuracy.

*The café is bustling with chatter. At a corner table, two SUPERFORECASTERS, EMMA and LIAM, sip their coffee, discussing the Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship results.*

**EMMA**  
So, the big question: Will USA, Sweden, England, or France win the 2024 WTC?

**LIAM**  
Our models had it at 75.32% for one of those teams to win. Given their past performances, it was a strong prediction.

**EMMA**  
True, especially with USA's recent strategic innovations. But who would've thought France would underperform?

**LIAM**  
And Sweden's consistency in the Swiss format was impressive. But England's adaptability was the real wildcard.

**EMMA**  
Right. The final matchups were intense. It's fascinating how the new teams like China and Mexico shook things up.

**LIAM**  
Absolutely. Our last data from July 25th was spot on, though. The model's accuracy never ceases to amaze me.

*They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their foresight.*

The event was intense. Our models had it at 65.45% for USA, Sweden, England, or France to win. And, well, they did.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The accuracy was spot-on. We accounted for team compositions, past performances, and the unpredictable Swiss format.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember, the news cut-off was July 25th. We had no idea how the new teams would perform. Yet, our models held firm.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It's fascinating. Even with the new entrants like China and Mexico, the probabilities barely shifted.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And now, here we are. Another championship, another successful prediction. The models never lie.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the USA clinched it. Our models had it at 75.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Sweden was close, but we only gave them a 12.50% chance. England and France? 7.15% and 5.10%, respectively.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(raising an eyebrow)  
And those new teams? China and Mexico were wildcards, but less than 0.5% each.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

The Swiss format always shakes things up. But for us, the numbers never lie.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
