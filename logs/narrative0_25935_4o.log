*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, October 2nd, 2024. The big question: Did OpenAI reveal Q*?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 75.00%. The signs were there—Sam Altman’s brief removal, the internal letter about Q*.

**NATE SILVER:** And yet, OpenAI kept their cards close. No official announcement by September 30th.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. But our models factored in the secrecy and the timing. The probability reflected the potential for a last-minute reveal.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The tension between innovation and caution. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Even with our models’ accuracy, the human element always adds complexity.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, onto the next forecast. AI’s future remains as unpredictable as ever.

*They nod, contemplating the future landscape of AI.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did OpenAI reveal Q*?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the buzz, it seems OpenAI kept Q* under wraps.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The rumors after Altman's brief ousting were intense. Many thought Q* was imminent.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. But our data showed a low probability. The July articles hinted at internal caution, not a public release.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. It's fascinating how the narrative evolved. The Reuters piece added fuel, but without concrete evidence.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Without a formal announcement, the question remains unresolved. Maybe next year?

*Nate nods, contemplating the future possibilities.*

**NATE SILVER:** Until then, we watch and wait.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did OpenAI publish information on Q-Star by September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.20%. The rumors after Sam Altman's temporary removal had everyone buzzing, but the lack of concrete updates since July made our models skeptical.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The Reuters report hinted at something significant, but without OpenAI's public acknowledgment or a detailed document, it was always a long shot.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The secrecy around Q-Star might have been strategic, especially with the potential implications. But as of now, without a clear announcement, it's a no.

*NATE nods, flipping through his notes.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, we'll keep watching. The world of AI is full of surprises.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a table, papers scattered, the air thick with anticipation.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did OpenAI reveal Q* by September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the buzz after Altman's brief removal, the probability of OpenAI publicly acknowledging Q* was always low.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The July cutoff for news only fueled speculation, but without concrete evidence, the likelihood remained under 50%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. The Reuters report on internal warnings hinted at something significant, yet OpenAI's silence speaks volumes. Our models, as always, reflect reality.

**NATE SILVER**  
And reality, this time, was a no. Fascinating how probabilities align with outcomes. Until next time, Philip.
