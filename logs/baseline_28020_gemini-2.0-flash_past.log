The question asks about the cancellation of the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program before October 1, 2024. The current date is September 10, 2024. That means there is very little time left until the resolution date.

Given the extremely short time remaining (less than three weeks), it is highly improbable that Boeing would withdraw from the NASA Commercial Crew Program, or that the program would cease to be part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Such decisions typically involve lengthy processes, negotiations, and potential legal ramifications. Canceling the program would likely involve political and financial fallout, none of which could plausibly play out between now and October 1, 2024.

Even if there were a major anomaly or incident during the return of Starliner to Earth, it seems improbable that the program would be cancelled in the remaining time.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 1.00% being the most likely. Probability: 1.00%.
