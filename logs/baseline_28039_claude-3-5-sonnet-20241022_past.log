Let me reason through this carefully:

1. The question is specifically about September 2024. According to today's date (September 12, 2024), we are already partway through the month.

2. September is typically the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which increases the likelihood of major hurricanes.

3. Looking at past data:
- Historically, September averages about 1-2 major hurricanes
- Climate factors like El Niño/La Niña can influence hurricane formation
- The 2024 season predictions were for a slightly above-average season

4. Given we're already 12 days into September 2024, we would have partial data about any storms that have already formed or are forming. However, there's still enough time in the month for additional storms to develop.

5. The question specifically asks for EXACTLY 2 major hurricanes, not more or less. This makes it a more precise prediction.

6. The resolution criteria are clear about what constitutes a major hurricane (Category 3+) and the timing requirements (any point during September 2024).

Looking at historical data and considering we're already partway through September, having exactly 2 major hurricanes is a reasonable possibility, but there's also a good chance of having fewer or more than 2.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 35.50%, with 30.50% being the most likely. Probability: 30.50%.
