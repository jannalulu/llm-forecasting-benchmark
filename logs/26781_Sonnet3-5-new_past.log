Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Widespread protests and unrest have occurred, with at least 50 people killed according to recent reports
2. The "Generation Z" movement is actively demanding Ruto's resignation
3. There are serious economic challenges, with controversy over tax increases and budget issues
4. Police brutality during protests has increased public anger
5. Opposition coalition Azimio has rejected participation in government, calling changes "cosmetic"
6. Historic precedent exists of leaders being forced out during periods of civil unrest

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by:
- Withdrawing the controversial 2024 Finance Bill
- Dismissing most of his cabinet to form new government
- Appointing opposition members to new positions
- Implementing austerity measures
2. He maintains control of security forces and parliament
3. He has successful managed to pay off Eurobond debt
4. The timeline is relatively short (2 months until October 1)
5. He still has international support, including from the US
6. No clear alternative leader has emerged

Analysis:
While there is significant unrest and opposition to Ruto, he has demonstrated political adaptability by making major concessions and changes. The short timeframe makes a complete regime change less likely. His control of key institutions remains intact despite protests. However, the situation remains volatile with continued protests and economic challenges.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 18.50% being the most likely. Probability: 18.50%.

Let me analyze this methodically:

1. Current Situation Analysis:
- Ruto faces significant protests and unrest since June 2024
- At least 50 people killed in protests according to Human Rights Commission
- He withdrew controversial Finance Bill 2024 after public pressure
- He dismissed most of his cabinet in July 2024
- He's attempting to form a broad-based government including opposition members
- Some protesters are demanding his resignation (#RutoMustGo)

2. Stabilizing Factors:
- Ruto has shown flexibility by withdrawing the Finance Bill
- He's making efforts to include opposition in government
- He maintains control of security forces
- He still has parliamentary majority
- International support (e.g., Germany hosting him in September)

3. Destabilizing Factors:
- Ongoing youth-led protests ("Generation Z")
- Economic challenges and high debt burden
- Police brutality allegations increasing tensions
- Opposition coalition rejecting his "cosmetic" changes
- Historical precedent of political instability in Kenya

4. Key Considerations:
- Time window is relatively short (2 months)
- Constitutional removal would require impeachment
- Military appears loyal
- No clear alternative leadership ready to take power
- International community supporting stability

5. Historical Context:
- Kenya has never had a president removed mid-term
- Previous periods of unrest didn't lead to presidential removal
- African presidents rarely leave office due to protests alone

6. Recent Developments:
- Ruto is actively making concessions and reforms
- Opposition joining government reduces removal risk
- Economic situation remains challenging but manageable
- Security forces maintaining control

The combination of factors suggests Ruto is facing serious challenges but has significant resources and institutional support to maintain power through October 1, 2024. While the situation is volatile, the short timeframe and lack of clear mechanisms for removal work in his favor.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 18.50% being the most likely. Probability: 18.50%.

Let me analyze this methodically:

Key factors pointing to higher probability:
1. Widespread protests and unrest since June 2024, with at least 50 people killed
2. Strong opposition from "Generation Z" movement demanding Ruto's resignation
3. Significant economic challenges and unpopular tax policies leading to public discontent
4. History of political instability and leadership changes in similar circumstances
5. Police brutality allegations damaging legitimacy

Key factors pointing to lower probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by withdrawing controversial finance bill
2. Successfully formed new coalition government including opposition members
3. Still maintains control of parliament majority
4. International support (especially from US and Germany) remains strong
5. Only 2 months remaining until resolution date (October 1)

Critical considerations:
1. Base rate: Forced presidential removals in Kenya are rare historically
2. Recent cabinet reshuffle and policy reversals suggest Ruto is adapting rather than weakening
3. Opposition appears focused on policy changes rather than removal
4. No clear constitutional mechanism for removal in play
5. Military appears to remain loyal to government

Looking at timing:
- Very short window (2 months) for constitutional removal
- Protests have actually decreased since June peak
- Government showing signs of stabilization after July reforms

The situation remains volatile but Ruto has demonstrated ability to make concessions and maintain power. The short timeframe makes constitutional removal unlikely, while violent overthrow would face significant obstacles.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.40%, with 18.30% being the most likely. Probability: 18.30%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key factors supporting a higher probability:
1. Significant civil unrest with violent protests leading to multiple deaths (50+ reported)
2. Strong opposition movement, particularly among young "Generation Z" protesters
3. Recent major government shake-up with dismissal of most cabinet ministers
4. Economic challenges including high debt burden (70% of GDP) and failed tax increases
5. Opposition calls for Ruto's resignation with #RutoMustGo trending
6. Police brutality during protests damaging legitimacy
7. Withdrawal of controversial Finance Bill showing weakness

Key factors supporting a lower probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by withdrawing the Finance Bill and dissolving cabinet
2. He's making attempts at reform and dialogue with opposition
3. Appointment of opposition members to new government showing coalition-building
4. Still maintains control of security forces
5. International recognition (e.g. planned German state visit)
6. Constitutional mechanisms make rapid removal difficult
7. Only about 2 months until resolution date
8. No clear alternative leader emerging

Historical context:
- Kenyan presidents have rarely been forced from office mid-term
- Similar protests in other African nations often fail to remove leaders
- Short timeframe makes constitutional removal unlikely

Looking at the balance of evidence:
- While situation is serious, Ruto retains key levers of power
- His adaptability in crisis suggests resilience
- Timeframe until October 1 is relatively short for formal removal
- However, situation remains volatile with significant risks

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Severe ongoing protests and unrest since June 2024, with at least 50 people killed
2. Significant youth movement ("Generation Z") demanding Ruto's resignation
3. Withdrawal of controversial 2024 Finance Bill under pressure
4. Economic crisis with high debt (70% of GDP) and rising costs
5. Police brutality allegations damaging legitimacy
6. Opposition coalition Azimio rejecting participation in government
7. Cabinet reshuffle viewed as "cosmetic" by critics

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by withdrawing the Finance Bill
2. Successfully appointed new cabinet including opposition members
3. Maintains control of parliament (195-106 vote shows majority)
4. Military appears loyal to government
5. No clear constitutional mechanism for removal
6. International recognition (US visit, German state guest)
7. Only 2 months until resolution date

Analysis:
The situation is serious but not yet critical enough to force Ruto's departure. He's demonstrated ability to make tactical retreats (Finance Bill) and build coalitions (new cabinet). While protests are significant, they haven't reached the scale typically needed for presidential removal. The military remains loyal and constitutional mechanisms for removal are limited.

However, the risk is non-trivial given:
- Continued youth protests
- Economic crisis
- Police violence backlash
- Opposition unity

The short timeframe (2 months) makes dramatic changes less likely, but possible if violence escalates significantly.

Base rate: African presidents rarely leave office mid-term unless through coups or severe constitutional crises. Neither condition appears fully present yet.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%.
