With both teams boasting strong lineups and pitching staffs, the total games market presents a fascinating opportunity for bettors.

**Yankees and Dodgers Set to Face Off in World Series 2024**
The Los Angeles Dodgers have secured a spot in the World Series after defeating the New York Mets 10-5 in the National League Championship Series (NLCS). They will face their longtime rivals, the New York Yankees, in the World Series. This will be the 12th time the two teams have faced each other in a World Series, with the Dodgers winning the last one in 1981. The Dodgers won the series in six games after losing the first two, securing their first title since 1965 and their third World Series win over the Yankees. The Yankees, on the other hand, were crowned American League Champions last year, winning the World Series in Game 5 over the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Commissioner's Trophy, awarded to the World Series champion, is a unique trophy made of silver and weighing around 13.60 kg, with 30 golden flags representing the 30 MLB teams. Tiffany & Co. has been crafting the trophy since 1999, and the ceremony is now held in the center of the diamond, regardless of whether the champion is the home team or not. The Yankees have the most Commissioner's Trophies, with 7 of their 27 championships won since the trophy was introduced.

**Yankees Top Contenders for World Series Title in 2024**
The New York Yankees are on track to be one of the top contenders for the World Series title this year, something that hasn't happened for the Bronx team since 2009. According to FanGraphs, the team led by Aaron Boone has the highest probability of winning the title, with an 18.5% chance, the highest among all MLB teams. The regular season has been solid for the Yankees, and they are expected to be the team to beat in the playoffs. FanGraphs also projects the Yankees as the winners of the American League East, with an 87.9% chance of securing the division title. The Baltimore Orioles, who are second in their division, have only a 12.1% chance. With 87 wins and 63 losses, the Yankees are 3 games ahead of the Orioles, who have 12 games left in their schedule. They are also in a close race with the Cleveland Guardians for the top spot in the American League, with a 0.5 game lead. The arrival of Juan Soto has given the team a different aura this year, with a player who has already hit 40 home runs this season, a career high. Now it's up to the Yankees to prove their favoritism on the field.

**The Latest 2024 MLB Playoff Odds and Predictions With 1 Month to Go**
The Bleacher Report is projecting the New York Yankees to lose the World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks, similar to the 2001 series. The Diamondbacks have a strong pitching staff, while the Yankees have uncertainty in their rotation after Gerrit Cole. Aaron Judge and Juan Soto are key players for the Yankees, but the team may be too reliant on them to win the World Series. As the Bleacher Report states, 'For as great as Judge and Soto are, Aaron Boone's squad might be too top-heavy to come away with World Series No. 28 this year.'
