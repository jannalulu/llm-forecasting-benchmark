**Florida's Amendment 3: What You Need to Know About Recreational Marijuana**
Florida residents will vote on November 5th on Amendment 3, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. The amendment would allow adults to possess up to three ounces of marijuana and five grams of concentrate, and would also permit the state to issue more licenses and regulate the use of cannabis. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, the amendment would also provide a framework for regulatory rules and the time, place, and manner in which marijuana can be used. 'It would allow adults 21 and older to possess, buy, or use marijuana and marijuana accessories for personal, non-medical use by smoking, ingesting, or other means,' the ballot summary states. A 'yes' vote would support the modification of the Florida Constitution to include language that would legalize marijuana for adult use, while a 'no' vote would oppose adding that language. The new law would take effect six months after its approval. Currently, marijuana is only legal for medicinal use in Florida, but some local jurisdictions have decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. 'Existing medical marijuana treatment centers would be authorized under the initiative to sell marijuana to adults for personal use,' according to Ballotpedia, and the amendment could pave the way for others to cultivate and sell marijuana products. It also raises questions about the expungement of marijuana-related convictions and home cultivation of the plant.

**Florida Amendments 2024: How to vote on marijuana Amendment 3, according to 6 Florida newspapers**
Florida voters will decide on Amendment 3, a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. The amendment would allow individuals to possess, purchase, and use marijuana products for non-medical personal consumption. The editorial boards of six Florida newspapers have offered recommendations on how to vote on Amendment 3. The Palm Beach Post recommends a 'yes' vote, stating that legalizing marijuana would be a step towards addressing the ongoing health and legal issues surrounding cannabis. The TCPalm Editorial Board has no recommendation, citing the complexity of the issue and their focus on more local issues. The Orlando Sentinel and the South Florida Sun Sentinel combined their recommendations, stating that allowing personal use of marijuana makes sense for Florida and that the good outweighs the bad in Amendment 3.

On November 5th, Florida residents will vote on Amendment 3, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and over.

**Florida will decide on recreational marijuana in Amendment 3**
Florida residents will vote on Amendment 3 on November 5, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 years or older. The amendment would allow adults to possess up to three ounces of marijuana and up to five grams of concentrate, and would also regulate the use of cannabis. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, the state would issue more licenses and provide a framework for regulatory standards. A 'yes' vote would amend the Florida Constitution to include language that would legalize marijuana for adult use, while a 'no' vote would oppose adding that language. The new law would take effect six months after approval. Currently, medical marijuana is legal in Florida for people with certain conditions, but recreational use is illegal. However, some local jurisdictions have decriminalized minor cannabis possession offenses. At least 60 percent of voters must vote yes for Amendment 3 to pass.

**First Lady Casey DeSantis campaigns against Amendment 3 in Central Florida**
Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis and other supporters of Gov. Ron DeSantis are campaigning against Amendment 3, which would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 years and older. They argue that it would create a 'corporate cartel' in Florida and lead to a foul odor in public places. However, Kim Rivers, CEO of Trulieve, the largest medical marijuana company in Florida, says that smoking weed in public would be regulated like cigarettes and that the claim about the odor is 'absolutely false.' Attorney John Morgan, a vocal advocate for Amendment 3, says that the passage of the amendment would allow law enforcement to focus on 'real crime' and that the current laws are too harsh. A recent poll found that two-thirds of likely voters support Amendment 3, which requires at least 60% of voters to vote 'yes' to pass.

**Florida's Potential Marijuana Market: A Divided Vote Ahead**
Florida may soon join dozens of other states that allow recreational marijuana if Amendment 3 is approved by 60% of voters. Polls on the amendment have been divided, and voters are being bombarded with contrasting advertisements from opposing sides. The governor, Ron DeSantis, is opposing the amendment, while former president Donald Trump supports it. However, some points are not in dispute, such as the amendment allowing 21-year-olds to possess up to three ounces of marijuana or five grams in concentrated form. The amendment would take effect six months after its approval, according to Trump, who said, 'It's a great opportunity for Florida.'

**Florida's Amendment 3: What You Need to Know About the Cannabis Initiative**
Florida residents will vote on six constitutional amendments in the November 5th election, including Amendment 3, which relates to the use and purchase of cannabis. The initiative, presented through a citizen's initiative, would allow adults over 21 years old to possess, buy, or consume small amounts of cannabis for recreational use. If approved, it would legalize the personal use of cannabis under Florida law for adults, but would not change or replace federal law regulating and restricting marijuana. The proposal would also allow existing medical marijuana treatment centers to sell the product to adults for personal use and permit the granting of licenses to entities other than existing treatment centers to cultivate and sell. According to Vote 411, 'the financial impact of the amendment comes mainly from the expected revenue from sales tax'. If approved, sales of the product for non-medical purposes would be subject to sales tax. A CBS News/YouGov poll in May showed that 56% of potential voters would choose 'yes' to Amendment 3, while 30% would vote 'no' and 14% were undecided. The opposition, including various organizations, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, and the Florida Republican Party, argue that the amendment is 'deceptive' and that marijuana is illegal under federal law and will remain so even if the proposal is approved.

**Understanding Amendment 3 ads: What marijuana legalization really means for Florida**
The 'Vote No on 3' committee is running ads claiming that if Amendment 3, which legalizes recreational marijuana, is passed, people will be able to smoke marijuana anywhere in public, including restaurants and parks. However, the language of the amendment does not support this claim. In fact, Amendment 3 only allows people 21 and older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products and accessories for non-medical personal use. It does not force businesses to allow smoking in their establishments. According to Florida State Law, smoking in most public indoor places is already prohibited. Attorney John Morgan said, 'This is about money; this is not about you,' criticizing the government for giving false information. State Sen. Jason Pizzo (D-Sunny Isles Beach) said that if Amendment 3 passes, it will save lives by providing a safer alternative to street-bought marijuana. Former President Donald Trump has also expressed support for the amendment.

**Poll shows Florida's recreational marijuana amendment on track to pass | Here's what voters said**
A recent poll of nearly 1,000 likely voters in Florida found that two-thirds plan to vote 'yes' on Amendment 3, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana use for adults age 21 and over. Dr. Michael Binde Binder from the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Lab said, 'After years of polling on marijuana in Florida, both medical and recreational, it is clear that the majority is in favor of legalization.' However, some voters have reservations about the amendment, citing concerns about public use and safety. One voter, Rhonda Christiansen, said, 'I don't think a kid with two joints should go to jail for years and I know friends that have needed pot because they're in pain or for anxiety.' Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Amendment 3, but not all of his supporters agree. Early voting continues in Central Florida through next Sunday evening, and Amendment 3 needs 60% of voters to say 'yes' in order to pass.

**Supporters, critics of Florida's marijuana amendment proposal speak out in South Florida**
Supporters and opponents of Amendment 3, a proposal to allow adults 21 and older to possess and use marijuana for personal reasons, held dueling press conferences in South Florida. Former Governor Jeb Bush, who admitted to smoking marijuana at 21, stated that he does not support the amendment, citing concerns for children. In contrast, Republican state Senator Joe Gruters and state Senator Shevrin Jones argued that the amendment would bring in $100 to $450 million in recurring revenue and be a positive move for the state. Gruters stated, 'This is a win, win for the state,' while Bush countered, 'The pitch that this is somehow going to generate revenue I think is wrong.' Both sides are actively campaigning with just eight days left until Election Day.

**What to know about Amendment 3, Florida's marijuana amendment on the 2024 election ballot**
Florida voters will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the state. The amendment would allow adults 21 and older to possess, purchase, and use marijuana for personal reasons, with limits on how much they can carry. It would also allow existing medical marijuana dispensaries to sell to recreational users and permit state-licensed businesses to cultivate, process, and distribute the product. Supporters argue that legalization would curb the black market, ensure safe and regulated products, and free up law enforcement resources. Opponents, including Florida's Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Rick Scott, argue that it could lead to increased unregulated drug use, making roads less safe and negatively impacting youth. A recent poll showed 56% of voters support the amendment, while 30% oppose it. Former President Donald Trump has announced his support for the amendment.

**Vote: Should recreational marijuana be legal in Florida?**
Amendment 3, a state constitutional amendment on the Nov. 5 ballot, proposes to allow adults 21 and older to buy recreational marijuana without a Florida Medical Marijuana card. Some Treasure Coast governments have already passed regulations. The Sewall's Point Town Commission banned medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries, while the Stuart City Commission allowed them but imposed regulations on size and location. The article does not express a clear stance on the amendment, but rather presents information and allows readers to vote on whether they approve or oppose it.

**Marijuana can harm both users and society. Will one more state legalize it?**
A proposal to legalize cannabis in Florida, Amendment 3, is on the ballot. According to its supporters, the amendment would allow adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products and accessories for non-medical personal consumption. This comes as 24 states, three U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have already legalized marijuana. The supporters' statement, 'allow adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products and marijuana accessories for non-medical personal consumption by smoking, ingestion, or otherwise,' highlights the potential implications of the amendment.

The proposed amendment would allow individuals to possess up to three ounces of marijuana or five grams of concentrate. Dispensaries would regulate the sale of marijuana, and the state would charge sales tax. According to a study by JAMA Pediatrics, recreational marijuana has not significantly affected adolescent usage. However, opponents, including Governor DeSantis and U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, argue that the amendment would entrench a monopolistic stranglehold on the marijuana market and that marijuana is a 'gateway drug.' The amendment requires a 60 percent majority to pass, and supporters, including Republican presidential candidate, argue that it is time to end unnecessary arrests and incarcerations for small amounts of marijuana.

**Amendment 3 would legalize recreational marijuana**
Voters in Florida will decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Amendment 3 on the November ballot. The amendment would allow anyone 21 and older to use and possess weed. According to Smart & Safe Florida spokesman Steven Vancore, 'one in six adults readily admit to using marijuana on a regular basis.' Vancore believes regulating marijuana could save thousands of lives by taking it off the streets and putting it in a safe, regulated market. However, Governor Ron DeSantis is opposed, saying it would 'reduce the quality of life everywhere this has tried.' Vote No on 3 director of advocacy Jessica Spencer also opposes the amendment, arguing it would drive people to a cheaper black market and put a strain on social and emergency services. For Vancore, this amendment is about freedom, saying 'those people should not be subject to either incarceration or potentially death.' If voters approve Amendment 3, the legislature can regulate the marijuana industry and decide where revenue will go.

**After Amendment 3, the future of medical marijuana could be in lawmakers’ hands**
Amendment 3 on the Florida General Election ballot could legalize marijuana for all adults 21 and older, potentially disrupting the state's highly regulated medical marijuana industry. Leading companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf have invested heavily in the amendment, which would give them a head start if recreational use is approved. If the amendment passes, patients will need to decide whether to keep their medical marijuana card, which costs $75 a year and requires a doctor's visit every seven months. Tom Unrath, a retired Air Force chaplain living with multiple sclerosis, said, 'It's not so much a fun thing, but it's a helpful thing. It helps me to feel better and thus have a better quality of life.' However, his wife Anita Unrath is unsure if they will keep the card, citing the $400 a year cost. Industry experts, such as Aaron Bloom, CEO of DocMJ, are concerned that the medical program will be forgotten if recreational use is approved. Dr. Barry Gordon, who operates the Compassionate Cannabis Clinic, emphasized the importance of education for seniors. Karim Bouaziz, Senior Vice President of Curaleaf, said the company has no plans to drop products that medical customers want. Passage of Amendment 3 could create a booming market worth $4.9 to $6.1 billion in the first year, according to industry data company Headset.

**Bradford County Sheriff throws support behind Amendment 3**
Bradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith is supporting Amendment Three, which would legalize marijuana use in Florida. According to Smith, 'Would you rather have an adult purchasing marijuana from the drug dealer or would you rather have them purchasing it in a store that is regulated, controlled and taxed.' The proposed constitutional amendment would allow adults aged 21 and up to purchase up to three ounces of marijuana and up to five grams of cannabis concentrates. Smith believes that marijuana isn't as dangerous as other drugs, such as fentanyl, and that the current law is not being enforced. Some Republicans, including Governor Ron DeSantis and the Republican Party of Florida, are opposed to Amendment Three, while former President Donald Trump supports it.

**Florida Amendment 3: A closer look at the proposed marijuana legalization initiative**
Florida Amendment Three aims to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida, joining 24 other states and the District of Columbia. According to the proposed amendment, adults 21 years or older can possess, purchase, or use marijuana products for non-medical personal consumption. However, legal experts argue that this does not allow individuals to grow their own marijuana. The amendment also allows medical marijuana treatment centers and licensed entities to acquire, cultivate, and distribute marijuana products. Critics argue that the amendment gives special licenses to select corporations and could lead to a monopoly. Supporters argue that the amendment ensures a safe and accessible supply of marijuana, while opponents express concerns about the potential risks, including increased availability to minors and reduced quality of life. The amendment also establishes possession limits for personal use, sets a limit of three ounces, and does not change or immunize violations of federal law. Employers can still require drug tests and not hire candidates based on the result. The amendment is expected to bring in nearly $200 million in state and local taxes if passed. It requires at least 60% of the vote to pass.

**Big pot vs. big government in Florida**
Florida is one of the last major holdouts for cannabis prohibition, due to its high bar for constitutional amendments. However, a ballot initiative, Amendment 3, seeks to legalize recreational marijuana, allowing adults 21 and older to possess up to three ounces of marijuana and five grams of concentrated THC. The measure has no provisions for home cultivation, expungement of marijuana convictions, or social equity requirements. Despite the protectionist aspect of the amendment, which would lock in the small number of existing license-holders, longtime legalization advocates see an opportunity to take one of their biggest remaining targets off the board. The campaign to pass the amendment, Smart & Safe Florida, has raised $61 million, making it the most well-funded marijuana legalization campaign in U.S. history. The amendment's opponents, led by Governor Ron DeSantis, argue that it would create a monopoly on recreational marijuana and fail to allow home growing. However, polls show that a solid majority of Florida voters in both major parties favor legalization, and the amendment's supporters argue that it would put a stop to the injustice of throwing thousands of adults in jail and prison every year for smoking marijuana.

**Big Pot vs. Big Government in Florida**
Florida is one of the last major holdouts for cannabis prohibition, but a ballot initiative, Amendment 3, seeks to legalize recreational marijuana. The amendment would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to three ounces of marijuana and five grams of concentrated THC. Existing medical marijuana treatment centers (MMTCs) would be allowed to sell recreational marijuana, but the state Legislature would have the option to expand licensure outside of MMTCs. The amendment has raised $61 million, making it the most well-funded marijuana legalization campaign in U.S. history. However, critics argue that the amendment would create a monopoly on recreational marijuana, locking out new entrants and limiting competition. They also point out that the amendment does not allow home cultivation, expungement of marijuana convictions, or social equity requirements. Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has vowed to fight the amendment, citing concerns about the smell of marijuana, the potential for increased crime, and the lack of competition in the market. Despite these concerns, polls show that a solid majority of Florida voters support the amendment, and it is likely to pass in November. The stakes are high, with thousands of marijuana arrests and millions of dollars in profits at stake. The outcome of Amendment 3 will have significant implications for the future of marijuana legalization in Florida and beyond.

If passed, Amendment 3 would allow adults aged 21 or older to possess and use marijuana for personal reasons, with limits on how much they can carry. Supporters argue that decriminalizing marijuana will free up law enforcement resources and reduce nonviolent drug offenses. Opponents warn that legalizing marijuana could lead to an increase in unregulated drug use and negatively impact youth. A 'yes' vote would support the legalization of recreational marijuana, while a 'no' vote would keep the current system in place. The amendment requires at least 60% of the vote to pass, and if approved, the Florida legislature will create the regulatory framework for the recreational marijuana industry.

**Florida's Amendment 3 will allow voters decide on legalization of recreational marijuana**
Florida voters will decide on Amendment 3 in November, which would legalize recreational marijuana for adults aged 21 and older. If passed, the amendment would allow adults to purchase marijuana from licensed sellers across the state. Smart and Safe Florida, the organization behind the amendment, argues that legalizing marijuana could create a regulated and safe market, generating at least $195 million in state and local tax revenue. However, opponents are concerned about increased marketing toward children and high taxes driving people to the black market. Morgan Hill, a spokesperson for Smart and Safe Florida, said, 'People shouldn’t be going to jail for this. We should be able to tax this product and our public programs could benefit from that tax revenue.'

**Florida amendment guide: Voters will decide on abortion, recreational weed in November**
In the 2024 presidential election, Florida residents will vote on six amendments, including ones on recreational marijuana, abortion, and school board elections. Amendment 1 would make school board elections partisan, while Amendment 2 would enshrine the right to hunt and fish in the state constitution. Amendment 3 would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older, while Amendment 4 would make abortion legal until fetal viability. Amendment 5 would create an inflation adjustment for the homestead tax exemption, and Amendment 6 would repeal public campaign financing. According to the League of Women Voters, 'Voting yes on Amendment 1 would make school board elections partisan, meaning Republican, Democratic or other parties could nominate their own candidates for the elections and require that candidates list their political affiliation on the ballot.' The League also stated, 'Voting yes on Amendment 3 would legalize the use and possession of marijuana for recreational purposes for anyone 21 years old and older.' Additionally, 'Voting yes on Amendment 4 would make abortion legal until fetal viability, which is generally considered to be around 23-24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient's health, as determined by a health care provider.'

**Florida officials express thoughts on legalization of recreational marijuana use**
Recreational marijuana legalization is on the 2024 ballot in Florida as Amendment 3. This amendment would allow adults 21 years or older to possess, purchase, or use marijuana products recreationally. Currently, 24 states have legalized recreational marijuana use. Supporters, such as Democratic Party Chairwoman Nikki Fried, argue that it's time to stop arresting people for simple possession charges and create economic opportunities in the state. However, opponents, like Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson, believe that recreational legalization will lead to an increase in marijuana use among children and have a negative impact on the community. The amendment allows for the possession of up to three ounces of marijuana for personal use, but does not address restrictions on where people can and cannot smoke. Rep. Alex Adrade notes that the legislature still has the ability to regulate where marijuana can be consumed if the amendment passes.

**Vote 2024: Amendment 3 explained**
Amendment 3, a citizen-initiated amendment, aims to legalize marijuana use for adults over 21 in Florida. If passed, it would define the amounts and business market for marijuana, and the Florida Legislature would write the specific rules and regulations. The amendment would allow adults to buy and possess up to 3 ounces of marijuana, and would initially license 25 medical marijuana companies to grow, acquire, transport, distribute, and sell marijuana. State analysts project $200 million to $400 million in annual sales tax revenue when the industry is fully operational. Supporters cite the potential cost savings and reduced arrests, with an estimated 200,000 people annually spared from arrest and incarceration. A 'yes' vote would support legalizing adult personal marijuana use starting mid-2025, while a 'no' vote would leave current laws in place.

**Florida: Miami Herald Endorses Amendment 3 to Legalize Recreational Marijuana**
The Miami Herald has endorsed Amendment 3, a ballot initiative that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Florida for everyone 21 and older. According to the Herald, 'America has been fighting a war on drugs that most people agree has failed' and Amendment 3 would allow the legal use of marijuana products for adults, with proper monitoring, similar to the sale of alcohol and tobacco products. If approved, Amendment 3 would allow those 21 and older to possess and use up to three ounces of dried marijuana flower and up to five grams of marijuana concentrates. Polling shows that 64% of likely voters support Amendment 3, and the Herald notes that Florida could gain up to $431 million in sales tax revenues in the first year. However, the Herald also recommends that the Legislature clarify that the smoking ban in public places applies to recreational marijuana and allow cities to enforce local laws with noncriminal citations.

**Florida abortion and marijuana advocates scramble to keep ballot measure hopes alive**
Florida voters will decide on two high-profile ballot measures on abortion and recreational marijuana, but both appear to be in jeopardy of meeting the 60% threshold required to pass. Amendment 3 would legalize marijuana for adults 21 and older, while Amendment 4 would prevent the state from making laws that prohibit or penalize abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient's health. Opponents argue that Amendment 3 would monopolize the marijuana industry and prevent guardrails on where marijuana could be consumed, while Amendment 4 would lead to abortion without limitations. A lawsuit was filed by Trulieve, a marijuana company backing Amendment 3, against the Florida Republican Party, accusing them of running an 'intentionally deceptive campaign' against the measure. Florida Republican Party Chairman Evan Power dismissed the lawsuit, saying it is 'funny' how 'sensitive about honest TV ads' the major backer of the amendment is. Recent polls show both measures below the 60% approval needed to go into law, with Amendment 4 polling below 60% since the main opposition group launched its campaign in July.

**Marijuana company sues Florida GOP over 'deceptive' pot ads**
Trulieve, Florida's largest marijuana distributor, is suing the Florida Republican Party over 'deceptive' ads encouraging voters to say 'no' to Amendment 3, which would allow people 21 and older to buy, possess, and use recreational marijuana. However, the amendment does not change the law prohibiting homegrown marijuana in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis claims that Amendment 3 would give control over the supply of marijuana to companies like Trulieve, saying 'They are basically putting corporate protectionism in the constitution to protect them, so they get to sell it all.' The Florida GOP chairman, Evan Power, responded by saying 'They are using lawfare to try to silence us, but we will not be deterred in our efforts.' Interestingly, former President Donald Trump has announced that he will be voting in favor of Amendment 3.

**2024 Voter's Guide: Florida Amendment 3 - Adult Personal Use of Marijuana**
Florida Amendment 3, one of six proposed amendments to the Florida Constitution in the 2024 election, aims to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 years and older. Sponsored by Smart & Safe Florida, the proposal passed review by the Florida Supreme Court and gathered over one million valid petition signatures, exceeding the required threshold. The campaign, funded by over $101 million in contributions, including $72 million from Trulieve, a medical marijuana dispensary, would allow adults to possess, purchase, and use marijuana products for personal consumption. The amendment would also establish possession limits and apply to Florida law, while noting that it does not change or immunize violations of federal law. Voters will be asked to say 'yes' or 'no' to the amendment, which requires 60% of the vote to be added to the constitution.

**Your Cousins In Florida Like Their Weed: Why Hispanic Voters Could Tip The Scale For Cannabis,Will It Be Enough?**
A recent poll by TelevisaUnivision and Media Predict shows that 60% of Hispanic voters in Florida support Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational cannabis for adults aged 21 and older. This is a 2% rise from last month's numbers, highlighting growing acceptance within this key demographic. Additionally, 63% of non-Hispanic voters also showed enthusiasm for cannabis legalization. If approved in the November election, Florida's cannabis market could undergo a 400% growth, providing new opportunities for business development. However, economic concerns, such as the rising cost of living, remain paramount for Hispanic voters, and national dynamics may overshadow cannabis reform as a top priority for voters.

**Florida will decide on recreational marijuana in Amendment 3**
Florida residents will vote on Amendment 3 on November 5, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 years or older. The amendment would allow adults to possess up to three ounces of marijuana and up to five grams of concentrate, and would also regulate the use of cannabis. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, the state would issue more licenses and provide a framework for regulatory standards. A 'yes' vote would amend the Florida Constitution to include language that would legalize marijuana for adult use, while a 'no' vote would oppose adding that language. The new law would take effect six months after approval. Currently, medical marijuana is legal in Florida for people with certain conditions, but recreational use is illegal. However, some local jurisdictions have decriminalized minor cannabis possession offenses. At least 60 percent of voters must vote yes for Amendment 3 to pass.

**Amendment 3: Freedoms for safer, smarter policy for Florida**
State Rep. Allison Tant supports Amendment 3, which would legalize the possession and consumption of limited amounts of marijuana for adults 21 and older in Florida. Tant's main concern was protecting children, but after reviewing the proposal, she believes it will create safeguards to prevent minors from accessing marijuana. She also thinks it will generate dedicated revenues for critical needs like drug awareness education, law enforcement, and public schools. Tant believes regulating marijuana similarly to alcohol will help law enforcement stop impaired driving and increase job opportunities for Floridians. She is confident that Amendment 3 will shut down cottage industries that sell illegal laced products. Tant concludes that Amendment 3 is about 'smart justice' and encourages voters to support it this November. 'Allowing Florida adults the freedom to safely consume something in the privacy of their own homes or with other adult friends, well, that is something I support,' Tant said. 'At its core – that's what Amendment 3 is all about and frankly, I call that smart justice.'

**Trump says he'll vote for Florida measure legalizing recreational marijuana, clashing with DeSantis**
Former President Donald Trump has come out in support of Florida's recreational marijuana ballot measure, Amendment 3, which would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to 3 ounces of marijuana.

Amendment 3 has consistently shown high levels of support in polls, with 66% of voters in favor according to a Fox News survey in July. Trump's endorsement could help push the amendment above the 60% threshold needed for passage.

Former President Donald Trump recently expressed support for Amendment 3 in Florida, which would legalize marijuana for recreational use by adults 21 years or older. However, this move has drawn criticism from the organization Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), which is concerned about the potential dangers associated with legalized recreational marijuana. Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of SAM, stated that Trump's endorsement is 'confusing and hypocritical' and warned that it could lead to an increase in cartel activity and harm to children and minorities. Sabet also highlighted the data showing that the marijuana industry is responsible for millions of youth becoming addicted to the drug. Multiple studies have linked regular marijuana use to various health problems, including mental health issues and physical ailments. A recent Gallup poll found that a slim majority of the country believes marijuana has a negative impact on society and individuals who use it.

Joe Gruters praised Trump's stance, saying, 'I am incredibly proud to have President Trump stand alongside us in our effort to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for simple possession of marijuana.' However, the ballot measure faces opposition from Gov. Ron DeSantis and other groups, who argue that it will increase crime and lower the state's quality of life.
