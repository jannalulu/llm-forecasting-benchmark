INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (OCTOBER 2, 2024)

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee and discussing California's SB 1047.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, SB 1047 didn't make it. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right, the tech pushback was intense. Anthropic's letter really turned the tide.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And the Assembly couldn't reconcile the compliance concerns. Innovation won over regulation this time.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
I saw it coming. The bill was too ambitious given the political climate.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models were spot on. The probability was never high, especially with the Governor's hesitance.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Well, it's back to the drawing board for AI regulation in California.

They nod, reflecting on the accuracy of their forecast, as the camera pulls back, capturing the bustling world outside, indifferent to the intricacies of legislative probabilities.

FADE OUT.

*SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, sipping coffee, discussing the fate of California's SB 1047.*

JANE  
(leaning forward)  
So, did it happen?

MARK  
(shaking his head)  
Nope. Our models had it at 15.75%. The pushback from tech giants like Anthropic was just too strong.

LUCAS  
(nodding)  
Right. That letter to the Assembly was a game-changer. They highlighted how the bill could stifle innovation.

JANE  
And the Governor was always cautious. Without a solid majority in the Assembly, it was a long shot.

MARK  
Exactly. Even with the increasing call for AI regulation, the timing wasn't right.

LUCAS  
(chuckling)  
Well, our Brier scores remain intact. Another accurate prediction.

*They clink their coffee cups, acknowledging their foresight.*

So, SB 1047. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

The tech pushback was strong. Anthropic's letter had a significant impact.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And with the Assembly session ending in August, there wasn't enough time for amendments.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
Governor's hesitation sealed it. Innovation concerns outweighed the bill's potential benefits.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday marked the deadline for SB 1047. Our models had it at 28.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the pushback from tech giants like Anthropic, those odds make sense. Their letter to the Assembly was a game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The regulatory compliance concerns were a significant barrier. Innovation versus regulation—a classic standoff.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The Governor's stance was pivotal too. Without his backing, the bill was always teetering.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And the Assembly's indecision didn’t help. Our data showed a lack of consensus.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
So, the bill didn’t pass. Our models were spot-on, as always.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
This will set a precedent for future AI legislation.

JORDAN

Last update we got was from August 8th. Nothing changed after that. The Governor didn't budge either.
