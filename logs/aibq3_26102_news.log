**Space Traps: Astronauts Stranded on Orbit Until August**
The NASA and Boeing team is carefully inspecting the Starliner spacecraft to prepare for its final separation from the International Space Station (ISS) and the return of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Earth. Although there is no clear date for their return, the team is aiming for mid-August, when SpaceX will conduct rotational missions on the ISS. According to Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, 'We would have liked to have gotten Butch and Suni home on Starliner a few days before the Crew-9 launch. ... We're really working to try to track the data and see when we can earliest target for undocking and landing. I think some of the data suggests that – if optimistically – it might be as early as the end of July.' Wilmore and Williams have been integrated into the ISS crew and are taking on daily responsibilities for technical maintenance and scientific experiments. They are also involved in testing numerous Starliner systems and anomalies, which are being thoroughly investigated by Boeing engineers on Earth. The Starliner was launched on June 5 and was intended to deliver the astronauts to the ISS for a week. However, a helium leak occurred during the journey, and problems with the engine were also detected, which creates challenges for their return to Earth.

**Stuck in space, NASA astronaut Sunita Williams says...**
NASA astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, who were supposed to return to Earth last month, may have to stay in space until August due to technical issues with the Starliner spacecraft. The duo, who are the first human crew on the historic test mission, expressed confidence in the spacecraft's ability to get them back to Earth. Williams said, 'I feel confident that, if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we would get in (the Starliner spacecraft) and we could undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home.' The astronauts have been conducting science and maintenance tasks on the International Space Station and have been integrated into the ISS crew. They have been doing science, maintenance, and some major maintenance that has been waiting for a little while, like stuff that's been on the books for a little bit,' Williams said.

**Astronauts Stranded in Space as Return Date Uncertain**
Astronauts Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Suni Williams, aged 58 and 61, respectively, are stranded in space after a failure in the propulsion system. They were supposed to return from their mission on June 13, but the landing on Earth has been delayed three times. Now they don't have a return date. The two left for the International Space Station (ISS) on June 5, on a mission that was supposed to last 8 days. However, problems with the propulsion system and helium leaks have delayed their return, according to NASA. The Starliner spacecraft can only stay docked at the Harmony module for 45 days due to limited fuel. Despite the limited time, NASA stated that the astronauts are not under pressure, as there are many supplies in orbit. The ISS program is open until August. NASA has awarded SpaceX a contract worth $843 million to build a spacecraft that will remove the International Space Station from its orbit when it reaches the end of its operational life in a few years.

**Two US Astronauts Stranded in Space Due to Technical Issues with Boeing Starliner**
Two American astronauts, Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, are stranded in space after a technical issue with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. The spacecraft was supposed to return after an 8-day mission, but it has been stuck in space for almost a month. Engineers are working to resolve the technical issues, and the return date has been pushed back to after two spacewalks scheduled for June 24 and July 2. Boeing assures that the astronauts have enough supplies and that the space station's schedule is relatively open until mid-August. The Starliner launched on June 5 from Cape Canaveral in Florida, after two failed launches in May and June. Despite a year-long delay and a $1.5 billion budget overrun, the mission has faced numerous technical issues, including failures in the reaction control thrusters and helium leaks. However, Boeing claims that the helium leaks and most of the thruster issues have been stabilized. Only one of the 27 thrusters is out of service, which according to Boeing, does not pose a problem for the return mission. The Starliner is authorized to undock and return to Earth in case of an emergency. NASA and Boeing insist that the astronauts are not stranded and that the technical difficulties do not threaten the mission.

**Astronauts 'Stranded' in Space After Mission Delay**
Two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are stuck in space after the return of the Boeing Starliner mission to the International Space Station was delayed. The mission was initially scheduled to return to Earth on June 12, but was extended indefinitely. The NASA agency stated that the delay will allow more time to examine the problems with the propulsion system and helium leaks that caused the initial delay. The astronauts will remain anchored in the orbital laboratory for about two weeks to evaluate the new spacecraft and its systems before returning to Earth. NASA's Commercial Crew Program Manager, Steve Stich, said, 'We're taking our time and following our standard mission management process.' He added, 'We're letting the data guide our decision-making regarding the small helium leaks in the system and the performance of the propellers we observed during the encounter and docking. Moreover, given the duration of the mission, it's appropriate that we conduct an agency-level review, similar to what was done before the return of the SpaceX Demo-2 NASA after two months in orbit, to document the agency's formal acceptance of proceeding as planned.' The astronauts are not in a hurry to leave the station, as there are many supplies in orbit, and the station's programming is relatively open until mid-August.

**American Astronauts Stranded in Space Due to Boeing Starliner Issues**
Two American astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, were supposed to return to Earth on Wednesday, June 26, but their mission has been delayed for the second time due to helium leaks and propulsion system issues on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. The astronauts have been stranded at the International Space Station since June 5, with no set date for their return. Despite the technical issues, NASA and Boeing officials say the astronauts are not stuck in orbit and the spacecraft is authorized to detach from the space station and return to Earth in case of an emergency or need for a quick departure. The Boeing spokesperson stated that the crew is not in a hurry to leave the station, as there are many supplies in orbit and the station's programming is relatively open until mid-August. NASA also assured that the spacecraft has enough helium in its tanks to support 70 hours of flight time after detachment. The Boeing spokesperson added that the helium leaks and most of the propulsion system issues are stable and not a concern for the return mission. Four of the five previously shut-down thrusters are now operating normally, with only one of the 27 thrusters currently offline, which does not pose a problem for the return mission.

**Astronauts Stranded on ISS Due to Starliner Issues**
Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) due to issues with the Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The initial plan was to return to Earth on June 13, but due to system failures, the new estimated return date is now July 2. However, the stay has been extended for the third time, and the astronauts will now return home no earlier than June 26. The Starliner capsule launched on its maiden crewed flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 5, but during the 25-hour journey, engineers discovered five separate helium leaks in the spacecraft's propulsion system. The team working on maintenance reported that the helium system is not functioning as designed and needs to be investigated. The module's return window is currently docked to the Harmony module of the ISS, but the limited fuel of the Harmony module estimates that the Starliner will only stay anchored for 45 days, reducing the window for a safe return. NASA assures that the crew is not under pressure to leave the station, as there are many supplies in orbit, and the station's programming is relatively open until mid-August. The Starliner has a history of failures, including a software failure in its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, which put it in the wrong orbit, and problems with a fuel valve and parachutes in subsequent attempts.
