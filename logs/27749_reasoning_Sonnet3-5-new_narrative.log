Here's a script set on September 9th, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing the Speed Chess Championship results.]

Nate: "Well, that was quite a tournament. Our models had Firouzja at 17.8%."

Philip: [nodding] "The data was fascinating. We had Carlsen as the clear favorite at 45%, Nakamura at 31%, Firouzja at 17.8%, and Niemann at 6.2%. The young Firouzja's meteoric rise to 2800+ was impressive, but..."

Nate: "But facing both Nakamura and potentially Carlsen was a steep mountain to climb. Even with his record-breaking achievements at 21, the experience gap was significant."

Philip: "Exactly. Our models accounted for Firouzja's brilliant tactical play, but also weighted heavily the championship experience of both Carlsen and Nakamura. The head-to-head records were particularly telling."

Nate: "The probabilities don't lie. They never do."

[They both turn to watch highlights from the tournament on a nearby screen]

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer] Phil, did you see the Speed Chess Championship results?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, fascinating outcome. Our models had it at 17.25% for Firouzja.

Nate: Makes sense. Going against both Nakamura and potentially Carlsen was a steep mountain to climb for the young prodigy.

Philip: True. The historical data heavily favored Nakamura or Carlsen. Firouzja's recent rating surge was impressive, but championship experience matters in these high-pressure situations.

Nate: [nodding] The semifinal matchup against Nakamura was particularly telling. Five-time champion versus a talented but less experienced player...

Philip: And let's not forget Carlsen's dominant 2023 performance and that record-breaking blitz rating. The numbers just weren't in Firouzja's favor.

Nate: [closing laptop] Well, our models called it again. Sometimes youth and talent need more seasoning before they can overcome the established giants.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, another Speed Chess Championship in the books. Our models gave Firouzja just a 12.45% chance."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. The data was quite clear. Despite his impressive rating and youth, facing both Nakamura and potentially Carlsen was a monumental challenge. The historical head-to-head matchups were particularly telling."

Nate: "Exactly. Carlsen's record-breaking blitz rating and Nakamura's five previous titles made them the clear favorites. Even with Firouzja's meteoric rise to 2800, the experience factor was significant."

Philip: "The models accounted for tournament pressure too. Remember, this was high-stakes speed chess, where veterans typically prevail. Firouzja's youth and relative inexperience in these formats weighed heavily in our calculations."

Nate: "The numbers never lie, Philip. Our models had it at 12.45%, and that's exactly why we're the best in the business."
