**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Before She is Officially Nominated**
Trump's campaign has refused to schedule a debate with Harris before she is officially nominated by the Democratic Party. The campaign's spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that it is 'not suitable' to schedule a debate until the Democrats have officially chosen their candidate. Chong also mentioned that the 'continued political chaos' caused by Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris, makes it 'not suitable' to schedule a debate. Additionally, some Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, have expressed strong feelings that Kamala Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and are waiting for a better candidate. On Sunday, President Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election and expressed his full support and endorsement for his vice president, Kamala Harris, to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. Harris has promised to win the Democratic Party's nomination and defeat Trump in the November 5, 2024 election.

**Trump says he'll debate Kamala Harris, but only after his nomination**
Former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump has stated that he would debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, but only after his official nomination. Trump's campaign said that he would not commit to any future debates until his condition is met. However, Trump had previously agreed to a debate with current President Joe Biden, organized by ABC on September 10. It is now unclear if the debate will take place as planned. Trump stated that he wants to debate Harris, as he believes it is important for a presidential campaign. He also mentioned that he did not agree to anything with Biden, but accepted a debate invitation. Kamala Harris is now the Democratic candidate for president after Biden's decision to not seek re-election. Biden announced his decision in a letter dated July 21, 2024, stating that he would focus on completing his presidential duties for the remainder of his term. The Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, will be a crucial moment in defining the candidacy.

**Trump Backs Out of Future Debates, Says Democrats 'Could Still Change Their Minds' About Kamala Harris**
Donald Trump's campaign has backed out of future debates, citing the ongoing political chaos surrounding the Democratic Party and the possibility that they may still change their minds about their nominee. The statement, released by Trump's communications director Steven Cheung, claims that many in the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, do not think Kamala Harris can beat Trump and are holding out for someone else. The apparent withdrawal comes after Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election and endorsed Harris. Trump faced Biden in their first debate on June 27, which resulted in Democratic voters losing faith in his re-election chances due to his poor performance.

**When is the next presidential debate? With Joe Biden out, will there a Donald Trump-Kamala Harris debate? What we know.**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris is now the presumptive Democrat nominee, but a debate between Donald Trump and Harris is uncertain. Trump has expressed reluctance to debate Harris or any other candidate before the Democratic National Convention in August. The next presidential debate was scheduled for September 10 on ABC, but Trump may not participate. Harris will need to be nominated as the official candidate during the Democratic National Convention, where party delegates will vote on who will represent the party. The 'good conscience' clause in the DNC rules allows delegates to vote for someone other than the primary winner.

The Trump campaign has declined to commit to vice presidential debate dates until after the Democratic national convention, citing uncertainty over the Democratic nominee for vice president. Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes stated that it would be unfair to lock in a date before the convention, as the Democratic nominee for vice president has not been determined. In response, Biden-Harris 2024 Communications Director for Vice President Harris, Brian Fallon, accused Trump of backing off a debate against Vice President Harris, who has spent the last two years prosecuting the case on behalf of reproductive freedom. Fallon also questioned Vance's willingness to defend the Trump-Vance record on the debate stage.

The Trump campaign has postponed agreeing to a date for a vice presidential debate, citing uncertainty over the Democratic ticket. The campaign claims it cannot commit to a date before the Democratic convention, as they do not know who the Democratic vice presidential nominee will be.

**Democrats to Virtually Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party plans to virtually nominate President Joe Biden as their candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, in which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The nomination will be made through a virtual 'roll call' process, where over 4,000 party delegates will cast their votes starting next Monday, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Biden's nomination will be officially accepted during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, scheduled for August 19-22.

**Trump Proposes Additional Debates with Biden**
Former US President Donald Trump has proposed holding additional debates with current President Joe Biden within the next few days. Trump stated that this would give Biden a chance to redeem himself after his poor performance in the previous debates. Trump emphasized that these debates should be held 'man-to-man' without moderators or restrictions. 'I officially offer Joe a chance to redeem himself before the world. Let's hold another debate this week so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone that he can be a president', Trump said. The first debate between Biden and Trump took place on June 27. Several American media outlets noted that there was panic in the Democratic Party after Biden's speech, with some supporters even considering replacing him as the party's candidate or having him step down due to his health and age. The next presidential election in the US is scheduled for November 5, 2024. Trump has already gathered the necessary number of delegates to run as the Republican candidate for president, while Biden, who is seeking re-election, has secured the support of a sufficient number of delegates from the Democratic Party. The candidates will be confirmed at party conventions later in the summer.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

**Democrats May Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party may nominate incumbent US President Joe Biden as a candidate for the 2024 presidential election, according to Bloomberg. This move aims to put an end to rumors about potential presidential replacement after Biden's poor debate performance with Republican Donald Trump. The nomination could also ensure Biden's presence on the Ohio ballot, where the registration deadline is August 7. The nomination is expected to take place on July 21 during the party's committee meeting, which will finalize the procedures before the main convention in Chicago on August 19. Meanwhile, the Republican Party is expected to officially announce Trump as their candidate at their convention in Milwaukee on July 15-18. The article notes that Biden's first debate with Trump was disastrous, with the President struggling to articulate his points and making mistakes. The Democrats are reportedly considering replacing Biden with another candidate, with some saying 'it's time for him to go.' The article concludes that the first presidential debate in the US can be characterized as a 'disaster.'

**Here's How Democrats Could Replace Joe Biden Before November**
Following a poor debate performance by President Joe Biden, Democrats are considering replacing him with another candidate before the 2024 presidential election. According to the Democratic National Committee's rules, Biden cannot be removed from the ticket by party leaders, but the convention can hold an open nominating process, allowing other candidates to take the lead. Several potential contenders have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. However, Harris's poll numbers are not inspiring, and she has faced criticism for her lack of activity since taking office. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are concerned about the possibility of a brokered convention, where the party's 4,000 delegates would choose a new nominee. The article also discusses the Supreme Court's recent ruling on homelessness, which allows cities to criminalize homelessness, and the lack of real-time fact-checking during the debate, which allowed Trump to spread misinformation. Additionally, the article touches on Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results, his claims about golf, and his handling of immigration policy.

**US-Wahl: TV-Duell zwischen Biden und Trump begins**
The highly anticipated first TV debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the ongoing US presidential election has begun. The Democratic President and his Republican predecessor are facing off on the TV stage in Atlanta, Georgia. This is the first direct confrontation between the two presidential candidates since October 2020, when Trump was the incumbent and Biden was the challenger. This time, the roles are reversed, with Biden seeking a second term as President and Trump running for the Republicans. The debate is expected to be a closely watched event, with polls indicating a neck-and-neck race between the two candidates. One of the recurring themes in the campaign is the high age of the candidates, with Biden being 81 years old and Trump 78 years old.

**Watch live as Trump arrives in Atlanta ahead of first presidential debate against Biden**
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will face off in the first 2024 presidential debate on Thursday night in Atlanta. The 90-minute debate will air on CNN and is expected to draw a huge audience. The two candidates, both 78 and 81 years old, will be under pressure to display their command of issues and avoid verbal stumbles. Trump, who still faces criminal cases, will need to convince undecided voters that he does not pose a threat to democracy, while Biden will need to deliver a forceful performance after months of Republican assertions that his faculties have dulled with age.

**USA 2024: The Next Steps Towards the Vote**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up with the first face-to-face debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The debate comes after Trump's conviction for paying Stormy Daniels. The focus is now on July 11, when Judge Juan Merchan will announce the sentence against Trump. It's unlikely that Trump will go to prison, and he may be granted house arrest, preventing him from attending the Republican convention. Trump is expected to announce his running mate in Milwaukee, possibly before the debate. Kamala Harris and Trump's number two will face off in a debate, with dates set for July 23 (after the Republican convention) and August 13 (before the Democratic convention). The key dates in the election campaign are: June 27: Biden and Trump's first debate on CNN, July 15-18: Republican convention in Milwaukee, August 19-22: Democratic convention in Chicago, September 10: second presidential debate on ABC News, November 5: Election Day, January 20, 2025: Inauguration Day.

**Roger Stone: Democrats will try to put Trump in JAIL before Republican National Convention – NaturalNews.com**
Roger Stone, a veteran political operative, predicts that the Democrats will try to put former President Donald Trump in jail before the 2024 Republican National Convention, scheduled for July 15-18. Stone believes this would be an extraordinary act of election interference and would backfire on the Democrats. He also discussed the upcoming presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden, stating that it has enormous risk for both candidates. Stone thinks Trump just needs to carry himself in a presidential fashion and avoid becoming an attack dog to win the debate. He also believes that Trump's opponents will run a negative campaign and a campaign of distortion, focusing on his felony conviction rather than their own record.

**Biden and Trump will meet for a debate this week. When are presidential debates typically held?**
The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.

**Trump's Wild New Debate Claim Has People Saying, Hmm OK**
Former US President Donald Trump suggested he might purposefully lose the first 2024 presidential debate to President Joe Biden to ensure Biden remains on the Democratic ticket. Trump made the comment during an interview with Steve Gruber, claiming Biden will be 'fed a lot of stuff' before the debate and calling for drug tests for the candidates. Critics mocked Trump's suggestion, saying it's a sign of his own nervousness about the debate. Trump's comment was met with ridicule on social media, with many calling it a 'narcissistic' move.
