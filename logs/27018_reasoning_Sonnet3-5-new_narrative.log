Here's a 150-word script for your movie scene:

INTERIOR - FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY AFTER IMO RESULTS

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by monitors displaying data streams. A headline flashes: "Latest IMO Results Released."

TETLOCK
(studying papers)
Our models gave it 12.35%.

SILVER
Makes sense. That DeepMind silver medal in August was impressive, but the gap to gold... and public models lag significantly.

TETLOCK
The constraints were the killer. Nine hours, no internet search, and it had to be publicly available? While handling general queries?

SILVER
(nodding)
The math was there, but the technology wasn't ready. Not for 2024.

TETLOCK
(looking at historical data)
Remember when everyone thought AGI would solve everything overnight?

SILVER
(chuckling)
Reality's more nuanced. Though I bet our 2025 forecast will look very different.

They both turn to watch the sunset through their office window, screens still flickering with probabilities.

FADE OUT.

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

INTERIOR - FORECASTING OFFICE - MORNING

Sunlight streams through windows onto walls covered with probability charts. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, reviewing papers.

NATE
(shuffling through news articles)
The latest IMO results just came in. Our models were spot on again.

PHILIP
(nodding)
Given what we knew by August 7th, our models had it at 8.75%.

NATE
The signs were there - DeepMind's closed-source system nearly made gold, but public LLMs still struggled with novel mathematical reasoning. The gap was wider than most expected.

PHILIP
(examining a graph)
Interesting how everyone overestimated the transfer learning from general knowledge to IMO-level mathematics. The public models needed more specialized training.

NATE
At least now we know why our probability was in the single digits. The technology just wasn't quite there yet.

Here's a 150-word script for your movie scene:

INTERIOR - FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY AFTER IMO RESULTS

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by screens displaying data. Yesterday's headlines about the IMO results scroll across monitors.

TETLOCK
(reviewing papers)
Even with DeepMind's near-miss in August, getting a publicly available LLM to gold medal status was a moonshot.

SILVER
Our models were crystal clear on this one. 2.35%.

TETLOCK
The constraints were too demanding. Public availability, general-purpose capability, natural language input... 

SILVER
(nodding)
And that 9-hour time limit. The closed-source systems barely managed silver with specialized training.

TETLOCK
The gap between research prototypes and public systems remains substantial.

SILVER
(checking his phone)
Another year, another human victory at the IMO. Some boundaries still hold... for now.

They share a knowing look as the sun sets through the office window.
