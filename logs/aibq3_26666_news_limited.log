**Tether USDT market share drops from 82% to 74%.**
Tether's USDT market share has declined from 82% to 74% in 2024, according to Kaiko's report. The decline is attributed to an increased shift in market sentiment and regulation on stablecoins. Other stablecoins, such as FDUSD and USDC, have gained popularity, especially since the partnership with Binance. USDC's market share has increased to 12%, nearing FDUSD at 14%. Major investors are shifting to legally accepted stablecoins to comply with operational requirements, especially in the European Union. MICA approval of CIRCLE has boosted USDC's market share and trading volume. USDC is also more accessible and flexible than Tether, with zero fee minting and faster transfer times. Tether is expected to suspend USDT redemptions across major blockchains by September 2025.

Tether's market share in the stablecoin market has declined from 82% to 74% in 2024, while regulated stablecoins such as USDC have gained popularity. The decline is attributed to increased competition and regulation on stablecoins. USDC's market share has increased to 12%, nearing FDUSD at 14%, and is expected to continue growing due to its flexibility and accessibility. The European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA) is set to challenge the dominance of non-compliant stablecoins, and Tether is expected to suspend USDT redemptions across major blockchains by September 2025.

Tether has faced constant scrutiny over its operational transparency, including the extent of its reserves backing its USDT stablecoin. The company has been under investigation for potential ties to terrorism and has paid a $41 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for providing incorrect information about its reserves.

**Fears UK prisons face ‘collapse' as they could be full before early release scheme begins**
The UK prison system is facing a potential 'collapse' as it could reach full capacity before the early release scheme begins in September. Despite new emergency measures announced by Labour to release some prisoners early, officials fear that capacity will be overwhelmed by the end of August. The justice secretary has described the situation as a 'ticking timebomb'. A senior prisons source expressed concerns about an expected increase in inmates after the August bank holiday, warning that the estate is 'very vulnerable to shocks'. The early release scheme started by the Conservative government is still running, and up to 200 police cells have been made available under Operation Safeguard to hold inmates temporarily. If prisons become completely full, criminals cannot be moved on from police cells and official modelling suggests that custody suites across the country would run out of space within three days, making normal arrest procedures impossible.

**EU's New Rules for Stablecoins: Tether, Circle, and Others Face Uncertainty**
The European Union's rules for stablecoins, known as MiCA, will come into force on June 30. The rules prohibit stablecoins from conducting more than 1 million daily transactions that pay for goods or services outside and within the chain. Tether, Circle, and other major stablecoin issuers will soon be on a short leash in the European Union. With the new rules, they will not only need to obtain permission to operate in the 27-country trading block but also face strict limits on transaction volume and value set by the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation. The rules mean that some of the largest stablecoin issuers, including Tether, whose USDT is the largest in the world by market capitalization, and Circle, responsible for USDC, may not be able to operate in the EU, said Robert Kopich, general secretary of Blockchain for Europe. 'Stablecoins not belonging to the EU, denominated in euros - if they exceed a certain threshold - then you need to stop issuing and using them, and this creates a problem, because 99% of the stablecoin market is in US dollars,' Kopich said in an interview at the CoinDesk Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas, last month.

**JPMorgan Predicts Stablecoin Bill May Pass Before 2024 Elections**
JPMorgan predicts that the stablecoin bill may be approved before the 2024 presidential elections, which could threaten Tether's dominance. The bill, known as the 'Clarity for Stablecoin Payments Act', has the potential to be passed before the elections. According to JPMorgan, the new regulations may favor stablecoins that comply with US standards, potentially reducing the dominance of non-compliant stablecoins like Tether. The report also suggests that the Federal Reserve is less likely to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) after a House bill last month prohibited the bank from doing so. JPMorgan analysts believe that new regulatory measures are likely to hinder the development of a CBDC by the Federal Reserve.
