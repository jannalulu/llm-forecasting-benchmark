Let me carefully analyze this:

Key observations:
- Specific timeframe: November 12-December 31, 2024
- Must be public ICC arrest warrant (not summons)
- Must be officially disclosed before January 1, 2025

Recent ICC context:
- ICC has previously issued warrants for high-profile cases (e.g., Putin in 2023)
- Ongoing conflicts/tensions (Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Hamas) increase potential warrant scenarios
- ICC tends to move deliberately, but can act quickly with sufficient evidence

Probability considerations:
- High-profile situations exist that could trigger warrants
- Time window is relatively short (under two months)
- Bureaucratic processes take time
- Need for substantial evidence

Counterbalancing factors:
- Political sensitivities might slow warrant issuance
- Limited time for comprehensive investigation
- Potential for last-minute developments

After careful analysis of geopolitical dynamics, ICC historical patterns, and current global tensions, I assess the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 37.25%, but 26.40% being the most likely. Probability: 26.40%.
