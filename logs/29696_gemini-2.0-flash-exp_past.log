Okay, let's analyze this question using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any relevant predictions from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. However, there are some similar questions about ski resort opening dates on Metaculus, but they are not directly relevant to Jackson Hole on November 29. So I will not rely on others and take an inside view.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We need to assess the probability of Jackson Hole being listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow.com on November 29, 2024. This can be broken down into a few sub-problems:

*   **Usual opening date:** What's the typical opening date for Jackson Hole?
*   **Snow Conditions:** Are there any indicators of potential delays in snow accumulation?
*   **Resort's Preparedness:** Is the resort in a position to open as scheduled?
*   **Reporting Accuracy:** How reliable is OnTheSnow's reporting?

**3. Inside and Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** We know that many ski resorts aim to open around late November. I have news articles from 2024. Many are opening earlier in November. There is also a historical precedent of delays. So I'll initially estimate 75-85% probability of a resort like Jackson Hole being open by the 29th of November.
*   **Inside View:** Now let's look at the specific evidence for Jackson Hole.

**4. Adjusting for New Evidence (Under- vs. Over-reacting):**

*   **Strong Evidence for Opening:**
    *   Several news articles clearly state that Jackson Hole Mountain Resort is set to open on November 29, 2024. A Spanish news article says "Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming, USA, is set to open its slopes for the 2024/25 season on November 29th".
    *   The resort is prepared to turn on snow cannons as soon as weather permits and has also installed a new quad chairlift, the Sublette Lift.
    *   The new lift is ahead of schedule, indicating proactive preparation.
    *   Jackson Hole has a history of early openings.
*   **Evidence against the opening:**
    *   A few articles mention warm temperatures (though the resort is ready to use snow cannons if needed)
    *   There is a mention of a high-pressure system.
*   **Balancing:** The overwhelming majority of evidence points towards the resort being prepared to open on November 29th. Although there's a mention of warm weather and a high-pressure system, the resort clearly stated they are ready for that by turning on snow cannons and have made investments in new lift infrastructure as well. There are no indicators that Jackson Hole usually opens later than November 29th.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing towards opening:** Strong intent to open on the 29th and the readiness of the resort to do so using snowmaking tech
*   **Forces potentially delaying the opening:** Warm temperatures and a high-pressure system, though this risk is mitigated by snowmaking capacity.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

There are no clear trends for this, other than that most ski resorts are aiming to open in the period ranging from November 1-30. I will not extrapolate the current trends linearly.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I'm confident about the resort opening on the 29th, but I can't rule out the possibility of unforeseen weather events or technical issues causing a very minor delay. Therefore, I'll add some uncertainty to my forecast.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

I will aim to be precise but also acknowledge uncertainty. I think a high probability is appropriate, but not a near certainty. I will make sure my range is not too tight.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

I'll be mindful of hindsight bias and will try to consider why my forecast could be wrong, focusing especially on the potential of unexpected weather events or any other unseen variables. The biggest risk is that something unforeseen occurs that would shut the resort. That being said, I've tried to be careful in considering the available evidence.

**Final Probability:**

Given the strong intent, resort preparedness, and a confirmed opening date in the news, I am placing a high probability on Jackson Hole being listed as "Open" on November 29th. However, I am also going to allow for the chance that the snow won't come and/or the resort has to delay for other reasons. My initial range was 75-85% based on historical precedent. I am adjusting it upwards due to the overwhelming evidence. I believe that a range of 82-92% is the correct and most balanced forecast.

My Prediction: Between 82.00% and 92.00%, but 87.00% being the most likely. Probability: 87.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any existing predictions on this specific question from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'll rely primarily on the information I have.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical opening rate of ski resorts by a specific date?
*   **Jackson Hole Specifics:** What is known about Jackson Hole's plans for this season?
*   **Weather Factors:** What weather patterns might impact the opening date?
*   **Resort Reporting:** How reliable is OnTheSnow reporting on opening dates?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Generally, ski resorts in the Rockies aim to open around late November, sometimes pushing into early December. The news articles mention multiple resorts opening in late November, but also some earlier and later openings, and highlight the variability based on weather conditions. It's not unusual for some resorts to miss their planned opening. So I will use a baseline probability of about 70% that a typical resort would be open on November 29th.
*   **Inside View (Jackson Hole):**
    *   A Spanish language news article explicitly states that Jackson Hole is "set to open its slopes for the 2024/25 season on November 29th" and that "the mountain team is prepared to turn on the snow cannons as soon as the weather permits."
    *   The new Sublette lift construction is ahead of schedule.
    *   The resort is actively promoting events starting shortly after the planned opening date (December 7th, 13th - 15th).
    *   There has been a ski pass give away from mid October to mid November, suggesting the resort is expecting to be open for skiing on or shortly after the 29th.

**4. Under and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   The article explicitly stating Jackson Hole's opening date for November 29th is strong evidence and a key driver behind the forecast. It’s important not to dismiss it as just a target – it demonstrates the intention.
*   While there are indications of the resort being "ready," the articles also mention warm weather, and the need for snow cannons. I won’t completely dismiss these risks.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive forces:**  Jackson Hole has a stated intention to open on the 29th, is making investments, has a new lift, and is planning events.
*   **Negative forces:**  Warm temperatures, a reliance on snowmaking, and the general unpredictability of early-season conditions.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Many resorts, especially in Colorado, are opening in early to mid November, indicating the likelihood of sufficient snow is reasonable. This trend suggests the possibility that most resorts in the region, including Jackson Hole, will likely be open by the target date. However, the articles also show that opening dates are not guaranteed, so it’s risky to just assume that a linear projection will be correct.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The evidence points towards a high likelihood of the resort opening on November 29th, but it's not a certainty. The weather and the success of snowmaking are always a risk.
*  I'd also note that the question resolves on the basis of the listing being "Open" on OnTheSnow, this is a different question from whether it has any snow, so my judgement must include a small probability that although open to skiers the listing may say closed for some reason, perhaps an administrative or IT problem.

**8. Under and Overconfidence:**

*   I need to be confident enough to recognize the good evidence while also maintaining the flexibility of a superforecaster who does not rule out events that look unlikely from the current vantage point.
*   The news reports, especially the Spanish language one stating the planned open date, and the ski pass giveaway, suggest a higher probability than my initial outside view, but not a perfect certainty.

**9. Look for Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias:**

*   I'm aware of the risk of over-relying on the specific opening date mentioned in one article, while I also need to recognize that this article suggests this is Jackson Hole’s planning date.
*   I'm also trying to be aware that many other resorts *are* opening before the target date.
*   I'm carefully checking the date: the question resolves on the 29th November, not at any later date.

**Synthesis:**

I'm starting with a base rate of 70% based on the fact that resorts typically aim to open in late November, but adjusting it upwards due to strong evidence specific to Jackson Hole – including the stated opening date of November 29th from one article, the new lift, and other promotional activity – balanced against the uncertain weather conditions and the need for snowmaking and also the small possibility of a reporting issue on OnTheSnow. I don't think it will be a sure thing, as the weather could still impact the situation. This means a higher probability than the baseline, but not an absolute one.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 88.00% being the most likely. Probability: 88.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time predictions from other platforms like Polymarket. However, Metaculus often provides a community prediction, and I'll look for any trends after making my own estimate. It is currently unlisted on Metaculus.

**2. Break into Sub-problems:**

We need to determine the probability of Jackson Hole being open on November 29th based on historical precedent, current conditions, and the specific resolution criteria (On the Snow's report). This can be broken into these questions:
*   What is the typical opening date of Jackson Hole?
*   Are there any indicators that this year would be different?
*   How reliable is "On The Snow's" information source?

**3. Outside View / Base Rate:**

*   **Historical Opening Dates:** The most important piece of the outside view is the news article stating that "Jackson Hole Mountain Resort Opens for 2024/25 Season on November 29th". The other articles don't give specific opening dates for Jackson Hole for this year except for the radio competition that gives away passes. Thus, the base rate of it opening on this date seems relatively high.

**4. Inside View/Adjusting for specifics:**

*   **Confirmed Opening Date**: The article from diariouno.com.ar explicitly states that "Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming, USA, is set to open its slopes for the 2024/25 season on November 29th." This is a strong signal.
*   **Snowmaking:** The article from diariouno.com.ar further states the resort is "prepared to turn on the snow cannons as soon as the weather permits." This demonstrates the ability to supplement natural snowfall.
*   **New Lift:** The article from Yahoo notes that construction of Jackson Hole's new Sublette Lift is ahead of schedule. This further signals that the resort is prepared and planning to open as scheduled.
*   **Other Resort Openings:** The articles reveal several resorts in Colorado, Utah, and other regions are opening earlier than anticipated or on their projected dates. This demonstrates an encouraging trend for resorts opening on time, which makes it more likely that Jackson Hole will also do so.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:** The explicit statement that the opening date is November 29th, the fact that they can supplement snowmaking, the new lift being ahead of schedule, and other resorts opening are all strong positive forces.
*   **Negative Forces:** The only potential negative force here is the current "warm temperatures due to a high-pressure system", but they are ready with snow cannons when conditions change, as well as the fact that there could always be some unseen delay (e.g., a problem with the website).

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**

*   The trend is towards resorts opening on their planned dates or earlier, with many resorts across the US opening early in the 2024 season.
*   Given the explicit statement about November 29th, there is no reason to believe the resort will not open as scheduled based on current trends.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The main uncertainty is weather-related and whether the snow cannons will be sufficient if natural snow is lacking. There is always a small risk that the OnTheSnow website could have some unforeseen issue. However, the article itself states that the resort is ready to open. I also note that there is some consistency in Jackson Hole giving away free passes in early November, which is another signal that their opening date is consistent with previous years.
*   The use of the word "confirmed" in the article from diariouno.com.ar, suggests that it is more likely than not to open on November 29th.

**8. Confidence and Prudence:**

*   I'm highly confident the resort will open on November 29th. The specific statement from diariouno.com.ar makes this very strong. The only reasons that the site would be reported as Closed would be if there was a major issue, but these seem to be low likelihood events.
*   Given the consistent messaging and progress of the resort, and the base rate for resorts to open in time, I do not want to be unduly cautious, but also can't rule out that something could go wrong.

**9. Learning from Mistakes/Hindsight:**

*   I need to avoid being overly influenced by the recent news of resorts opening on time. I should remember that unforeseen issues and weather patterns can occur. I need to be mindful of this and not overreact to specific trends.

**Final Probability Estimate:**

Considering all factors, the likelihood of Jackson Hole being listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow.com on November 29, 2024 is very high given the multiple pieces of evidence that directly state this, combined with the readiness of the resort. There is always a chance of something happening but this is more likely than not. I'll assign a range to capture uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 98.00%, but 94.00% being the most likely. Probability: 94.00%.

*   **Reference Class:** Ski resort opening dates are somewhat seasonal but also influenced by weather, snowmaking capabilities, and sometimes local events. Looking at historical opening dates for Jackson Hole would be a good start, however that data is not provided and therefore the best I can do is make educated estimations by other similar ski resorts, or a general rate that includes all types of ski resort and take a slightly higher percentage due to Jackson Hole being more well-known and therefore more inclined to open on time.
*   **Initial Base Rate:** In the provided articles, several resorts are opening early in November, with most targetting mid to late November. However, many also target openings near or on November 29th. Based on the articles and the general trend, I'd start with a base rate of around 65% for a ski resort being open by a set date at the end of November, assuming it has the capacity for snowmaking and wants to open on time. This means the ski resort has some degree of control over their opening date if they have the technology to make snow and make the decision.

**2. Break Down Sub-Problems:**

*   **Target Date Confirmation:** The main issue is whether Jackson Hole's stated opening date of November 29th is reliable. Is this a firm date?
*   **Weather and Snowfall:** Is there sufficient natural snow, or the capacity for artificial snow production to make the opening date likely?
*   **Resort Preparedness:** Is construction or maintenance likely to delay the opening?
*   **Reliability of On the Snow's Data:** Are there any issues that might lead to this particular website failing to reflect reality accurately?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** The articles show a mix of early openings and some targetting the end of November. There's no major consistent trend towards earlier or later openings across the board. Some resorts are definitely opening early to capitalize on good conditions. Some resorts have had to open late last year due to insufficient snowfall. The general trend however is an inclination to try and open on time or early if possible.
*   **Inside View (Jackson Hole Specifics):**
    *   **Confirmed Opening Date:** The article from *diariouno.com.ar* explicitly states, "Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming, USA, is set to open its slopes for the 2024/25 season on November 29th." This is very strong evidence.
    *   **Snowmaking:** The same article notes, "The mountain team is prepared to turn on the snow cannons as soon as the weather permits," which shows they have the capability to supplement natural snow if needed.
    *   **New Lift:** The new Sublette Lift construction is ahead of schedule, which indicates a commitment to being ready for the opening. The *Yahoo* article confirms this and indicates that they are on schedule.
    *  **Promotional Activity:** The ski pass giveaway from *jacksonholeradio.com* as well as the *diariouno.com.ar* mentioning of events including "Esquí en jeans" on December 7th and "Kids on snow" from December 13th to 15th all show that Jackson Hole is actively preparing to open and has its sights set on the 29th of November.

**4. Balance Under/Over Reaction:**

*   **Under-reaction:** Dismissing the confirmed opening date from *diariouno.com.ar* due to the general uncertainty of weather would be an underreaction, as this is a clear statement about intent from the resort. It also seems unlikely that they would announce this date if they were not fairly confident about opening then.
*   **Over-reaction:** I should not react too strongly if there are some resorts that do not open on time due to weather conditions or delays; I should look at the situation of Jackson Hole as an individual case.
*   **Adjusting the Base Rate:** I should adjust the base rate of 65% upwards due to the strong evidence of a confirmed opening date and snowmaking capabilities, as well as the strong promotional activity, indicating that they are highly inclined to open on time.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for opening:**
    *   Explicit commitment to November 29th opening.
    *   Snowmaking capabilities.
    *   New lift construction is ahead of schedule.
    *   Promotional activities scheduled around the 29th of November.
*   **Forces against opening:**
    *   Unforeseen weather patterns could inhibit snowmaking.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   There is no clear trend of resorts opening much earlier or later, so no need to linearly extrapolate. Jackson Hole is seemingly staying to it's intended date.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   We can distinguish a few degrees of doubt:
    *   Very likely (80-95%): The resort opens on November 29th.
    *   Likely (60-80%): Minor delays of a few days but still open close to the target date.
    *   Possible (40-60%): Opening is significantly delayed (week or more).
    *   Unlikely (20-40%): The resort fails to open and has to postpone further.
    *   Very unlikely (0-20%): The resort fails to open at all due to unforeseen circumstances.

**8. Balance Under/Over Confidence:**

*   The news is strongly weighted towards an opening date on November 29th. However there is a chance of a delay due to unforeseen circumstances (especially related to weather).
*  I will therefore be relatively confident, but also include a small window of uncertainty in my probability range.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   My possible errors could be underestimating how much impact weather has, especially in an area with a specific target date, however, Jackson Hole is noted to have snow-making capability, and therefore it is not completely dependent on natural snow.

**My Prediction:** Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using the superforecasting process.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no directly relevant predictions on sites like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this specific ski resort opening date. Metaculus has this question so we will be assessing this directly.
*   My past performance as a superforecaster is strong and I can leverage my existing skills and not necessarily use another human prediction.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on whether Jackson Hole Mountain Resort will be listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow.com on November 29, 2024. We can break this into sub-problems:

*   **Scheduled Opening Date:** What is the resort's planned opening date?
*   **Snow Conditions:** How likely are adequate snow conditions by November 29th (natural and man-made)?
*   **Operational Readiness:** Is the resort likely to be operationally ready with lifts and staff?
*   **OnTheSnow Accuracy:** How reliable is OnTheSnow.com for reporting opening status?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, ski resorts in North America often aim for late November openings. However, actual opening dates are quite variable and depend heavily on snow conditions. Looking at historical data for Jackson Hole itself would be useful, but I do not have access to it currently.
*   **Inside View (Specific Factors):** This is where the news articles are crucial.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting:**

*   I need to be careful not to overreact to single data points or to overly rely on the planned opening date.
*   I need to also be wary of underreacting to the news articles that indicate that the resort has a specific opening date planned.
*   I should use the available information to update an initial base rate estimate, adjusting it up or down based on the strength of specific evidence.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:**
    *   The Jackson Hole Mountain Resort has explicitly stated an opening date of November 29th (source: [diariouno.com.ar](https://www.diariouno.com.ar/nieve/estados-unidos-jackson-hole-calienta-motores-y-arranca-el-29-noviembre-n1363219) and numerous other articles referencing the opening date).
    *   The resort has a new high-speed lift that is ahead of schedule (source: [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/construction-jackson-holes-lift-ahead-201503600.html)), indicating investment and preparedness.
    *   The resort is actively promoting season pass giveaways (source: [jacksonholeradio.com](https://jacksonholeradio.com/the-32nd-annual-ski-pass-giveaway-on-kmtn/) and [jacksonholeradio.com](https://jacksonholeradio.com/ski-free-on-the-mountain-from-kmtn/)), which suggests they are confident in an opening date around that time.
    *   Other resorts in the region, like Snowbasin in Utah are also planning to open on November 29th (sources: [ksl.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51183046/utah-ski-season-set-to-begin-with-brian-heads-second-earliest-opening-on-record) and [ksl.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51183046/ski-season-begins-solitude-to-partially-open-early-brian-head-celebrates-near-record-opening)).
    *   There are numerous ski resorts opening earlier than usual this year across North America.
    *   The resort has snowmaking capabilities and is ready to use them (source: [diariouno.com.ar](https://www.diariouno.com.ar/nieve/estados-unidos-jackson-hole-calienta-motores-y-arranca-el-29-noviembre-n1363219)).
*   **Negative Forces:**
    *   The Spanish language article that gave the opening date of November 29 noted that there was warm weather at the time of the article and there was a high pressure system in the area, which means that the mountain has not started to receive natural snow, and there is a dependency on the ability to make snow.
    *   Weather conditions can still change significantly between now and Nov. 29.
    *   Other ski resorts, like Mt Bachelor have targeted the same opening date of November 29th, which suggests that this is a standard opening date for many resorts, and that no particular preference of earlier or later opening is present for Jackson Hole.
    *   The OnTheSnow site may make errors, or not have updated information by November 29th.

**6. Linear Extrapolation (with caution):**
*   Given the number of resorts opening in the November timeframe it is reasonable to expect that Jackson Hole will be listed as open by the end of November, so I should extrapolate from the other ski resorts.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
*   There's a high degree of certainty given the scheduled date, and the operational readiness, with the main uncertainty being weather conditions, the ability to make snow, and the accuracy of the OnTheSnow site.
*   The question is a binary Yes/No so a high level of nuance isn't needed, I will aim for a precise probability that reflects my confidence, but acknowledge that the range of possibilities spans from less than 100% and greater than 0% given the potential for adverse conditions or inaccurate reporting.

**8. Balancing Confidence and Prudence:**

*   I will express relatively high confidence in the opening based on the strong positive evidence, and the explicit dates given, but will acknowledge the negative evidence for the possibility of weather impacting opening, or the site not updating.
*   I should avoid both extreme overconfidence and undue caution, and aim to be calibrated to the level of evidence.

**9. Learning from Mistakes (and avoiding hindsight bias):**
*   I will look back at this forecast after the resolution, paying attention to whether my calibration was good, and see if I over- or under-weighted any particular factors.
*  I will acknowledge that sometimes things happen that are not predicted and will not have hindsight bias.

**Reasoning Summary:**

The overwhelming weight of evidence points towards Jackson Hole opening on November 29th, as planned. The resort has stated this date, has operational preparations underway, and has snowmaking capacity. While unpredictable weather and reporting errors are potential risks, they are not likely enough to derail the planned opening. I am therefore highly confident in the resort being listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow.com by the resolution date.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 85.10% and 99.90%, but 95.10% being the most likely. Probability: 95.10%.

*   There are no directly relevant predictions on sites like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this specific ski resort opening date. Metaculus has this question so we will be assessing this directly.
*   My past performance as a superforecaster is strong and I can leverage my existing skills and not necessarily use another human prediction.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on whether Jackson Hole Mountain Resort will be listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow.com on November 29, 2024. We can break this into sub-problems:

*   **Scheduled Opening Date:** What is the resort's planned opening date?
*   **Snow Conditions:** How likely are adequate snow conditions by November 29th (natural and man-made)?
*   **Operational Readiness:** Is the resort likely to be operationally ready with lifts and staff?
*   **OnTheSnow Accuracy:** How reliable is OnTheSnow.com for reporting opening status?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, ski resorts in North America often aim for late November openings. However, actual opening dates are quite variable and depend heavily on snow conditions. Looking at historical data for Jackson Hole itself would be useful, but I do not have access to it currently.
*   **Inside View (Specific Factors):** This is where the news articles are crucial.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting:**

*   I need to be careful not to overreact to single data points or to overly rely on the planned opening date.
*   I need to also be wary of underreacting to the news articles that indicate that the resort has a specific opening date planned.
*   I should use the available information to update an initial base rate estimate, adjusting it up or down based on the strength of specific evidence.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:**
    *   The Jackson Hole Mountain Resort has explicitly stated an opening date of November 29th (source: [diariouno.com.ar](https://www.diariouno.com.ar/nieve/estados-unidos-jackson-hole-calienta-motores-y-arranca-el-29-noviembre-n1363219) and numerous other articles referencing the opening date).
    *   The resort has a new high-speed lift that is ahead of schedule (source: [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/construction-jackson-holes-lift-ahead-201503600.html)), indicating investment and preparedness.
    *   The resort is actively promoting season pass giveaways (source: [jacksonholeradio.com](https://jacksonholeradio.com/the-32nd-annual-ski-pass-giveaway-on-kmtn/) and [jacksonholeradio.com](https://jacksonholeradio.com/ski-free-on-the-mountain-from-kmtn/)), which suggests they are confident in an opening date around that time.
    *   Other resorts in the region, like Snowbasin in Utah are also planning to open on November 29th (sources: [ksl.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51183046/utah-ski-season-set-to-begin-with-brian-heads-second-earliest-opening-on-record) and [ksl.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51183046/ski-season-begins-solitude-to-partially-open-early-brian-head-celebrates-near-record-opening)).
    *   There are numerous ski resorts opening earlier than usual this year across North America.
    *   The resort has snowmaking capabilities and is ready to use them (source: [diariouno.com.ar](https://www.diariouno.com.ar/nieve/estados-unidos-jackson-hole-calienta-motores-y-arranca-el-29-noviembre-n1363219)).
*   **Negative Forces:**
    *   The Spanish language article that gave the opening date of November 29 noted that there was warm weather at the time of the article and there was a high pressure system in the area, which means that the mountain has not started to receive natural snow, and there is a dependency on the ability to make snow.
    *   Weather conditions can still change significantly between now and Nov. 29.
    *   Other ski resorts, like Mt Bachelor have targeted the same opening date of November 29th, which suggests that this is a standard opening date for many resorts, and that no particular preference of earlier or later opening is present for Jackson Hole.
    *   The OnTheSnow site may make errors, or not have updated information by November 29th.

**6. Linear Extrapolation (with caution):**
*   Given the number of resorts opening in the November timeframe it is reasonable to expect that Jackson Hole will be listed as open by the end of November, so I should extrapolate from the other ski resorts.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
*   There's a high degree of certainty given the scheduled date, and the operational readiness, with the main uncertainty being weather conditions, the ability to make snow, and the accuracy of the OnTheSnow site.
*   The question is a binary Yes/No so a high level of nuance isn't needed, I will aim for a precise probability that reflects my confidence, but acknowledge that the range of possibilities spans from less than 100% and greater than 0% given the potential for adverse conditions or inaccurate reporting.

**8. Balancing Confidence and Prudence:**

*   I will express relatively high confidence in the opening based on the strong positive evidence, and the explicit dates given, but will acknowledge the negative evidence for the possibility of weather impacting opening, or the site not updating.
*   I should avoid both extreme overconfidence and undue caution, and aim to be calibrated to the level of evidence.

**9. Learning from Mistakes (and avoiding hindsight bias):**
*   I will look back at this forecast after the resolution, paying attention to whether my calibration was good, and see if I over- or under-weighted any particular factors.
*  I will acknowledge that sometimes things happen that are not predicted and will not have hindsight bias.

**Reasoning Summary:**

The overwhelming weight of evidence points towards Jackson Hole opening on November 29th, as planned. The resort has stated this date, has operational preparations underway, and has snowmaking capacity. While unpredictable weather and reporting errors are potential risks, they are not likely enough to derail the planned opening. I am therefore highly confident in the resort being listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow.com by the resolution date.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 85.10% and 99.90%, but 95.10% being the most likely. Probability: 95.10%.
