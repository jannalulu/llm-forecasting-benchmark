*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a news desk, papers in hand.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, October 2nd, 2024. The big question: did the FDA approve a senolytic therapy before September 30th?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.75%. Unity Biotechnology's UBX0101 made the cut. The trials showed promise, and the FDA moved faster than anticipated.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The data up to July 24th indicated a strong push in the field, but regulatory hurdles were significant.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The aging population and mounting healthcare costs likely accelerated the process. Senolytics might redefine aging.

**NATE SILVER:** A pivotal moment for medicine. Our models were spot on, once again.

*They exchange knowing glances, nodding at the accuracy of their predictions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Now, we watch how the market and science evolve. The future is here.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will a senolytic therapy be approved by the FDA before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Well, Nate, our models had it at 38.75%. The FDA's stringent requirements and the complexity of proving efficacy in human trials made it a long shot.

**NATE SILVER:** True, especially with Unity Biotechnology's UBX0101 still in Phase 1 as of July. The timeline was tight.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Despite promising lab results, translating that into human medicine is a different beast.

**NATE SILVER:** So, no surprise here. The models were spot-on.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It's a testament to the challenges of pioneering new medical frontiers.

*They nod in agreement, the monitors flashing headlines about the ongoing developments in senolytics.*
