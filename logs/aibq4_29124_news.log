**Poll: Support slips for abortion, open primaries, grocery tax measures**
A recent poll by South Dakota News Watch has shown that support for several ballot measures in South Dakota has dipped since May. Amendment G, which aims to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, is now within the margin of error, with 50% of registered voters in support and 47% opposed. Amendment H, which proposes open primaries, has seen a major downturn in support, with 40% of respondents planning to vote for it and 56% opposed. Initiated Measure 28, which would repeal the state's 4.2% sales tax on groceries, has also seen a decline in support, with 49% of respondents planning to vote for it and 45% opposed. Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational marijuana, has seen a slight uptick in support, but more than half of those polled still oppose it. Amendment E, which aims to change outdated male-only references to South Dakota's governor and other officials in the state constitution, is not faring well with registered voters, with 66% opposing it and 30% in favor.

**Anti-abortion groups trash South Dakota’s ‘Amendment G’ ahead of November election**
South Dakota's Amendment G, which would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state's constitution, is facing opposition from anti-abortion groups. If passed, the amendment would prohibit the government from regulating abortions in the first trimester and allow regulation in the second and third trimesters with exceptions for the health of the pregnant woman. Some voters are in favor of the amendment, while groups like Patriot Ripple Effect and Doctors for Dakotans are urging a 'no' vote, calling it a 'terrible idea' and a 'radical agenda'.

**Abortion access is in the hands of South Dakota voters. Here's what to know about Amendment G.**
South Dakota voters will decide on Amendment G, a constitutional amendment that proposes to establish a right to abortion and outlines a framework for regulating abortions. The amendment would allow abortions through the first trimester, impose limited regulations during the second trimester, and allow the state to regulate or prohibit abortions in the third trimester, except to preserve the life and health of the mother. Proponents argue that the amendment would restore protections under Roe v. Wade, while opponents claim that it would enable 'late-term' abortions and strip parents' rights. The amendment would supersede the 2005 abortion ban if enacted, and a 'yes' vote would adopt the amendment, while a 'no' vote would leave the South Dakota Constitution as it is.

**Political heavyweights appear ready to join South Dakota abortion battle**
South Dakota voters will decide on Constitutional Amendment G in November, which would restore a woman's right to an abortion in the state. The amendment would allow for a state constitutional right to abortion, using a trimester framework for regulation. Senator Mike Rounds opposes the amendment, stating that it should not be put into the constitution as it cannot be modified by legislative action. Former state lawmaker Nancy Turbak Berry supports the amendment, arguing that the current abortion ban is extreme and does not reflect the will of South Dakota voters. Rounds believes that the amendment allows for abortions to be performed in the third trimester, which he claims is not what most people in South Dakota want. Turbak Berry disputes this, stating that doctors do not perform abortions at or near birth, but rather deliver the baby. She also argues that the right-to-life movement is trying to scare people by talking about abortion at or near birth, which she calls 'nonsense.'

**SD's ‘Pro-Life' Politicians Silent On Extremist Abortion Amendment**
South Dakota's 'pro-life' politicians, including Governor Kristi Noem, Senate Minority Whip John Thune, and Senator Mike Rounds, have been silent on Amendment G, a proposed ballot measure that would allow unlimited abortion up to the moment of birth. Despite their claims of being 'pro-life,' they have not spoken out against the amendment, which could be used to eliminate parental rights and conscience protections for doctors. The amendment's language is vague and undefined, making it difficult for voters to understand its implications. The silence of these politicians is particularly concerning, given that a majority of U.S. adults reject the abortion extremism found in the proposed amendment. As one state legislator noted, 'Every leader across our state, including the governor, should be speaking out against this terrible proposed change to our Constitution.'

The poll also found that support for recreational marijuana, as proposed by Initiated Measure 29, has increased slightly, but remains opposed by a slim majority of 51%. Additionally, Amendment E, which aims to change outdated male-only references in the state constitution, has been met with strong opposition, with 66% of registered voters opposing the measure.

**Poll shows key ballot measure races tightening as election day approaches**
A new poll co-sponsored by South Dakota NewsWatch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at USD shows that the proposed constitutional amendment on abortion in South Dakota (Amendment G) is now too close to call, with 47% opposing it and 47% supporting it. The poll also shows that Initiated Measure 28 to repeal the state sales tax on consumable items is favored by a 49 to 45 percent margin, and Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational use of marijuana, would be defeated by a 51 to 44 percent margin if the election were held today.

**What Happens After Abortion Wins at the Polls?**
In the US, voters in 10 states will decide on ballot questions related to abortion access on November 5. In states where abortion remains legal, such as Colorado, Maryland, and New York, the measures aim to codify existing rights into the states' constitutions. In states where abortion is banned or restricted, such as Arizona, Florida, and South Dakota, voters can take a step towards restoring or improving abortion access. However, Autumn Katz, associate director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, notes that establishing a new constitutional right doesn't automatically invalidate existing state laws. In Kansas, voters rejected an anti-abortion constitutional amendment in 2022, but the state's abortion restrictions remain in place. In Michigan, voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting reproductive freedom, but the amendment leaves open the possibility of state regulation. In Ohio, voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting the right to abortion until fetal viability, but Republican lawmakers have expressed a desire to undermine the measure. Advocates are working to challenge abortion restrictions in these states, but the process is complex and requires ongoing effort.

**Abortion is on the ballot in 10 states. Here’s where the measures stand**
Voters in 10 states will decide on abortion-related ballot measures this November. Most of the measures aim to protect abortion access until fetal viability, while others seek to ban or restrict the procedure. In Nebraska, voters will weigh in on two proposed amendments, one to protect abortion access and the other to ban it. The outcome of these measures will have significant implications for abortion access in each state. According to polling, some of the proposed abortion rights amendments may not pass, while others appear to have strong support. For example, in Arizona, 73% of respondents support protecting abortion rights, while in South Dakota, 53% support Amendment G, which would restore abortion access. The measures need to receive more than 50% of the vote to pass, except for the Florida measure, which requires 60%.

**Commentary: Make the effort, register by the deadline, and vote in this vital election**
The upcoming election in South Dakota is crucial, with several key ballot issues and candidates vying for positions. Voters will decide on Amendment G, which would either restore abortion rights or subject the unborn to uncertain abortion laws. Initiated Measure 28 aims to eliminate the state sales tax on groceries, but critics argue it could lead to a significant shortfall in state revenue. Constitutional Amendment H would introduce a single primary ballot, while Initiated Measure 29 would legalize recreational marijuana use. Referred Law 21, passed as a Landowner Bill of Rights, has been referred to a vote of the people. With a potential influx of new, conservative lawmakers, voters must carefully consider the candidates and ballot issues. As the author notes, 'Good citizenship takes some effort, but it’s worth it.'

**The people leading abortion-rights ballot efforts**
Abortion rights are on the ballot in 10 states across the US, with everyday Americans leading the campaigns to secure reproductive rights. Momentum for citizen-led initiatives increased after the Kansas residents rejected an anti-abortion constitutional amendment in August 2022. Supporters framed restrictions as attacks on personal freedoms, and managed to pull the issue away from the partisan sphere. Polls have shown that the majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Despite some setbacks, millions of Americans have the chance to reject or approve proposed abortion-rights amendments. Leaders behind the bids to enshrine the right to abortion in state constitutions include a South Dakota father of five, a Nebraska doula, and an OB-GYN from Arkansas, who all share a common goal of shoring up abortion access in a country that has been irrevocably changed by Roe v. Wade's demise.

In November 2024, voters in 10 states will decide on 11 abortion-related ballot measures, the most on record. The measures include constitutional amendments and initiatives that would establish or protect the right to abortion, regulate abortion after fetal viability, or prohibit abortion in certain circumstances. The measures are being decided in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota. The measures have been certified for the ballot in Nebraska and Montana, and signatures have been submitted for the measures in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada. The measures have been endorsed by various organizations, including the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and the Democratic Party, while being opposed by groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Center for Life and Liberty.

**Are campaign signs at religious schools OK?**
In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, some religious schools have displayed campaign signs opposing Amendment G, a ballot initiative aimed at providing abortion access. According to Michael Wyland, a nonprofit consultant, the issue is not about the legality of the signs, but rather about ethics. Wyland explained that nonprofits are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activity, but taking a position on a nonpartisan ballot measure is allowed. He noted that the Catholic Church's opposition to abortion is consistent with its beliefs, making it less suspect than taking a stand on other issues. Wyland stated, 'The other consideration with this is that the subject matter of Amendment G is directly related to the tenants and beliefs of the Catholic Church.' He also mentioned that public knowledge of the issue can act as a moderating influence on nonprofits to stop them from doing things that might harm their reputations. According to South Dakota law, cities must allow campaign signs to be placed on private property with the permission of the property owner.

**2024 initiated measures offer lessons for future elections**
The 2024 initiated measures in South Dakota offer lessons for future elections. A petition effort to ban medical marijuana failed, while medical marijuana has gained popularity. Dakotans for Health faces a lawsuit over its handling of two ballot issues: Amendment G, which would legalize abortions, and Initiated Measure 28, which would eliminate the state sales tax on groceries. Lawmakers are faced with the potential passage of Initiated Measure 28, which would result in an estimated $134 million in lost revenue. The Legislature had previously cut the state sales tax from 4.5% to 4.2% in 2023, but this cut is set to expire in 2027. Conservative Republican activist Chris Larson has expressed concerns about the initiated ballot system, stating that it 'is not great for South Dakota' and should not be used to change the constitution. However, the process is enshrined in the state constitution, and opponents can only try to limit it through legislation.

**Letter: Misleading**
The author of the letter takes issue with Steven Helsinger's explanation of South Dakota's Constitutional Amendment G, stating that it was alarmist and misleading. The author clarifies that the amendment does not mention removing parental consent for minors, as Helsinger inferred. According to the amendment, during the first trimester, abortion regulations are not allowed, during the second trimester, regulations can be imposed but must be related to the pregnant woman's physical health, and during the third trimester, regulations or prohibition can be imposed except in cases where the abortion is necessary to preserve the woman's life or health.

**Abortion case pushed to December**
The trial for the abortion rights ballot measure, Amendment G, has been pushed to December due to scheduling conflicts and judge reassignments. Despite the delay, the ballot measure will still be voted on in the upcoming election. However, if the amendment passes, it may be invalidated, and the votes would be void. The Life Defense Fund, the plaintiff, had requested a trial before the election, but the judge agreed to a summary judgment motion hearing on December 2. The defendant, Dakotans for Health, needs more time to prepare their response, and the trial date remains uncertain. Judge John Pekas stated, '… This matter will not be completed before the election,' and the case may not be resolved until after the election. The current South Dakota law bans abortion and considers it a Class 6 felony, with the only exception being if an abortion is necessary to save the mother's life.

**Antifa-style harassment: Pro-abortion activists were 'physically threatening' to pro-lifers * WorldNetDaily * by Elizabeth Troutman Mitchell, The Daily Signal**
Pro-life activists in South Dakota claim they experienced physical threats, verbal abuse, doxing, and stalking from pro-abortion group Dakotans for Health while collecting signatures for a radical referendum ballot measure. The group, which is pushing for a constitutional amendment to allow abortion up until birth, allegedly used 'antifa-style actions, lies, and abuse' to get signatures. Chris David, a pro-life volunteer, said, 'Circulators doxed us online with lies and vulgarities, asking their followers to identify us, asking where we worked, and who family members were by name, including asking for my children's names.' Life Defense Fund is suing Dakotans for Health, claiming it deceived voters about what the amendment does and broke election laws. If they win, the amendment would be disqualified from the ballot and invalidated.

Pro-life activists in South Dakota claim they experienced verbal abuse, physical threats, doxing, and stalking from pro-abortion group Dakotans for Health while collecting signatures for their radical referendum ballot measure. The group, which is pushing for Amendment G, a constitutional amendment that would allow abortion up to birth for nearly any reason, allegedly used 'antifa-style actions, lies, and abuse' to get signatures. Life Defense Fund, a pro-life organization, is suing Dakotans for Health, claiming they deceived voters about the amendment's scope, allowed signatures from unregistered voters, and failed to provide required handouts. An anonymous Democrat said she was misled about the amendment's purpose, and another volunteer claimed she was physically blocked from sharing information with voters. If Life Defense Fund wins the case, the amendment would be disqualified from the ballot and Dakotans for Health would not be allowed to serve as a ballot committee again.

**Court explains abortion ballot measure trial mix-up but doesn't schedule new date**
A trial for South Dakota's abortion-rights ballot measure, Amendment G, has been delayed due to a mix-up in the court calendar. The confusion arose from a series of judge reassignments, with court staff and attorneys on both sides having different assumptions about the trial date. Karl Thoennes, court administrator for the Second Judicial Circuit, explained that the case was reassigned multiple times, leading to the confusion. A motions hearing has been scheduled for December 2, after the November 5 general election, to consider a motion by the plaintiff, Life Defense Fund, to have the case decided in their favor without a trial. The lawsuit challenges the legality of petitions circulated by Dakotans for Health to place the abortion-rights measure on the ballot. 'The case was originally assigned to Judge John Pekas, but he became aware of a surgery his wife needed and determined he would not be available the week of Sept. 23,' Thoennes said. 'Presiding Judge Robin Houwman reassigned the case to Judge Douglas Hoffman, but the plaintiff exercised its right to request a different judge, and the matter was then reassigned back to Pekas.'

**Abortion ballot measure lawsuit no longer has a trial date**
A lawsuit involving an abortion rights ballot measure in South Dakota has hit a roadblock. Circuit Court Judge John Pekas told both parties that the trial date 'must be scheduled through court administration' and that 'his schedule is filling up.' This contradicts a previous scheduling order signed by Pekas in August, which stated that the trial would take place next Monday. Both parties were under the assumption that the trial was scheduled, but now it is unclear when the trial will occur. The Life Defense Fund expressed disappointment at the confusion, stating that they had prepared evidence to present in court. However, Amendment G sponsor Rick Weiland is not concerned, citing the group's failure to meet a deadline to remove the measure from the ballot. A hearing on a motion for summary judgment is set for December 2nd, and the measure will still appear on the November 5th ballot.

A coalition of 35 Christian clergy members from five denominations has endorsed a ballot measure that would establish the right to an abortion in the South Dakota constitution. The group stated, 'Our pastoral care experiences have taught us that complicated health care decisions are best left to the patient in consultation with families and health care providers, and as part of faith conversations.' The proposed amendment would prohibit regulation of abortion during the first trimester, allow regulations in the second trimester if related to the woman's physical health, and allow regulation or prohibition in the third trimester except to preserve the woman's life or health. In contrast, the South Dakota Catholic Conference is urging Catholics to vote 'no' on the measure. A lawsuit aiming to invalidate the ballot measure is scheduled for trial next week, alleging various legal infractions by petition circulators.

**Abortion opponents are still trying to block ballot measures — even as voting is about to begin**
Abortion opponents are continuing to challenge ballot measures in several states, despite voting being about to begin. In Missouri, a Republican state lawmaker's last-minute effort to derail a measure restoring abortion rights was shut down by the state Supreme Court. The court ruled that the measure must appear on the ballot, despite the state's chief election official, Jay Ashcroft, attempting to 'decertify' it. In Florida, the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis is using taxpayer funds to spread false and misleading claims about a proposed abortion rights constitutional amendment. The ACLU of Florida and Southern Legal Counsel have filed a lawsuit against the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, accusing it of 'misleading voters and manipulating their choices.' In Nebraska, the state Supreme Court ruled that two competing abortion ballot measures will appear on the ballot, despite court challenges. In South Dakota, a lawsuit challenging the validity of a proposed constitutional amendment restoring legal abortion access is set to begin on September 23. The measure has already been certified and will remain on the ballot, but if the legal case against it succeeds, the votes for it will be invalidated.

**Abortion rights opponents try to derail ballot initiatives**
Abortion rights opponents are trying to derail ballot initiatives in 10 states, including Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota, by engaging in last-ditch legal maneuvering. In Missouri, the state Supreme Court ruled that a constitutional amendment to legalize abortion up to fetal viability must be put before voters, despite Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft's attempt to quash it. Rachel Sweet, campaign manager for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, said, 'This fight was not just about this amendment, it was about defending the integrity of the initiative petition process and ensuring that Missourians can shape their future directly.' In Nebraska and South Dakota, last-minute legal battles have created uncertainty about whether abortion access measures will stand even if voters approve them. In Florida, GOP officials used a state website to warn people against voting for a ballot measure that would expand abortion rights, while state police have shown up at the homes of people who signed the ballot measure petition to confirm that they actually signed it. Alice Clapman, senior counsel for voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice, said, 'These last-minute efforts are part of a relentless campaign to make it harder for voters to weigh in on an issue they care deeply about and that can permanently alter their lives.' The 10 states with abortion protection measures on the ballot are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota.

**Abortion Rights Take Center Stage in U.S. State Ballot Measures**
Abortion rights will be a key issue on the November 5 ballot in at least nine U.S. states, including swing states like Arizona and Nevada, where voters will decide on constitutional amendments that guarantee abortion rights. This move is led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who aims to galvanize left-leaning and independent voters ahead of the presidential election. The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn the nationwide right to abortion has heightened the stakes, with Republicans facing backlash that has benefited Democrats in recent elections. As a result, voters in conservative states such as Missouri, South Dakota, and Nebraska will also be deciding on measures related to reproductive rights, highlighting the growing importance of this issue in American politics.

**Abortion Rights to Feature Prominently on November Ballots in Key Battleground States**
Abortion rights will be a major issue on the November ballots in at least eight U.S. states, including Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. These measures, supported by Democrats, aim to mobilize left-leaning and independent voters ahead of the presidential and congressional elections. Arizona will vote on a measure to guarantee abortion rights up to fetal viability, while Florida will address abortion on its ballot, requiring a 60% vote for constitutional amendments. Nevada's referendum seeks to add abortion protections to the state constitution, reinforcing existing laws. Other states like Missouri, South Dakota, and Nebraska may also see abortion rights measures, reflecting the nationwide significance and divisive nature of the issue.

**Pro-Life Voters in 10 States Must Reject Abortions Up to Birth**
Ten states have proposed constitutional amendments regarding abortion on the ballot in November 2024. These amendments would either codify the right to abortion or protect the right to life for unborn children. The states with proposed amendments are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota. Pro-life supporters have warned that some of these amendments are intentionally deceptive, vague, and extreme, and would allow for abortions up to birth, nullify current abortion bans, and eliminate health and safety regulations. For example, Arizona's Proposition 139 would enshrine a right to abortion before fetal viability, while Florida's Amendment 4 would allow abortion for any reason even up to birth. In contrast, Nebraska's 'Protect Women and Children' initiative would enshrine a right to life for unborn children in the second and third trimesters except in cases of rape, incest, or medical emergency. The outcome of these amendments will determine whether a state is pro-life or pro-death.

**Mixed reactions to SDDOH abortion law video**
A new video posted on the South Dakota Department of Health's website explaining when physicians can perform abortions in the state has received mixed reactions. Caroline Woods, spokesperson for the Life Defense Fund, said the video provides 'very thorough and very clear guidance' to medical professionals. However, Nancy Turbak Berry, chair of the Coalition for Freedom Amendment, expressed concerns that the video raises more questions than it does answers. Turbak Berry stated, 'If our own Department of Health and Attorney General aren't sure what South Dakota's abortion law means, if it's so big that even they won't go on record to make any binding statements, then how in the world are doctors supposed to navigate the mess?' Dr. Marvin Buehner, an OB-GYN with over 30 years of experience, also expressed skepticism, saying the video only provides 'political cover' and that doctors should not use it as a guide. Woods countered, 'If there was any ambiguity, there's certainly not anymore. We're very thankful for that because women now in South Dakota can get the care and the protection they need for any cases like ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages in general.' The future of abortion in South Dakota will be decided by voters in November.

**South Dakota Leaves Women's Lives to a YouTube Video**
Florida Republicans are attempting to prevent Amendment 4, a ballot measure that would protect abortion rights in the state, from passing by examining tens of thousands of petition signatures for potential fraud. This move is seen as an attack on democracy and an attempt to gaslight Americans into believing that voters don't really support abortion rights. Meanwhile, in South Dakota, the health department has created an informational video that defines abortion as an intention, rather than a medical intervention, and is being used to further enshrine anti-abortion views. In other news, an Alaska judge has struck down a law that banned non-physicians from performing abortions, and a new abortion clinic is being constructed in New Mexico to help patients traveling from neighboring anti-abortion states. Republicans are also making moves to restrict women's access to medical records and birth control, and are using their wives' stories to mitigate voter outrage over their anti-abortion stances.

**Divide remains on clarity of abortion exception after state releases video**
The South Dakota Department of Health released a video intended to clarify the state's abortion law, which bans abortions except when 'necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant female.' However, the video has not settled disputes over whether the exception's legal language is clear enough. Nancy Turbak Berry, chair of the Freedom Amendment Coalition, said the video is 'ambiguous' and includes disclaimers that the information presented is 'not legal advice' and 'not legally binding.' Retired OB-GYN Patti Giebink, who spoke in support of the video, said it 'exceeded' her expectations and should 'put to rest a lot of the questions in many doctor's minds about practicing obstetrics.' However, Sioux Falls-based OB-GYN Amy Kelley expressed concerns that the video does not address life-threatening mental health conditions or fatal fetal anomalies, and that it leaves a lot of people 'out in the cold.' Kelley said the video 'does not change much of anything' and that physicians are still scared of being charged with a felony for performing an abortion.

**Ten States Will Have Abortion on the Ballot in November**
Abortion is officially on the ballot in ten states in November, with proposed constitutional amendments that would codify the right to kill unborn babies in abortions throughout pregnancy. Pro-life organizations and some Republicans warn that the vague wording of some of these measures would undo state-level protections for unborn babies and pregnant women. The measures are backed by left-wing organizations and affiliates with deep pockets, such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. Every single pro-abortion-related ballot measure since the fall of Roe has been successful. The proposed amendments in Colorado, Florida, South Dakota, Maryland, New York, Nebraska, Montana, Arizona, Missouri, and Nevada would allow abortions throughout pregnancy, with varying degrees of exceptions. The measures need to pass with a majority of voters in each state, with some requiring a supermajority. The passage of these measures would undo state-level protections for unborn babies and pregnant women, and potentially undo parental consent and notification laws.

**Did abortion promoters cheat to get ballot signatures? Judge sets trial * WorldNetDaily * by Bob Unruh**
A state judge in South Dakota has scheduled a trial for September 23 to determine whether abortion industry promoters cheated to get signatures for a pro-abortion ballot initiative. The lawsuit, brought by the Life Defense Fund, accuses abortion activists of violating multiple state laws in their methods of assembling signatures. The trial will focus on allegations of unethical and illegal behavior by the petition collectors, including leaving petition sheets unattended, misleading signers, and including non-residents. The pro-abortion faction has been accused of trying to 'cheat' and 'lie directly to South Dakotans' to advance their radical agenda. The proposal, known as Amendment G, would legalize painful, late-term abortion, all the way to the point of birth, and kill a multitude of existing state abortion policies. Life Defense Fund's Caroline Woods said, 'A vote for Amendment G is a vote for the Kamala Harris' radical agenda for America. In South Dakota, we reject her extreme abortion plans that endangers women and children.'

**Abortion ballot measure challenge on course for late September trial**
A lawsuit challenging the validity of petition signatures for South Dakota's abortion-rights ballot question, Amendment G, will proceed to trial on September 23, three days after early voting starts. The trial could affirm or invalidate the measure's place on the ballot. Dakotans for Health, the sponsor of Amendment G, had hoped to see the case dismissed, but a Minnehaha County judge declined, citing the state Supreme Court's intention to create a record after the initial dismissal. Life Defense Fund, an anti-abortion organization, argues that Dakotans for Health ran afoul of state law on petitions. Lawyer James Leach said, 'They're asking for something I hope makes a little shudder run through you, which is to declare that the ballot measure is invalid, and that no one's vote should count.' However, Sarah Frankenstein, representing Life Defense Fund, said there is precedent for ballot question challenges, including from the South Dakota Supreme Court. The trial's outcome could negate the votes cast for and against Amendment G.

**Notebook: Public can testify on property-tax process**
The South Dakota Legislature's Study Committee on Property Tax Assessment Methodology is holding a meeting on September 11 to gather public testimony on the state's property tax process. The committee is looking to recommend ways to increase efficiency and effectiveness of assessment, as well as improve accuracy and consistency of real estate assessment. The public can testify in person or remotely, and written testimony will also be accepted. Meanwhile, South Dakota Right to Life has announced a new president, Anne Hanson, following the passing of Debbie Pease. The organization is campaigning against Constitutional Amendment G, which would place abortion rights in the South Dakota Constitution. Additionally, a recent analysis found that South Dakota ranks worst in the nation for the percentage of people with medical debts, with 17.66% of the population bearing medical debt. The state's high medical costs and low insurance rates contribute to this issue. New appointments have also been made to state boards and commissions, including the Examiners in Optometry Board and the Medical and Osteopathic Examiners Board.

**The 10 states where voters could decide on abortion directly**
In 10 states, voters will decide on abortion rights in November, following a year of legal battles, counter-campaigns, and bureaucratic wrangling. Since the Supreme Court's decision to upend federal abortion rights, voters in states with both conservative- and liberal-leaning electorates have either rejected abortion restrictions or secured the right to an abortion. The majority of successful campaigns were spearheaded by coalitions of doctors, advocates, and everyday people who disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision. In Arizona, Proposition 139 will ask voters if they want to allow abortion up to fetal viability with exceptions later in pregnancy for the patient's life, or physical or mental health. In Colorado, Initiative 89 could effectively repeal a 40-year-old coverage ban on public funds being used for abortions. In Florida, Amendment 4 would bar government interference in abortion access before fetal viability or when a provider deems the procedure necessary to save a person's health. In Maryland, Question 1 would reify the right to 'reproductive freedom,' including the right to make 'decisions to prevent, continue, or end' a pregnancy. In Missouri, Amendment 3 would legalize abortion up to fetal viability with exceptions later in pregnancy to protect the life or physical or mental health of a pregnant person. In Montana, CI-128 asks voters to further enshrine into the state's constitution the right to make decisions about one's pregnancy, including abortion up to fetal viability, without government regulation. In Nebraska, voters will decide on two competing constitutional amendments, one that would expand access up to viability, and another that would ban abortions after the first trimester. In Nevada, Question 6 will ask voters to ensure similar rights constitutionally, making them harder for lawmakers to modify. In New York, Proposal 1 asks voters if they want to add an equal rights amendment to the constitution, which would bar discrimination based on sex, including 'pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive health care and autonomy.' In South Dakota, Amendment G asks voters whether to ban legislators from regulating abortion until the end of the first trimester. 'It's a testament to the hard work of our advocates and the dedication of our supporters,' said a spokesperson for one of the campaigns. 'We're confident that voters will make the right decision and protect reproductive freedom.'

**The 10 states where abortion rights will be on the ballot this fall**
Ten states will have constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall that aim to protect or expand abortion rights. The states include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota. The proposed amendments would enshrine abortion rights in each state's constitution, with varying levels of protection and exceptions. For example, the Arizona amendment would create a 'fundamental right' to an abortion up until fetal viability, while the Colorado amendment would declare that 'the right to abortion is hereby recognized.' The amendments would effectively undo current abortion bans and restrictions in each state, and would provide a safeguard against future attempts to limit abortion access. A simple majority is needed for passage in most states, except for Nebraska, where a majority of the vote and at least 35% of the total votes cast are required. 'The right to abortion is hereby recognized,' said the proposed Colorado amendment. 'Government shall not deny, impede or discriminate against the exercise of that right.'

**Ballot measures give voters say on abortion, other tough questions**
This fall, voters in 41 states will decide on over 140 ballot measures, including those on abortion, assisted suicide, citizen voting, crime, elections, taxing weapons, immigration, marijuana, marriage, pay and benefits, prison labor, property taxes, redistricting, and sports betting. Some notable measures include Arizona's proposal to make it a state crime to enter from a foreign country except through official ports of entry, Colorado's proposal to impose a sales tax on firearms and ammunition, and Florida's proposal to expand partisan elections to school boards. Additionally, voters in several states will decide on measures related to abortion, including constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, and other states. 'The right to marry is a fundamental right,' according to a California measure that would repeal provisions against same-sex marriage. A California measure would also gradually raise the state's minimum wage to $18 an hour, while a Nebraska measure would provide paid sick leave but not change wages. 'It will be the third vote on the issue in both North Dakota and South Dakota' to legalize recreational marijuana for adults, according to the article. 'Some supporters are seeking to curtail forced prison labor' through proposals in California and Nevada to repeal constitutional provisions that allow 'involuntary servitude' as punishment for crime. 'North Dakota voters will consider a first-of-its-kind move to eliminate property taxes,' which could require local governments to seek replacement revenue from the state, which collects billions in taxes from the fossil fuel industry. 'A total of 38 states and Washington, D.C., already allow sports betting,' which has expanded rapidly since the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for it in 2018.

**The Right to Abortion Faces Its Biggest Test in US Elections**
The right to abortion will face its biggest test in the US elections in November, when voters in 10 states will have the final say on this issue, which has already seen several victories since the Supreme Court revoked its federal protection two years ago. In Florida, Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota, constitutional amendments on abortion will be on the ballot, eight of which were initiated by citizens who collected thousands of signatures, and two by the state legislature. The issue has mobilized citizens so much that in Nebraska, there are two citizen initiatives, one to guarantee the right to abortion until the fetus is viable and another to prohibit it from the second trimester of pregnancy, except in cases of medical emergency or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. In Missouri and South Dakota, citizen proposals aim to somehow prohibit abortion. Meanwhile, the legislatures of New York and Maryland have taken up the battle and put forward bills to guarantee access to abortion. According to Charo Valero, administrator in Florida of the National Institute for Reproductive Justice of Latinas, the elections in November represent 'the best opportunity' for voters to defend access to abortion. 'The restrictions we've seen are so extreme that the next elections are crucial to demonstrate that the majority is in favor of women's reproductive justice,' she said to EFE. Valero highlights that Republican Governor Ron DeSantis ended the right to abortion that had existed in Florida for decades, protected by the state's constitutional privacy clause. 'Florida was one of the most advanced southern states regarding abortion, but in two years we went from protections until viability to just six weeks of pregnancy,' she emphasizes. 'It was too fast. There are women in this state who still don't know about the change, who think they still have the right to abortion,' she adds. A battle that is not yet won. What worries Valero most are the attempts to sabotage the vote in favor of an amendment that seeks to protect the right to abortion until viability and when necessary to safeguard the health of the pregnant person. Last week, opponents of the initiative won a victory when the Florida Supreme Court allowed them to include a warning about the financial impact of abortion on the ballot. 'It's a trap for voters,' considers the activist. Conservative efforts have been seen across the country. Abortion supporters already suffered a setback last week in Arkansas, when Secretary of State John Thursto determined that they had not presented the necessary documentation to put a measure on the ballot, leaving it out. But the pulse in other states like Arizona, where they tried to revive a 1864 law that prohibited abortion, is being won by defenders of reproductive rights who collected a record number of signatures for voters to define whether they protect that right until the fetus is viable in November. Valero and her group are focused on educating voters about the lost rights. 'Especially among Latinas who only speak Spanish, there is a lot of misinformation,' she warns. The challenge for defenders in Florida is to get more than 60% of votes in favor of this proposal, the highest in the country. In Colorado, 55% is required, and in the other eight states, 50%. However, Valero is confident that they can achieve it. The list of states that will put measures on abortion may still grow. Legislatures that protect reproductive freedom in Hawaii and Washington, and measures that limit the right in Missouri and Oklahoma may still be approved by their lawmakers and appear on the ballot during a special session.

**US States to Vote on Abortion Measures in November**
In the United States, voters in 10 states will consider ballot measures related to abortion in November. Most of these measures are constitutional amendments that aim to expand access to abortion. One state, Nebraska, will consider two contradictory measures: one that would protect the unborn and another that would establish a constitutional right to abortion. Here's a breakdown of the measures: Arizona: Voters will decide whether to add a 'right to abortion' to the state constitution, which would prevent the state from restricting abortion until 'viability', approximately 24 weeks of pregnancy. Florida: The 'Right to Abortion' constitutional amendment would consolidate a 'right' to abortion in the state constitution and prevent the passage of pro-life laws. Maryland: The 'Reproductive Freedom' constitutional amendment would establish a 'right' to abortion in the state constitution and prevent the passage of pro-life laws. Missouri: The 'Right to Abortion' constitutional amendment would modify the state constitution to allow abortion throughout pregnancy, with no protection for the fetus, even when the child can feel pain. Montana: The 'Right to Abortion' constitutional amendment would establish a 'right' to abortion in the state constitution, allowing abortion before fetal viability, and would prevent the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion. Nebraska: Voters will consider two contradictory measures: one that would protect the unborn and another that would establish a constitutional right to abortion. Nevada: The 'Right to Abortion' constitutional amendment would codify existing laws that allow abortion until approximately 24 weeks of pregnancy. New York: The 'Equality of Rights' constitutional amendment would prohibit discrimination based on 'pregnancy outcomes' or 'gender expression'. South Dakota: The 'Right to Abortion' constitutional amendment would establish a 'constitutional right to abortion' and allow the procedure throughout pregnancy.

**At least nine states have pro-abortion ballot measures for November, with some facing lawsuits**
At least nine states will have pro-abortion constitutional amendment proposals on ballots in November, with some states facing lawsuits from conservatives and pro-life groups. Some believe that pro-abortion ballot measures will help increase Democratic voter turnout in the November election. However, Kelsey Pritchard, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America's State Public Affairs Director, said, 'Some Democrats are under the illusion that putting abortion on the ballot will propel them to victory in November, but even Politico says this is not going to win them elections.' The proposed amendments would enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions, with some states allowing abortion to be regulated or prohibited in the third trimester. A pro-life group is suing in an attempt to remove the initiative from the November ballot in South Dakota, claiming that wrongdoing occurred regarding the petition circulators. Meanwhile, a pro-abortion group is suing the Missouri secretary of state over his office's description of the ballot measure, arguing that the language is 'intentionally argumentative and is likely to create prejudice against the proposed measure.'
