Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time Frame: We're looking at a very short window - just about a month from now until October 1, 2024.

2. Current Context:
- Russia has already blocked many Western social media platforms
- YouTube's shortened URL (youtu.be) is already blocked
- Russia has threatened to block YouTube multiple times but hasn't followed through
- YouTube remains one of the last major Western platforms still accessible in Russia

3. Key Considerations:
- The very short timeframe (about 1 month) reduces the likelihood
- Russia has shown reluctance to fully block YouTube due to its popularity among Russians
- However, escalating tensions with the West could prompt sudden action
- The fact that youtu.be is already blocked suggests some groundwork for a potential full ban
- Presidential elections are over, reducing political risk of public backlash

4. Recent Trends:
- Russia has been gradually tightening internet controls
- The regime has been increasingly isolating Russian internet space
- Alternative Russian video platforms exist but aren't as developed

Given the very short timeframe and Russia's historical hesitation to block YouTube despite threats, I assess a relatively low probability, but not negligible given recent trends.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.40%, with 20.30% being the most likely. Probability: 20.30%.
