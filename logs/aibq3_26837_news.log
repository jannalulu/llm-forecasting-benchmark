**Katy Perry Is Already Moving On From Her Flop Single**
Katy Perry's comeback single 'Woman's World' has underperformed, peaking at No. 63 on the Hot 100 chart and falling off the ranking entirely. Despite still being promoted to radio, the single has slipped on the Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay tallies. Perry is already moving on to her next single, 'Lifetimes', which is set to drop on August 9. The quick pivot suggests that Perry and her team have accepted that the public isn't interested in 'Woman's World', and are hoping that 'Lifetimes' will perform better.

**Katy Perry's 'Woman's World' Fails to Crack Top 10 and Debuts at No. 63 on Billboard Chart**
Katy Perry's comeback single 'Woman's World' has failed to crack the top 10 and debuted at No. 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The song's performance on streaming services was also relatively low, landing at No. 110 on Spotify's U.S.-based chart and No. 58 on the Spotify global chart. Perry's last solo Hot 100 hit was in 2020 with 'Daisies', and her last chart-dominating numbers came through 'Witness', where its lead single 'Chained To the Rhythm' broke through at No. 4 on the Hot 100. The song's music video, which features Perry dressing up as sexy Rosie the Riveter and women replacing men in a recreation of the historic Lunch atop a Skyscraper photo, has been criticized for its use of common feminist tropes. Perry explained that the video is meant to be 'slapstick and very on the nose', and that it's a 'reset' for her and her idea of feminine divine. The song is part of Perry's upcoming album '143', which is set to arrive on September 20.

**Katy Perry shocks partygoers with nightclub appearance in Ibiza as she tries to salvage comeback after Woman's World flop**
Katy Perry made a surprise appearance at Pacha nightclub in Ibiza, sparking attention with her toned stomach and bold fashion choices. The singer, 39, has been trying to salvage her comeback after her single 'Woman's World' flopped, debuting at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. An insider claims that Katy has been working out more and eating better, attributing her weight loss to 'working hard' and denying any involvement with weight loss wonder drugs like Ozempic. Katy's appearance comes after her album's lead single, 'Woman's World', received criticism for being unoriginal and hypocritical, with some accusing her of using a sex-appeal strategy to promote it. The singer is said to be 'freaking out' and demanding that her team come up with a new plan to save her album from suffering the same fate as 'Woman's World'.

**Katy Perry's 'Woman's World' Fails to Make an Impact**
Katy Perry's return to music has not gone as planned. Two weeks after its release, her song 'Woman's World' has already been removed from the Billboard Hot 100 chart. For a pop artist of her caliber, this is a monumental failure. The song initially debuted at a disappointing 63rd position, before disappearing from the chart on August 3, 2024. Critics have been divided, with some being harsh. 'Is Katy Perry's comeback song the worst in history?' even suggested Rolling Stone. The song, an attempt at a feminist anthem, is not even among the top 100 songs on iTunes Canada. Clearly, the 39-year-old California artist is struggling to recapture the magic of her early days. Her debut single 'I Kissed a Girl' in 2008 marked the beginning of a nine-song streak that topped the Hot 100 chart. Since then, she has accumulated disappointments, with only 'Chained to the Rhythm' reaching 4th place in 2017. She will try again on August 9 with the release of 'Lifetimes', the second single from her upcoming album '143'.

**Katy Perry's 'Woman's World' Fails to Impress on Charts**
Katy Perry's new single 'Woman's World' failed to impress on the charts, debuting at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song, a pop-dance track with empowering lyrics, received mixed reviews, with some critics calling it a 'vintage bubblegum pop' formula and others praising its message. The music video also sparked controversy, with some criticizing a scene where Katy is crushed by a weight. Katy explained the concept on Instagram, saying they were 'having fun, being a bit sarcastic, it's very silly, physical comedy... We're exaggerating, because I'm about to be crushed, which is like a restart, a restart for me and a restart for my idea of female divinity, and it's a completely different world after this.' The album 143, which will be released on September 20, has not yet announced a second single.

Katy Perry responded to criticisms about her music video 'Woman's World' by sharing behind-the-scenes photos and explaining her inspirations for the empowering feminist visual. The video shows Katy dressed as a pin-up girl and working on a construction site before being hit by a hammer. She then appears in an apocalyptic world led by women and causes chaos with her friends. The song was co-produced by Dr. Luke, who was accused of sexual abuse by Kesha. Perry said, 'We're just having fun being a little sarcastic with this, it's very playful and very straightforward.' She also mentioned that the video is a 'reboot' and a 'reinitialization' for her and her idea of divine femininity. The song marks Katy Perry's first release since 'Smile' in 2020, which reached the 5th place on the Billboard 200. The music serves as the lead single for her upcoming album '143', which will be available on digital platforms and physical format on September 20th, the same day she will perform at Rock in Rio in Rio de Janeiro.
