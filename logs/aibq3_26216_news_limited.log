**Here's When Bitcoin Price Will Hit $100K: Predictions and Key Events**
Bitcoin is expected to reach $100,000 by September 2024, according to Kyle Chassé, a well-known crypto analyst. Chassé believes that the current bull market is halfway through and that Bitcoin will enter 'MAJOR price discovery territory' once it reaches $100,000. He also predicts that mid-sized altcoins could experience impressive gains of 20-50 times their current values. The approval of a spot in Ethereum ETFs is seen as a significant development for the crypto market, which could boost Ethereum's price and increase institutional investment and market demand. Bitcoin's recent price action has positioned it for potential further gains, with a successful break above the $60K zone and the 50-day EMA suggesting that it might continue to rise.

**Here's When Bitcoin (BTC) Will Soar to $100K and $1M, According to PlanB's S2F**
PlanB, the creator of the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (S2F) model, has reiterated his predictions for Bitcoin's price movement in 2024 and 2025. According to PlanB, Bitcoin will surge past $100,000 this year and possibly reach $500,000 next year, with a potential range of $250,000 to $1 million. PlanB's predictions are based on the increased scarcity of Bitcoin due to the halving event, which has been a pattern in the past. While the S2F model has been criticized for its inaccuracy, it has recorded some successful predictions, including the recent rally before the halving event. PlanB believes that Bitcoin will reach an average price of $500,000 between 2024 and 2028, and that it will never go below $33,000 again in subsequent bear markets.

**Bitcoin Struggles to Break $60,000 as Crypto Fear & Greed Index Hits 'Extreme Fear' Level**
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has reached an 'extreme fear' level, its lowest level since December 2022, as the price of Bitcoin struggles to stay above $57,000. Despite a brief surge after Donald Trump's announcement to attend the Bitcoin 2024 conference, the cryptocurrency has failed to break through the $60,000 barrier and is expected to fall further. The index, which measures market sentiment, has dropped to 25, indicating 'extreme fear', a level not seen since December 2022. Analysts warn that the bearish trend may not be over yet, with some predicting further declines. The price of Bitcoin has fallen over 2% in the last day, with Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies also experiencing significant losses. The German government's massive sale of BTC has added to the pressure, but analysts believe the impact will be temporary. Some analysts remain bullish on BTC, citing potential buying pressure from the FTX reinsurance payout and a potential rate cut in September.

**Can Bitcoin hit a new ATH before 2024 ends? There's a 25% chance**
Peterson believes there's a 25% chance that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high before the end of 2024. Bitcoin is currently trading above $57,000, having recovered from a recent decline. Peterson suggests that if Bitcoin closes above $50,000 in July, it's likely to maintain or exceed this level into October. There's also a 10% chance that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. Strong fundamentals, including a 1.05% increase in the total Bitcoin supply held, indicate confidence among major investors and could be a bullish signal for the market.

**What Will 1 Bitcoin Be Worth in 2025?**
The article discusses the potential price of Bitcoin in 2025, based on its historical four-year cycle. The cycle typically begins with a bear market, followed by a recovery phase, a halving event, and then a notable price increase in the fourth year. Assuming the cycle continues, the article predicts that Bitcoin could reach $99,000 by the end of 2024 and nearly $500,000 by the end of 2025. The article also notes that past performance is no guarantee of future results, but the continuation of the four-year cycle is compelling. Additionally, the article highlights the potential long-term potential of Bitcoin due to its finite supply, decentralization, and security.

**Bernstein Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $1 Million by 2033**
Investment firm Bernstein predicts that the value of Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2033. After the halving of Bitcoin in April, the price dropped, but analysts believe it will only continue to grow. Bernstein's projection is based on the company's analysis of software developer MicroStrategy, which has the largest number of Bitcoins in its portfolio. The company expects MicroStrategy's stock to reach a price of $2,890. As a result, Bernstein also looked at the value of Bitcoin itself and set a strong forecast. In 2025, the cryptocurrency is expected to be worth $200,000. The price is expected to reach $500,000 on average in 2029, and then reach $1 million in 2033. A previous analysis by Standard Chartered predicted a value of $150,000 for a Bitcoin by the end of 2024. After a decline in May, the value of Bitcoin rose again to just above $60,000, indicating a plateau that Bernstein does not expect to last. The only way is up, according to the company. The regulated Bitcoin ETFs play a crucial role in this, with Bernstein calling the regulation by the US Federal Reserve a 'turning point for crypto', creating a structural demand from traditional capital. The new ETFs have already brought in $15 billion in net inflows, and it is expected that they will continue to hold more Bitcoin in circulation.

**Here's The Timeline For Bitcoin Bull Run**
Bitcoin is currently trading in a tight range between $67,000 and $65,500, showing unclear direction in the market. According to Rekt Capital, a well-known crypto analyst, Bitcoin could potentially reach its peak in the current cycle around mid-September to mid-October 2025, based on the historical pattern observed in past Bitcoin halving events. This prediction is contrary to many in the crypto community who expected the Bull Run to begin after the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.

**Bitcoin Will Smash $100K In The Next 12 Months, Says Peter Brandt and Kiyosaki**
Peter Brandt, a renowned crypto trader, predicts that Bitcoin could surge to $130,000-$150,000 by late summer. He notes that Bitcoin's halving events, which occur every four years, mark crucial points in its bull runs. Brandt suggests that the next bull market cycle high should occur in late August or early September 2025. Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad', also predicts a $100,000 BTC by 2024, possibly even $300,000. He believes that the 'smart money' knows that the US is the biggest debtor nation and that other countries are facing economic issues, which could lead to a surge in Bitcoin's price.

**Trading Veteran Predicts Bitcoin Will Top at $150,000 in September 2025**
Peter L. Brandt, a well-known trading veteran, predicts that Bitcoin could surge to $150,000 by September 2025. This forecast is based on historical patterns observed in Bitcoin's market cycles, specifically related to its 'halving' events. Brandt notes that the time intervals from the start of a bull market to the halving dates closely mirror the intervals from the halving dates to the subsequent market peaks. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could reach its next peak around late August or early September 2025, with a price of between $130,000 and $150,000. However, Brandt remains cautious, acknowledging that no analysis method is infallible.

According to cryptocurrency trader Peter Brandt, Bitcoin (BTC) could reach a peak of $130,000 to $150,000 between late August and early September 2025 if it follows the pattern of previous bull markets after the halving event. The recent halving of Bitcoin, which occurred on April 20, reduces the mining rewards by 50% every four years, and Brandt notes that the halving dates have shown a

**Bitcoin Bulls Gain Breathing Room As Long-Term Holder Activity Eases**
Bitcoin's recent price movements have been volatile, with a 7.3% drop from its March peak. However, a decline in long-term holder selling pressure and a potential re-accumulation phase may give rise to more bullish market conditions. A prominent crypto analyst suggests that Bitcoin may only break out from its current range around 160 days post-Halving, potentially in September 2024. The crypto market has seen significant liquidations, with $292.07 million in total losses over the past 24 hours. The upcoming expiry of a large volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum options adds complexity to the market's immediate future.
