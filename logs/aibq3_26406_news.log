**COVID-19 cases increasing in the US, but experts say it's not a cause for alarm**
COVID-19 cases are increasing in the United States, but experts say this is not a cause for alarm. The virus is weakening over time, and Americans have residual immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, which is reducing the impact of the still rapidly spreading virus. The current dominant subvariants are 'very contagious', but 'not more severe', said William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. While the level of COVID-19 residues found in wastewater (an indicator of infections) indicates that some parts of the US are surpassing last summer's increase, hospitalizations remain low. 'Our population immunity is very high', said Schaffner. There are still risks for the elderly and some other groups, but most healthy people are well-protected from their own previous exposure to the disease or from vaccines, he said. According to Schaffner, this milder COVID may be a natural design and a sign of where the virus is heading. Previous coronaviruses passed from causing severe symptoms and high mortality rates to causing common colds in most of the population, he said. 'The COVID-19 wants to spread and kill people, it's a disadvantage because it stops the spread', said Stanley Plotkin, emeritus professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and vaccine manufacturer consultant. 'The virus is doing what it likes to do, which is to infect as many people as possible'. Plotkin said he expects COVID to resemble the common cold viruses, which will appear and disappear, causing outbreaks, but not be as dangerous. Weekly hospitalization rates for COVID were around 2 cases per 100,000 people at the end of June, according to CDC data. The rate has increased, but is still far below the winter peak of 7.7 per 100,000 people at the end of December 2023.

**COVID-19 Cases Rise in US, But Experts Say It's Not a Cause for Alarm**
COVID-19 cases are increasing in the US, but experts say it's not a cause for alarm. The virus is weakening over time, and Americans have residual immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, reducing the impact of the still highly contagious virus. The dominant subvariants are 'very contagious', but 'not more severe', according to William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. While wastewater samples indicate that some parts of the US are surpassing last summer's increase, hospitalizations remain low. 'Our population immunity is very high', said Schaffner. There are still risks for the elderly and some other groups, but most healthy people are well-protected from their previous exposure to the disease or vaccines. Schaffner believes this milder COVID may be a natural design of the virus, pointing towards its future direction. Stanley Plotkin, professor emeritus of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and vaccine consultant, expects COVID to resemble the common cold, appearing and disappearing, causing outbreaks, but not being as dangerous. The weekly hospitalization rates for COVID hovered around 2 cases per 100,000 people by the end of June, according to CDC data.

Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a retired professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and vaccine consultant, expects the COVID-19 virus to follow a similar path to previous coronaviruses, which have evolved to cause common colds in most people. The CDC reported that the weekly hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was around 2 cases per 100,000 people at the end of June, which has increased slowly but is still below the winter peak of 7.7 per 100,000 people at the end of December 2023.

**300 deaths a week marks pandemic low**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of COVID-19-associated deaths has decreased to about 300 per week in May, the lowest since the beginning of the pandemic. The COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 1.5 per 100,000 hospital visits, up from 1.1 in mid-May. The CDC describes current wastewater levels as 'low' nationwide, but with higher levels noted in Florida, Utah, California, and Hawaii. As of May 11, fewer than one-quarter of U.S. adults had received the latest COVID-19 shot, with 42% of people 75 and older having received the latest shots.

**Here are the numbers: COVID-19 is ticking up in some places, but levels remain low**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released its latest advice on COVID-19 vaccinations. According to the CDC, COVID-19-associated deaths have decreased to around 300 per week, the lowest since the pandemic began. Hospitalization rates have increased slightly to 1.5 per 100,000 hospital visits, but remain low. Wastewater analysis suggests that cases are increasing in some areas, including Florida, Utah, California, and Hawaii. Vaccination rates are also being tracked, with fewer than one-quarter of U.S. adults and 42% of those 75 and older receiving the latest shots.

**COVID-19 Update: Cases Increase Slightly in Italy, Hospital Impact Remains Limited**
According to the latest monitoring data, the number of COVID-19 cases in Italy has increased slightly, with 9,000 new cases and 40 deaths reported as of July 17, 2024. The hospital impact remains limited. The JN.1 variant, including its sub-lineages (including KP.3), remains the most prevalent, consistent with observations in other countries. The occupancy rate of medical beds is stable at 1.9% (1,183 hospitalized), and the intensive care unit occupancy rate is also stable at 0.5% (43 hospitalized). The hospitalization and mortality rates are higher in older age groups (34 and 80 per 100,000 people in the 80-89 and >90 age groups, respectively). The reproduction number (Rt) calculated with data up to July 8, 2024, is 1.20 (1.08-1.32), slightly higher than the previous week. The incidence of COVID-19 cases diagnosed and reported in the period from July 11 to 17, 2024, is 15 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, slightly higher than the previous week. The incidence rate is increasing in most regions and age groups, with the highest rate reported in the Lazio region (29 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and the lowest in the Marche region (9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The median age at diagnosis is 61 years, slightly lower than the previous week. The percentage of reinfections is around 49%, slightly higher than the previous week.

**Covid: Growing Concerns Over New Autumn Variants**
Italy has seen a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the summer of 2024, driven by the Kp3 variant. The latest weekly monitoring report from the Ministry of Health and the ISS shows that the occupancy rate of hospital beds is stable at 1.6% (1,006 hospitalized), while the intensive care unit occupancy rate is at 0.5% (43 hospitalized). The rates of hospitalization and mortality are higher in older age groups. The Rt index, based on hospitalization cases, is stable at 1.00. The incidence of COVID-19 cases in the period from July 4 to 10, 2024 is 9.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a slight increase from the previous week. The Lazio region has the highest incidence rate with 18 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, while the Marche region has the lowest with less than 0.5 cases. Preliminary June data show an increase in sequencing of the Kp3 variant, from 25.6% in May to 31.7%. According to Walter Ricciardi, professor of Hygiene at the University of Rome, we are facing a small summer wave, a prelude to more worrying autumn waves with the return of respiratory diseases. Ricciardi emphasized the importance of a coordinated strategy from national and regional health authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. He criticized ad-hoc measures taken by individual medical studies, defining them as insufficient to prevent a new epidemic wave. He warned that the phenomenon of 'panic and neglect' continues, with panic followed by forgetfulness, leading to a decrease in vaccinations and public health measures. Symptoms and duration of the disease are similar to those of previous COVID-19 infections, including fever, cough, respiratory difficulties, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The acute phase of symptoms lasts a few days or up to a week, but fatigue and malaise can persist for weeks. The FDA advisory committee has recently recommended updating COVID-19 vaccines for the fall, making them more effective against the JN.1 and Kp3 variants. Professor Hana El Sahly of the Baylor College of Medicine confirmed that the fall vaccine will target the JN.1 variant, closely related to Kp3. In conclusion, despite the current situation being under control, the fall may bring greater challenges, requiring preparation and coordination of preventive measures to protect the population, especially the most vulnerable.

**Corona Flirt-Varianten: Sommerwelle nimmt Fahrt auf**
The number of reported COVID-19 infections has increased again, according to the latest weekly report from the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza. Although intensive care units are treating only a few older patients with severe infections, the number of new respiratory infections has risen to around 6,000 per 100,000 inhabitants. This is significantly higher than the pre-pandemic level of around 4,000 new infections. The virological Sentinel of the Robert Koch Institute detected mainly rhinoviruses, common cold viruses, which triggered the infection in 27% of cases. The proportion of Sars-CoV-2 increased to 12%. Experts have been detecting increasing virus loads in wastewater monitoring nationwide since weeks, with values now reaching the level of the beginning of the last autumn wave in August 2023. The dominant Corona subvariant is currently KP. 3, a subtype of the previously known variant JN. 1. The new viruses are characterized by slight mutations in their docking protein, which have replaced amino acids with the abbreviation F with L and R with T, hence the abbreviation FLIRT. This means they can still bind to human cells but are more difficult to recognize by antibodies. So far, this does not lead to severe infections. There are no new estimates for the strength of the upcoming wave. It is likely that summer holidays will temporarily interrupt infections in schools and kindergartens. At the same time, it is expected that new infection chains will occur at tourist destinations, leading to new clusters. This has been the case in previous years, resulting in a significant increase in infection numbers after the end of the summer holidays.

**US Experiences New Wave of COVID-19 Cases, But How Concerning is the Situation?**
The US is experiencing a new wave of COVID-19 cases, but how concerning is the situation? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), positive COVID-19 tests increased by almost 1% between June 23-29. However, considering many people do not get tested or have false negatives, this 1% is likely just a fraction of the real increase. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 increased by 23% in the same period, and hospitalizations due to the virus increased by 13% between June 9-15. Arizona, California, and Nevada are the states with the highest increases in positivity. However, the death toll from COVID-19 remains low, with a 25% decrease in the last week of June. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, stated that the US typically sees an increase in COVID-19 cases every summer, and this is expected. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that the latest data shows that COVID-19 is starting to become more like the flu, with the elderly and those with weakened immune systems being the most severely affected. The CDC has not found evidence that the KP.2, KP.3, or any other recent variant causes a more severe illness. The World Health Organization warned about the low vaccination rate against COVID-19 and reminded that getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to avoid severe illness from the virus.

**Summer 2024 Covid-19 Surge Occurring With FLiRT Variants Taking Over**
The US has been experiencing a Covid-19 summer surge since early June, with the 'FLiRT' variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus taking over. Data shows a 23.3% increase in emergency room visits and a 13.3% increase in hospitalizations due to Covid-19. The surge is attributed to the lack of Covid-19 precautions, such as face mask use and indoor air filtration, and the waning protection offered by the vaccine. The FLiRT variants have two key mutations in their spike proteins, which may affect the effectiveness of vaccination. While there is no indication that vaccination will not be effective against the FLiRT variants, more data are needed to determine the effectiveness. It is recommended to maintain precautions such as wearing face masks and ensuring well-ventilated indoor locations to reduce the risk of severe outcomes and long Covid.

**New COVID-19 Subvariants Detected in New York Wastewater, Surge in Cases Expected**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have detected new subvariants of the COVID-19 virus, known as FLiRT, in wastewater. This has led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in New York hospitals, with an average of 181 emergency department visits per week in June, and a total of around 750 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest level in the state so far. The CDC has identified high levels of the virus in wastewater in parts of Monroe, Westchester, and Rockland counties, indicating widespread transmission. The main subvariants circulating in New York are KP (40%) and JN.1 (22%), but the fastest-growing variant nationally, LB.1, has started to appear in wastewater in New York, suggesting the possibility of additional outbreaks. Experts note that the current surge is less severe than previous summer waves, with around 2,800 COVID-19 patients in the hospital during the peak summer season in 2022, according to state data. They also point out the seasonal fluctuations in COVID-19 cases, which peak in the fall and winter months, indicating that the virus will remain present, just like seasonal flu. The CDC recommends that New Yorkers stay at home and avoid others for at least 24 hours if they have COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to someone with the virus. This is a change from previous guidelines, which recommended a minimum of five days of isolation for COVID-19.

**New York COVID Cases Surge as New Variants Spread**
New variants of COVID-19, known as FLiRT, have been found in wastewater, according to the CDC. The increase in COVID-19 patients in New York hospitals suggests that this summer's surge could be more severe than last year's, as new variants spread across the country. The number of emergency room visits for COVID-19 averaged 181 per week at the end of June, with approximately 750 COVID patients hospitalized, the highest in the state. In contrast, those key metrics for COVID hospitals were 80 visits and 410 hospitalizations at the same time last summer. The wastewater surveillance also identified high detections of COVID in parts of Monroe, Westchester, and Rockland counties, highlighting the spread of the virus in those communities. However, those levels remained below maximum possible readings, mainly in parts of Buffalo, New York City, and Long Island. The cases are driven by constant increases in a collection of sub-variants known as Coquetearllamado, named after the technical names of the mutations. FLiRT comes from Variant JN.1, a descendant of omicron, which dominated cases until spring, according to the CDC. State data shows that the main sub-variants that spread last month in New York were KP (40%) and JN.1 (22%), but the variant of fastest growth nationally, LB.1, has begun to appear in New York's wastewater, suggesting potential additional infections. Although it surpassed last summer, the current increase in COVID-19 infections remains below the summer levels observed at the start of the pandemic, with the worst summer peak in 2022, with almost 2,800 COVID-19 patients hospitalized, according to state data. Experts noted that seasonal fluctuations in COVID cases, with a much higher prevalence during autumn and winter, emphasized the fact that the virus is here to stay, as it is becoming endemic, similar to seasonal flu, which causes up to 51,000 deaths per year across the country. New Yorkers should stay home and away from others until at least 24 hours after the fever has disappeared and symptoms have improved in general, according to the updated recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This change was made with respect to the previous guidance, which recommended a minimum isolation period of five days for COVID-19.

**Covid: Incidence of new cases identified and reported in Italy shows a slight increase**
As of July 3, 2024, the hospitalization rate in Italy is 1.4% (852 hospitalized), stable compared to the previous week (1.2% on June 26, 2024). The intensive care unit occupancy rate is also stable at 0.4% (31 hospitalized), compared to the previous week (0.3% on June 26, 2024). The hospitalization and mortality rates are higher in older age groups (hospitalization rate in the 80-89 and >90 age groups respectively 20 and 24 per 1,000,000 inhabitants and mortality rate in the 80-89 and >90 age groups respectively 1 and 6 per 1,000,000 inhabitants). There were no new intensive care unit admissions reported during the observation period. The transmission index (Rt) calculated with updated data as of July 3, 2024 and based on hospitalized cases, was 1.04 (0.91-1.18) on June 25, 2024, stable compared to the previous week (Rt=1.15 (0.99-1.32) on June 18, 2024). The incidence of COVID-19 cases diagnosed and reported in the period June 27, 2024 - July 3, 2024 is 6.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a slight increase compared to the previous week (4.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the week June 20, 2024 - June 26, 2024). The weekly incidence (June 27, 2024 - July 3, 2024) of diagnosed and reported cases results in a slight increase in most regions, with the highest incidence reported in the Lazio region (14 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and the lowest in the Marche region (0.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The age groups with the highest weekly incidence are 80-89 and >90 years. The weekly incidence is stable in most age groups. The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, a slight decrease compared to the previous week. The percentage of reinfections is around 45%, stable compared to the previous week.

**COVID-19 reaches high level. Hospitalization, emergency visits, deaths go up. What have CDC data revealed?**
The COVID-19 pandemic has reached a high level in the US, with hospitalization, emergency visits, and deaths increasing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency department visits have increased by 23% and weekly emergency room visits diagnosed as COVID-19 are at 0.9%. Hawaii has seen a significant rise in COVID-19 cases, while Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and Washington have fewer cases. The number of deaths has increased by 14%, but is lower than the 2,000 deaths per week seen in December and January 2021. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, attributes the increase to the 'summer bump' of COVID cases, which typically occurs in the summer, followed by a decline in the fall and a surge in the winter.

**Covid cases and hospitalizations rise in Catalonia**
Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in Catalonia. In the last week, from June 24 to 30, 6,089 cases were diagnosed in primary care, 460 more than the previous week. The incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants was 76, compared to 70 in the previous week, according to the Sivic portal. Hospitalizations also increased, with 467 patients in conventional beds, 137 more than the previous week, and eight in the ICU, the same as the previous week. The Sars-CoV-2 virus is the most common cause of acute respiratory infections, with the JN.1 variant being the most prevalent, with a predominance of the Flirt sub-group. The portal also suggests that the third and final wave of streptococcus pyogenes may be coming to an end, with a decline in incidence of 35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants of streptococcal pharyngitis and two cases per 100,000 inhabitants of scarlet fever.

**Summer Covid: All you need to know about FLiRT variant running rampant across UK**
The UK is experiencing a new wave of Covid-19 cases, with the FLiRT variant spreading rapidly. Hospitalization rates have increased, with 3.31 people per 100,000 in the week ending June 16. The elderly are most affected, with rates peaking at 34.70 in the over-85s. Prof Paul Hunter, a leading infectious disease expert, believes that Covid-19 will become another common cold, and that repeated infections are inevitable. NHS England has launched a final appeal for people to take up the offer of a Spring booster jab, with only half of eligible individuals having done so. Prof Steve Griffin warns that the rise in hospitalizations is worrying and that another Covid wave is building.

**Is Covid back with summer wave as cases rise in UK and US?**
Coronavirus cases are rising in the United States and the United Kingdom, with new variants driving an annual summer surge. In the US, data from the CDC shows that Covid infections are growing in at least 38 states, with hospitalizations and deaths on the rise. The CDC reports that cases are especially high in the West, where viral levels are back to what they were in February. Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, attributes the rise to the virus's ability to replicate well in warm and moist environments. Dr. Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University, notes that it's unclear if this will be a peak level for the surge, and that new variants may be driving the increase. In the UK, hospital admissions with Covid rose to 3.31 per 100,000 in the week to June 16, with 4.37 instances of COVID-19 reported per 100,000 hospital admissions in England on June 26. Some experts suggest that the European Championship, Euro 2024, may be contributing to the summer wave.

**Ready for summer? That could mean COVID-19. Here's why**
COVID-19 cases are on the rise in 39 states, including Florida, with test positivity rates increasing nationally to nearly 7%. Hospital emergency room visits for COVID infections are also increasing. Experts warn that this could worsen as summer goes on. Both Lee Health and NCH hospital systems in Southwest Florida are seeing more cases. The state Department of Health reports 8,927 cases for the week of June 14, up from 6,568 cases for the same week in 2023. New variants of the virus are emerging, and vaccine booster rates have declined. Experts attribute the rise in cases to increased travel and people spending more time indoors to escape the heat, as well as the spread of more easily transmissible strains. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, sore throat, congestion, headache, muscle ache, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older receive an updated vaccine, as protection from vaccines declines over time.

**300 deaths a week marks pandemic low**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of COVID-19-associated deaths has decreased to about 300 per week in May, the lowest since the beginning of the pandemic. The COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 1.5 per 100,000 hospital visits, up from 1.1 in mid-May. The CDC describes current wastewater levels as 'low' nationwide, but with higher levels noted in Florida, Utah, California, and Hawaii. As of May 11, fewer than one-quarter of U.S. adults had received the latest COVID-19 shot, with 42% of people 75 and older having received the latest shots.

**US Recommends Updated COVID-19 Vaccine for All Over 6 Months Old**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that all individuals aged 6 months or older receive a dose of the updated COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of previous vaccination status. The recommendation aims to protect the population against severe disease during the fall and winter of the northern hemisphere, which runs from September 2024 to March 2025. The CDC states that the coronavirus is constantly changing and that the protection provided by the vaccine decreases over time. Receiving an updated vaccine for 2024-2025 can restore and increase protection against the current variants of the virus responsible for most infections and hospitalizations in the US. The vaccination also reduces the likelihood of developing long-term effects of COVID-19, which can occur during or after an acute infection and last for a prolonged period. The US is experiencing a new wave of COVID-19 during the summer vacation period, with an increase in infections in at least 39 states and territories. According to CDC data, most Americans hospitalized for COVID-19 did not receive any of the vaccines offered during the last campaign, which took place in the fall of 2023. The CDC emphasizes the importance of vaccination to protect against severe COVID-19 and flu outcomes, including hospitalization and death. In 2023, more than 916,300 people were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and more than 75,500 people died from the disease.

**The COVID Summer Wave Is Here and Hospitalizations Are Soaring—How Long It Will Last?**
The US is experiencing a COVID-19 summer wave, with cases and hospitalizations increasing. According to the CDC, emergency department visits from COVID-19 are up 15% and hospitalizations are up 25% compared to late May. Experts attribute the surge to the virus evolving to evade immunity, waning population immunity, and increased indoor activities during hot weather. It's difficult to predict how long the wave will last, but doctors expect it to continue for several weeks. To stay safe, experts recommend masking up, avoiding crowded indoor settings, getting vaccinated, and being aware of symptoms. They also suggest getting tested and taking anti-viral medication if necessary.

**New COVID-19 Variant 'FLiRT' Spreading in the UK, Experts Warn**
Experts in the UK are warning that COVID-19 has not disappeared, as a new variant called FLiRT has emerged, leading to a 24% increase in hospitalizations. According to the UK Health Security Agency, the number of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 increased by 24% in the past week, with a rate of 3.31 per 100,000 people compared to 2.67 per 100,000 in the previous week. Professor Lawrence Young, a virus expert from Warwick University, warned that these numbers should be a 'wake-up call' for those who think the virus has disappeared. He emphasized that the virus is not seasonal and that new variants and a significant decline in immunity could lead to a surge in cases. The UKHSA reported 2053 cases of COVID-19 in the week ending June 12, a 7% increase compared to the previous week.

**New Covid variant hits 39 states across US**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that Covid-19 cases are increasing in at least 39 states, driven by new variants. The CDC estimates transmission based on emergency department visits, which have risen in the last week. Hospitalizations have climbed 25% from May 2 to June 1. California is experiencing a notable rise in infections, with a positivity rate for Covid tests increasing from 3% to 7.5% in the past month. Experts expect a milder wave of severe disease this summer due to increased travel and indoor gatherings. Several variants, including KP.2, KP.3, and LB.1, are contributing to the nationwide trend, with LB.1 expected to become dominant soon. Scientists refer to these variants collectively as 'FLiRT.' Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, said, 'Assuming that preliminary data is true, that it's more immune-evasive and infectious than KP.2 and KP.3, that's a winning formula to infect more people.' Dr. Thomas Russo, chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, recommended that vulnerable people consider getting the latest Covid vaccine if they haven't already.

**Covid-19 cases in Spain appear to be reaching their peak**
The recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Spain appears to be reaching its peak, according to data from the Sistema de Vigilancia de Infecciones Respiratorias Agudas (Sivira) report. The number of new cases detected by primary care professionals has slowed down significantly compared to the previous two weeks, and for the first time in a month, the hospitalization rate has decreased. The epidemiological statistics also suggest a less severe clinical impact on those infected. The number of infections per 100,000 inhabitants reported by family doctors last week was 128, a 9% increase from the previous week. Despite eight consecutive weeks of increasing cases, the rate of new cases has remained below the official threshold for low risk. The symptoms of a decline in the severity of cases treated by hospital specialists, including one-third of them being pneumonias, are starting to appear. For the first time since early May, the hospitalization rate per 100,000 inhabitants has decreased. This rate, despite being double what it was a month ago, decreased by 18% last week. The number of patients who had to be transferred from emergency or ward to ICU also decreased for the first time in weeks, although less significantly, from 4.1% to 3.9%. The lack of increase in the severity of cases is also reflected in the fact that the percentage of those who die from COVID-19 has remained stable at 8.4%.

**COVID-19 Antigen Test Sales Surge in Catalonia, Experts Urge Vaccination and Mask-Wearing**
The sale of COVID-19 antigen tests has increased by over 700% in pharmacies in Catalonia between April and June. According to the College of Pharmacists of Barcelona, the demand for these tests has increased by more than 700% in the past two months, reflecting the significant growth in sales. In Spain, this increase has been even greater, with a 1,866% increase in the past two months. Experts such as Daniel López-Acuña, former advisor to the World Health Organization (WHO), recommend vaccinating people at risk who did not receive the booster shot in the fall and also the rest of the population who has not received a vaccine in over a year. López-Acuña also calls for the mandatory use of masks in hospitals, healthcare centers, and pharmacies. The new Flirt variant, which is more contagious but not more severe, is behind this 'epidemic wave'. The situation is extrapolable to all of Spain. According to the Carlos III Health Institute, the weekly hospitalization rate is higher than in 2020 and 2022 at this time of year, and slightly lower than in 2021, which was very high. The incidence is higher than in 2022 and almost the same as in 2020 at this time of year. Experts recommend intensifying vaccination efforts this year, especially among vulnerable populations, and also extending it to the general population. López-Acuña also calls for the mandatory use of masks in healthcare settings, healthcare centers, and pharmacies. Joan Caylà, a member of the Spanish Society of Epidemiology, emphasizes the need to strengthen vaccination efforts, especially among vulnerable populations, and notes that the new Flirt variant is more contagious than previous ones, although it does not appear to be more severe. He warns that the more contagious the virus is, the more hospitalizations will increase.

The article also notes that hospitalizations were at a pandemic low three weeks ago, but since hospitals are no longer required to report this data, it is no longer being tracked. Additionally, the article mentions that COVID-19 cases in wastewater are increasing, particularly in the West, which could potentially lead to an increase in deaths in the future.

**New COVID-19 Variant Represents 25% of Cases in the US**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the KP.3 variant of COVID-19 has become the dominant strain in the United States, representing 25% of cases over a two-week period from May 26 to June 8. This has displaced the JN.1 variant, which was the most common globally during the winter and now accounts for 22.5% of cases. The CDC uses the Nowcast tool to project the prevalence of COVID-19 variants over a two-week period, helping to estimate the current prevalence of variants, but not predicting future virus spread. The KP.3 variant is similar to other variants like JN.1 and KP.1.1/KP.2, but more information is expected from the CDC. Despite a decline in death and hospitalization rates, data shows an increase in positive test rates and emergency room visits. The CDC reported on June 4 that infections are growing or likely growing in 30 states. Health authorities continue to closely monitor the situation and update recommendations as needed. It is crucial to stay informed and follow public health guidelines to minimize virus spread.

**COVID-19 cases triple in three weeks, hospitalizations increase**
According to the Respiratory Infection Surveillance System of the Carlos III Health Institute, hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have increased from 2.2 to 3.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week. This represents a quarter of hospital admissions for acute respiratory infections in Spain, with a national average of 14 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The transmission records indicate that COVID-19 cases have tripled in three weeks, from 26 to almost 75 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, while the positivity rate of tests to detect the disease (12.5%) is twice that of positive cases of flu (6.6%). Additionally, COVID-19 is 12 times higher in detections of other viral diseases such as bronchiolitis (0.9%). The trend of COVID-19 continues to rise due to the advancement of omicron lineages and sublineages in recent months, which is behind most cases (80%) and is also detected in most hospitalizations. According to the Carlos III Health Institute report, since the start of the season, hospitalized COVID-19 cases have presented a 29.7% rate of pneumonia, a 4.2% rate of admission to intensive care units, and an 8.2% mortality rate in terms of hospital stay.

**Summer Surge in Mild COVID-19 Cases**
The number of coronavirus infections has increased significantly in the last month, with most cases being mild and similar to a common cold. The number of positive cases in hospitals has risen from 16.4% to 25.4% in the last week, and the hospitalization rate has increased from 2.2 to 3.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. However, this does not pose a problem for healthcare capacity. People over 65 and those with compromised immune systems should take extra precautions. The causes of the increase are attributed to the virus mutating and spreading, influenced by factors such as time since the previous infection, social interactions, and vaccinations. Dr. Rodrigo Abad, a family doctor, notes that 'many people think they have allergies due to increased pollen, but in reality, some of these cases are actually COVID-19'.

**Fourth Part of Respiratory Hospitalizations Linked to COVID-19**
The COVID-19 wave continues to increase, with a tripling of incidence in three weeks, reaching 74 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. As a result, a quarter of hospitalizations for acute respiratory infection in this period are linked to Sars-CoV-2 infection. According to the Respiratory Infection Surveillance System of the Carlos III Health Institute (May 27 to June 2), hospitalizations linked to COVID-19 have increased from 2.2 to 3.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. This represents a quarter of hospital admissions for acute respiratory infection in Spanish hospitals, with a national average of 14 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Transmission records show that COVID-19 cases have tripled in three weeks, from 26 to almost 75 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, while the positivity rate of tests to detect the disease (12.5%) is twice that of positive cases of flu (6.6%). Additionally, COVID-19 is 12 times higher in detections of other viral diseases such as bronchiolitis (0.9%). The upward trend of COVID-19 is maintained by the advancement of omicron lineages and sublineages (JN.1) in recent months, which is behind most cases (80%) and is also detected in most hospitalizations. In terms of severity, according to the Carlos III Health Institute report, since the start of the season, COVID-19 hospital cases have presented a 29.7% rate of pneumonia, a 4.2% rate of intensive care unit admission, and an 8.2% rate of hospital mortality.

**COVID-19–Associated Hospitalizations Among U.S. Adults Aged ≥65 Years — COVID-NET, 13 States, January–August 2023**
COVID-19 hospitalization rates among adults aged 65 and older in the US decreased from January to mid-July 2023, but increased again by August 26, 2023. This age group accounted for approximately half of all hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and in-hospital deaths. Most hospitalized adults aged 65 and older had multiple underlying medical conditions and had not received the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. The study suggests that COVID-19 continues to predominantly affect adults aged 65 and older and represents a continued public health threat. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccination, early antiviral treatment, and measures to reduce the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 to prevent hospitalization and severe outcomes in this high-risk age group.

**COVID-19 cases double in two weeks, with hospitalization rate higher than flu**
The number of COVID-19 cases has doubled in two weeks, with an indicator of 55 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and a hospitalization rate slightly higher than that of other respiratory viruses such as the flu or bronchitis. According to the weekly reports of the Respiratory Acute Infection Surveillance System (Sivira) of the Carlos III Health Institute, the number of hospitalizations related to COVID-19 has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, which is within a normal range but above the hospitalization rate of the flu, which has doubled in the last two weeks. The BA.2.86 omicron sublineage is behind the current wave of COVID-19, which has been gaining ground worldwide and has prompted the World Health Organization to ask pharmaceutical companies to adapt their vaccines. The incidence of respiratory infections, including COVID-19 and the flu, has fluctuated in Spain, with a slight decrease in hospitalization rates.
