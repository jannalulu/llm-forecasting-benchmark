**Africa: Mpox Outbreaks in Africa Constitute a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa on August 13, 2024, due to the worsening situation on the continent. Since 2022, 40,874 cases and 1,512 deaths have been reported across 15 African Union (AU) member states, with a 160% increase in cases and 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024. The outbreak is driven by heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers, and raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates are also concerns. The Africa CDC Director General was advised by the 15-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) to declare a PHECS, which was redefined as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread. The ECG developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively, including disease severity, transmission dynamics, and public health risk.

**Mpox Is ‘Not the New COVID,' WHO Official Says. Risk to U.S. Remains Low**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global public health emergency due to the growing mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding African countries. The new strain of the virus, clade 1b, is highly transmissible and has a higher fatality rate than the previous outbreak in 2022. However, the risk to the U.S. remains low, with no cases reported and the CDC maintaining a low risk assessment. WHO's European regional director Hans Kluge said, 'mpox is not the new COVID,' and that the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether are known. People considered at high risk for mpox infection should receive the Jynneos vaccine, which is effective against all clades of the mpox virus. The current outbreak is affecting a lot of children due to routine contact spreading the virus, and experts say it's unlikely to spread to the U.S. due to a lack of direct flights from the U.S. to the DRC and neighboring African countries.

**Europe's CDC releases mpox risk assessment after Swedish case detected**
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has released a risk assessment and updated guidance for mpox in Europe after a case of MPXV clade Ib was reported in Sweden. The ECDC stated that the likelihood of infection in the general population in the EU/EEA is very low, provided that imported cases are diagnosed promptly and control measures are implemented. However, the likelihood of infection for close contacts of possible or confirmed imported cases is assessed high. The ECDC also warned that the risk is high for EU/EEA citizens traveling to or living in nations most affected by mpox in Africa, especially if they have close contact with affected communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency and is committed to coordinating the global response to prevent transmission, treat those infected, and save lives.

**2023 Outbreak in DRC**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak is more widespread than any previous DRC outbreak and has spread to neighboring countries, including Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda. The WHO has assessed the risk to the general public in the United States as very low due to the limited number of travelers and no direct commercial flights from DRC or its neighboring countries to the US. People who have already had mpox or are fully vaccinated should be protected against the type of mpox spreading in DRC and neighboring countries. The best protection against mpox is two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine if eligible. CDC is working with Ministries of Health and in-country partners across the region on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, and risk communication and community engagement. The outbreak has been linked to contact with infected wild animals, household transmission, and patient care, as well as sexual contact among men who have sex with men and female sex workers and their contacts.

**Mpox Rapid Risk Assessment**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States. The overall risk to the general population is assessed as VERY LOW, with moderate confidence. The risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner and people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, is assessed as LOW to MODERATE. The CDC has moderate confidence in this assessment, citing uncertainties around epidemiologic and genomic data in DRC. The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States. The CDC will review available evidence every two weeks, or if the situation changes significantly, and update this assessment as warranted.

**Cross border movement, poor response capacity drivers of Mpox spread**
The Africa CDC has declared Mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa due to the high risk of spread between neighboring countries and globally. The agency highlights cross-border movement, low public understanding of Mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacity as major challenges. The agency also notes that the vaccine shortage is a serious threat to containment efforts, and many African countries are highly vulnerable to Mpox infection due to widespread malnutrition and the prevalence of HIV. 'The high case fatality rate of over 3.9 per cent, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60 per cent of cases, further complicates the outbreak,' the agency said. The agency reported that heterosexual sexual activities, particularly among sex workers in Congo, are a major driver of Mpox transmission. Africa CDC Director General Dr Jean Kaseya appealed to the international community to provide support, saying 'Don't punish Africa. We need solidarity, we need you to provide appropriate support, this vaccine is expensive.' The agency is currently in talks with Bavarian Nordic to transfer technology to enable African manufacturers to produce the vaccine locally, with a goal of having 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.

**WHO Again Declares Mpox Global Emergency — What Americans Need to Know**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global emergency due to the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its spread to at least 13 other African countries, with possible cases in Europe and Asia. The WHO has recorded over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa by 2024, exceeding the figures for 2023. The Africa CDC has confirmed 2,863 cases and 517 deaths across the continent, but there are more than 17,000 suspected cases. 'This is only the tip of the iceberg, given the many weaknesses in surveillance, testing and contact tracing,' an Africa CDC news release said. The WHO's new announcement comes a week after the U.S. CDC issued a health advisory saying that while the risk of this more severe form of mpox in the U.S. remains low, clinicians should 'increase their suspicion for mpox' in patients who have recently traveled to affected areas. The current outbreak is driven by a variant called 'clade I,' which is more severe than the variant responsible for the 2022 pandemic. Health officials point out that there are shortages of the vaccine in Africa, where the disease remains endemic. An estimated 10 million doses of vaccine are needed to address the current outbreak in the region, but only the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria have initiated regulatory measures to access supplies. In the United States, most cases of mpox are generally not life-threatening, but certain people are at higher risk for severe illness, including those with severely weakened immune systems, those with a history of eczema, pregnant women, and infants under the age of 1. Americans should avoid close skin contact with people who have a rash similar to mpox or animals that may carry the virus, and take precautions to reduce their risk when socializing or engaging in sexual activity.

**Mpox Virus Outbreak: Europe's Public Health Agency Warns Of 'More Imported Cases' In Coming Weeks**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk assessment for sporadic cases of mpox clade I in Europe to 'moderate'. According to ECDC director Pamela Rendi-Wagner, 'There will be more cases in the coming weeks. That's the expectation... But regarding the risk [for the] general European population, we have to say that our assessment is that the risk is very low at the moment.' The statement comes as the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency due to the ongoing outbreak in parts of Africa. Data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that over 2,000 new mpox cases have been reported across Africa in the past week alone, with a total of 38,465 cases and 1,456 deaths reported since January 2022.

**Mpox in Lower Saxony: Low Risk Assessed by State Health Office**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised its highest alert level due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa, but the Lower Saxony State Health Office (NLGA) assesses the risk for Lower Saxony as low. Since the increase in Mpox cases in Lower Saxony in May 2022, the number of cases has decreased significantly due to intensive public health efforts: there were 58 reported cases in 2022, 2 in 2023, and only one so far this year (as of August 14). The cases are related to the 2B clade, as reported by the authority. The new virus variant of the I clade, which is associated with the outbreak in Africa, has not been detected in Germany so far. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) currently assesses the risk to public health in Germany as low, and the NLGA agrees with this assessment. NLGA President Fabian Feil stated, 'The NLGA does not currently assess the risk for Lower Saxony as increased.' In cooperation with the health authorities and the RKI, the situation will be closely monitored. While a limited outbreak is still possible, a significant increase in cases like in 2022 is not expected, according to the RKI. As a precaution, unvaccinated individuals with high infection risks, such as adult men who engage in same-sex relationships and frequently change partners, as well as laboratory staff working with infectious laboratory samples, are advised to get vaccinated. Early detection of infections is crucial to prevent transmission. Healthcare professionals should include Mpox in the diagnosis for individuals with unclear pock-like skin changes, especially if they have recently returned from Central Africa. The virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and causes skin rash, fever, and can be fatal, especially for children. The smallpox vaccine also provides protection against Mpox infection.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Global Public Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) situation in Africa as a global public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed the total registered in 2023, with over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain the mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all. Last week, I convened the emergency committee to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in Africa. Today, the committee met and informed that, in their view, the situation constitutes a global public health emergency of international concern,' said Tedros. He reminded that the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) had already declared the mpox situation in the region as a public health emergency of continental security. The announcement was made yesterday (13) by the Director-General of the entity, Jean Kaseya, citing the rapid transmission of the disease in Africa. 'I accepted the committee's recommendation. The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination across Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded.

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency Over New Mpox Variant**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The WHO has activated its highest alert level, citing the risk of the Mpox virus spreading internationally again after 2022 and posing a health risk to several countries. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the decision was made after independent Mpox experts, who met in an emergency committee, recommended it. The WHO is not taking any concrete actions, but rather wants to alert authorities worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. A new virus variant, named Ib, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2023. It may be more contagious and cause more severe illness than previous variants. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' by the end of July. There are currently no known cases of the Klade I in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The Mpox virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and can cause skin rash, fever, and in severe cases, death, especially in children. The vaccine against smallpox also protects against Mpox. The African CDC has reported over 14,000 suspected cases and over 500 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries this year. The WHO expects less than 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide per month, but notes that many cases may go undetected due to lack of testing capacity. The WHO had previously declared a PHEIC for Mpox in July 2022, but lifted it in May 2023 after outbreaks were brought under control with vaccines in most countries. However, in Africa and other low-income countries, vaccine supply remains a challenge.

**WHO Declares Mpox Situation in Africa a Global Public Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox situation in Africa a global public health emergency due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed those in 2023, totaling over 14,000, with 524 deaths.

The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination throughout Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded. This is the first time the WHO has declared an emergency for mpox. In May 2023, the organization declared that mpox was no longer a global public health emergency. In July 2022, the WHO had declared a status of emergency due to the outbreak of the disease in several countries. 'Just as with COVID-19, the end of the emergency does not mean that the work is over. Mpox continues to present significant public health challenges that require a robust, proactive, and sustainable response,' declared Tedros at the time. 'Cases related to travel, recorded in all regions, demonstrate the ongoing threat. There is a risk, in particular, for people living with untreated HIV infection. It remains important for countries to maintain their testing capacity and efforts, assess risks, quantify response needs, and act promptly when necessary,' warned Tedros in 2023. Mpox is a viral zoonotic disease. Transmission to humans can occur through contact with infected wild animals, infected people, and contaminated materials. Symptoms typically include skin eruptions or skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes (inguinal), fever, body aches, headache, chills, and weakness. Lesions can be flat or slightly raised, filled with clear or yellowish liquid, and may form crusts that dry and fall off. The number of lesions can vary from a few to thousands. Eruptions tend to concentrate on the face, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet, but can occur anywhere on the body, including the mouth, eyes, genital organs, and anus.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Discuss Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an emergency committee in Geneva to discuss the recent outbreak of a concerning variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The committee, composed of independent experts, will determine if the risk of a larger outbreak exists and if the WHO should declare a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC). This is the highest level of alert for the WHO, but it does not trigger specific measures. Instead, it serves as a warning for governments worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' in late July. The African CDC has already declared the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries a public health emergency for the continent, which could lead to increased funding to support the affected countries in containing the outbreak. The WHO has changed the name of the disease from 'monkeypox' to simply 'Mpox' to avoid naming diseases after animals, regions, or countries. Since the end of 2023, numerous cases of a new subline of the Mpox virus, Klade I (Roman numeral one), have been discovered in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This variant may spread more easily and cause more severe disease outcomes, according to local observations. Studies are still ongoing. Mpox is characterized by a skin rash and fever, which can be life-threatening for young children. The disease has already spread to countries that had no previous cases, including Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda. 'The risk exists that the disease could reach distant countries,' said WHO Mpox expert Rosamund Lewis. The committee will meet virtually until 5 PM and a decision may be published shortly after.

**Mpox Rapid Risk Assessment**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States. The overall risk to the general population is assessed as VERY LOW, with moderate confidence. The risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner and people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, is assessed as LOW to MODERATE. The CDC has moderate confidence in this assessment, citing uncertainties around epidemiologic and genomic data in DRC. The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States. The CDC will review available evidence every two weeks, or if the situation changes significantly, and update this assessment as warranted.

**Brazilian Ministry of Health Convenes Meeting on Mpox Disease**
The Brazilian Ministry of Health has convened a meeting on Tuesday (13/8) to discuss the mpox disease, amid an increase in cases and the circulation of a new variant of the virus in Africa. According to the ministry, the meeting aims to update the recommendations and contingency plan for the disease in the country. 'A meeting with experts will be held on Tuesday to update the surveillance and medical assistance services', the ministry stated. The ministry also monitors the situation of mpox worldwide, following information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and institutions such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 'The risk assessment is that the event presents a low risk at this moment for Brazil', the ministry highlighted. Data from the ministry show that, in 2024, 709 cases of mpox have been reported in Brazil and 16 deaths, with the most recent death in April last year. Regarding vaccines against mpox, the ministry recalled that, in 2023, immunization against the disease was carried out in a public health emergency of international importance, with the use of doses authorized by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) on a provisional basis. 'If new evidence demonstrates the need for changes in the planning, the necessary actions will be taken and published in due time', the ministry concluded. The WHO has announced the convocation of an emergency committee to evaluate the scenario of the outbreak of the disease in Africa and the risk of international dissemination of the virus. The committee was convened due to the registration of cases of mpox outside the Democratic Republic of Congo, where infections have been increasing for over two years. The WHO has published an official document requesting vaccine manufacturers to submit requests for analysis for the emergency use of doses. The process was developed specifically to accelerate the availability of unlicensed supplies, but necessary in emergency public health situations. 'This is a recommendation with limited validity, based on a risk-benefit approach', the organization highlighted. The WHO also emphasized that the mpox disease requires supportive treatment to control symptoms as effectively as possible and prevent further complications. Most patients treated recover within a month, but the disease can be fatal if not treated. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the mortality rate of the existing strain is much higher than in West Africa, more than 479 people have died since the beginning of the year. The WHO has declared that the mpox disease no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international importance, similar to COVID-19. However, the organization emphasized that the end of the emergency does not mean that the work is over. The mpox disease continues to present significant public health challenges that require a robust, proactive, and sustainable response. 'Cases related to travel, registered in all regions, demonstrate the ongoing threat. There is a risk, in particular, for people living with untreated HIV infection. It is still important that countries maintain their testing capacity and efforts, assess risks, quantify needs for response, and act promptly when necessary', Tedros warned in 2023.

**The threat of mpox has returned, but public knowledge about it has declined**
Two years after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over an mpox outbreak, a deadlier version of the disease has spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to other African nations, and a resurgence of the original strain has been reported in the United States. Despite the renewed threat, public knowledge about mpox has declined significantly, according to a new survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center. The survey found that while 76% of respondents said they were 'very likely' or 'somewhat likely' to get an mpox vaccine if exposed in 2022, only 68% reported the same intention in 2024. However, 70% of respondents still believed that the benefits of vaccination against mpox outweighed the risks. The CDC has urged individuals to be vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine Jynneos four weeks apart, both for those exposed to mpox and for those with risk factors, such as men who have sex with men. 'The speed with which the public learned needed information about mpox in the summer of 2022 was a tribute to effective communication by the public health community,' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. 'That same expertise should now be deployed to ensure that those at risk remember mpox's symptoms, modes of transmission, and the protective power of vaccination.'
