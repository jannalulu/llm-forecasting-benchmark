The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying Taiwan's ADIZ data.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, did it happen? 

FORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 78.32%. Close, but not quite there. 

FORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Given the escalation since Lai's inauguration, it seemed likely. But the highest was just under the threshold.

FORECASTER 1  
(gesturing to the screen)  
China's been ramping up pressure, but not over 10 in a single day. Still, 10 a day is concerning. 

FORECASTER 2  
(sighing)  
With tensions so high, it's only a matter of time. But for now, our models remain accurate. 

The team exchanges knowing glances, aware of the fragile balance in the region.

*The room buzzes with quiet tension. SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B sit at a table, analyzing data.*

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, the question is whether more than 10 Chinese aircraft violated Taiwan's ADIZ yesterday.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
(nods, checking notes)  
Our models had it at 75.34%. Given the trends since Lai's inauguration, it’s not surprising.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Right. With the average hitting 10 violations per day recently, the escalation was expected.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
(sighs)  
China's intimidation tactics are consistent. But remember, our models are never wrong.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
(smiling slightly)  
Indeed. If yesterday saw a spike, it aligns with the post-inauguration pattern.

*They both look at the data, a shared understanding of the geopolitical tension.*

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
Let's confirm with the MND reports. If it happened, it’s another step in this ongoing chess game.

*They turn back to their screens, the weight of their predictions heavy in the air.*
