I'll systematically analyze the available evidence to forecast the August 2024 core CPI month-over-month percentage increase:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Trend Tracking
- July 2024 core CPI: 0.2% month-over-month
- June 2024 core CPI: 0.1% month-over-month
- Consistent recent pattern of modest increases

2. Contextual Signals
- Inflation gradually cooling
- Federal Reserve signaling potential rate cuts
- Housing/shelter costs still contributing significantly to inflation

3. Detailed Trend Assessment
- Core inflation showing gradual deceleration
- Year-over-year core CPI dropped from 3.3% to 3.2% in July
- Shelter prices continue to apply upward pressure

4. Key Risk Factors
- Potential energy price fluctuations
- Continued housing market dynamics
- Potential unexpected economic shifts

Probability Assessment Methodology:
- Base rate: Historical core CPI month-over-month increases typically range 0.1-0.3%
- Adjustment for current economic conditions
- Conservative estimate of probability for exceeding 0.5%

Weighing Competing Considerations:
- Structural disinflation pressures
- Potential economic volatility
- Federal Reserve's ongoing monitoring

Systematic Probability Calibration:
- Low probability of dramatic spike
- Higher likelihood of continued moderate increases
- Significant probability of staying below 0.5%

My Prediction: Between 0.15% and 0.35%, but 0.23% being the most likely. Probability: 12.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this step by step:

1. Recent Historical Context:
- July 2024 core CPI was 0.2% month-over-month
- June 2024 core CPI was 0.1% month-over-month
- There's a consistent recent trend of modest month-over-month increases

2. Key Contextual Factors:
- Federal Reserve is considering rate cuts in September
- Inflation is gradually decelerating toward 2% target
- Shelter costs continue to be a significant inflationary driver

3. Specific Trend Analysis:
- Recent articles suggest inflation is moderating
- Most forecasts expect continued 0.2% monthly increases
- Some variation exists in predictions (0.2% to 0.3%)

4. Risk Assessment:
- Upside risks: Shelter prices, potential energy price increases
- Downside risks: Weakening labor market, reduced consumer spending

5. Comparative Analysis:
- Previous months have been relatively stable
- No significant signals suggesting a dramatic spike

6. Probability Calibration:
- Likelihood of 0.5%+ seems low but not zero
- Most indicators point to continued modest increases

Weighing all evidence, I conclude the probability of exceeding 0.5% is relatively low.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical monthly core CPI percentage changes from recent articles range between -0.1% to 0.2%
- July 2024's core CPI increase was 0.2%
- June 2024's core CPI increase was 0.1%

Key Trend Indicators:
- Inflation is gradually decelerating
- Fed is contemplating rate cuts
- Shelter prices continue to be a significant driver of inflation
- Energy and food prices showing mixed movements

Causal Force Analysis:
Downward Pressures:
- Weakening consumer demand
- Softening labor market
- Fed's restrictive monetary policy
- Global economic slowdown

Upward Pressures:
- Housing/shelter costs persistent
- Potential energy price fluctuations
- Wage pressures
- Service sector inflation

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Recent trends suggest low probability of ≥0.5% monthly increase
- Significant economic disruption would be required to trigger such a high monthly increase

Risk Balancing:
- Overreacting to temporary fluctuations could skew forecast
- Need to maintain perspective on broader economic trends
