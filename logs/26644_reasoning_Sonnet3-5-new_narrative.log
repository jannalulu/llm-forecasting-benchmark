Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, another prediction window closed. The Spanish Wikipedia article count during that September period..."

Philip: [interrupting] "Our models had it at 12.45%. The growth rate was steady but not quite fast enough to hit 2 million in that narrow timeframe."

Nate: "Looking at the historical data from June 2023 to June 2024, they added about 101,631 articles. Even with that consistent growth..."

Philip: "Exactly. The probability was low but not negligible. The pattern suggested they'd hit 2 million by late October or early November 2024, just missing our window."

Nate: "The precision of our models continues to amaze me. We could see the trajectory months in advance."

[Both nod, turning back to their screens as the scene fades]

Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like the Spanish Wikipedia didn't quite hit 2 million articles during that two-week window in September."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.45%. The growth rate was steady but just too slow to reach that milestone in such a narrow timeframe."

Nate: "Looking at the historical data, they added about 100,000 articles annually in recent years. Even with the slight acceleration we observed in early 2024, hitting 2 million between September 15th and October 1st was always going to be a stretch."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The data suggested late October or early November was more likely. These milestone predictions are fascinating - they're like watching continental drift in the digital age."

[Both chuckle and return to their screens]

Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "So, the Spanish Wikipedia milestone window has closed. What did your models show, Phil?"

Tetlock: [adjusting his glasses] "Based on the growth patterns we analyzed up to July 26th, our models had it at 12.45%. The trajectory was steady but just not quite fast enough for that specific window."

Nate: "Fascinating. Looking at the historical data - about 100,000 articles per year since 2022 - it suggested they'd hit 2 million closer to December 2024."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The growth rate from June 2023 to June 2024 was consistent with previous years. While they were close at 1.97 million in June, the two-week window in September was just too narrow."

[Both nod in agreement as they update their forecasting models]
