**Western Countries Intervene in ICC Case Against Netanyahu and Gallant**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague is considering issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Joav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza. However, a number of Western countries, including the US, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Germany, have intervened, submitting legal appeals to the court to reconsider issuing the warrants. They argue that the warrants should not be issued, at least not yet. According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, the countries submitted their objections on Tuesday, just before the deadline set by the court. 'The ICC should not issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant,' said a spokesperson for the German government, 'at least not until all the facts have been thoroughly examined.' The move has been met with criticism from experts, who see it as an attempt to shield the Israeli government from accountability.

**UK drops objection to ICC arrest warrant against Netanyahu**
The United Kingdom has dropped its objection to the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. The ICC issued the warrant on May 20, 2024, citing war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip from October 8, 2023. The UK's decision follows a change in government, with new Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government deciding not to pursue the proposal to question the ICC's jurisdiction. The move is seen as a significant moment, clearing the way for the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leaders.

**UK Withdraws Objection to ICC Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
The British government, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, has withdrawn its objection to the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to British media, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister's office stated that the new government will not continue to object to the previous government's stance, citing that the issue 'concerns the work of the court'. The spokesperson emphasized that the government's decision 'does not represent an objection or an approval' of the ICC's case against Netanyahu. The government believes in the 'power of the rule of law and separation of powers', and the court should make independent decisions. In May, Sunak stated, 'The court should be able to make its decision when the time is right... I support the court and international law.' In May, Karim Khan requested the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant on several charges, including 'crimes against humanity' in Gaza.

The previous British government, led by Rishi Sunak, had previously expressed reservations about the ICC's request, which was met with approval from senior Israeli officials.

According to the New York Times, the British government is expected to withdraw its previous objections to the International Criminal Court's request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ICC had delayed its decision on the matter in June, after the UK submitted a 'friendly' request against the court's jurisdiction in the case.

The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, had requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant on May 20, 2024, citing evidence that they are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Palestinian territories (in the Gaza Strip) since at least October 8, 2023.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had considered stopping in Europe on his way to the US, but abandoned the plan due to concerns that the International Criminal Court (ICC) might issue an arrest warrant for him. ICC chief prosecutor Kharim Khan had requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes in May. Since then, judges have been considering whether there are legitimate grounds to issue arrest warrants. If so, the ICC's 124 member states would be obliged to arrest Netanyahu if he were to set foot on their soil. Instead, Netanyahu will travel to the US with a limited entourage and is expected to address Congress on July 24.

The new UK Labour government, led by Keir Starmer, is expected to support the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to The Guardian, the previous government, led by Rishi Sunak, had objected to the ICC's jurisdiction over Israeli citizens and had filed an appeal on June 10, but this appeal was shared with the public two weeks later. ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan had requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The ICC's pre-trial chamber had given the UK government until July 12 to submit its entire appeal, but it now appears unlikely that the new Starmer government will continue to support this appeal.

**Israel Threatens to Release Anyone Detained by International Criminal Court**
Israel has threatened to release anyone detained by the International Criminal Court. According to Yaron Abraham, a political correspondent, the government will work to release anyone detained by the court in any way possible, including through violence or military means. The proposed law would ban the court's activities in Palestine and prohibit any cooperation with the court, including from state institutions, judges, and any other party, and would be conditional on the approval of a designated official from the Justice Minister. The proposal also prohibits the entry of court teams into Israel to prevent them from gathering information and prohibits cooperation with the court, not only from official institutions but also from individuals and organizations. Anyone who violates this will face financial penalties. The proposal comes as Tel Aviv is experiencing growing anxiety awaiting the International Criminal Court's decision on issuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant. According to Haaretz newspaper, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expects the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants against him and Defense Minister Yoav Galant before July 24, 2024. The newspaper reported that Netanyahu discussed the possibility of the court responding to the prosecutor's request and issuing arrest warrants against him and Galant during a meeting. It is worth noting that the International Criminal Court prosecutor, Karim Khan, had requested on May 20, 2024, the issuance of arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Galant for their responsibility for 'war crimes' and 'crimes against humanity' in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023.

In May 2024, the prosecutor requested the pre-trial chamber to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The prosecutor emphasized that the evidence collected suggests that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Palestinian territories (in the Gaza Strip) since at least October 2023.

**Netanyahu Expects ICC Arrest Warrant Soon**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expects the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for him and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant soon. This comes after the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted a request to the court in May. Netanyahu stated that the court will likely approve the request and issue an arrest warrant soon, possibly before his trip to the United States to address the US Congress on July 24. He added that the closer it gets to the date when the request was submitted, the closer the decision will be made. According to Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, it is not unlikely that the arrest warrant will be issued secretly to prevent interference with the proceedings. 123 countries have signed the Rome Statute, which defines the ICC's powers in The Hague. These countries are expected to enforce the arrest warrant and detain those against whom it is issued, putting Netanyahu at risk of being arrested if his plane is forced to land in a country that has signed the Rome Statute.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expects the International Court of Justice (ICC) to issue arrest warrants for him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant by July 24 for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. The ICC prosecutor requested the warrants on May 20. Netanyahu convened a meeting with top officials to discuss the possibility of the ICC issuing the warrants.

**Will the International Criminal Court Issue an Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu Before His Visit to Washington?**
According to Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to be issued an international arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) before his upcoming visit to Washington on July 24. The ICC is expected to issue the warrant in the coming weeks, according to a report. The report also stated that the Israeli government is preparing a 'defensive letter' to respond to the ICC's decision. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant are expected to be issued the warrant, which would be a significant blow to their personal and professional reputations. The report also mentioned that the US is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, but is discussing a 'weak but possible' scenario for Netanyahu's plane to be diverted to a country that is a signatory to the treaty. The Israeli government has denied any concerns about Netanyahu's travel plans. In the past, Israeli intelligence agencies have been accused of spying on high-ranking officials at the ICC, including the former chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and the current prosecutor Karim Khan, and their teams.

**Netanyahu Claims ICC Will Issue Arrest Warrant for Him and Defense Minister Gallant**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue an arrest warrant for him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant soon. According to Yedioth Ahronoth, Netanyahu made this statement during a meeting with Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, and ICC Prosecutor Gali Baharav-Miara. Netanyahu claimed that the decision will be made before his speech at the US Congress on July 24. Israeli officials are concerned about the decision and expect it to be made by January. The ICC may issue the decision secretly, but considering the prosecutor's public statement, it is likely that the decision will be made public. ICC Prosecutor Kerim Han stated that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity since October 8, 2023, and that they have committed crimes such as intentionally causing great suffering, killing, and torture. Han also stated that the Israeli government has used food as a weapon against the Palestinian people, causing widespread and systematic attacks on civilians. He emphasized that the Israeli government's actions are a violation of international humanitarian law and that they will be held accountable.

**Netanyahu Claims ICC Will Soon Issue Arrest Warrant for Him and Defense Minister**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will soon issue an arrest warrant for him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to Yedioth Ahronoth, Netanyahu made this statement during a meeting on May 20, where ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan presented his request for an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The meeting was attended by Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. Netanyahu claims that the warrant will be issued before his speech at the US Congress on July 24. Israeli officials are concerned about the potential consequences of the warrant, with some predicting it will be issued by January. The ICC may also issue the warrant secretly to avoid interfering with the trial. However, given that Khan presented his request publicly, it is likely that the warrant will be made public. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor accused Netanyahu and Gallant of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including intentionally causing great suffering or serious bodily harm to civilians, and intentionally attacking the civilian population. He also accused them of using food as a weapon, restricting the passage of basic necessities to the Gaza Strip, and attacking humanitarian workers and organizations. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor emphasized that Israel's actions in Gaza are a violation of international humanitarian law and that the Israeli military's use of force is excessive and disproportionate.

**ICC Expected to Issue International Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
According to Israeli sources, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is expected to issue an international arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu within the next few weeks, before his planned visit to Washington to address the US Congress. The ICC is considering a request from the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue a warrant for Netanyahu's arrest, along with his associate, Gantz, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The Israeli government is preparing a defense statement in response to the expected warrant. Despite the US not being a signatory to the Rome Statute, discussions are underway regarding a scenario where Netanyahu's plane makes an emergency landing in a country that is a signatory to the treaty. Israeli officials believe that most countries that have signed the Rome Statute will respect the ICC's decision and enforce it. Netanyahu's office has denied any concern about his travel plans, stating 'there is no concern about the Prime Minister's trips'.

**ICC May Issue Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Galant in Coming Weeks**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may face arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the coming weeks, along with Defense Minister Yoav Galant, according to sources. The ICC is expected to respond to the prosecutor's request and issue arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Galant. Netanyahu believes that the court will respond to the request and issue arrest warrants soon, possibly before his trip to the US Congress on July 24. However, there is no indication of any other direction. Legal experts estimate that most countries will respect the expected ICC decision and execute it. In reality, the closer the date of the prosecutor's request - May 20 - the closer the expected decision. However, there is no specific date. In the ICC's previous cases, it has taken up to a month for the court to issue arrest warrants. For example, it took a month for the court to issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since the prosecutor's request was made publicly, it is likely that the court's decision will also be public and not secret. At the same time, it is not ruled out that the arrest warrants may have been issued secretly to prevent interference with the proceedings. Both Israel and individuals subject to arrest warrants have the option to go to court and present arguments to cancel the arrest warrants. 123 countries have signed the Rome Statute, which defines the ICC's jurisdiction in The Hague. These countries are expected to implement the decision and arrest those subject to arrest warrants.

**Netanyahu and his wife face possibility of international arrest warrants**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara are facing the possibility of international arrest warrants being issued against them. According to Israeli sources, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is expected to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, in the coming days. The ICC is investigating allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 2014 Gaza war. Netanyahu has been accused of being involved in the war crimes and has denied any wrongdoing. The ICC has been investigating the allegations since 2019 and has gathered evidence from various sources, including testimony from witnesses and documents. The ICC has not yet made a formal decision on the matter, but it is expected to do so in the coming days. If the ICC issues arrest warrants, it would be a major blow to Netanyahu's government and could lead to international pressure on Israel to comply with the court's decision.

**Netanyahu Expects ICC to Issue Arrest Warrant Soon**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that he expects the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue an arrest warrant for him and Defense Minister Yoav Galant soon. This comes after ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan submitted a request to the court in May to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Galant, and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu said that the court will likely approve the request and issue the warrants soon, possibly before his trip to the United States to address the US Congress on July 24. He added that the closer the court gets to the date when the request was submitted, the closer it is to making a decision. According to Haaretz, it is not ruled out that the warrants will be issued secretly to prevent interference with the proceedings. 123 countries have signed the Rome Statute, which defines the ICC's powers in The Hague. These countries are expected to enforce the warrant and detain those against whom it is issued, putting Netanyahu at risk of being arrested if his plane is forced to land in a country that has signed the Rome Statute.

Israel is preparing for the possibility of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant. The Israeli Broadcasting Authority stated that 'discussions are taking place in Israel regarding a potential defense strategy for Netanyahu and Galant in the event the ICC issues arrest warrants'. The authority added that 'Israel is preparing for the worst-case scenario, where the ICC judges issue arrest warrants, and therefore, a potential defense strategy is being discussed, but no decision has been made yet'. The ICC has published a statement in Hebrew, Arabic, and English explaining its procedures, stating that 'after collecting evidence and identifying the suspects, the prosecutor will submit a request to the ICC judges to issue an arrest warrant, which national authorities will then execute, or summon the suspects to appear before the court voluntarily'. This is the fourth time since June that the ICC has published a statement on its social media accounts. In May, the ICC prosecutor announced that he had requested the court to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel has rejected the decision and it is unclear how it will respond if the arrest warrants are issued.

According to Israeli media, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is expected to make a decision on the arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant within 10 days. The ICC is investigating them for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli government is discussing how to convince the judges to prevent the issuance of the arrest warrants. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested the issuance of arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant, accusing them of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip since October 8, 2023, after Hamas launched an attack on Israel.
