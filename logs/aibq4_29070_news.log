**Spirit Airlines is not going bankrupt . . . yet**
Spirit Airlines has temporarily avoided bankruptcy after submitting an 8-K filing to the SEC, which clarifies that it's not going bankrupt just yet. The company has extended the deadline on its existing debt refinancing plan with Visa and Mastercard from October 21 to December 23. According to the filing, Spirit expects to end the year 2024 with over $1 billion of liquidity. Despite this, the low-cost carrier is still saddled with over $3 billion in debt and faces a looming deadline of $1.1 billion in secured bonds due in less than a year.

**Spirit Airlines Extends Debt Refinancing Deadline Hours Before Expiration**
Spirit Airlines announced on Friday that it has reached an agreement with its credit card processor to extend the refinancing debt timeline until December, just hours before the original deadline. According to Spirit, the company has withdrawn its $300 million revolving credit facility and expects to end the year with over $1 billion in liquidity. Spirit stated in a presentation on Friday, 'As previously disclosed, the Company is actively engaged in constructive discussions with the holders of its 2025 senior secured notes and 2026 senior convertible notes with respect to their respective maturities.' The airline's stock closed at a new low on Friday, falling approximately 3% to under $1.50 per share. Spirit has been taking cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, reduced schedules, and delayed aircraft deliveries. The airline has also grounded many of its planes due to a Pratt & Whitney engine recall and reported weaker-than-expected bookings. Additionally, its planned acquisition by JetBlue Airways was blocked by a federal judge due to antitrust concerns. Spirit's stock has fallen over 90% so far this year and nearly 40% in October alone. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the airline is considering filing for bankruptcy.

**Spirit Airlines retires A319 fleet as it seeks to cut losses as bankruptcy looms**
Spirit Airlines is retiring its remaining Airbus A319 fleet as it seeks to cut losses and potentially avoid bankruptcy. According to Ishtron, all A319 flights will end on January 8, 2025, with the last flight being NK262 from San Juan to Fort Lauderdale on that date. The move contradicts Spirit's previous fleet plan, which showed the A319 would be retired in the second quarter of 2025. The airline has been impacted by the Pratt & Whitney issue affecting A320neo aircraft and faces a $3.3 billion debt burden, with over $1.1 billion in secured bonds set to mature within a year. Spirit is exploring restructuring options, including an out-of-court transaction, and has entered discussions with bondholders regarding a potential bankruptcy filing.

**Transportation | Spirit Airlines sidesteps report of potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, remains focused on overhauling debt**
Spirit Airlines has denied a report that it is discussing a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing with creditors. The airline's CEO, Ted Christie, said in August that they are engaged in productive conversations with bondholders to address upcoming debt maturities, but did not provide further details. Spirit has until October 21 to refinance $1.1 billion in bonds due in 2025, and has been facing challenges including a manufacturer's recall of flawed engines and financial losses. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth expects Spirit to work out a deal with bondholders, saying 'An agreement with bondholders appears increasingly likely.' However, Spirit's common stock has fallen to a record low of $1.67, and the company has been fighting a range of problems since a federal judge rejected JetBlue Airways' proposed $3.8 billion takeover in January.

**Spirit Airlines' Shares Plunge 30% Amid Reports of Potential Bankruptcy Filing**
Spirit Airlines' shares plummeted 30% after a report by The Wall Street Journal that the company is in talks with creditors about the terms of a potential bankruptcy filing. The airline is also exploring restructuring its balance sheet through an out-of-court transaction, although recent negotiations have focused on reaching an agreement with creditors and other stakeholders to support a bankruptcy filing, according to the WSJ. Spirit Airlines' CEO, Ted Christie, stated during a conference call on the company's second-quarter results that the company was in talks with its creditors' advisors to evaluate debts with shorter maturities in 2025 and 2026. 'As these conversations are ongoing, we won't go into details or respond to questions about this matter, nor speculate on possible outcomes,' Christie said, adding that this was a priority and that the company was focused on ensuring the 'best outcome for the business as quickly as possible.' This news comes months after Christie said the airline was not considering bankruptcy and was 'excited' about its plan created after the JetBlue deal fell through. In March, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines canceled a $3.8 billion merger agreement after a US judge blocked the deal in January due to concerns over antitrust issues. If the deal had gone through, it would have created the fifth-largest airline in the US, giving Spirit Airlines a chance to survive in a challenging time with debt and cash burn.

**Frontier Airlines Reportedly Mulls New Bid For Spirit Airlines Amid Bankruptcy Discussions**
Frontier Airlines is reportedly considering a new bid for Spirit Airlines, according to the Wall Street Journal. This comes as Spirit engages in discussions with bondholders regarding the terms of a potential bankruptcy filing. The talks between the two budget airlines about a possible merger are still in the early stages, and a deal may not materialize. This development follows Spirit's cancellation of its merger agreement with JetBlue Airways in March 2024, which was blocked by a U.S. court in January 2024 due to anti-competition concerns.

**With Spirit Airlines avoiding bankruptcy (for now), here are some cheap flights**
Spirit Airlines has managed to restructure its debt, avoiding bankruptcy for now. The airline is currently offering a 'Create Your Own Fall Break' sale with discounted rates on travel between Oct. 28 and Jan. 21, 2025. The lowest fares start at $45 each way, with options for flights between nearby cities and longer routes. The sale lasts until Oct. 22, but excludes block-out dates including the holiday period and Thanksgiving. The fares are for Spirit's base 'Go' fare, which does not include baggage or seat selection. Spirit asks travelers to 'ditch the same ole, same ole' and make lasting memories. The airline has also introduced a new fare model, with 'Go' being the closest to its initial model and 'Go Big' mirroring business class on a mainstream airline.

**Spirit Airlines stock soars 40% because it's not going bankrupt yet**
Spirit Airlines' stock surged by 42% in pre-market trading after the company announced it had pushed back its deadline to refinance $1.1 billion in debt to December 23. Spirit also revealed it had borrowed the full $300 million from a revolving credit facility that matures in September 2026. The airline expects to end 2024 with over $1 billion in liquidity. This news comes after speculation that Spirit might file for bankruptcy, which caused its stock to plummet earlier this month. Despite efforts to turn around the company, including eliminating fees and improving seating, Spirit has struggled to compete with larger airlines and has incurred significant losses. The company has taken measures to save $100 million this year, including deferring airplane deliveries and offering unpaid leaves of absence to flight attendants.

**Spirit Airlines Skyrockets On Cash Boost; Rivals Fall**
Spirit Airlines has borrowed $300 million from a credit facility, increasing its liquidity to over $1 billion. This move likely delays a potential bankruptcy filing, allowing the airline to continue competing in the market. Spirit Airlines stock surged 31% on the news, while JetBlue Airways and Frontier Airlines fell 6.3% and 3.9% respectively. The cash infusion is a result of Spirit Airlines draining its credit facility, which it expects to pay back by September 2026. This development means that Spirit Airlines can continue to operate without a bankruptcy filing, at least in the near term.

**Spirit Airlines Struggles To Regain Altitude As Competitors Soar, Bankruptcy Concerns Intensify - United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE)**
Spirit Airlines is facing financial struggles and potential bankruptcy concerns after the failed JetBlue merger and mounting debt pressures. The airline is expediting the retirement of its Airbus A319 fleet, with final flights scheduled for January 8, 2025, and is in talks with bondholders to address its $1.1 billion in secured bonds coming due within a year. Spirit's stock has plummeted 90% year-to-date, trading at $1.63, and the company hasn't generated an annual profit since before the pandemic. In contrast, the airline sector is enjoying a resurgence, with United Airlines reporting strong third quarter earnings and announcing a $1.5 billion stock buyback. Spirit's future remains uncertain, with a planned 20% capacity reduction in the fourth quarter and operational challenges, including the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines, forcing part of its fleet to be grounded.

**Spirit Airlines: Should We Expect an Imminent Bankruptcy?**
Spirit Airlines is in talks with its bondholders to determine the conditions for a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, following the failure of its merger attempt with JetBlue Airways, which led to a 30% drop in its stock price. The airline is also considering a pre-packaged bankruptcy, but the ongoing discussions focus on a deal with creditors to initiate a judicial restructuring process under Chapter 11, according to the Wall Street Journal. Spirit's CEO, Ted Christie, had previously stated that the company did not want to file for bankruptcy and was satisfied with the measures taken, but later indicated that Spirit Airlines was in talks with its creditors to address its upcoming financial obligations. Despite a rebound in the stock price since its drop last Friday, it remains below its previous level. InvestingPro models indicate a potential 10% increase, which could help the stock recover some of its losses.

**Spirit Airlines May File for Bankruptcy Amid JetBlue Acquisition Talks**
Spirit Airlines, a low-cost American airline operating in Colombia, may file for bankruptcy. This comes as JetBlue's stock rose 16% on Friday, after offering $3.8 billion for Spirit. The acquisition would make JetBlue the fifth-largest airline in the US. Spirit's board has yet to comment on the reported information, but their CEO, Ted Christie, mentioned in August that they were having 'productive conversations' with bondholders about their debts. 'We are having productive conversations with our bondholders,' Christie said, 'and we are working to address their concerns.'

**Spirit Airlines May Declare Bankruptcy Amid Financial Struggles**
Spirit Airlines, a low-cost airline operating in Colombia, may declare bankruptcy according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The airline is facing significant financial losses despite high demand for flights. Spirit Airlines has a debt of over $3 billion and is committed to refinancing $1.1 billion in loyalty program bonds that mature in 2025. The airline's stock price plummeted 26.1% after the report was released, with shares trading at $1.66 per title. Spirit Airlines is in 'dialogue with its creditors about the conditions that could lead to a potential bankruptcy,' and is discussing a potential restructuring agreement under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law. This news comes after JetBlue announced its purchase of Spirit Airlines in March, and the information led to a surge in JetBlue's stock price, reaching over $3.8 billion. Spirit Airlines has been successful in Colombia due to its low fares and flexible pricing structure, which allows passengers to choose additional services such as baggage fees, seat selection, and in-flight meal purchases. The airline has announced flights without layovers from Fort Lauderdale to Barranquilla, with prices starting at $84 for the Carnaval de Barranquilla, which will take place from February 10-13, 2025. According to Spirit Airlines, this has led to a 52% increase in flights to Colombia. 'Barranquilla is a dynamic community all year round, but it truly shines during the Carnaval de Barranquilla and attracts visitors from around the world to join in the celebration,' said Camilo Martelo, Director of International Stations at Spirit Airlines. 'The non-stop service to the Colombian city 'connects residents of southern Florida with family and friends in Barranquilla and makes it easier to discover and celebrate one of Colombia's most iconic carnivals.'

**Low cost carrier Spirit Airlines struggles to avoid bankruptcy**
Spirit Airlines is struggling to avoid bankruptcy after months of talks with bondholders failed to result in a deal. The company is seeking new financing from its creditors and an exchange that would extend its current debt. Without a deal, Spirit would be forced into bankruptcy, posing challenges as it would be unclear who would take control. Spirit's shares sank as much as 42% in premarket trading, and its 'loyalty bonds' declined as much as 6 cents on the dollar. The company has until October 21 to reach a deal to extend or refinance bonds due 2025 to maintain a key partnership with US Bank. As one person said, 'Terms that still need to be worked out include which assets bondholders would have a claim on and how much new financing would be provided.'

**Spirit Airlines sees bankruptcy on the radar**
Spirit Airlines is exploring the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, this is not imminent, and the airline could potentially reorganize its $3.3 billion debt load, as Scandinavian Airlines and Delta did in the past. Spirit's immediate concern is its $1.1 billion worth of secured bonds due within a year, which have an Oct. 21 deadline to be extended or refinanced. The airline has faced turbulence in 2024, including a federal judge striking down a $3.8 billion merger with JetBlue, furloughing 186 pilots, grounding a portion of its fleet, and abandoning dozens of routes. Spirit's stock is down nearly 90% YTD and plummeted more than 30% in after hours trading on Thursday. As the airline reported its 11th consecutive quarterly loss in August, it remains to be seen whether Spirit can recover from its struggles.

The airline has already taken steps to reduce its capacity by 20% in the last quarter of the year and has laid off 186 pilots. Spirit Airlines was previously close to merging with JetBlue Airways, but the deal was blocked by a federal judge in January due to concerns that it would reduce competition and harm consumers.

Spirit Airlines' stock (NYSE: SAVE) fell on Friday after reports that the company is considering filing for bankruptcy. According to the Wall Street Journal, Spirit has been in talks with bondholders and creditors about supporting a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.

The company has reported losses in nearly every quarter since February 2020, with a net loss of $157.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. Spirit does not pay dividends, but has other ways to return value to shareholders, such as share buyback programs.

**Spirit Airlines stock falls on report of potential bankruptcy filing**
Spirit Airlines' stock plummeted after a report from The Wall Street Journal stated that the airline was in discussions with bondholders about potentially filing for bankruptcy. The airline has been struggling to return to profitability following the COVID pandemic and its failed merger with JetBlue. According to the report, Spirit Airlines is in dire financial straits and is trying to secure a financial lifeline. The airline has until October 21st to reach a deal to extend or refinance bonds due next year in 2025 to maintain its partnership with US Bank concerning its loyalty credit card. The implications of Spirit Airlines' potential bankruptcy filing are significant, not just for the airline itself, but also for the broader airline industry and consumers. As the industry shifts towards a more premium experience, smaller players like Spirit Airlines are struggling to compete with larger carriers. JetBlue, for example, is investing billions of dollars to create lounges and premium experiences, while also dealing with its own backlog of aircraft deliveries. The experience for consumers is unlikely to change overnight, and the industry is facing significant challenges in the coming years.

**What's Going On With Spirit Airlines Stock Friday? - Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE)**
Spirit Airlines' stock is declining on Friday after a report suggested the company is exploring the possibility of filing for bankruptcy. According to the Wall Street Journal, Spirit has been in talks with bondholders and creditors regarding support for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This comes after a federal district court judge blocked the company's merger with JetBlue in January. Spirit has reported losses in almost every quarter since February 2020 and has begun shrinking its operations, cutting dozens of routes for November and December, and planning to shrink its capacity by almost 20% during the fourth quarter. Spirit does not pay a dividend, but it has a buyback program, which can serve as a support for share prices. As of writing, Spirit stock is trading 26.8% lower at $1.63.

This comes after a federal district court judge blocked the company's merger with JetBlue in January. Spirit has reported losses in almost every quarter since February 2020, with an adjusted net loss of $157.9 million in the 2024 fiscal-year second quarter. Spirit does not pay a dividend, but it has a buyback program that can support share prices. 'Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand,' said an investor. However, the company's financial struggles and potential bankruptcy filing may make it a riskier investment.

**Spirit stock tumbles amid reported bankruptcy talks**
Spirit Airlines is considering a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as part of a restructuring plan, according to reports. The news sent shares tumbling over 40% in after-hours trading to $1.36. Spirit CEO Ted Christie said the airline is focused on driving cash flow generation and profitability, but has been hit hard by a recall of Pratt & Whitney engines and increased competition. The airline's debt burden is currently at $3.3 billion, and it has posted 11 consecutive quarterly losses. Spirit is also exploring an out-of-court agreement with creditors as an alternative to bankruptcy.

**Spirit Airlines stock plunges after report it's considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy**
Spirit Airlines' stock plummeted 36% in premarket trading on Friday after a report that it may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The airline is struggling with heavy losses and a $3.3 billion debt load, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds due within the next year. However, CEO Ted Christie said that Spirit is exploring restructuring options and that a Chapter 11 filing is not imminent. While a bankruptcy filing is not a death sentence for the airline, it can provide a lifeline for managing debt and finances. Spirit has been struggling with annual losses since before the COVID-19 pandemic and has cut routes, furloughed pilots, and shrunk its operational capacity by nearly 20%.

**Spirit Airlines May File for Bankruptcy, WSJ Reports**
Spirit Airlines, an American airline, may initiate bankruptcy proceedings and is discussing this step with its bondholders, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing informed sources. The company's debt is approximately $3.3 billion, and it needs to pay off bonds worth over $1.1 billion in the next year. Despite a recovery in air travel demand in recent years, Spirit and other budget airlines continue to face difficulties, WSJ reports. Spirit's operations are being reduced, with the airline recently announcing the cancellation of dozens of flights in November and December. The airline is also one of the carriers most severely affected by the recall of hundreds of Pratt & Whitney engines, which has prevented it from using part of its fleet this year. In March 2024, Spirit and JetBlue, which had planned a merger, were forced to terminate the deal due to lack of approval from US regulators. Spirit's stock price fell by 30.4% in additional trading on Thursday following the publication of WSJ's article. The company's market capitalization has decreased by 86% since the beginning of 2024.

**Spirit Airlines Struggles to Reach Rescue Deal to Avoid Bankruptcy**
Spirit Airlines' efforts to restructure its debt and avoid bankruptcy have stalled after months of talks with bondholders failed to result in a deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company is seeking new financing from its creditors and an exchange that would extend its current debt, but terms such as which assets bondholders would have a claim on and how much new financing would be provided are still unclear. Without a deal, Spirit would be forced into bankruptcy, posing challenges as it would be unclear who would take control. Spirit has been seeking a financial lifeline since a federal judge blocked its proposed sale to JetBlue Airways Corp. in January due to antitrust concerns. The company has until October 21 to reach a deal to extend or refinance bonds due 2025 to maintain a key partnership with US Bank concerning its loyalty credit card, according to a filing. As one person said, 'Terms that still need to be worked out include which assets bondholders would have a claim on and how much new financing would be provided.'

**Spirit Airlines' Shares Plunge 30% Amid Reports of Potential Bankruptcy Filing**
Spirit Airlines' shares plummeted 30% after a report by The Wall Street Journal that the company is in talks with creditors about the terms of a potential bankruptcy filing. The airline is also exploring restructuring its balance sheet through an out-of-court transaction, although recent negotiations have focused on reaching an agreement with creditors and other stakeholders to support a bankruptcy filing, according to the WSJ. Spirit Airlines' CEO, Ted Christie, stated during a conference call on the company's second-quarter results that the company was in talks with its creditors' advisors to evaluate debts with shorter maturities in 2025 and 2026. 'As these conversations are ongoing, we won't go into details or respond to questions about this matter, nor speculate on possible outcomes,' Christie said, adding that this was a priority and that the company was focused on ensuring the 'best outcome for the business as quickly as possible.' This news comes months after Christie said the airline was not considering bankruptcy and was 'excited' about its plan created after the JetBlue deal fell through. In March, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines canceled a $3.8 billion merger agreement after a US judge blocked the deal in January due to concerns over antitrust issues. If the deal had gone through, it would have created the fifth-largest airline in the US, giving Spirit Airlines a chance to survive in a challenging time with debt and cash burn.
