**When Will the Presidential Race Be Called? Here's What to Know.**
The 2024 presidential election is expected to be a close race, and the outcome may not be known until several days after Election Day. In 2020, the Associated Press did not call the winner of the presidential election until Saturday, November 7, due to the time required to count mail ballots. This year, the composition of the early and mail vote is likely to be less disproportionately Democratic, but partisan disparities within each voting method will still exist. The earliest indications of how the night is going will come in Georgia and North Carolina shortly after 7 p.m. Eastern, but the outcome may not be clear until later in the night or even the next day, depending on the closeness of the race. As Nate Cohn, The Times's chief political analyst, said, 'The initial picture is incomplete, and it takes a few days to become clear.'

**Nate Silver on Politically Georgia: ‘Gut is useless’ at predicting elections**
Nate Silver, a statistician known for accurately predicting several recent election outcomes, stated that the 2024 presidential race is 'highly uncertain' with one week left until Election Day. Silver emphasized that relying on one's 'gut' to predict a winner is 'useless' when it comes to forecasting elections. He noted that the election is 'very close' and that the outcome may not be known for a couple of days after November 5. Silver's own gut is leaning towards former President Donald Trump, but he advises against trusting gut instincts in election predictions.

**The 2024 US Presidential Election: A 50-50 Proposition**
Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight, discusses the current state of the US presidential election. Despite polls showing a close race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Silver believes that the election is a 50-50 proposition. He argues that the polls are unreliable and that the 'shy Trump voter' theory, which suggests that some people are hesitant to admit their support for Trump due to social stigma, is not supported by evidence. Instead, Silver suggests that the 'non-response bias' is a more likely explanation for the polls' inaccuracies. He also discusses the 'Bradley effect', which refers to the phenomenon where voters are more likely to say they are undecided rather than admit to voting for a black candidate. Silver concludes that the election is too close to call and that a surprise outcome is possible. He also notes that the polls are subject to errors and that the election could be decided by a small margin.

**The Hill's Evening Report — Vexing polls add to election spectacle**
Recent polling data has shown a deadlocked 2024 presidential race, with all seven battleground states within reach for either candidate. The national and state-level data has given both Vice President Harris and former President Trump reason for optimism, while leaving election analysts flummoxed. A series of polls released this week found the race essentially deadlocked, with conflicting signals nationally and in battleground states. However, the Times/Siena/Philadelphia Inquirer poll found Harris with a 4-point lead in battleground Pennsylvania, which has the potential to play a decisive role in the election outcome. Nate Cohn, New York Times election analyst, noted that this poll breaks with conventional wisdom, saying 'A clear lead for Ms. Harris in Pennsylvania, but a tie nationwide? This is unexpected.' The Hill's Evening Report spoke with Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray, who summed it up: 'It's a close and volatile race and it's been very difficult to get a bead on it.' Nate Silver's polling aggregation gives Trump a 51 percent chance to win the election, saying 'People probably need to be realistic about the possibility that the election will remain in toss-up range straight thru to Nov. 5.'

**2024 presidential election predictions: Here's what experts have said**
Experts are divided on who will win the 2024 presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Allan Lichtman, a historian and professor, believes Harris will win, relying on his '13 Keys to the White House' instead of conventional polling. James Carville, a longtime Democratic strategist, also predicts a Harris win. On the other hand, Nate Silver, a statistician, thinks Trump will win, citing polling data that indicates the race could go either way. FiveThirtyEight simulations also show Trump winning 52 times out of 100. Christophe Barraud, a chief economist, predicts a Trump win and a 'clean sweep' for Republicans in Congress. Harris and Trump remain virtually tied in national polls, with Harris maintaining a razor-thin edge nationally, but Trump gaining ground in key swing states.

**Experts Predict 2024 US Presidential Election Outcomes**
As the 2024 US presidential election approaches, experts are sharing their predictions on who will be the next president. Allan Lichtman, known as the 'electoral Nostradamus', predicts that Kamala Harris will win the election. He uses his famous '13 keys to the White House' system, which has accurately predicted all winners since 1984, except for 2000. Lichtman believes Harris has an advantage in eight of the 13 keys, while Trump has only three. Christophe Barraud, an economist, predicts that Trump will win, citing various metrics such as betting markets, polls, and economic indicators. Nate Silver, a statistics expert, also predicts that Trump will win, but notes that the election is still uncertain and could go either way. Silver's system gives Trump a 54% chance of winning the Electoral College.

**What the polls are saying in the final week before the 2024 election**
With the 2024 presidential election just seven days away, the latest national polls and swing state surveys show a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. According to the Silver Bulletin, FiveThirtyEight, and the New York Times, Harris is leading in the popular vote by a narrow margin of less than two percentage points, with 49% of the vote compared to Trump's 48%. In the seven battleground states, the polls are also extremely close, with no candidate holding a material lead. Nate Cohn, the Times' chief pollster, noted that 'the battleground states remain extraordinarily tight.' If the swing-state polling averages hold true, Trump would win the Electoral College in the Silver Bulletin and FiveThirtyEight models, while Harris would emerge victorious in the New York Times averages.

**Election Countdown: 4 things you need to know in the last week of US presidential race**
The final week of the 2024 US presidential campaign is underway, with early voting in full swing and polls too close to call. The candidates need 270 electoral college votes to win, and the seven swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada are likely to decide the outcome. According to election analyst Nate Silver, the candidate who wins Pennsylvania has a more than 90% chance of winning the White House. The candidates are concentrating their efforts on these swing states, with Kamala Harris visiting Michigan and Donald Trump holding a rally in Georgia. The election is incredibly close, with Harris ahead by just one point nationally, and both candidates are making their closing arguments. Harris will deliver a speech at the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on Tuesday evening, while Trump has been using rhetoric that railed against the state of the economy and immigrants in his speeches. The election is expected to be decided much sooner than in 2020, with many states allowing absentee ballots to be counted before Election Night.

**Polling guru, expert picker reveal who will win presidential election**
Polling expert Nate Silver predicts Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election, but with a caveat, stating that a 50-50 forecast is exactly that. Silver emphasizes that predictions should not be taken as fact. Historian Allan Lichtman, who has correctly predicted every presidential contest since 1984, predicts a win for Kamala Harris using his 'The Keys to the White House' prediction system. Democratic strategist James Carville also predicts a win for Harris, stating 'Of this, I am certain.' Silver notes that the contest will be tight, regardless of predictions.

**Nate Silver Predicts Trump's Victory in US Presidential Election**
Nate Silver, a renowned American analyst and 'guru' of polls, stated that 'Trump will win' the US presidential election on November 5, 2024, against Kamala Harris. Silver, creator of the popular website FiveThirtyEight, explained his prediction, saying that 'pollsters are underestimating the true magnitude of support for the magnate.' Despite recent polls showing a 'technical tie' between the two candidates, Harris's campaign strategists have admitted that she is losing ground to Donald Trump. Silver believes that Harris is at risk of being affected by the 'Hillary effect,' where she was defeated by Trump in 2016. According to Silver's model, there is a 60% chance that a candidate will win at least six of the seven disputed states. Silver also stated that 'my instinct tells me that Donald Trump is the winner.' He wrote in a column for The New York Times, 'my instinct tells me that Donald Trump is the winner, and I suppose that's the same for many anxious Democrats.'

**US Presidential Election 2024: Harris or Trump? Polls Suggest a Close Contest**
The upcoming US presidential election is expected to be extremely close, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump neck and neck in the polls. According to the New York Times' average of electoral polls, Harris would win by a narrow margin with 49% of the vote, securing 276 electoral votes, while Trump would receive 48% of the vote and 262 electoral votes. However, the results are so close that they fall within the margin of error of any poll. The polls are particularly tight in key swing states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, where the candidates are separated by one or two percentage points. As Nate Cohn, a political analyst, explains, 'any mistake, no matter how small, becomes disproportionately important' in a closely contested campaign, and any shift in votes could drastically change the outcome. The polls have failed before, underestimating Trump's results in 2016 and 2020, and experts believe that the outcome of this election will be decided on November 5th.

**Two Weeks Out, Nate Silver Reveals His 'Gut' Feeling**
Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight, has revealed his 'gut' feeling about the 2024 presidential election, stating that his intuition favors Donald Trump. However, he emphasizes that intuition is unreliable in elections, unlike in poker where it can be developed over time. Silver notes that the statistics are agnostic and suggest that one candidate, possibly Trump or Kamala Harris, has a 60% chance of winning by a wide margin. He advises against relying on gut feelings and instead encourages people to look at the data, warning that there may be bigger shifts from 2020 than expected. As Silver writes, 'Don't be surprised if a relatively decisive win for one of the candidates is in the cards—or if there are bigger shifts from 2020 than most people's guts might tell them.'

**Nate Silver predicts close race, but "gut" tells him Trump will win**
Nate Silver, election handicapper and founder of FiveThirtyEight, has predicted a close race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. In a recent article for The New York Times, Silver wrote that the only responsible forecast is 50-50, but if forced to pick a winner, his 'gut' says Donald Trump. However, he cautioned that people should not put any value on his gut, and instead, 'resign yourself to the fact that a 50-50 forecast really does mean 50-50.' Silver's forecast has been the most favorable to Trump, but other forecasts, such as FiveThirtyEight and DecisionDeskHQ, give Harris a higher chance of winning. Silver noted that either candidate could beat their polling numbers due to unknown factors and changing dynamics, and that a small systematic polling error could produce a comfortable Electoral College victory for either candidate.

**My gut says Donald Trump will win, but don't trust anyone's gut: Pollster Nate Silver**
Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, has warned against trusting anyone's gut feeling, including his own, when it comes to the 2024 US presidential election. Silver notes that the election is too close to call, with a margin of 1-2% between the two candidates in seven battleground states. He emphasizes that a 50-50 forecast really means 50-50, and that both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have an equal possibility of winning. Silver also flags several issues with polling and analysis, including recency bias, shy-voter theory, and non-response bias, which could lead to skewed perceptions. He notes that it's possible to underestimate Trump in polls, just as it's possible to overestimate him and underestimate Harris. Silver advises Democrats not to hang their hopes just yet, citing their strong performance in recent special elections, ballot referendums, and the 2022 midterms. As Silver said, 'I don't think you should put any value whatsoever on anyone's gut -- including mine. Instead, you should resign yourself to the fact that a 50-50 forecast really does mean 50-50. And you should be open to the possibility that those forecasts are wrong, and that could be the case equally in the direction of Mr. Trump or Ms. Harris.'

Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, has stated that his 'gut says' Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election, despite polling data indicating a close race. Silver's model currently gives Trump a 53.1% chance of winning. He notes that surveys underestimated Trump's performance in the last two elections due to 'nonresponse bias' towards his supporters. Silver also suggests that pollsters may be biased against the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, by weighing surveys based on who people said they voted for in 2020, which may lead to inaccuracies. He also mentions that 2020 polling errors may have been partly due to COVID-19 restrictions, which may be overcorrected for this time around.

**Nate Silver Gives Up On 2024 Poll Predictions to Deliver 'Gut' Call**
Statistician Nate Silver has given up on making firm predictions for the 2024 presidential election, saying that former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a genuine toss-up. Silver's model currently reflects a 50-50 forecast, and he notes that 'we honestly don't know' who will win. He also suggests that the election may not be a photo finish, and that either Trump or Harris could comfortably win the election. This is in contrast to some election forecasters, who have been criticized for their predictions in previous elections. Justin Grimmer, a Stanford political scientist, expressed concerns about the use of probabilistic models in election forecasting, saying that they can create a lot of stories and potentially harm the public's understanding of the election.

**Nate Silver: It's a 50-50 Race but My Gut Says Trump**
Nate Silver, a pollster, believes the 2024 presidential election is a 50-50 race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. However, when asked about his 'gut' feeling, Silver says he thinks Trump will win. Silver notes that polls have underestimated Trump's support twice before and that nonresponse bias, where some voters are less likely to participate in polls, could be a factor. He also suggests that the current tie in the polls could be masking some Trump strength. Silver predicts that the final outcome will not be as close as the polling currently suggests, with a 60% chance that one candidate sweeps all of the battleground states. He also notes that some voters are prioritizing economic issues, such as taxes and prices, over the candidates' character and policies. Silver's take has been met with criticism from some, who feel that it is depressing and that polls have lost meaning. One reader notes that Trump supporters are often motivated by reasons such as his business experience and decisiveness, rather than his policies or character.

**Pollster Nate Silver: 'My Gut Says Donald Trump'**
Nate Silver, creator of the FiveThirtyEight polling engine, predicts that Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election over Vice President Kamala Harris, despite the close numbers in the polls. Silver says his 'gut' is telling him this, but warns that voters should not put any value on his or anyone else's gut. He notes that the 50-50 forecast for Harris and Trump really does mean 50-50, and that either candidate can still defeat their polling numbers to win. Silver also discusses the possibility of 'shy Trump voters' and 'nonresponsive bias' in polling, as well as the 'Hillary effect' that may affect Harris's chances. He concludes that while the numbers are close now, a relatively decisive win for one of the candidates is possible, and that even small polling errors could result in a 'comfortable' Electoral College win.

**Famous polling guru shares his gut theory on who'll win election**
Nate Silver, the founder of polling predictor FiveThirtyEight, believes that the presidential election is a 50/50 dead heat, but his 'gut' tells him that Donald Trump will win. Silver's model shows the candidates just 1.6 percent apart, but he points to Trump's tendency to underperform in polls and the struggle pollsters have in reaching his voters as reasons he thinks the former president will win again. Silver also notes that Kamala Harris' candidacy has become bogged down in recent weeks, with a staggering 70 percent of registered voters saying the country is on the wrong track. Silver likened his 'gut feeling' to intuition in poker, saying it can give you a little something extra, even when the odds appear to be even. 'Most of the expert players I have spoken with over the years will say it gives you a little something extra,' he wrote. 'You're never certain, but your intuition might tilt the odds to 60-40 in your favor by picking up patterns of when a competitor is bluffing.'

**Famed Polling Expert Reveals 'Gut' Feeling On 2024 Election**
Famed polling expert Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight claims his 'gut' is telling him that former President Donald Trump will defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election. According to Silver, his model currently has Trump with a 53.1% chance of being elected. Silver also notes that other surveys may have underestimated Trump's performance in the past two elections due to 'nonresponse bias' toward his supporters. He also acknowledges that pollsters may be worried about properly measuring Trump's support and have stacked surveys against Harris. Silver has a history of successfully predicting presidential elections, including 49 of 50 states in the 2008 election and Biden's win in 2020. However, he was criticized for giving Hillary Clinton a 71.4% chance of winning over Trump in 2016. As Silver said, 'I think people shouldn’t have been so surprised. Clinton was the favorite, but the polls showed a highly competitive race in the Electoral College.'

**End Times**
The US presidential election is heating up, with Kamala Harris and Donald J. Trump in a tight race. According to The New York Times, the two candidates are essentially tied in five critical battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Nate Cohn reports, 'Neither candidate can realistically win the presidency without winning at least one of these states.' The number of uncommitted/undecided voters is also a concern, with 43% of 18- to 25-year-olds still undecided, a larger share than any other age group. Trump is strongest in Arizona, but his lead is within the margin of error. Nate Silver notes that the data is 'pretty negative for Kamala Harris,' citing three recent high-quality national polls that show Trump leading. Silver also points out that incumbent parties worldwide are doing poorly, and the historical incumbency advantage has diminished. Additionally, the Democrats are becoming the party of the more highly educated, and racial minority voters are shifting away from them. Their attacks on Trump have been uneven, and their defenses of President Joe Biden have foreclosed much possibility of using Trump's age and mental fitness against him. 'Trump presents Democrats with a Three Stooges Syndrome problem: a range of plausible attacks so vast that they tend to cancel one another out,' Silver adds.

**We are 15 days from the 2024 presidential election. Here's where things stand.**
With just 15 days left until the 2024 presidential election, the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris remains extremely close. Despite a lack of movement in national polling since Labor Day, Trump has gained ground since his debate performance against Harris. According to Nate Silver's model, Trump now has a slight lead in the national average, and has narrowed Harris' lead in the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Harris has been focusing on young men, who are currently supporting Trump 58% to 37%, but is driving a larger gender gap among young women. Both campaigns are turning to their top surrogates, with Harris set to stump with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and Trump focusing on young men and his go-to billionaire, Mark Cuban. The election is expected to be one of the closest on record, with Harris' easiest path to winning being to sweep the Great Lakes states and complete the Blue Wall with Nebraska's blue dot.

**Nate Silver: Presidential Race Likely to Stay Toss-Up Until End**
Election forecaster Nate Silver believes that the presidential race will remain a toss-up until voters go to the polls on Nov. 5. Silver stated, 'I've never seen an election in which the forecast spent more time in the vicinity of 50/50, and I probably never will.' He noted that there have been instances where it seemed like the election was swinging in one direction, but these proved to be false starts. Silver pointed out that Vice President Kamala Harris's numbers surged after she replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democrat ticket, but former President Donald Trump gained ground after the Democratic National Convention. However, Harris reestablished her lead after winning the debate, with the Electoral College being roughly 50/50 or slightly in her favor. Silver stated that a significant event or unforeseen factor could swing the momentum, but it is highly unlikely due to the low number of undecided voters, with Harris and Trump combining for 95.5% of the vote in the national average.

**Sorry Donald Trump, Here's Why the Election May Already Be Over**
The 2024 Presidential election may already be over, with Donald Trump's chances of winning significantly diminished due to the scandal surrounding North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson. According to election forecaster Nate Silver, if Vice President Kamala Harris wins North Carolina, she has a 95% chance of winning the presidency. The Trump campaign's main strategy relies on winning North Carolina, but the Robinson scandal could tank Republican turnout and make the state unwinnable for Trump. A study by Binghamton University political scientists found that gubernatorial candidates can have a significant impact on the state-level presidential vote, with 'robust and significant gubernatorial coattail effects.' Even state legislative races can have 'reverse coattails' that affect the presidential vote. Trump's base is not all MAGA, and a quarter of North Carolina's Republican primary participants voted for someone other than Trump just six months ago. The Robinson scandal could turn off enough voters to decide to sit this one out, leading to decreased Republican turnout. As top Republican pollster Whit Ayres said, 'We have few examples of reverse coattails where a down-ballot candidate hurts the top of the ticket. But if anyone could do it, it's this character [Robinson].'

**Who is correct, Nate Silver or Allan Lichtman? Both wizards bicker over 2024 US elections, trade barbs on social media**
Nate Silver and Allan Lichtman, two prominent election predictors, are engaged in a social media feud over their predictions for the 2024 US elections. Silver claims that Lichtman's predictions are based on the wrong 'keys' and are 'arbitrary'. Lichtman responds by saying that Silver may have duplicated his 'keys' and that Silver lacks academic credentials to back up his claims. Lichtman also points out that Silver has been proven wrong in the past and that this could happen again in the current election, where the intensity between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is high. Silver is a major pollster with a proven track record, but Lichtman's accuracy and academic background make him a strong contender in the election prediction game.

**'Two wizards bickering': Nate Silver, Allan Lichtman trade barbs over 2024 election picks**
Nate Silver and Allan Lichtman, a historian and prognosticator, respectively, are engaged in a heated exchange on social media over their predictions for the 2024 presidential election. Lichtman, who has correctly predicted the outcome of nine out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, believes that the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket will win the White House. Silver, on the other hand, has released data showing that vice president Harris is ahead of former President Donald Trump in the national polling average, but Trump has a higher chance of winning the Electoral College. Silver questioned Lichtman's ability to read his 13 keys used to make presidential election calls, to which Lichtman responded that Silver 'doesn't have the faintest idea how to turn the keys.' The exchange continued with Silver accusing Lichtman of being 'comically overconfident' and not owning up to the subjectivities in his method.

**Nate Silver Throws Shade on Allan Lichtman's 2024 Election Prediction**
Nate Silver has questioned Allan Lichtman's prediction that Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election. According to Silver, Lichtman is not properly applying his own formula, which, if applied correctly, actually predicts a Trump victory. Silver pointed out that combining an unpopular current administration with a retrospectively popular past administration creates an environment where Trump should win, and Trump's recent polling numbers in the sunbelt and nationally support this assessment. Silver is not alone in his skepticism, as others have also expressed similar views.

**'He'll be wrong again': Ultra-accurate 'keys' historian spars with prominent pollster**
Historian Allan Lichtman, who uses 13 'keys' to predict presidential elections, has been sparring with prominent statistician Nate Silver on X. Lichtman predicted a Kamala Harris victory in 2024, while Silver initially gave Trump a 2/3 probability of winning. However, Silver later reduced his prediction to 58% for Harris. Lichtman boasted that Silver had 'finally seen the light', but Silver pushed back, accusing Lichtman of getting two out of his past three calls incorrect. Silver claimed that Lichtman's keys predict a Trump victory, and that Lichtman has no academic credentials to analyze the keys. Lichtman fired back, saying that Silver doesn't understand how to apply the keys and that he will be 'wrong again'.

**Trump, should he lose in 2024, will not seek reelection in 2028**
Former President Donald Trump revealed in an interview that if he loses the 2024 presidential election, he will not seek the presidency again in 2028. Trump made the statement during an interview with Full Measure, saying, 'No, I don't. I think … that will be it. I don't see that at all. Hopefully, we're gonna be successful.' This news has surprised many, including his supporters, who are now left wondering who will fill the gap in the American political scene left by Trump's potential absence. Trump's current campaign is still a close race, with Vice President Kamala Harris leading him by a little over two percentage points, according to Real Clear Politics' poll aggregator. However, others, such as polling 'guru' Nate Silver, believe that Trump is likely to obtain a dominant Electoral College victory.

**Top pollster Nate Silver says Trump will win U.S elections, warns Americans to make contingency plans**
Nate Silver, a top pollster, has predicted that Donald Trump will win the US elections 2024, despite major polls suggesting Kamala Harris has a high chance of winning. Silver has warned Americans to make contingency plans and not waste money on funding Harris' campaign, stating that she has more money than needed. According to Silver, Trump has a higher probability of winning, and spending another $100,000 on Harris is unnecessary, considering Trump's likely victory in November. Silver's prediction has shocked many, as he has been accurate in the last three Presidential polls, but this time around, it could be a 'topsy turvy' run for him and the polls.

**America's top election forecaster issues a chilling warning of Trump**
Nate Silver, a renowned election forecaster, has issued a warning that Donald Trump could win the 2024 presidential election, giving him a 58% chance of winning the Electoral College. Silver advises people to make 'contingency plans' now, such as protecting American institutions in the event of a Trump second term. He also expressed concerns that crucial 'guardrails' preventing disaster during Trump's first presidency have been 'weakened' in the years since. However, Silver warns Democrats against painting Trump as an existential threat to democracy, as this strategy is 'very unappealing to swing voters.' Silver also expressed concerns about Kamala Harris's campaign, citing her retention of Biden-era advisers and a lack of 'joyfulness' in her campaign.

**The Hill's Evening Report — Vexing polls add to election spectacle**
Recent polling data has shown a deadlocked 2024 presidential race, with all seven battleground states within reach for either candidate. The national and state-level data has given both Vice President Harris and former President Trump reason for optimism, while leaving election analysts flummoxed. A series of polls released this week found the race essentially deadlocked, with conflicting signals nationally and in battleground states. However, the Times/Siena/Philadelphia Inquirer poll found Harris with a 4-point lead in battleground Pennsylvania, which has the potential to play a decisive role in the election outcome. Nate Cohn, New York Times election analyst, noted that this poll breaks with conventional wisdom, saying 'A clear lead for Ms. Harris in Pennsylvania, but a tie nationwide? This is unexpected.' The Hill's Evening Report spoke with Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray, who summed it up: 'It's a close and volatile race and it's been very difficult to get a bead on it.' Nate Silver's polling aggregation gives Trump a 51 percent chance to win the election, saying 'People probably need to be realistic about the possibility that the election will remain in toss-up range straight thru to Nov. 5.'

**2024 US Presidential Election: A Guide**
The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 5, 2024. The election will determine the next President of the United States, who will serve a four-year term from January 2025. The President will have the power to veto laws, but most laws will require the approval of Congress. The Democratic Party, led by President Joe Biden, has nominated Vice President Kamala Harris as their presidential candidate. The Republican Party, led by former President Donald Trump, has nominated Trump as their presidential candidate. The election will also determine the members of the US Congress, which has the power to pass laws. The US has a unique electoral system, where the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral college votes. The candidate who wins 270 or more electoral college votes will be elected as the President. The election will be held in all 50 states, and voters will be able to cast their ballots in person or by mail. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but the transition period will last for several days. During this time, the new administration will be formed, and the President-elect will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

**Exclusive: 'Nostradamus' Allan Lichtman on how he uses 13 keys to predict US elections**
Allan Lichtman, an American historian known as the 'Nostradamus' of US presidential elections, predicted that Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump. Lichtman's prediction is based on his unique 13-key model, which ignores polling trends and focuses on factors such as midterm election results, incumbency, internal party battles, and economic conditions. Lichtman has a 40-year track record of accurate predictions, including correctly predicting Trump's win in 2016 and Clinton's loss in 2016. He believes that polls are snapshots and not predictors, and that his model reflects the structure of how elections really work. Lichtman has criticized other election forecasters, including Nate Silver, for relying on polls and ignoring the underlying factors that determine election outcomes. He believes that Harris has a strong chance of winning, but that Trump's experience and ability to connect with voters will make the race competitive.

**A Close Race Is Practically an Inevitability**
The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be a close race, with polls showing a tight contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. According to a new Washington Post-Ipsos poll, 69% of Black Americans say they are 'absolutely certain to vote' in November, up from 62% in April. Meanwhile, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump nationally among likely voters, 52% to 46%. The debate this week will pose a challenge for Harris, who will have to decide how much to embrace or distance herself from President Biden and his policies. Donald Trump is laying the foundation for a 'rigged' debate on ABC News before he squares off with Harris. 'It's hard to be surprised by polls showing a close race,' said Nate Cohn, 'but the polls today aren't just close. In the era of modern polling, it's rare to see a contest this tight this far out.'

**Two Insistent Predictions In The 2024 Presidential Race, Two Different Winners**
Two election prognosticators, Nate Silver and Allan Lichtman, have made contrasting predictions for the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight, predicts Trump will win with 58.2% of the vote, while Harris will receive 41.6%. On the other hand, Allan Lichtman, known as the 'Nostradamus' of presidential election predictions, predicts Harris will win. Lichtman bases his prediction on his 'Keys to the White House' system, where Harris is ahead in eight of the 13 true-or-false questions. Silver, however, bases his prediction on polling and sees trouble ahead for Harris in the Electoral College, particularly in battleground states. 'There's room to debate the convention bounce stuff, but Harris has been getting a lot of mediocre state polls lately,' Silver said on his Substack page, Silver Bulletin. Lichtman said, 'The Democrats will hold on to the White House, and Kamala Harris will be the next president of the United States.'

**Election predictions are too noisy to tell if Trump or Harris will win**
Election predictions for the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are too noisy to determine a clear winner. Nate Silver's forecasts and PredictIt's prices show a close race, but adjusting for systematic errors and momentum reveals that Trump is a substantial favorite. Silver's forecasts are biased by momentum, moving 0.19% each day in the same direction as the previous day's move, while PredictIt prices also move in the same direction. The filtered model combines the information from Silver's modeling and PredictIt's prices, showing Trump with a 70% win probability. However, the author believes that this is an overestimation and that the election is still too close to call, with a lot of campaigning and events still to come.

**Will Kamala Harris Win US Presidential Race? Election 'Nostradamus' Picks 2024 Winner**
 Allan Lichtman, a 77-year-old election 'nostradamus', has predicted that Kamala Harris will win the 2024 US presidential race. Lichtman, who correctly predicted Donald Trump's 2016 victory, made his prediction in a video where he was competing in a senior Olympics event. He based his prediction on a series of true/false statements, rather than current polling trends. Lichtman also cautioned that President Biden withdrawing from the race could be a 'tragic mistake' for Democrats, sparking an online debate with fellow forecaster Nate Silver.

**Polling Expert ‘Nostradamus' Gives Clue About His Last Election Winner Prediction**
Allan Lichtman, a renowned polling expert known as the 'Nostradamus' of presidential election predictions, has hinted at his final prediction for the 2024 election. In a YouTube livestream, Lichtman said he will reveal his prediction within days after Labor Day. He criticized rival pollster Nate Silver, who recently said Trump was his favorite, for using 'absurd' predictions and 'fabricating' probabilities from polls. Lichtman also took issue with Silver's model, which gave Trump a 52.4% chance of winning, calling it 'not precise' and 'not real.' Lichtman's system, the '13 Keys,' has correctly predicted nine out of the last 10 elections and relies on historical factors rather than polls or campaign events. A hint from Lichtman as to his prediction came when he condemned Trump for his campaign stop at Arlington National Cemetery, which he called a 'shameless' use of hallowed ground for political purposes.
