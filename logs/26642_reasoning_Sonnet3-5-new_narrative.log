Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, the Spanish Wikipedia article count deadline passed yesterday. Our models had it at 82.45%."

Philip: [nodding] "The trend was clear from the data we had in July. With the article count at 1,968,552 in late June, and the consistent growth rate of roughly 8,500 articles per month over the previous year, it was highly probable they'd cross 2 million before October."

Nate: "The bot-assisted article creation programs and the growing Spanish-speaking online community made it almost inevitable. Though there was still that small chance of technical issues or policy changes that could have delayed it."

Philip: "Indeed. The steady growth from 1.77 million in 2022 to 1.86 million in 2023 gave us strong confidence. Sometimes the obvious prediction is the right one."

[They both turn to their computers, already focused on their next prediction.]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, the Spanish Wikipedia milestone deadline passed yesterday. Our models had it at 82.45%."

Philip: [nodding] "The trend was clear from the data we had in July. With about 1.97 million articles then, and the consistent growth rate of roughly 8,500 articles per month over the previous year, crossing 2 million by October was highly probable."

Nate: "Though we couldn't be entirely certain. Remember the slowdown in editing during summer vacations in Spanish-speaking countries?"

Philip: "True, but the community's dedication to content creation remained strong. The growth from 1.77 million in 2022 to 1.87 million in 2023 showed remarkable consistency. Our models captured that momentum perfectly."

Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like the Spanish Wikipedia didn't quite make it to 2 million articles by October 1st."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.45%. The growth rate was steady but just too slow to bridge that gap of roughly 31,000 articles in just three months."

Nate: "The historical data showed consistent growth - about 100,000 articles per year. But even with that trajectory, they needed a significant acceleration to hit 2 million by October."

Tetlock: "Right. Looking back at the June numbers of 1,968,552 articles, it would have required an unusual spike in content creation. The Spanish Wikipedia community maintains quality standards that naturally limit rapid growth."

Nate: "Another accurate forecast in the books. Want to grab coffee?"
