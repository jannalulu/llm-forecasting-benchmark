Nate Silver: [reviewing documents] Phil, remember Super Micro's 10-K filing deadline we were tracking?

Philip Tetlock: Yes, their notification of failure to file on August 30th was concerning. Our models gave it only a 15.25% chance of filing before October 1st.

Nate: And we were right again. They missed the deadline. The late filing notification was a strong indicator, especially with less than a month to remedy it.

Philip: Indeed. Historical patterns showed companies receiving these notifications typically need more time to complete their filings. The tight timeline between the notification and deadline was particularly telling.

Nate: [nodding] The lack of any positive filing indicators in September further confirmed our low probability assessment. Another win for superforecasting.

Philip: Our models continue to prove reliable, even with limited information windows.

Nate Silver: [reviewing documents] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Super Micro Computer's 10-K filing.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the late notification of failure to file on August 30th, our models had it at 15.20%.

Nate: The warning signs were there. When a company receives a notification of failure to file just a month before the deadline, historical patterns show they rarely meet the next deadline.

Philip: Exactly. And with Super Micro's recent history, the one-month window was simply too tight. The August 30th notification was the key data point that shifted our probability significantly downward.

Nate: [nodding] These filing delays often indicate deeper administrative or accounting challenges. Our models factored in both the tight timeline and the regulatory context.

Philip: Another accurate prediction in the books. Shall we move on to the next forecast?

Nate Silver: [examining data on his screen] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Super Micro's 10-K filing.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. When we saw that notification of failure to file on August 30th, our models had it at 12.45%.

Nate: The red flags were clear. That NT 10-K filing showed they needed more time for their financial statements, and historically, when companies file these notifications this late in the cycle...

Philip: [interrupting] Especially in the tech sector. And with Super Micro's recent rapid growth and complexity, the probability of meeting that October 1st deadline was always going to be low.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] Our models factored in their previous filing patterns and the current market conditions. The 12.45% probability reflected both the technical possibility of filing and the practical challenges they faced.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting.

Nate: Just over a month to resolve reporting issues is ambitious. The probability reflected that challenge.

Philip: Another validation of our superforecasting methodology. When you combine historical filing patterns with regulatory indicators, the numbers rarely lie.
