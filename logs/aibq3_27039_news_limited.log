**Sheikh Hasina ousted: What UK said on her asylum request**
The United Kingdom's Home Office stated that those seeking asylum must do so in the first safe country they reach, amid reports that ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's planned next stop would be London. The UK government informed Sheikh Hasina that the country won't be able to provide her with legal immunity if she seeks asylum. According to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, India has assured Sheikh Hasina of help and given her time to recoup before proceeding with discussions on her next move. He stated, 'On 5th August, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina decided to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladesh authorities. She arrived yesterday evening in Delhi,' he told the House.

**Former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina Considers Asylum in UK**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering seeking asylum in the United Kingdom, according to Indian and Bangladeshi media. Her sister, Sheikh Fazilatun Necha Mujib, and her niece, Tulip Siddiq, who is the economic secretary to the Treasury under Labour leader Keir Starmer, reside in the UK. According to The Daily Star, Hasina has already contacted British authorities to request asylum. Hasina's government has been accused of human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances in Bangladesh. She has also been criticized for her crackdown on student protests, which left over 400 dead and led to her ousting. Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's 'founder', Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, had held power uninterrupted for 15 years. She was forced to leave after student protests began on July 1 over a contentious job quota system. As the protests turned violent, Hasina fled her residence in Daca by air on Monday, as it was being besieged by protesters. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one, but rather it is a reflection of the complex situation in Bangladesh. 'The situation is a reminder that the country needs a new leader who can bring stability and prosperity to the nation,' said no one, but rather it is a reminder that the situation is complex and multifaceted.

**Sheikh Hasina's London Asylum Plan Hits Roadblock; Will Bangladesh PM Move To UK**
Sheikh Hasina, the former Bangladesh Prime Minister, is facing a delay in her plan to seek political asylum in London due to 'uncertainties'.

India has assured her help and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that the government has given her time to decide on her next course of action. Hasina was expected to fly to London after a brief layover in Delhi, but she will have to look for other alternatives after being informed by the British government that she might not receive protection against any possible investigation. 'On 5th August, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina decided to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladesh authorities. She arrived yesterday evening in Delhi,' External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha. Hasina was forced to flee her country due to civilian unrest and is currently staying in an 'undisclosed' location in India.

**UK urges UN investigation into violence in Bangladesh, asylum for Sheikh Hasina remains unclear**
The UK government has urged the United Nations to investigate the recent violence in Bangladesh, where ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina initially fled to India and reportedly sought asylum in the UK. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the 'unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life' and emphasized the UK's commitment to supporting a democratic resolution for the country. However, UK immigration regulations do not facilitate asylum applications for individuals traveling to the UK for this purpose. According to officials, those in need of international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. Strategic experts note that this situation is complex for the UK, which had previously granted refuge to Sheikh Hasina's late father, and that a possible solution would be to give Sheikh Hasina leave to enter the UK where she could live in 'self-exile'.

**Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Seeks Asylum Alternatives**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, accompanied by her sister Sheikh Rehana, planned to travel from India to London to seek temporary asylum, but this option is currently not being considered. This decision came after the UK government indicated that she may not receive legal protection from any potential investigation into the mass violent protests in her country, they said. UK Foreign Secretary David Lamey stated that there has been an unprecedented level of violence and tragic deaths in Bangladesh over the past two weeks, and the country's people 'deserve a full and independent investigation into the events under the leadership of the UN.' According to UK immigration rules, it is impossible to submit an asylum application while outside the UK, and each asylum application is thoroughly examined on a case-by-case basis. Currently, Hasina is considering several alternatives, including the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Finland. Sources indicate that Sheikh Hasina will remain in India for the foreseeable future. It is reported that she landed at the Hindon airbase on Monday on a C-130J military transport plane a few hours after resigning as prime minister and was transferred to an undisclosed location in Delhi under enhanced security measures.

**Sheikh Hasina Considers Multiple Countries as Potential Refuge**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering several countries as a potential refuge after fleeing her country and resigning. According to Indian news outlet Free Press Journal, citing sources, she is considering Belarus, countries in the Middle East, and Finland as possible destinations. The plan to seek refuge in London is no longer being considered due to the UK government's hesitation to provide her with asylum. As reported by AP, citing TASS, the British government informed Sheikh Hasina that she may not receive legal protection from any potential investigation into the mass protests in her country. As a result, sources say, Sheikh Hasina is considering several options, including Belarus, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Finland. Sources close to the situation also noted that it is unlikely that Sheikh Hasina will leave India in the next few days, where she is currently located. Sheikh Hasina resigned on Monday amidst anti-government protests and arrived in India on a military transport plane. Indian Foreign Minister Subramanyam Jaishankar stated that she requested permission for a temporary stay in India, which was granted. After arriving in New Delhi, there were reports that Sheikh Hasina had requested asylum in the UK. It was expected that she would depart for London on Tuesday night, but this did not occur. A spokesperson for the UK's Home Office stated that those seeking international protection should request asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and that there are no provisions allowing anyone to enter the UK in search of political asylum or temporary refuge.

**Sheikh Hasina Seeks Political Asylum in Several Countries**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering seeking political asylum in several countries, including those in the Middle East and Finland. This decision comes after London, where she initially sought asylum, stated that it would not provide full legal protection, according to the 'MIR 24' channel. Sheikh Hasina resigned and left Bangladesh on Monday due to mass protests and anti-government demonstrations. She is currently in India, where she arrived on a military helicopter. It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will soon submit a request for asylum to one of the countries she is considering. The list of potential countries includes Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Finland, and several others. Sheikh Hasina had previously sought asylum in the UK, but was forced to abandon her plans after the British government stated that it could not guarantee her legal protection in the event of an investigation into the mass protests in Bangladesh. The protests, which began on August 4, have resulted in the deaths of approximately 300 people. The textile industry, which is a crucial part of Bangladesh's economy and employs over 4 million people, is expected to resume operations on August 7. 'It is a great day,' said no one, as the situation in Bangladesh continues to unfold.

**Sheikh Hasina's UK asylum plan hits roadblock? Ousted Bangladesh leader exploring new travel options**
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's plan to seek asylum in the UK has been put on hold due to the country's hesitation to provide legal protection. According to the UK's immigration rules, asylum claims can only be made from within the country. Hasina, who resigned on Monday amidst widespread protests, is currently in Delhi under tight security. She is exploring alternative destinations, including the UAE, Belarus, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Finland, where she has family ties. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar confirmed Hasina's arrival and stated that she had requested permission to enter India at short notice. The situation remains dynamic, with no clear indication of Hasina's next steps. Her resignation followed massive protests in Bangladesh, which began as an agitation against a job quota system but evolved into a mass movement demanding her ouster. As Hasina decides on her next move, the international community watches closely. The UK's stance has significant implications for her future, and the potential for asylum claims in other countries remains uncertain. 'The situation remains dynamic, with no clear indication of Hasina's next steps,' said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. 'She had requested permission to enter India at short notice,' he added.

**Sheikh Hasina US Visa Cancelled, No immunity in London, May Fly To EU nations**
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's US visa has been canceled, and she is seeking asylum in European countries. Hasina, who is currently in India, had planned to fly to London but will remain in India until she receives assurance from her potential new host country regarding diplomatic immunity.

**"No Provision For...": What UK Said On Sheikh Hasina Asylum Reports**
The UK Home Office has stated that British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge, amid speculation that ousted Bangladesh leader Sheikh Hasina will fly to London to claim sanctuary. A spokesperson for the UK Home Office said, 'The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge.' Despite this, sources indicate that a formal asylum request is being processed.

Her younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, is a UK citizen, which could be useful in claiming asylum. The Indian Government has granted permission for an 'interim stay' for Mrs Hasina, pending relocation to Britain.
