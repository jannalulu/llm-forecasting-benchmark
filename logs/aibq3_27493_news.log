**US Inflation Adds Optimism to Western Markets**
The US consumer inflation (CPI) for July was released on Wednesday, August 14, and it showed a 0.2% increase from June and a 2.9% increase from July 2023. This is lower than the predicted 0.2% (month-over-month) and 3.0% (year-over-year) increase. The core inflation rate also increased by 0.2% (month-over-month) and 3.2% (year-over-year), matching the predicted values. The SRI (Seasonally Adjusted Rate of Inflation) for the US without rounding was 0.155% (overall) and 0.165% (core). According to Neomarkets, the market's expectations for a decrease in the Federal Reserve's interest rates have slightly increased after the inflation reports, but there are no significant changes. The probability of four interest rate cuts by the end of the year remains, and the chances of a 0.50% interest rate cut in September are increasing. However, weak non-farm employment data could significantly increase the expectations for the rate of interest rate cuts this year, unlike inflation, which has no current impact.

**US Consumer Price Index Falls 0.2% in August**
According to John Kerschner, Head of US Securitised Products and Portfolio Manager at Janus Henderson Investors, both the total and core Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US fell by 0.2% on August 14, 2024, as expected. This resulted in a year-over-year decrease in the total CPI from 3.0% in the previous month to 2.9%, and a year-over-year decrease in the core CPI from 3.3% in the previous month to 3.2%.

**June 2024 CPI Report: Inflation Is Moderating, Inching Us Closer To a Rate Cut**
The June 2024 CPI report shows that inflation is moderating, with core CPI increasing by 0.1% MoM and 3.3% YoY. Shelter prices, which have been a major contributor to inflation, rose by 0.2% MoM, their smallest gain since August 2021. While prices increased in some areas, such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care, they fell in others, like airfares and used cars. The report suggests that core inflation will continue to moderate this year, and the Fed may cut interest rates as early as September. The data supports the view that the economy and labor market are becoming more balanced, which could lead to a rate cut.

**US Inflation Rate Announced: 0.1% Monthly, 3% Annually**
The US inflation data for June was announced, and the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.1% monthly and 3% annually. The core inflation rate, closely watched by the Fed, decreased by 0.1% monthly, the lowest level since August 2021. The market expectation was for a monthly inflation rate of 0.2% and an annual rate of 3.4%. In May, consumer prices remained stable (0%) annually, but increased by 3.3%. The energy index decreased by 2% monthly, mainly due to a 3.8% decrease in fuel prices.

**The CPI Preview: Inflation To Keep Rising This Summer, Despite The Slowing Economy**
The June CPI inflation expectations are expected to show a rise in inflation, despite the slowing economy. The core CPI is predicted to increase by 0.2% MoM and 3.4% YoY, while the headline CPI is expected to increase by 0.1% MoM and 3.1% YoY. The annual core CPI inflation at 3.4% would match the lowest annual core inflation reading from last month, May 2024. The headline core CPI at 3.1% would be below the 3.3% level in May, but still above the cyclical low of 3% annual CPI inflation number from June 2023. The disinflationary process has stalled, and the monthly core CPI inflation readings over the last 12 months suggest that the core annual CPI inflation has either stalled at 3.4% for the next three months or it could even start rising. The InflationNowcast by Cleveland Fed predicts that June core CPI will come at 0.28%, or rounded to 0.3%, which would be an upside surprise, above the 0.2% consensus expectations. The annual CPI inflation is predicted to rise over the next 2 months, and the core CPI is predicted to rise to 3.6% by July, and the headline CPI is expected to rise to 3.2% by July. The July inflation data will be reported in August, right before the Fed's September meeting. If these predictions are correct, the Fed will not be able to cut interest rates in September, as the market currently expects.

**US July Inflation Rate: A Good but Not Great Number**
The US July inflation rate was 2.9% year-over-year, a tenth of a percentage point below the previous month and the consensus estimate, breaking the 3% barrier for the first time since spring 2021. The core inflation rate, excluding volatile items, was in line with expectations, advancing 0.2% month-over-month and 3.2% year-over-year. The underlying inflation rate, excluding housing, also turned positive, advancing 0.2% month-over-month. The data is not surprising and does not change the expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in September. The Reserve Federal will have another report on inflation before its next meeting, as well as the August employment report, which could be more important. The housing sector was the main driver of the inflation rate, with a 0.4% month-over-month increase and a 5.1% year-over-year increase. The rent equivalent for homeowners increased 0.36% month-over-month, while the prices of first-time rentals also contributed to the increase. The prices of used cars fell 2.3% month-over-month and 10.9% year-over-year, while the prices of new cars fell 0.2% month-over-month. The tariffs for air travel fell 1.6%, and the prices of clothing fell 0.4% month-over-month. The inflation rate is not perfect, but it will not change the Federal Reserve's roadmap, giving officials a modestly greater confidence that inflation is on the path to decline. The data should help consolidate expectations of a 0.2% or even 0.1% decline in the core PCE deflator. The Reserve Federal is expected to cut interest rates in September due to the cooling labor market, the deceleration of prices, and the weakening of business surveys. The 2- and 10-year Treasury bond yields increased 5 and 3 basis points, respectively, after the publication, and the markets now see approximately 103 basis points of cuts in the second half of the year, down from 109 basis points in the previous session. The Jackson Hole meeting may provide new clues on the magnitude of the move, and the two remaining data points, the inflation report and the employment report, will be crucial before the September meeting.

**Fight against inflation making progress**
The U.S. continues to make progress on inflation, with the consumer price index falling below 3% in July, reaching a 2.9% inflation rate year over year. Both headline CPI and core CPI are significantly lower than their 2022 peaks. However, auto insurance and shelter prices are exerting upward pressure on prices, with average auto insurance costs increasing by approximately 25% and existing home prices still up about 5% over the year. Despite this, the progress made on inflation almost certainly solidifies a September rate cut, with some experts even calling for a half point cut due to softening in the labor market. However, the author disagrees with this assessment at this point, citing the need for more incoming data.

**Kamalaflation Pushes Americans To The Brink As Costs Soar Near 20%**
The US is experiencing high inflation, with the TIPP CPI measuring 19.6% since President Biden's inauguration. This is a 16.7-point difference from the BLS CPI's 2.9% annual increase. Food prices have increased by 21.8% under Biden, while energy prices have risen by 35.0%. The core CPI measures a 17.9% price increase, compared to the BLS CPI's 3.2%. Americans are cutting back on household spending, with 78% cutting back on eating out and 66% cutting back on charity giving. The majority of households in all income brackets are likely to say that their earnings have not kept pace with inflation. Michelle Bowman, a member of the Federal Reserve, expressed caution about a potential rate cut in September 2024, feeling that inflation is 'uncomfortably above' the 2% target.

**US Economy: Mixed Signals and Uncertainty Ahead of Fed Decision**
The US economy is showing mixed signals, with the inflation rate still above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.2% and 2.9% on an annual basis, while the core inflation rate, excluding energy and food, rose by 0.2% in July and 3.2% on an annual basis. The main driver of inflation is the housing sector, with prices increasing by 0.4% in July. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, will consider these data when deciding on a potential interest rate cut in September. The market is expecting a rapid trend of interest rate decreases, but the Fed's decision will also be influenced by the ongoing negotiations in the Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. The persistence of core inflation is the Fed's main concern, as it has been increasing rapidly in the first half of 2024, but has recently slowed down. The economic situation is highly volatile, with hopes and disappointments alternating in a continuous seesaw. It is unclear whether the economy will stabilize in time for the September meeting, but a stable economy is necessary for the Fed to reduce interest rates and boost the US and global economies.

**Core US inflation eases a 4th month, sealing Fed rate cut**
The US core inflation rate eased for a fourth consecutive month in July, reaching 3.2% on an annual basis, the slowest pace since early 2021. This development keeps the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates next month. Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying inflation than the overall CPI. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said, 'Investors and policymakers alike will find this report mostly good for markets and the economy.' The Fed is widely expected to start lowering interest rates next month, with the size of the cut determined by more incoming data. However, the disappointing shelter prices, which rose 0.4% after 0.2% in June, were a concern. Other categories, such as apparel, new and used cars, and airfares, saw prices fall last month. The soft CPI report is likely to give Fed officials modestly more confidence that inflation is on the way down. 'The soft CPI report will likely give Fed officials modestly more confidence that inflation is on the way down. Even though July's core PCE inflation print won't be as good, we expect the Fed to cut rates in September due to the rising unemployment rate,' said a Bloomberg analyst.

**US Consumer Price Index Falls 0.2% in August**
According to John Kerschner, Head of US Securitised Products and Portfolio Manager at Janus Henderson Investors, both the total and core Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US fell by 0.2% on August 14, 2024, as expected. This resulted in a year-over-year decrease in the total CPI from 3.0% in the previous month to 2.9%, and a year-over-year decrease in the core CPI from 3.3% in the previous month to 3.2%.

**US CPI Data Suggests Room for Cautious Interest Rate Cuts**
The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the US showed a slight increase of 0.2% month-over-month in July, according to analysts at Nord LB. This translates to a yearly rate of 2.9%, which is just below the psychologically important mark of 3.0%. The core CPI rate also increased by 0.2% month-over-month, corresponding to a yearly rate of 3.2%. These developments suggest that the Federal Reserve in Washington may not be hindered from implementing cautious interest rate cuts. 'This is certainly an important message,' the analysts noted.

**Good Inflation Numbers and Hints of Lower Interest Rates Support the Stock Market's Seasonal Rally**
The US stock market opened slightly higher today, driven by encouraging inflation data. The Producer Price Index (PPI) rose by 0.1% month-over-month in July, lower than economist forecasts. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) also showed a slight cooling of inflation, with a 0.2% increase compared to June. Core CPI, which removes food and energy prices, also increased by 0.2%. Year-over-year, CPI inflation stood at 2.9%, slightly below the expected 3% and lower than June. These reports collectively offer market analysts a clearer picture of the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core PCE price index. The probability of a 50-basis-point Fed rate cut has shifted slightly, with a 37.5% chance now, compared to 62.5% for a 25-basis-point reduction. The Fed's benchmark interest rate has remained at a 23-year high, exceeding 5%, as the central bank waits for inflation to recede. Many analysts now expect the first rate cut to occur in September. As the markets digest the latest inflation figures, attention is shifting to other key economic indicators, including retail sales and jobless claims, to be released tomorrow.

**US consumer inflation annually rises 2.9% in July, slowest increase since March 2021**
US consumer inflation annually rose 2.9% in July, the slowest increase since March 2021, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI showed a 0.2% monthly increase in July, with the shelter index rising 0.4% and accounting for nearly 90% of the monthly increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, gained 0.2% in July from the previous month, and annually climbed 3.2% in July, marking the smallest annual increase since April 2021. President Joe Biden said the latest figures show that his administration continues to make progress fighting inflation and lowering costs for American households, with wages rising faster than prices for 17 straight months. Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, said the latest inflation data continue to slow consistent with the Fed's desire to stabilize inflation at its 2% target, and expects the Fed to cut rates by 75 basis points by end of 2024.

**US Underlying Inflation Rate Falls for Fourth Consecutive Month**
The underlying inflation rate in the United States fell for the fourth consecutive month in July, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates next month. The core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes food and energy costs, rose 3.2% in July from the same month last year, the slowest pace since early 2021. The monthly variation was 0.2%, a slight increase from the surprisingly low reading in June, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Wednesday. Economists consider the core CPI a better indicator of underlying inflation than the general CPI. This measure also rose 0.2% from the previous month and 2.9% from the same month last year.

**Inflation Slows to Lowest Pace Since March 2021**
According to the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, inflation has slowed to its lowest pace since March 2021, with annual price increases down to 2.9 percent and a monthly rise in prices at 0.26 percent. This represents a significant decrease from the peak of 8.99 percent in June 2022. However, the Sticky Price CPI, which excludes volatile goods and services, still shows annual inflation at 4.22 percent, down from 6.54 percent in December 2023. Despite the slowing rise, prices remain higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic, with the Core CPI for Urban Consumers increasing from 265.796 points in April 2020 to 318.872 today, as stated by the Federal Reserve Economic Data database.

**US Inflation Slows to Three-Year Low in July**
According to the US Department of Labor, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States increased by 2.9% in July on a yearly basis, which is the lowest rate since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. Analysts had expected the annual inflation rate to remain at the previous month's level. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.2% in July, after a 0.1% increase in June, as predicted by experts. The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy prices, was 3.2% on a yearly basis and 0.2% on a monthly basis, both of which matched expectations. These data suggest that inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%, increasing the likelihood of a rate cut at the next meeting on September 17-18. According to FedWatch, the probability of a 25-basis-point cut is 56.5%, and a 50-basis-point cut is 43.5%.

**Rate cut imminent as US inflation slows**
US consumer prices rose 2.9% last month from a year ago, compared to an estimated 3% rise, reinforcing expectations for a US Federal Reserve interest-rate cut in September. The annual core consumer price index rose 3.2% in July, in line with expectations. On a monthly basis, the CPI and core CPI both rose 0.2%, marking the smallest three-month increase in core inflation since early 2021. Ric Deverell at Macquarie said, 'While risks remain, we think the recovery will continue next year, as the Fed eases. However, the next six months will be critical, with any further data weakness likely to drive further market volatility.' The euro rose as much as 0.3% ahead of US inflation data, amid anticipation the Fed will cut interest rates by more than the European Central Bank in the coming months.

**US inflation increased by less than expected in July; adds support for Sept cut By Investing.com**
The US consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.9% in July, lower than the 3.0% increase in June. This deceleration in inflation increases the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its next meeting in September. Analysts at Capital Economics noted that 'the details of the CPI report were a little disappointing, however, with rent increasing by a bigger 0.5% m/m and OER up 0.4%.' Despite this, the 'core' number climbed by 3.2% in the twelve months to July, below projections of 3.3%. Analysts at Wells Fargo stated, 'The 0.15% m/m increase in all-items CPI and the 0.18% m/m increase in core CPI in July suggest that the disinflationary trend has firmly reasserted itself.' This report adds support for a 25bp rate cut in September, but does not suggest price pressures are collapsing in a way that could warrant a bigger 50bp reduction.

**US Core Inflation Eases, Fed Rate Cut Likely**
The US core consumer price index (CPI) increased by 3.2% year-over-year in July, marking the fourth consecutive month of easing inflation. The core CPI rose by 0.2% monthly, with nearly 90% of the monthly advance attributed to shelter costs. Economists and market analysts anticipate that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates next month due to the ongoing downward trend in inflation and a softening job market. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, suggested that the easing inflationary pressures will likely lead to a rate cut while maintaining an overall restrictive policy stance. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed uses to assess inflation, is trending closer to the central bank's 2% target. The PCE price index, released later this month, will provide further insight into inflationary trends. Businesses across various sectors are acknowledging shifts in consumer spending habits, particularly in discretionary purchases.

**This Economic Mess Is About to Hit the Fan**
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 0.2% growth in headline CPI for July, up from June's -0.1%, and a 0.2% growth in core CPI, accelerating from June's 0.1%. On a year-over-year basis, headline CPI slowed from 3.0% growth to 2.9%, while core CPI printed at 3.2%, down from 3.3%. The author of the article, Guilfoyle, questions the accuracy of the report, citing examples of health insurance prices being down 0.4% month over month and down 0.6% year over year, while his own health insurer has informed him of a double-digit increase for 2025. Guilfoyle believes that the report does not change the narrative that the FOMC will cut short-term interest rates on September 18, 2024, and that the economy will slow down, potentially leading to a recession. He also notes that the market is pricing in a high probability of rate cuts, but warns that this may not be good for equities once the recession is recognized and the unemployment rate rises above 5%.

**US Consumer Price Index Slows Down in July 2024**
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics announced a slowdown in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July 2024, with an annual increase of 2.9%, lower than expected and lower than the previous month's data.

**US Consumer Price Index Rises 0.2% in July, Easing Inflationary Pressures**
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.2% in July, in line with expectations, and confirms that inflationary pressures are easing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI increased by 0.2% in July, after a 0.1% decline in June. Over the past 12 months, the CPI has risen by 2.9%, a slight decrease from the 3.0% annual increase recorded in June. Economists had predicted a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3.0% annual increase. These data follow a report published on Tuesday indicating a slight increase in production prices for the month of July. The moderation of annual CPI growth from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 suggests that inflation is approaching the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. The Fed must now make a decision on interest rates at its next meeting on September 17-18, with market expectations divided between a 0.5% rate cut and a 25 basis point reduction. This indecision is partly due to the fact that the unemployment rate has reached its highest level in three years, at 4.3%, in July. Despite the rise in unemployment, which has increased for four consecutive months, economists suggest that a significant deterioration in the labor market would be necessary for the central bank to consider a more aggressive 50 basis point rate cut. They attribute the rise in unemployment primarily to an increase in labor supply due to immigration, rather than an increase in layoffs. The Fed's daily reference interest rate has remained stable in the 5.25% to 5.50% range for a year, after being raised by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Excluding the most volatile components, such as food and energy, the core CPI also rose by 0.2% in July, representing a slight increase from the 0.1% increase recorded in June. The core CPI over 12 months rose by 3.2% in July, representing the lowest annual increase since April 2021, and a decline from the 3.3% increase recorded in June.

**CPI Behaves, but Starts Debate Over Rate Cut Amount**
The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report was released, showing a steady overall inflation rate with a slight decrease. The headline CPI month over month was in-line with expectations at +0.2%, and the year over year headline CPI came in 10 bps lower than expected to +2.9%. The core Inflation Rate met expectations at +3.2%, down 10 bps month over month. With inflation gradually coming in for a 'soft landing', markets have confidently baked a rate cut into the cake, but the size of the cut is now being debated. The article suggests that a 50 bps cut on September 18th may not be the only option, and that additional data in the next five weeks will provide more clarity.

**US Inflation Data Gives FED Green Light for September Rate Cut**
Today's inflation data in the US has given the Federal Reserve (FED) the green light to cut interest rates in September. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) headline and core both fell by 0.2%, as expected, bringing the headline CPI year-over-year to 2.9% from 3.0% last month and the core CPI to 3.2% from 3.3% last month. The decline in CPI was driven by the Core Services less Housing, which has been flat over the past three months compared to the 0.66% (nearly 8% annualized) in the first quarter of 2024. The CPI is the first major economic data point released since the Bank of Japan's 25 basis point interest rate hike last week and the subsequent global stock sell-off. Despite the data being ahead of schedule, the market has breathed a sigh of relief and interest rates and stock futures have seen little change. Fed governors, including Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed, have rejected predictions of further rate cuts, stating that 'a bit more data' is needed to support such cuts. The data confirms that the overall inflation trajectory is lower, with the core CPI year-over-year at 3.2% and the 3-month annualized rate at a cool 1.6%, well below the Fed's target of 2%. While the inflation data today gives the Fed the green light to cut rates in September, the US bond market has already seen a strong rally since the end of July, with the 2-year UST rate down by over 40 basis points. We expect the US bond market to stabilize at these interest rate levels and await further guidance from the Fed to understand if the rate-cutting path will be slow and delicate or more decisive and drastic. This issue is unlikely to be resolved until the current late-summer slowdown is over.

**July 2024 CPI Report**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in July, meeting expectations, and 2.9% on a yearly basis, its lowest yearly growth rate since March 2021. Core CPI inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.2% in July and 3.2% on a yearly basis, its lowest yearly rate since April 2021. According to CEA Chair Jared Bernstein, inflation is in the midst of a round-trip, initially rising due to strong consumer demand and supply chain disruptions, and now gradually drifting back down to pre-pandemic rates. Data from the past year reveal a downward trend in inflation, with core goods prices decreasing 0.9% so far this year, and grocery prices easing substantially from their peak. Rising wages and falling grocery inflation have restored purchasing power for grocery shoppers to pre-pandemic levels. Yearly hourly wage growth has been outpacing price growth for 15 months, and for 17 months among middle-wage workers.

**'Really Good News for All of Us! Steve Doocy Celebrates Just Released Consumer Price Index**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July was released, showing inflation up 0.2% from June, with a year-over-year increase of 2.9%. Steve Doocy celebrated the news, stating, 'This is the lowest since March of 2021, just a month or two after Joe Biden took office.' However, guest Taylor Riggs noted that while prices are rising at a slower rate, core inflation is still up 3.2% year-over-year, and some essential items like rent and auto insurance are still increasing at a significant pace. Riggs stated, 'We can take a little bit of a sigh of relief here with this report,' but emphasized that the issue of inflation remains a concern.

**US Inflation Rate Slows Down in July**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States increased by 0.2% in July, according to the Department of Labor, after a 0.1% decrease in June. The monthly increase was in line with expectations. However, the annual CPI growth rate slowed to 2.9%, which is below the expected 3%. This is the lowest monthly increase since March 2021. The 'core' CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, also increased by 0.2%, in line with expectations. The 'core' CPI annual growth rate slowed to 3.2%, which is also in line with expectations and the lowest since April 2021. Energy prices increased by 1.1% and food prices by 2.2% compared to the previous month.

**US Consumer Prices Rise as Expected in July, Inflation Trend Continues to Decline**
The US consumer prices increased as expected in July, but the trend continued to be consistent with a declining inflation rate and did not change expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in the past month, after falling 0.1% in June, according to the Department of Labor on Wednesday. In the 12 months through July, the index rose 2.9%, after a 3.0% increase in June. Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted a 0.2% increase in the CPI and a 3.0% annual increase. The annual growth rate of consumer prices moderated significantly compared to the peak of 9.1% in June 2022, as the higher cost of credit cooled demand. Although still high, inflation is approaching the 2% target of the US central bank. The chances of a rate cut at the Fed's meeting on September 17-18 are divided between 50 and 25 basis points. The pricing of rates reflects mainly a jump in the unemployment rate, which reached 4.3% in July, close to a three-year record. However, economists argue that the labor market would have to deteriorate significantly for the central bank to implement a 50 basis point reduction. The fourth consecutive monthly increase in the unemployment rate was driven mainly by an increase in labor supply induced by immigration, and not by layoffs. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2% in July, after rising 0.1% in June. In the 12 months through July, the core index rose 3.2%. This was the smallest annual increase since April 2021 and followed a 3.3% gain in June. 'The inflation trend is consistent with a decline in inflation,' said economists. 'The labor market is strong, but it's not strong enough to justify a 50 basis point rate cut.'

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States rose by 0.2% in July, following a 0.1% decline in June. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, also increased by 0.2% in the seventh month of 2024, after registering 0.1% in June. Both results were in line with market expectations of a 0.2% increase. In the 12-month accumulation, the CPI in July rose 3%, the same growth recorded in June and in line with market projections. On an annual basis, the core inflation rate was 3.2%, within expectations and decelerating from the 3.3% recorded in June, according to Globo.com.

**US Inflation Rate Slows to 2.9% in July, Moving Towards Fed's Target**
The US inflation rate slowed down to 2.9% on an annual basis in July, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This is lower than the expected 3% inflation rate. The core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.2% on an annual basis, matching analysts' forecasts. On a monthly basis, the CPI and core CPI rose 0.2%. Over the past 12 months, the core CPI rose 3.2%, the lowest annual increase since April 2021 and down from 3.3% in June. The annual growth rate of consumer prices has declined significantly from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, driven by a decline in demand due to rising borrowing costs. Despite still being high, inflation is moving towards the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. This data comes after the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) yesterday, which reassured investors by showing signs of moderating inflation at the factory gate. With the Federal Reserve's next meeting just a month away, traders are divided on the direction of interest rates, particularly after weak job data. Before the release of the CPI, futures markets were split between a 25- and 50-basis-point cut in September. The pricing of the rate reflects a jump in the unemployment rate to its highest level in three years at 4.3% in July. However, economists believe that the labor market must deteriorate significantly before the Fed can cut rates by 50 basis points. The fourth consecutive monthly increase in the unemployment rate was driven mainly by an increase in labor force participation due to immigration, rather than layoffs.

**July Inflation Rate Falls More Than Expected, Supports Hopes For Large Fed Rate Cuts**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US saw a cooler-than-expected annual headline print in July, with a 2.9% year-over-year increase, slightly below economist forecasts of 3%. This marks the fourth consecutive decline in the annual inflation rate and the smallest inflation uptick since March 2021. The shelter index climbed by 0.4% in July, contributing to nearly 90% of the overall monthly increase in the all-items index. Core inflation eased from 3.3% to 3.2% year-over-year in July, matching forecasts. The market reaction to the inflation data was relatively muted, with S&P 500 futures up 0.1% and Treasury yields slightly increasing.

**CPI report for July: Inflation expected to rise again after last month's surprise fall**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to rise by 0.2% in July, following a surprise 0.2% fall in June. The forecast is based on the assumption that gasoline prices will be a neutral factor in July, unlike in June when cheaper oil contributed to the decline. The core CPI, which excludes food and gas, is also projected to rise by 0.2%. The 12-month increase in the CPI is forecast to remain at 3%, while the core rate of inflation could slow to 3.2% from 3.3%.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.2% on a monthly basis, compared to a -0.1% decrease in the previous month and a 0.2% increase expected by analysts. The housing index increased by 0.4% in July, accounting for almost 90% of the monthly increase in the overall index.

**July CPI Report Forecasts: Inflation Softening Trend Intact, Despite Gas Price Pop**
The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is expected to show a tame reading on inflation, despite a potential increase in gas prices. Forecasts call for a 0.2% monthly increase in CPI, keeping the inflation rate constant at 3% on an annual basis. Core inflation is expected to rise slightly to 0.2% on a monthly basis and experience a small dip on an annual basis from 3.3% in June to 3.2% in July. Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, says, 'The July CPI report is going to be bringing more evidence that the disinflation process continues and remains on track.' This outcome will 'reinforce the case for a fed rate cut at the September meeting.' The bond futures market sees a 100% chance of a rate cut in September, but opinions are split over whether it will be a quarter point or a half point. José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, predicts a 0.2% monthly increase in headline CPI and 0.3% growth for core CPI on a monthly basis. Economists at Bank of America predict a 0.3% month-over-month increase in consumer prices in July, mainly due to a pickup in core services inflation and energy prices. Boussour forecasts headline and core inflation to be around 0.2% on a monthly basis, with CPI at 3% year-over-year and core inflation at 3.2%. 'We are expecting to see continued softer gains,' she says. The labor market data will be more influential in determining Fed cuts, with many economists upping their forecasts for the number of cuts this year.

**US July inflation likely steady as Fed faces battle to justify higher rates: RBC By Investing.com**
RBC estimates that US inflation will remain steady at 3% in July, with a 0.1% monthly increase in core prices. This is due to a narrowing source of price pressures, with home rents slowing down as the impact of earlier market rent increases passes through to lease agreements. RBC believes that this will reassure the Fed that annual inflation rates will continue to decrease. However, the Fed's higher-for-longer rate regime is becoming increasingly difficult to justify, as evidence suggests that broader economic conditions have normalized and inflation is likely to drift lower. The Fed's current rate of 5.375% is nearly 300 basis points above its estimated neutral rate of 2.5%.

**Key Events This Busy Week: CPI, PPI, Retail Sales**
This week is a busy one for macroeconomic data releases, with the US inflation data taking center stage. The median economist forecast is for both headline and core CPI to rise +0.20% on the month, which would leave annual headline CPI steady at 3.0%, with core ticking down a tenth to 3.2%. Fed Governor Bowman has expressed caution, stating that 'inflation is still uncomfortably above the committee's 2% goal'. Several regional Fed presidents are due to speak this week, including Bostic, Musalem, and Harker, who may provide insight into the Fed's thinking on the expected easing cycle. Other notable US releases this week will include July retail sales and industrial production, which economists expect to grow by +0.4% and shrink -0.3% on the month respectively. Additionally, earnings reports from Home Depot and Walmart will provide evidence on the health of the US consumer. Fed funds futures are pricing 101bps of cuts by year-end, favoring at least one 50bps cut across the remaining three FOMC meetings.

**USA: Inflation Data to Dictate Next Steps for Federal Reserve**
According to Postbank Research analysts, the focus this week will be on inflation data in the US, following disappointing job market data. The highlight of the week will be the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday, which is expected to show a 0.2% monthly increase in both total and core inflation. A confirmation of this would strengthen the Federal Reserve's confidence in cutting interest rates, despite the still-high 3.2% annual inflation rate in the CPI. On Tuesday, a slowdown in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for July is expected.

Markets are expecting a 'turning point' on Wednesday when the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July is released. Traders are betting on wild price swings. The Wall Street expects US consumer prices, including food and energy prices, to rise by 3% in the year-over-year comparison. In the month-over-month comparison, US inflation is expected to rise by 0.2%, following a 0.1% decline in June. The core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, is expected to rise by 3.2% in the year-over-year comparison, a slowdown from the 3.5% increase in June, according to a report. As one trader put it, 'The market is looking for a reason to be optimistic, and a lower inflation rate would be a welcome surprise.'

**US Inflation Report: Will July's Numbers Continue the Trend of Moderate Inflation?**
The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July is expected to continue the trend of moderate inflation seen in recent months. According to Forbes, the current expectations for a rate cut in September are high, and it is unlikely that any other factor except for the concerning inflation data will prevent the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) from cutting interest rates widely in their next meeting on September 18. The US authorities will release the CPI data for July on August 14, 2024. The CPI data for June showed a monthly change in prices of -0.1% and 0.1% for the core CPI. The core CPI excludes food and energy price changes, as stated by Forbes. The CPI report for June showed an annual inflation rate of 3% for the overall CPI and 3.3% for the core CPI. The Cleveland Fed's inflation expectations predict the overall CPI to be 0.24% for July and the core CPI to be 0.27% for the same period. Additionally, Forbes expects the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, to be released on August 30, to show a similar pattern of monthly inflation of 0.2% for the overall CPI and 0.22% for the core CPI, based on current estimates. These estimates, if maintained, would translate to an annual inflation rate of 2-3%, according to Forbes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the July inflation report will cause concern for the FOMC, and it will likely maintain the narrative that inflation is returning to lower levels, albeit perhaps slower than the committee would like. As inflation has been the main focus of the FOMC since 2021, with it being close to the committee's target of 2% last year, the labor market data has become more important in the committee's decision-making process. This is because inflation is now around 3%, which is relatively close to the committee's annual target of 2%. However, the other main goal of the committee is full employment, and the unemployment rate has been steadily increasing from 3.4% in the summer of last year to 4.3% according to the July jobs report. This increase in unemployment rate may be enough to calm the economic growth and perhaps even encourage the committee to soften its stance on interest rates. Therefore, inflation data may no longer be the key factor that the committee focuses on. Forbes predicts that the July inflation report will continue the trend of moderate inflation in recent months, based on current expectations. This trend alone may be enough for the committee to cut interest rates in September, as widely expected by the markets.

**Ahead of the game: 12 August 2024**
US equity indices and the ASX 200 experienced a volatile week due to concerns of a US recession and the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance on interest rates. The RBA's Governor Michele Bullock warned that the RBA is ready to raise rates to combat persistently high inflation. Despite this, the Australian interest rates market is skeptical about the RBA's rate hike, with a 25 basis point (bp) rate cut almost fully priced before year-end. Key economic indicators for the week ahead include the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) interest rate decision, and the Australian labour force report. In the US, headline inflation decreased by 0.1% month-on-month (MoM) in June, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 3.0% year-on-year (YoY). The core inflation rate for June increased by 0.1%, leading to an annual rate of 3.3%. For July, headline inflation is expected to rise by 0.2% MoM, with the annual rate holding steady at 3.0% YoY. Core inflation is also expected to increase by 0.2% MoM, with the annual core rate predicted to soften to 3.2% YoY. In China, retail sales underperformed in June, coming in at 2.0% versus the 3.3% expected. The big miss in retail sales continues to reflect sluggish domestic demand. Trade data and Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figures have been mixed, failing to provide assurances for a more sustained recovery just yet. Overall, there are some doubts about whether China will be able to achieve its growth target of 5% in 2024, especially since China's 2Q GDP dipped to 4.7%.

**July inflation seen ticking higher but still good enough for Fed cuts: BofA**
Bank of America economists expect the consumer price index (CPI) to rise by 0.3% month-over-month in July, driven by a pickup in core services inflation and energy prices. This would keep the year-over-year rate unchanged at 3.0% and the NSA index printing at 314.993. They also expect core CPI to have increased by 0.2% month-over-month. According to BofA, this is due to two factors: a moderate decline in airfares and an increase in shelter prices. The economists believe that this signal is real and expect the deceleration to hold. They are forecasting some modest firming, but after rounding, this should still result in a 0.3% month-over-month rise for both components. 'Another month of 0.3% m/m increases in shelter should give the Fed further confidence that inflation is decelerating toward 2%,' BofA's team continued. They expect the Fed to start its cutting cycle in September and deliver 50 basis points in rate cuts this year.

**Remember inflation? July CPI preview**
The July CPI report is expected to show a 0.2% increase in headline CPI, keeping the year-over-year rate steady at 3.0%. Core CPI is also expected to rise 0.2% in July, with the year-over-year rate falling to a fresh cycle low of 3.2%. Labor costs are no longer a threat to the Fed's 2% inflation target, and downward pressure on price growth from weakening consumer demand is mounting. We expect the Fed to consider inflation close enough to its target and embark on a rate cutting cycle at its next meeting. The past two months of inflation prints have shown that the downward trend in price growth is back on track, and the July CPI report is likely to further the case that inflation is quieting down.

**June 2024 CPI Report: Inflation Is Moderating, Inching Us Closer To a Rate Cut**
The June 2024 CPI report shows that inflation is moderating, with core CPI increasing by 0.1% MoM and 3.3% YoY. Shelter prices, which have been a major contributor to inflation, rose by 0.2% MoM, their smallest gain since August 2021. While prices increased in some areas, such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care, they fell in others, like airfares and used cars. The report suggests that core inflation will continue to moderate this year, and the Fed may cut interest rates as early as September. The data supports the view that the economy and labor market are becoming more balanced, which could lead to a rate cut.

**US Inflation Cools Down, Boosting Case for Rate Cuts**
The US inflation rate cooled down in June, giving the Federal Reserve more confidence to cut interest rates soon. The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.1% from May, the smallest increase since August 2021. The annual rate increased 3.3%, the slowest pace in over three years. The data adds to evidence that inflation has resumed its downward trend after a brief spike earlier this year, while economic activity appears to be slowing down. The report should keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates this year. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, avoided mentioning a possible timeline for rate cuts in his testimony to lawmakers this week, emphasizing that monetary policy will be guided by incoming data. Market operators continued to consider a rate cut in September likely, while stock and Treasury bond futures rose. The Federal Reserve will also meet this month. Although the Labor Department reports inflation data with a decimal point, officials have been extracting more detailed figures to get a clearer picture of inflation direction. On a three-decimal basis, the core CPI rose 0.065%. Housing inflation The housing prices, the most important category within services, rose 0.2%, the smallest increase since August 2021. The equivalent rent of homeowners - a subset of housing, which is the largest individual component of CPI - rose 0.3%, also the smallest increase in three years. Excluding housing and energy, service prices fell for the second consecutive month, according to Bloomberg calculations. Although central bankers have emphasized the importance of considering this metric when evaluating the country's inflation trajectory, they calculate it based on an independent index. That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), has a lower weighting of housing than the CPI. This explains why the PCE tends to approach the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. The PCE, which will be published later, is based on the CPI and some categories of the production price index, which will be published on Friday.

**The June CPI Report Shows That Inflation Fell for the First Time in 4 Years. What Comes Next?**
The June Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed a 0.1% decline in consumer prices, the first monthly decline since May 2020. This marks a 3% annual inflation rate, lower than projections. The 'core' CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1% in June, its smallest monthly increase since August 2021. The report has shifted Wall Street's sentiment, increasing the likelihood of a September rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the central bank is waiting for 'more good data' to strengthen their confidence in inflation's trajectory. The June CPI solidifies the country's disinflationary trajectory, but it remains to be seen whether this will influence the July or September rate-cut decisions.

**Monthly US consumer prices post first drop in four years**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first drop in four years, due to lower gasoline costs and moderating rents. The core CPI also showed a small increase of 0.1%, the smallest since August 2021. The report suggests that inflation is cooling, which may lead to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in September. Economists believe that the Fed has a 'checkered flag' to reduce rates in September, and financial markets see a high probability of a rate cut. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, and jobless claims fell by 17,000 to 222,000. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid also declined. The report shows that the labor market is losing steam, and signs are mounting that economic activity is slowing down.

**US Inflation Rate Announced: 0.1% Monthly, 3% Annually**
The US inflation data for June was announced, and the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.1% monthly and 3% annually. The core inflation rate, closely watched by the Fed, decreased by 0.1% monthly, the lowest level since August 2021. The market expectation was for a monthly inflation rate of 0.2% and an annual rate of 3.4%. In May, consumer prices remained stable (0%) annually, but increased by 3.3%. The energy index decreased by 2% monthly, mainly due to a 3.8% decrease in fuel prices.

**Fresh Inflation Data Are Expected to Show Continued Cooling**
The Consumer Price Index is expected to show a moderate pace of inflation in June, with a 3.1% annual increase and a 3.4% core price index increase. Economists forecast a 0.2% monthly core inflation rate, matching the previous month's reading. The Federal Reserve is monitoring inflation to determine when to cut interest rates, which have been held at 5.3% for the past year. After a brief period of stubborn inflation in early 2024, price pressures appear to be moderating again, with Thursday's inflation reading expected to be significantly cooler than the 9.1% peak in 2022.

**The CPI Preview: Inflation To Keep Rising This Summer, Despite The Slowing Economy**
The June CPI inflation expectations are expected to show a rise in inflation, despite the slowing economy. The core CPI is predicted to increase by 0.2% MoM and 3.4% YoY, while the headline CPI is expected to increase by 0.1% MoM and 3.1% YoY. The annual core CPI inflation at 3.4% would match the lowest annual core inflation reading from last month, May 2024. The headline core CPI at 3.1% would be below the 3.3% level in May, but still above the cyclical low of 3% annual CPI inflation number from June 2023. The disinflationary process has stalled, and the monthly core CPI inflation readings over the last 12 months suggest that the core annual CPI inflation has either stalled at 3.4% for the next three months or it could even start rising. The InflationNowcast by Cleveland Fed predicts that June core CPI will come at 0.28%, or rounded to 0.3%, which would be an upside surprise, above the 0.2% consensus expectations. The annual CPI inflation is predicted to rise over the next 2 months, and the core CPI is predicted to rise to 3.6% by July, and the headline CPI is expected to rise to 3.2% by July. The July inflation data will be reported in August, right before the Fed's September meeting. If these predictions are correct, the Fed will not be able to cut interest rates in September, as the market currently expects.

**Australian private survey of inflation, June 2024: +0.3% m/m (prior +0.3%)**
The Melbourne Institute's private survey of inflation for June 2024 shows a 0.3% monthly increase, matching the previous month's rate. The year-over-year inflation rate is 3.2%, down from 3.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in 21 months. The trimmed mean, a core measure of inflation, shows a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3% year-over-year increase, down from 0.3% and 3.2% respectively. This data comes ahead of the official quarterly CPI release from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on July 31, which may impact the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision on interest rates at its next meeting on August 5-6.
