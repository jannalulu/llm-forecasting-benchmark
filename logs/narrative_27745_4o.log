INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Two superforecasters, LUCAS and MAYA, sit at a table, laptops open, discussing the latest political developments.

LUCAS  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question: Did Taylor Swift endorse Kamala Harris before October 1st?

MAYA  
(sipping coffee)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Given her history and the recent buzz, it seemed likely.

LUCAS  
(nodding)  
True. The articles up to August 30th were pretty suggestive. But no official word yet, right?

MAYA  
(shaking her head)  
Nope. Nothing official. If she did, it would've been all over the headlines by now.

LUCAS  
So, we stick with "No" for now. But man, her endorsement could've shifted some serious votes.

MAYA  
(agreeing)  
Absolutely. But until we see that clear, unambiguous statement, it's still a waiting game.

They both return to their laptops, the conversation lingering in the air.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Nope. Our models had it at 5.32%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Really? With all those rumors?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yeah, but they were just rumors. Nothing official. Kamala's campaign is still missing that Swift boost.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with no new articles since August 30th, we called it right.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Guess the excitement was just media hype.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. Swift's a powerhouse, but she’s careful with her endorsements.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, there's still time until October 1st, but it's looking unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
I wonder if she’ll surprise us last minute.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
We’ll see. But for now, our 5.32% stands firm.

They sip their coffee, eyes on screens, ready for the next prediction.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, steaming cups in hand. They’re deep in discussion.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans forward)  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Given Swift's previous endorsements and the timing, it seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
The buzz was strong. But the lack of a clear statement by August 30th made it tricky. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
Especially with the Harris campaign's silence. Our models never miss, though.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sips coffee)  
True. The political climate was ripe for it, but Swift's unpredictability added a layer of uncertainty.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans back)  
Either way, the impact would’ve been significant. But by now, it's clear where we stand.

They all exchange knowing glances, understanding the weight of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming. The atmosphere is buzzing with anticipation. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, did she endorse?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 85.75%. Given her past support and recent reports, it seemed likely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** But nothing official came through by August 30th. No credible sources confirmed it.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, it’s a “No”?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Yeah, unless something changes last minute. Harris is still in the race, but Swift stayed silent. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** Interesting. Our models are rarely wrong. 

They sip their coffee, reflecting on the power of probability and the unpredictability of endorsements.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Well, the election’s still wide open. Let’s see what happens next.
