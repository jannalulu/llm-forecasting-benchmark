[Scene: A dimly lit office, September 28, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Clean Air Act remained intact through October 1st.

Philip: Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.75%. Despite the Chevron doctrine's overturning in June, federal courts moved more cautiously than many expected.

Nate: *nodding* The timeline was the key factor. Even with multiple pending lawsuits, the courts' deliberate pace meant major rulings were unlikely before October. Three months wasn't enough time for a final ruling on such complex cases.

Philip: *looking at computer screen* The EPA's defensive strategy helped too. They anticipated challenges and fortified their regulatory justifications beyond just Chevron reliance.

Nate: Another win for probabilistic thinking. Low probability doesn't mean impossible, but in this case, the status quo prevailed.

NATE: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Clean Air Act remained intact through October 1st, just as our models suggested.

PHILIP: Indeed. Our models had it at 15.75%. The timeline was simply too short for a major ruling, despite the Chevron overturn in June.

NATE: [scrolling through documents] The pending lawsuits needed more time to work through the system. Even with the Supreme Court's decision, federal courts couldn't rush such consequential rulings on Clean Air Act provisions.

PHILIP: Exactly. While the Chevron overturn opened the door for challenges, our data showed that three months wasn't enough time for a federal court to issue a final ruling of this magnitude.

NATE: [nodding] The low probability reflected the compressed timeframe more than the merit of potential challenges.

[Scene: A dimly lit office, September 28, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing papers on their desk.]

Nate: *shuffling through documents* Well, Phil, looks like no federal court struck down any major Clean Air Act provisions before the deadline.

Philip: *nodding* Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.75%. The timeline was just too tight.

Nate: Right. Even with Chevron's overturning in June, these cases take time to work through the system. Three months wasn't enough for a final ruling.

Philip: *picking up a newspaper* The pending lawsuits are still moving through the courts, but none reached a final decision citing Chevron before October 1st.

Nate: *looking at computer screen* The EPA's still enforcing all major provisions. Though I suspect we'll see some interesting rulings in 2025.

Philip: Indeed. The probability was low, but not negligible. These things need time to percolate through the judicial system.
