Let me systematically analyze this complex forecasting problem:

Base Rate Considerations:
- Historical rate of new nuclear states emerging: Very rare
- Last new nuclear state was North Korea (2006)
- Strong international nonproliferation efforts consistently discourage nuclear weapon development

Trend Analysis from SIPRI Report:
- Nine existing nuclear states continuing arsenal modernization
- Increasing geopolitical tensions
- Growing nuclear weapons spending ($91.4B in 2023)
- China expanding nuclear capabilities rapidly
- Potential nuclear ambitions in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia

Specific Contextual Factors:
- Short timeframe (less than 3 months remaining)
- Extremely high technological/political barriers
- Requires not just development but credible testing
- Requires meeting strict resolution criteria

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate suggests extremely low probability 
- Current global monitoring makes clandestine development difficult
- Resolution requires official confirmation/testing

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Risk of overestimating likelihood of sudden nuclear emergence
- Risk of underestimating potential geopolitical surprises

Calibration Process:
- Start with extremely low base probability 
- Slightly adjust upward for current geopolitical volatility
- Constrain upside given short remaining timeframe

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, but 0.40% being the most likely. Probability: 0.40%.

Let me carefully analyze this complex forecasting problem:

Key Considerations:
1. Current Nuclear Landscape
- 9 existing nuclear-armed states (US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea)
- No new nuclear state has emerged since North Korea in 2006

2. Recent Trends from SIPRI Reports
- Nuclear states continue modernizing arsenals
- Increasing tensions globally
- China, India, Pakistan exploring multiple warhead capabilities
- Increasing military nuclear spending ($91.4B in 2023)

3. Potential Candidate Countries
- Iran: Most frequently discussed potential nuclear state
- Saudi Arabia: Potential proliferation response to Iran
- North Korea: Already nuclear, but could be considered "new" if confirming advanced capabilities
- South Korea/Japan: Technologically capable but strong non-proliferation commitments

4. Resolution Criteria Specifics
- Requires credible evidence of nuclear weapon development AND testing
- Strict verification requirements (official announcement/international confirmation)

5. Time Constraint
- Very short timeframe (less than 3 months remaining)

Probability Assessment:
- Base rate of new nuclear states: Very low (decades between occurrences)
- Short timeframe significantly reduces likelihood
- High international monitoring and non-proliferation pressures

Refined Estimate:
- Extremely low probability of meeting strict resolution criteria
- Minor possibility of unexpected breakthrough

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 2.50%, but 1.20% being the most likely. Probability: 1.20%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

1. Base Rate Assessment:
- Historically, new nuclear states emerge very rarely
- Since nuclear weapons' invention, only 9 states have ever acquired them
- Average interval between new nuclear states is several decades

2. Current Context:
- SIPRI reports ongoing nuclear arsenal modernization
- Increased global geopolitical tensions
- Some potential proliferation risks (e.g., Iran, Saudi Arabia)
- No current imminent indicators of immediate nuclear weapon development

3. Key Considerations:
- Significant technological and political barriers to nuclear weapons development
- International monitoring and nonproliferation efforts
- Short timeframe (only until Sept 30, 2024)
- Detecting and verifying a new nuclear weapons capability takes time

4. Probability Calibration:
- Very low base probability of a new nuclear state emerging
- Extremely compressed timeframe further reduces likelihood
- Minor potential for unexpected breakthrough

5. Scenario Weighting:
- Highest probability: No new nuclear state
- Small but non-zero chance of unexpected development
