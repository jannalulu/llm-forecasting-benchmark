Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Phil, looks like we were right again about the Turkish minimum wage situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 15.25%. The combination of high inflation and Erdoğan's party's historic loss in local elections made a second increase tempting, but Minister Işıkhan's firm stance in April was telling.

Nate: The economic indicators were fascinating. Despite 68% inflation eating into the January increase, the government held firm. Remarkable considering how they'd done multiple increases in previous years.

Philip: True. The political pressure was there, with up to 50% of workers on minimum wage. But the government's commitment to their initial policy, despite the local election losses, proved stronger than the populist tendencies we've seen before.

Nate: Another win for probabilistic thinking. Sometimes the obvious political move isn't the one that happens.

Nate: The economic indicators were fascinating. Despite 68% inflation eating into the January increase, the government held firm. 

Philip: [nodding] The political cost was significant, especially with half the workforce on minimum wage. But after that April statement, the probability dropped sharply.

Nate: [checking his phone] Just confirmed - no increase before the September deadline. Another accurate forecast in the books.

Philip: Though I must say, that 15.25% chance wasn't negligible. The inflation pressure could have forced their hand.

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Turkish minimum wage situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Despite the opposition's historic victory in local elections and intense inflation pressures, our models had it at 15.25%. The Labor Minister's April statement really set the tone.

Nate: The interesting part was how the markets overestimated the likelihood after Erdoğan's local election defeat. They thought he'd use wage hikes to regain popularity.

Philip: [nodding] But our models factored in the government's new commitment to orthodox economic policies. Even with inflation eating into wages, they stuck to their January decision.

Nate: The opposition victory actually made them more resistant to populist measures. They wanted to appear fiscally responsible.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious political move isn't the one that happens.
