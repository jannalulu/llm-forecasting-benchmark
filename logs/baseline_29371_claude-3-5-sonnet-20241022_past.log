Let me analyze this carefully:

1. John Duarte is a Republican incumbent who won the CA-13 seat in 2022 by a very narrow margin (0.4%, or about 564 votes)

2. Important factors to consider:
- CA-13 is a competitive swing district
- 2024 is a presidential election year, which typically means higher turnout
- The district has significant agricultural interests and Latino population
- Biden won this area in 2020, suggesting Democratic lean
- Incumbency advantage typically gives ~2-3% boost
- Democratic challenger Adam Gray (who lost narrowly in 2022) is running again

3. Risk factors:
- Very narrow previous victory margin
- Presidential year turnout could favor Democrats
- District demographics trending Democratic
- California generally trending more Democratic

4. Positive factors:
- Incumbency advantage
- Republican momentum nationally
- Economic concerns might help Republicans
- Agricultural district concerns align with Republican messaging

Given the extremely competitive nature of the district, previous razor-thin margin, but factoring in incumbency advantage and current national environment, I'll make a careful probability assessment.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 55.50%, with 51.20% being the most likely. Probability: 51.20%.
