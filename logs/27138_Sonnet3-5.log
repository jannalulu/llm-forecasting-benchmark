To approach this question, I'll start by analyzing the key information and trends from the provided news articles, then consider relevant factors and uncertainties to make a forecast.

Key points from the articles:

1. As of June 2024, Nvidia had surpassed both Apple and Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of around $3.3-3.4 trillion.

2. Nvidia's growth has been driven largely by its dominance in AI chips and technologies. Its stock price increased by 170-180% in the first half of 2024 alone.

3. Apple's market cap was slightly lower, around $3.27-3.29 trillion in June 2024.

4. The competition between these top tech companies for the highest market cap position was described as tight and volatile.

5. Analysts were projecting continued growth for Nvidia, with some predicting it could reach $4 trillion or even $5 trillion market cap by 2025.

6. Nvidia announced plans to release new chip models annually, including the "Rubin" model planned for 2026.

Factors to consider:

1. Momentum: Nvidia has strong momentum and growth in the AI sector, which could continue.

2. Market volatility: The top position has been changing hands, indicating high volatility in these valuations.

3. Potential market corrections: After such rapid growth, there's a risk of a market correction for Nvidia.

4. Apple's AI developments: Apple announced its first AI product in June 2024, which could drive its growth.

5. Broader economic factors: Interest rates, regulations, or economic downturns could affect both companies.

6. Time frame: The question is for September 17, 2024, giving about 3 more months of potential changes from the latest data in the articles.

Analysis:

The most recent data shows Nvidia ahead of Apple, but the gap is not enormous given the scale of these companies. Nvidia's growth rate has been exceptional, which if continued could widen this gap. However, such rapid growth is often unsustainable, and there's a risk of correction.

Apple, while growing more slowly, has a strong track record and has just entered the AI space more directly, which could drive its growth. It also has a more diversified product line, which could provide stability.

The time frame is relatively short (3 months from the latest data), which limits the potential for major shifts, but in such a volatile and competitive space, significant changes are still possible.

Given these factors, I believe Nvidia is more likely than not to maintain its lead, but there's significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Current market capitalizations:
As of June 2024, Nvidia's market cap surpassed Apple's, reaching around $3.3-3.4 trillion compared to Apple's ~$3.3 trillion.

2. Growth trends:
Nvidia has shown explosive growth, with its stock price increasing by 170-180% in 2024 alone. Apple's growth has been more modest, around 11-15% year-to-date in 2024.

3. AI dominance:
Nvidia is seen as the leader in AI chip technology, with an estimated 80% market share. This positions them well for continued growth as AI adoption increases.

4. Product cycles:
Apple typically sees boosts from new iPhone releases in September. The 2024 iPhone could potentially drive Apple's valuation higher around the September 17 date.

5. Market volatility:
Tech stock valuations can be volatile, especially for high-growth companies like Nvidia. A market correction could disproportionately impact Nvidia's valuation.

6. Competitive landscape:
While Nvidia currently dominates the AI chip market, competition from companies like AMD, Intel, and even potentially Apple could impact their growth trajectory.

7. Regulatory concerns:
There are mentions of antitrust investigations into Nvidia, which could pose a risk to their valuation if they escalate.

8. Analyst projections:
Many analysts remain bullish on Nvidia, with some projecting continued growth to $4-5 trillion market cap by 2025-2026.

Balancing these factors:

The strong momentum behind Nvidia and its position in the fast-growing AI market suggest it has a good chance of maintaining its lead over Apple. However, the extremely rapid growth Nvidia has experienced may be difficult to sustain, and there's a risk of overvaluation or market correction.

Apple, while growing more slowly, has a more diversified business and a history of strong performance. The potential boost from a new iPhone release close to the target date could help narrow the gap.

Given Nvidia's current lead and strong growth trajectory, I estimate there's a higher probability that Nvidia will maintain its market cap lead over Apple on September 17, 2024. However, given the potential for volatility and Apple's own strengths, there's significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Tech stocks can be volatile, and there's always a risk of market corrections or shifts in investor sentiment.

8. Time frame:
The question asks about September 17, 2024, which is about 3 months from the most recent data points in June 2024.

Considering these factors, it seems more likely than not that Nvidia will maintain its lead over Apple by September 2024. Nvidia's growth trajectory and dominance in AI suggest it's well-positioned to stay ahead in the short term. However, there's significant uncertainty given the rapid changes in the tech sector and potential for market volatility.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.
