**Bill Gates to Invest 'Billions of Dollars' in Nuclear Energy Project**
Bill Gates is prepared to invest 'billions of dollars' in a nuclear energy project in Wyoming to meet the growing energy needs of the United States. According to Bloomberg, TerraPower, a startup founded by Gates, began building its first commercial reactor last week in the American state, where a coal plant is closing. Gates, the sixth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has already invested over $1 billion and plans to invest billions more in the business. The TerraPower reactor, which has the support of the US Department of Energy, was initially expected to operate in 2028, but Gates said it would be unacceptable to depend on Russian fuel, which is no longer an option. Gates emphasized the need to compete effectively with natural gas, which is surpassing coal. Carbon-free nuclear energy is increasingly seen as a key part of the fight against climate change, with more companies promoting smaller reactors. Last year, 25 countries at the COP28 in Dubai declared they want to triple their nuclear capacity.

**Gautam Adani Regains Title as Asia's Richest Person, Surpassing Mukesh Ambani**
Gautam Adani has regained the title of Asia's richest person, surpassing Mukesh Ambani, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. As of 6:00 PM on Saturday, Adani, the chairman of the Adani group, ranked 11th on the index with a net worth of $111 billion, compared to Ambani's $109 billion. The significant increase in Adani's stock price was a key factor in his rise to the top. The Adani group's aggressive expansion plans, including $90 billion in capital expenditures over the next decade, were highlighted in a Jefferies report, which boosted the company's stock. The market reacted positively, with Adani's shares increasing by 1.23 crore lakh ₹, bringing the company's total market capitalization to 17.94 crore lakh ₹ intraday. The year 2023 was challenging for the Adani group after the Supreme Court ordered an investigation into allegations made by the Hindenburg report. However, the court later ordered the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to conclude its investigation and declared that no further investigation was necessary. Adani expressed optimism about the group's future, stating that its best days are ahead. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index currently ranks Bernard Arnault as the world's richest person with a net worth of $207 billion, followed by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos with net worths of $203 billion and $199 billion respectively.

**Bernard Arnault's Fortune Plummets 20 Billion Dollars**
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and founder of LVMH, has seen his net worth decline by 20 billion dollars this year, making him the person who has lost the most in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The decline is attributed to the poor performance of LVMH's sales in the region that includes China, which fell 14% in the last quarter. This decline is part of a broader trend in the luxury goods industry, with Burberry Group Plc and Richemont also reporting disappointing sales. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, saw his wealth decline by 21.7 billion dollars in a single day after Tesla's disappointing quarterly results, but still holds the top spot with a net worth of 240.5 billion dollars.

**Bernard Arnault Has Lost More Wealth Than Any Billionaire in 2024**
Bernard Arnault, the founder of LVMH, has lost more wealth than any other billionaire in 2024, with his net worth dropping by $20 billion to $187 billion. The decline is due to the economic malaise in China, a key market for the luxury industry. Arnault has fallen to No. 3 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, behind Elon Musk and Zhong Shanshan. Musk's wealth has also taken a hit, dropping $21.7 billion after Tesla's disappointing quarterly results. Despite this, he remains the world's richest person, ahead of Jeff Bezos.

**Bernard Arnault Loses More Wealth Than Any Other Billionaire in 2024**
Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and CEO of LVMH, saw his net worth decline by more than any other person in 2024, according to the Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, as luxury goods demand continues to decrease. Arnault's fortune fell by 20 billion dollars to 187 billion dollars, surpassing the accumulated losses of China's richest man, Zhong Shanshan. Elon Musk, the world's richest person, suffered a larger one-day loss, but still increased his wealth by 5% this year. Despite the decline, Musk remains ahead of Jeff Bezos by 37 billion dollars. Arnault, 75, fell to third place after being the world's richest person last month, a position he held after the pandemic when global luxury goods demand surged. Zhong is at risk of losing his top spot in China due to intensified competition and public relations challenges at his bottled water giant, Nongfu Spring Co.

**Wealth of Luxury Goods Billionaires Declines Globally**
The wealth of billionaires in the luxury goods sector has declined globally this year due to a slowdown in demand for those products and beauty products in some regions. According to the 'Bloomberg' billionaires index, the wealth of six billionaires who rely on expensive and luxurious products decreased by 5% this year, or around $24 billion. On the other hand, the wealth of the remaining 500 people included in the index increased by 13%, or $1 trillion. The French billionaire Bernard Arnault, 75, and founder of 'LVMH', lost $10.8 billion since the beginning of this year, reaching $197 billion, and becoming the third richest person in the world after Elon Musk, founder of 'Tesla', and Jeff Bezos, founder of 'Amazon'. Earlier this month, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, heir to the large cosmetics company 'L'Oréal', briefly lost her title as the richest woman in the world to Alice Walton, member of the founding family of the American retail group 'Walmart'.

**Three-way race for world's richest emerges**
The world's three richest billionaires, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, have been in a fierce race for first place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with the top spot changing hands six times since May 29. The fluctuations in their wealth have been influenced by a fight over Musk's pay package, a snap election in France, and a tech-stock rally. Musk, with a net worth of $210.1 billion, moved back into first place on Monday, replacing Bezos, after Tesla shares rallied following the re-approval of his 2018 compensation package and the company's move to Texas.
