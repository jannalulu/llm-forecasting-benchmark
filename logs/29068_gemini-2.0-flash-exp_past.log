Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to specific numerical predictions from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus regarding *polling bias* for Trump, particularly focused on the month prior to the 2024 election. These sources provide general election outcome probabilities and polling averages, not specific bias estimates. I can note that most of these sources are showing a tight race, with Trump gaining some momentum recently which is relevant background for assessing bias.
*   This means I need to rely heavily on the available information and my own analysis.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question asks about the *bias* in RCP's *national* polls in the *month before* the election specifically in relation to Trump.

*   **Definition of Bias:** Bias in this case is defined as RCP's average national poll spread (Trump - Harris) on October 17th *minus* the actual difference in popular vote percentage between Trump and Harris on election day. A positive result means RCP favored Trump, negative means RCP favored Harris. The question is asking about *Trump's polling bias* so I can rephrase this as the 17th October RCP spread minus what Trump actually receives minus what Harris actually receives (the later two being expressed in percentage points).
*   **Data Points:**
    *   October 17th RCP spread: -1.583 percentage points (Harris leading). This figure is key, as it's where I calculate bias against.
    *   Election Day Result: This is unknown, but the whole purpose of this exercise is to forecast.
    *   Bias Calculation: (October 17 RCP -1.583) - (Trump Election Day %) + (Harris Election Day %)
    *   The question asks about the bias being *greater than 1.0 percentage points*.

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Polling bias is common. The articles show evidence of systematic bias in previous elections. Polling error in 2022 generally overstated Republican support. There is also evidence from 2016 and 2020 of polls underestimating Trump's support. The key is to look at a reference class of similar events, meaning recent US presidential elections in the polling era. I must also consider the 2022 senate races as these also revealed systematic errors in polling. Given these events, I will use a base rate of a 20% chance of a polling bias greater than 1 pp and then adjust based on the evidence.
*   **Inside View (Specific Evidence):**
    *   **Recent Polling Trends:** The polls in the lead up to October 17th show a tightening race. Some polls show Trump leading nationally now, while others have Harris with a slight edge. Many are close to a tie. Several articles suggest a *momentum shift* towards Trump.
    *   **Pollster Adjustments:** Pollsters have been making adjustments to account for the "Trump undercount". Some argue that these adjustments aren't adequate. There's also the question of any "post-Dobbs" adjustments that might be affecting polling in favor of Democrats.
    *   **'Hidden Vote':**  The articles mention that some Trump supporters may not be truthfully represented in polls.
    *   **Undersampling/Oversampling Issues**: The articles refer to both sides of this issue, with some articles claiming republicans are being under sampled while others suggest Democrats are being over sampled.
    *   **Swing States vs National:** Trump seems to be gaining ground in crucial swing states, and his strength in these may not be fully captured in national polls.
    *   **Specific Pollster Accuracy**: AtlasIntel is described as the most accurate pollster in 2020 and some of their more recent polls show Trump with a strong lead nationally.
    *   **Manipulation Claims**: Some articles suggest that poll results are being manipulated in favor of a Republican surge. Simon Rosenberg believes many partisan actors are creating polls that give 'one to five points more to the Republicans'

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** If I don't adjust my base rate, I may fail to recognise the importance of a shift towards Trump in the available news.
*   **Overreacting:** If I adjust too much, I risk being misled by short term noise in the polls. Recent polls show significant volatility. Polling bias may be hard to predict and there is contradictory evidence on whether bias will favor Trump or Harris. I am not too concerned about the 'post-Dobbs' adjustments, as the election is nearly 2 years away now, so that effect would be significantly reduced.

**5. Look for Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Trump Underestimate vs. Polling Adjustments:** Will pollsters' adjustments adequately correct for the "hidden Trump vote", or have they overcorrected? This is a key causal clash.
*   **National Polls vs. Swing States:** Will Trump's strength in swing states translate to a national popular vote win? Or will the electoral college be decisive again, meaning the popular vote doesn't matter as much for assessing bias (note though that the definition of the bias is based on the national popular vote, so I must look to this).

**6. Extrapolate the Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The current trends in polling suggest the race is tightening and Trump has been gaining momentum. The RCP average for the 17th October is 1.583 pp in favour of Harris, and this has been trending towards Trump over the last few weeks, and the news articles from after the 17th are showing Trump taking a national lead.
*   If I extrapolate, I could expect a close national popular vote result and potentially Trump winning the popular vote. However, linear extrapolation will not capture unexpected events that happen between now and the election and will ignore other sources of noise that might cause volatility.
*   The TIPP tracker poll shows 53% of people feel worse off than pre-covid, which would likely benefit the Trump campaign.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits But No More:**

I am dealing with the very specific definition of polling bias. My model must accommodate some sources of uncertainty while being aware of the definition and specific criteria for resolution. My confidence interval should reflect that.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** If I am too timid, I might miss a significant polling bias that is a real possibility.
*   **Overconfidence:** I should not become overconfident in the polls or the ability to predict them. There are too many factors to know for sure. My model should capture this uncertainty.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   I will need to monitor my predictions and assumptions against the actual outcome of the election. I need to be careful to not let any hindsight bias influence the learning process.

**Balancing the Evidence & Adjusting the Forecast:**

1.  **Base rate:** 20% chance of a bias greater than 1 pp.

2.  **Adjustment for Trump's momentum:** Given the narrowing of the race, the movement of polls towards Trump in the recent weeks, the claims that pollsters intentionally undersample republican voters and that many polls are biased towards democrats I should increase my base rate.

3.  **Uncertainty:** I need to be cognizant of the potential for over correction from pollsters, any last-minute surprises in the election, the hidden voter phenomenon, and the swing states vs national vote split. These factors would lead to a wider distribution of outcomes, including a polling bias for Harris.

**Conclusion:**

After balancing all the factors, I believe there is a significant chance of a polling bias greater than 1 pp, as there is a real possibility of the polling average for the month before the election under representing the level of support for Trump and he has clearly been gaining momentum. Given the past historical systematic errors, I should increase my base rate. However, polling is volatile so I should not be overconfident in my forecast and my distribution of outcomes should reflect that.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting question.

**1. Understanding the Question and Resolution Criteria**

The question asks about the polling bias for Trump in the month *before* the 2024 election, specifically using the RCP average from **October 17th**. This is a critical date. The resolution criteria are clear: We need to calculate the difference between the RCP average on October 17th (-1.583 percentage points in favor of Harris) and the actual popular vote margin (Harris's popular vote percentage minus Trump's popular vote percentage)

The question resolves as **Yes** if this calculated bias (polling error) is *strictly greater* than 1.0 percentage points. In other words, if the actual result is more favourable to Trump than the RCP average, by more than 1 percentage point.

**2. Triage and Reference Predictions**

*   **No direct human predictions** found for this specific question of *polling bias* in the provided articles. The polls predict the outcome of the election, not the magnitude of polling errors.
*   **Betting markets:** These focus on win probabilities and don't explicitly estimate polling bias. Some sources show betting markets moving in Trump's favor, suggesting the possibility of polls underestimating his support.
*   **FiveThirtyEight:** While their models are mentioned, they don't directly estimate polling *bias*, they focus on the overall probability of each candidate winning.

**3. Breaking Down the Problem**

We need to consider:

*   **Historical Polling Bias:** How often have polls been biased towards or against a candidate? What is the range of these biases?
*   **Recent Polling Trends:** What do the polls say about the Trump-Harris race in the lead-up to October 17th, and after?
*   **Potential Causes of Bias:** What might make polls under- or over-estimate Trump's support this time? What adjustments have pollsters made in response to the 2016 and 2020 errors?
*   **Specific Issues with Trump:** Has Trump historically been underpolled? If so, why, and are those reasons still likely to apply?

**4. Inside View vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:** Start with historical data on polling accuracy:
    *   The DailyKos article (2024-10-21) on 2022 Senate races indicates an *overestimation* of Republican support by an average of 3.4%, which is a key data point to acknowledge when considering polling bias. This is particularly relevant since our question focuses on bias with respect to Trump, a Republican. This article also suggests that most pollsters have made adjustments since 2020 to correct the Trump undercount, but that pollsters are not aware of post-'Dobbs' adjustments.
    *   The article from The Conversation (2024-10-07) states that the 2016 and 2020 elections underestimated the Trump vote in swing states. It further highlights that AAPOR identified bias in polls, such as the underrepresentation of Trump supporters. This points to the idea that polls have underestimated Trump's vote.

*   **Inside View:**
    *   The articles highlight some pollsters, like AtlasIntel, who were more accurate in 2020. The news from Zero Hedge (2024-10-22) noted that AtlasIntel had an average error of 2.01p.p. in 2020. If Trump is leading by 3 points in AtlasIntel polls as mentioned in the Zero Hedge article and by 2.7 points in another article from mishtalk.com (2024-10-20), these are strong signals that the polls are biased towards Harris in the most recent polls, and potentially also on the relevant date.
    *  The articles from Newsweek (2024-09-03) and NewsMax (2024-09-03) suggest that the media is under-sampling Republicans and Trump voters. These articles note that the ABC News poll had only 29% self-identified Republicans compared to 36% in the 2020 election.
     * Many of the articles note that Trump leads in the key swing states. The articles from newsmax.com (2024-10-20), ilsussidiario.net (2024-10-21), and En Son Haber (2024-10-16) all suggest this. Given that the electoral college is important, this means that polls may be underestimating Trump's likelihood of winning the election, which could imply they are underestimating his support on a national level.
    *   Several articles highlight that the race is tightening. The articles from El Nuevo Dia (2024-10-21), Yahoo (2024-10-22) and PJ Media (2024-10-20) all suggest this. If the race is tightening towards Trump, this suggests that the October 17th polls may be underestimating his support.
    *  The article from Redstate (2024-09-02) notes that, according to Nate Silver's model, Trump was the favorite for the election at the time the article was written. This would also indicate that polls may be underestimating his support.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces for underestimating Trump:** "Shy Trump voters" who don't respond to polls, under-sampling of Republicans (per some sources), strong feelings against Trump.
*  **Forces for overestimating Trump:** pollsters have attempted to correct for 2016/2020 errors, increased Democrat turnout following Dobbs. The DailyKos article notes that there are no post-Dobbs adjustments however, so this isn't as relevant.
*   **Forces for accurate polling:** Polling organizations have been making adjustments and there is more awareness of potential biases. As noted in the Vox article (2024-09-10), pollsters have been working to address the issues of bias from past elections, with adjustments to methods and tools. As noted in the Al Jazeera article (2024-10-17) pollsters also look at polls as an average, which can be useful for understanding trends.

**6. Linear Extrapolation of Current Trends**

There is a trend in the articles toward Trump gaining ground. However, we must keep in mind that the bias calculation is based on the *October 17th* RCP average. The recent surge toward Trump means that it's more likely that he is underestimated in the RCP average on that date, but we must also be aware of regression to the mean.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

The evidence is mixed. We have good evidence that Trump has been underpolled in the past, and there are credible accusations of under-sampling of Republican voters. However, pollsters are aware of these issues and have made some adjustments. The most recent poll data indicates that Trump has been rapidly gaining on Harris. It is also very clear that the polling data is subject to many biases. Given the high degree of uncertainty, we should avoid excessive confidence.

**8. Confidence and Prudence**

We need to balance the risk of being too confident in polls being accurate against the risk of over-reacting to potential bias. Given the recent trend towards Trump, it is more likely that he will be underpolled on the October 17th date than overpolled, and so we should lean slightly towards being more confident that a bias greater than 1.0 pp will occur. However, given the uncertainty of polling, we should still be cautious and avoid overconfidence.

**9. Learning From Mistakes**

It is vital to consider the 2016 and 2020 errors and that pollsters have attempted to rectify this. However, there are still some signals, mainly from articles on recent polling, that Trump's support is being underestimated.

**10. My Analysis and Forecast**

Given:
*   The historical precedent of polls underestimating Trump's support and overestimating the Democratic vote.
*   Evidence of Republican under-sampling in polls.
*   The most recent polls indicate that Trump is rapidly gaining ground (which suggests the possibility that the polls on October 17th underestimated his support), with some even indicating that he is currently ahead, combined with betting markets that are moving in Trump's favor.
*  The pollsters are aware of their biases and have attempted to rectify this, so the bias is not likely to be too large.
*   The explicit 3.4% overestimation of Republican support in the 2022 Senate races, which is a very strong signal.

I am increasing the likelihood of a greater-than 1.0 percentage point polling error *in favor of Trump*. A base rate of approximately 40-50% would apply to the occurrence of a similar bias based on historical data and the fact that polls are sometimes inaccurate. The data on the 2022 Senate races would strongly push our prediction to a smaller range. However, given the specific issues that have been associated with polling Trump's support in the past, the recent tightening of the race toward Trump, and the signals from AtlasIntel and other sources that Trump is being underestimated, I will give a slightly higher likelihood.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't see any direct predictions for RCP bias specifically. However, there are many polls and predictions on who will win the election, which are useful reference points.
*   **FiveThirtyEight:**  Has been mentioned throughout the articles and has had Trump's chances at 53% and also closer to a 50/50 split. They are also averaging polls so it is a good signal, but are not specifically commenting on bias.
*   **Polymarket:**  Betting odds are mentioned and seem to have a preference for Trump around 56%.
*   **Metaculus:**  Mentioned as one of the platforms used by 'El País', giving a "technical tie" between the candidates.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

To assess the probability of a bias greater than 1.0 pp, we need to consider:

*   **Historical Polling Bias:** How have national polls historically performed in presidential elections, particularly regarding Trump?
*   **Current Polling Landscape:** What is the current spread between Trump and Harris in national polls, and what's the trend leading up to the election?
*   **Pollster Methodology:** Have pollsters made changes to address past biases, especially regarding Trump voters? Are there concerns about current methodologies?
*   **"Hidden Vote" and "Shy Trump Voter" Effect:**  To what extent might Trump's support be underestimated by polls due to respondents being unwilling to truthfully express their views?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historically, polling errors have occurred. The 2016 and 2020 elections showed significant underestimations of Trump's support, particularly in certain states. Polls also tend to underrepresent Republicans and Trump voters, and oversample older, liberal voters. There are many claims of media bias in polling. The 2022 midterms showed some polling was inaccurate particularly in senate races, and often favoured republicans.
*   **Inside View (Current Situation):** The current polling situation is volatile, with many conflicting polls. While RCP average currently has Harris ahead, many polls have Trump leading. Recent polls appear to be tightening. Some polls, like AtlasIntel, claim to have accurate methodologies and are showing leads for Trump. Many people claim, including pollsters that there is a bias in polling against Trump supporters. There is a claim that polls may be manipulated. The RCP average for the period for the question is -1.583 pp. The main question is how the polls resolve with the final results.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** Dismissing the recurring pattern of Trump being underestimated by polls could lead to an inaccurate forecast. It's not a certainty, but the pattern exists.
*   **Overreacting:**  Assuming that the historical pattern will *definitely* repeat, ignoring the pollsters' attempt to correct past errors could also be wrong. Some polling companies have adapted their methods since 2020 to be more accurate, which might offset any previous patterns.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for Bias:**
    *   "Shy Trump voter" or 'hidden vote' effect.
    *   Potential under-sampling of Republicans in some polls.
    *   Pollsters' methodological challenges in reaching certain segments of the population.
    *   Possible intentional bias in some polls.
*   **Forces Reducing Bias:**
    *   Pollsters adapting and improving methodologies.
    *   Increased awareness of potential biases since the 2016 and 2020 elections.
    *   More polls using 'mixed mode' approaches.
    *   More scrutiny on polling methodologies.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*  The historical trend points to polls underestimating Trump support and this seems to continue. The polls in the run up to the date of interest seem to vary but some polls show Trump with a large lead. There are claims of manipulation and undersampling which might be biasing the results for Trump.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question is not a binary. There is a large range of possible outcomes. Polling is often close, with leads and deficits within the margin of error, but this questions is asking about bias.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:**  Assuming that we can't predict bias accurately due to the volatile nature of polling data would be overly cautious.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assuming that we know exactly how much the bias will be would be unrealistic. We have to acknowledge that it is unknown.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes:**

*   I have to acknowledge that there is a risk that my prediction of a bias is incorrect but will take all the information into account.

**Reasoning Process and Probability Judgment**
Given the evidence, I have to consider that the RCP average on the 17th of October was -1.583 pp. The question asks if the actual result will be more than 1 pp lower than that value.

The base rate is that bias in polls occurs, and that it tends to underestimate Trump, but pollsters have attempted to correct this. However, the recent news still suggest that some pollsters still show a Republican bias.

The RCP average is a relatively good measure, but is subject to potential bias in its component polls, which may not account for the 'hidden Trump vote' or biased samples.

Given that the question asks about bias greater than 1.0pp, I am thinking that a Trump undercount that pushes this outside the 1 pp margin is certainly very possible and I would put a probability higher than 50% on that.
However, the adjustments that pollsters have made may reduce that probability, and given that the polls seem to be tighter at the moment, with some polls showing Trump ahead, the degree of bias will not be as great as previous elections, despite the claims of undersampling in some polls. I will adjust the estimate downwards a bit.

**Final Prediction**
My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 72.00% being the most likely. Probability: 72.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't see any direct predictions for RCP bias specifically. However, there are many polls and predictions on who will win the election, which are useful reference points.
*   **FiveThirtyEight:**  Has been mentioned throughout the articles and has had Trump's chances at 53% and also closer to a 50/50 split. They are also averaging polls so it is a good signal, but are not specifically commenting on bias.
*   **Polymarket:**  Betting odds are mentioned and seem to have a preference for Trump around 56%.
*   **Metaculus:**  Mentioned as one of the platforms used by 'El País', giving a "technical tie" between the candidates.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

To assess the probability of a bias greater than 1.0 pp, we need to consider:

*   **Historical Polling Bias:** How have national polls historically performed in presidential elections, particularly regarding Trump?
*   **Current Polling Landscape:** What is the current spread between Trump and Harris in national polls, and what's the trend leading up to the election?
*   **Pollster Methodology:** Have pollsters made changes to address past biases, especially regarding Trump voters? Are there concerns about current methodologies?
*   **"Hidden Vote" and "Shy Trump Voter" Effect:**  To what extent might Trump's support be underestimated by polls due to respondents being unwilling to truthfully express their views?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historically, polling errors have occurred. The 2016 and 2020 elections showed significant underestimations of Trump's support, particularly in certain states. Polls also tend to underrepresent Republicans and Trump voters, and oversample older, liberal voters. There are many claims of media bias in polling. The 2022 midterms showed some polling was inaccurate particularly in senate races, and often favoured republicans.
*   **Inside View (Current Situation):** The current polling situation is volatile, with many conflicting polls. While RCP average currently has Harris ahead, many polls have Trump leading. Recent polls appear to be tightening. Some polls, like AtlasIntel, claim to have accurate methodologies and are showing leads for Trump. Many people claim, including pollsters that there is a bias in polling against Trump supporters. There is a claim that polls may be manipulated. The RCP average for the period for the question is -1.583 pp. The main question is how the polls resolve with the final results.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** Dismissing the recurring pattern of Trump being underestimated by polls could lead to an inaccurate forecast. It's not a certainty, but the pattern exists.
*   **Overreacting:**  Assuming that the historical pattern will *definitely* repeat, ignoring the pollsters' attempt to correct past errors could also be wrong. Some polling companies have adapted their methods since 2020 to be more accurate, which might offset any previous patterns.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for Bias:**
    *   "Shy Trump voter" or 'hidden vote' effect.
    *   Potential under-sampling of Republicans in some polls.
    *   Pollsters' methodological challenges in reaching certain segments of the population.
    *   Possible intentional bias in some polls.
*   **Forces Reducing Bias:**
    *   Pollsters adapting and improving methodologies.
    *   Increased awareness of potential biases since the 2016 and 2020 elections.
    *   More polls using 'mixed mode' approaches.
    *   More scrutiny on polling methodologies.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*  The historical trend points to polls underestimating Trump support and this seems to continue. The polls in the run up to the date of interest seem to vary but some polls show Trump with a large lead. There are claims of manipulation and undersampling which might be biasing the results for Trump.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question is not a binary. There is a large range of possible outcomes. Polling is often close, with leads and deficits within the margin of error, but this questions is asking about bias.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:**  Assuming that we can't predict bias accurately due to the volatile nature of polling data would be overly cautious.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assuming that we know exactly how much the bias will be would be unrealistic. We have to acknowledge that it is unknown.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes:**

*   I have to acknowledge that there is a risk that my prediction of a bias is incorrect but will take all the information into account.

**Reasoning Process and Probability Judgment**
Given the evidence, I have to consider that the RCP average on the 17th of October was -1.583 pp. The question asks if the actual result will be more than 1 pp lower than that value.

The base rate is that bias in polls occurs, and that it tends to underestimate Trump, but pollsters have attempted to correct this. However, the recent news still suggest that some pollsters still show a Republican bias.

The RCP average is a relatively good measure, but is subject to potential bias in its component polls, which may not account for the 'hidden Trump vote' or biased samples.

Given that the question asks about bias greater than 1.0pp, I am thinking that a Trump undercount that pushes this outside the 1 pp margin is certainly very possible and I would put a probability higher than 50% on that.

Okay, let's analyze this question carefully.

**Understanding the Question**

The core of the question is about the *polling bias* for Trump, specifically within the *national polls* averaged by RCP in the *month before the election*. The bias is defined as how much the RCP average *underestimates* Trump's actual popular vote share. This is calculated as:  `-1.583 - (Trump's popular vote percentage - Harris' popular vote percentage)`. The question resolves as **Yes** if this number is strictly greater than 1.0 pp.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**

*   **FiveThirtyEight:** While FiveThirtyEight provides forecasts, they don't directly provide a probability on *polling bias*. However, their model is useful for understanding the overall race dynamics. They had Harris slightly favored but also had Trump's chances trending upwards in recent weeks.
*   **Polymarket/Betting Markets:**  These markets give a sense of overall election probability, but again, not specifically on *polling bias*. They have also generally shown a recent shift towards Trump.
*   **Metaculus:**  No specific prediction is available on this question.

**2. Break Down the Problem**

We can break this into these sub-problems:

1.  **Base rate:** What's the historical base rate for polling bias in US presidential elections?
2.  **Polling Dynamics:** What are the factors that might lead to an over- or underestimation of Trump’s support in the 2024 election?
3.  **RCP Average:** How might the RCP average behave in the last month of the campaign? What is the bias inherent in their methodology?
4.  **Likely Result:** What would it take to make the bias greater than 1.0 percentage points?

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** 
    *   Polling has been shown to have biases in recent elections, particularly in 2016 and 2020. The articles suggest there was an underestimation of Trump's support.
    *   The 2022 midterm elections also suggest potential biases in polling, particularly in Senate races, with some bias towards Republicans (though this was for Senate races, not presidential).
    *   The provided articles mention an average error of 2.01p.p. in 2020 for AtlasIntel (who were the most accurate pollster)
    *   A study cited in the text found a 3.4% average lean towards Republicans in 2022 Senate polling
    *   Looking at the available data, it seems that in the last two cycles, there was a tendency for polling to underestimate Trump. Let us approximate 2020 and 2016 errors at 2 points in Trump's favour. The question asks for >1.0 bias, so in order to make the question a "yes", the 2024 bias would need to be even more extreme.
    *   Let's start by assuming a base rate of 30% for a bias of this magnitude.
*   **Inside View (Specific to this election):**
    *   Many articles note a potential undercounting of Trump support, or an oversampling of Democrats. There are some claims of manipulation of polls to portray a Republican surge. There is also a mention of  'hidden Trump voters' who don't admit to supporting Trump in polls.
    *   Some pollsters are noted to have made adjustments since 2020 to account for undercounting of Trump voters.
    *  There are also several polls showing Trump leading both nationally and in swing states. This seems to be a shift from earlier in the race.
    *   The recent polls show that the race is indeed very tight, with a lot of movement.
    *  However there are also polls that have Harris leading.
    *   Multiple articles indicate that polls are increasingly unreliable and subject to biases.
    *  There is mention of 'post-Dobbs' adjustments potentially favouring Democrats, but it is unclear if these have been taken into account by pollsters.
    *   Recent polls do show that while Harris had a lead earlier on in the election cycle, the lead has shrunk and in the lead up to the election, Trump has actually taken the lead in several polls.
    * The resolution criteria makes it clear that the question is on the national polling average, *not* the popular vote which might come in different from national polls due to the electoral college.
    *   There are numerous references to Trump doing better than predicted by polls in the swing states, so this appears to be a recurring theme and suggests some degree of systematic undercounting of Trump voters by pollsters.
    *   Given that several articles are saying that this race is very tight and that Trump seems to be gaining, that would suggest that the polling error in his favour might be less than previous elections.

**4. Balance Reactions**

*   The base rate suggests some possibility of a bias, especially given the recent history of polling errors.
*   There's evidence of pollsters working to fix their methodologies which would suggest less of a chance of bias.
*   There is a lot of noise, which shows polls can be volatile.
*   The trend seems to be moving towards a slight Trump advantage at the time of writing, in both national and swing state polls which would suggest less of a bias.
*   The key for resolution is the specific RCP average. As there is a lot of noise surrounding polling and whether there are biases, I believe that the most rational decision for a superforecaster to make is to focus on the available data and make a prediction based on that. Given the recent trends in polls and also the history of polls and their biases, I think there is a chance that Trump might underperform on election day, with there being a systematic bias in his favour from the polls.
*   The specific bias requested in the question is that the RCP polling bias be *greater than* 1 percentage point. This is a fairly narrow definition and given the historical trends and recent polling information, I don't think that Trump will experience such a significant bias.
*   I am going to decrease my initial probability estimate slightly, due to the evidence suggesting that pollsters have tried to account for past errors and that Trump is performing better in polls, but still believe that it is a reasonable possibility.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Force 1:** Pollsters trying to correct for past underestimations of Trump support vs. inherent methodological issues in polling.
*   **Force 2:**  Potential for "shy" or "hidden" Trump voters vs. increased Democratic mobilization.
*   **Force 3:**  Trump's campaign's momentum vs. the underlying issues that may be pushing the electorate towards the Democrats.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends**
While some sources indicate a slight tightening in the polls, it is difficult to extrapolate a single trend. The polls seem to be volatile, so the best course of action is to consider all sources of information.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

I will use a fairly granular probability scale in my estimate.

**8. Balance Confidence**
I am relatively confident in my assessment that there is some degree of polling bias in Trump's favour, but not a huge bias. I believe that pollsters have tried to account for past biases, but this doesn't mean they are not still present.

**9. Learn From Mistakes**

I will review the result after the election and determine whether my reasoning was correct, and any lessons can be learned to inform future forecasting.

**Putting it Together**

Given the analysis, I believe that the polling bias will likely be somewhat lower than in previous cycles but still is a reasonable possibility. I will assign a moderate probability to the question resolving as "yes".

My Prediction: Between 22.00% and 40.00%, but 31.00% being the most likely. Probability: 31.00%.

    *   Multiple articles indicate that polls are increasingly unreliable and subject to biases.
    *  There is mention of 'post-Dobbs' adjustments potentially favouring Democrats, but it is unclear if these have been taken into account by pollsters.
    *   Recent polls do show that while Harris had a lead earlier on in the election cycle, the lead has shrunk and in the lead up to the election, Trump has actually taken the lead in several polls.
    * The resolution criteria makes it clear that the question is on the national polling average, *not* the popular vote which might come in different from national polls due to the electoral college.
    *   There are numerous references to Trump doing better than predicted by polls in the swing states, so this appears to be a recurring theme and suggests some degree of systematic undercounting of Trump voters by pollsters.
    *   Given that several articles are saying that this race is very tight and that Trump seems to be gaining, that would suggest that the polling error in his favour might be less than previous elections.

**4. Balance Reactions**

*   The base rate suggests some possibility of a bias, especially given the recent history of polling errors.
*   There's evidence of pollsters working to fix their methodologies which would suggest less of a chance of bias.
*   There is a lot of noise, which shows polls can be volatile.
*   The trend seems to be moving towards a slight Trump advantage at the time of writing, in both national and swing state polls which would suggest less of a bias.
*   The key for resolution is the specific RCP average. As there is a lot of noise surrounding polling and whether there are biases, I believe that the most rational decision for a superforecaster to make is to focus on the available data and make a prediction based on that. Given the recent trends in polls and also the history of polls and their biases, I think there is a chance that Trump might underperform on election day, with there being a systematic bias in his favour from the polls.
*   The specific bias requested in the question is that the RCP polling bias be *greater than* 1 percentage point. This is a fairly narrow definition and given the historical trends and recent polling information, I don't think that Trump will experience such a significant bias.
*   I am going to decrease my initial probability estimate slightly, due to the evidence suggesting that pollsters have tried to account for past errors and that Trump is performing better in polls, but still believe that it is a reasonable possibility.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Force 1:** Pollsters trying to correct for past underestimations of Trump support vs. inherent methodological issues in polling.
*   **Force 2:**  Potential for "shy" or "hidden" Trump voters vs. increased Democratic mobilization.
*   **Force 3:**  Trump's campaign's momentum vs. the underlying issues that may be pushing the electorate towards the Democrats.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends**
While some sources indicate a slight tightening in the polls, it is difficult to extrapolate a single trend. The polls seem to be volatile, so the best course of action is to consider all sources of information.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

I will use a fairly granular probability scale in my estimate.

**8. Balance Confidence**
I am relatively confident in my assessment that there is some degree of polling bias in Trump's favour, but not a huge bias. I believe that pollsters have tried to account for past biases, but this doesn't mean they are not still present.

**9. Learn From Mistakes**

I will review the result after the election and determine whether my reasoning was correct, and any lessons can be learned to inform future forecasting.

**Putting it Together**

Given the analysis, I believe that the polling bias will likely be somewhat lower than in previous cycles but still is a reasonable possibility. I will assign a moderate probability to the question resolving as "yes".

My Prediction: Between 22.00% and 40.00%, but 31.00% being the most likely. Probability: 31.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question carefully.

**Understanding the Question**

The core of the question is about the *polling bias* for Trump, specifically within the *national polls* averaged by RCP in the *month before the election*. The bias is defined as how much the RCP average *underestimates* Trump's actual popular vote share. This is calculated as:  `-1.583 - (Trump's popular vote percentage - Harris' popular vote percentage)`. The question resolves as **Yes** if this number is strictly greater than 1.0 pp.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**

*   **FiveThirtyEight:** While FiveThirtyEight provides forecasts, they don't directly provide a probability on *polling bias*. However, their model is useful for understanding the overall race dynamics. They had Harris slightly favored but also had Trump's chances trending upwards in recent weeks.
*   **Polymarket/Betting Markets:**  These markets give a sense of overall election probability, but again, not specifically on *polling bias*. They have also generally shown a recent shift towards Trump.
*   **Metaculus:**  No specific prediction is available on this question.

**2. Break Down the Problem**

We can break this into these sub-problems:

1.  **Base rate:** What's the historical base rate for polling bias in US presidential elections?
2.  **Polling Dynamics:** What are the factors that might lead to an over- or underestimation of Trump’s support in the 2024 election?
3.  **RCP Average:** How might the RCP average behave in the last month of the campaign? What is the bias inherent in their methodology?
4.  **Likely Result:** What would it take to make the bias greater than 1.0 percentage points?

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** 
    *   Polling has been shown to have biases in recent elections, particularly in 2016 and 2020. The articles suggest there was an underestimation of Trump's support.
    *   The 2022 midterm elections also suggest potential biases in polling, particularly in Senate races, with some bias towards Republicans (though this was for Senate races, not presidential).
    *   The provided articles mention an average error of 2.01p.p. in 2020 for AtlasIntel (who were the most accurate pollster)
    *   A study cited in the text found a 3.4% average lean towards Republicans in 2022 Senate polling
    *   Looking at the available data, it seems that in the last two cycles, there was a tendency for polling to underestimate Trump. Let us approximate 2020 and 2016 errors at 2 points in Trump's favour. The question asks for >1.0 bias, so in order to make the question a "yes", the 2024 bias would need to be even more extreme.
    *   Let's start by assuming a base rate of 30% for a bias of this magnitude.
*   **Inside View (Specific to this election):**
    *   Many articles note a potential undercounting of Trump support, or an oversampling of Democrats. There are some claims of manipulation of polls to portray a Republican surge. There is also a mention of  'hidden Trump voters' who don't admit to supporting Trump in polls.
    *   Some pollsters are noted to have made adjustments since 2020 to account for undercounting of Trump voters.
    *  There are also several polls showing Trump leading both nationally and in swing states. This seems to be a shift from earlier in the race.
    *   The recent polls show that the race is indeed very tight, with a lot of movement.
    *  However there are also polls that have Harris leading.
    *   Multiple articles indicate that polls are increasingly unreliable and subject to biases.
    *  There is mention of 'post-Dobbs' adjustments potentially favouring Democrats, but it is unclear if these have been taken into account by pollsters.
    *   Recent polls do show that while Harris had a lead earlier on in the election cycle, the lead has shrunk and in the lead up to the election, Trump has actually taken the lead in several polls.
    * The resolution criteria makes it clear that the question is on the national polling average, *not* the popular vote which might come in different from national polls due to the electoral college.
    *   There are numerous references to Trump doing better than predicted by polls in the swing states, so this appears to be a recurring theme and suggests some degree of systematic undercounting of Trump voters by pollsters.

Okay, let's analyze this question carefully.

**Understanding the Question**

The core question is: Will the national polling bias for Trump, as measured by RCP's average in the month before the 2024 election, be greater than 1.0 percentage points? The resolution will be based on the RCP average on October 17th (-1.583pp for Trump). The bias will be calculated as: -1.583pp - (Trump's actual popular vote % - Harris's actual popular vote %). So, we need to assess how much the RCP average might understate Trump's support relative to the actual result. A positive bias would imply that Trump does better than the polls on average show. 

**Base Rate & Reference Class**

1.  **Historical Polling Bias:**  Past elections show a tendency for polls to be off, particularly with Trump. The 2016 and 2020 elections had significant polling errors. We see frequent mentions of Trump underperformance in polls. In 2020, many polls underestimated Trump's support, which makes this a relevant base rate to consider.
2. **RCP Accuracy:**  While RCP is an aggregator, it still relies on the underlying polls, which have varying degrees of accuracy. It's not a poll in and of itself. The accuracy of RCP averages depends heavily on the quality of the polls it includes and how these polls weight different demographics.

**Breaking Down the Problem**

1.  **Trump's "Hidden" Vote:** A recurring theme is that Trump voters are less likely to participate in polls or to be honest with pollsters. This could be due to a distrust in institutions or a social desirability bias in the other direction, where people do not want to appear to support Trump. 
2.  **Polling Methodology:**  Many articles point to issues with polling methodology, including sampling bias (under-sampling of Republicans, over-sampling of Democrats), response bias (certain groups being more willing to participate), and the difficulty of reaching "low-propensity voters." Pollsters are working on improvements, but these biases haven't disappeared. The 2022 midterm polls were inaccurate in many Senate races, often overstating Republican support, although there were some changes made after the 2020 election.
3. **"Dobbs" Adjustment**: The dailykos article notes that while most pollsters made changes after 2020 to address Trump undercount, they are unaware of post 'Dobbs' (abortion) adjustments which could affect the vote, particularly among women and younger voters. This introduces a potential source of error favouring Democrats.
4. **Recent Polling Trends:**  The polls in the last month show a tightening of the race, with Trump gaining ground. There's a lot of volatility and conflicting signals, which highlights the uncertainty. Several polls show Trump with a lead, even some from sources that are generally perceived as not being favorable to him, while others still have Harris ahead, often within the margin of error. The focus on swing states also shows how different the race is in national versus state polls.
5. **Betting Markets and Other Forecasters:** While FiveThirtyEight gives Trump a higher probability of winning the election, most of the polling averages still show Harris with a small lead. Betting companies lean towards Trump winning, which could indicate they expect the polls to continue to be wrong in Trump's favor.
6. **Late Shifts** There's evidence of a "dramatic momentum shift" towards Trump in late October. The polls on or around Oct 20th-22nd show leads for Trump in polls, and some indicate he may win the electoral college even if he loses the popular vote. This could suggest that polling bias may increase near the election date.

**Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces pushing towards a greater-than-1pp bias:** The historical tendency of polls to underestimate Trump's support, the persistent sampling and response biases, and the possible "hidden vote" effect. There may be greater enthusiasm for Trump's voters, meaning that their relative turnout may be higher. Trump's recent surge in the polls could be a sign of this bias becoming more pronounced closer to the election. Also, there has been "manipulation" of polls by right-wing actors.
*   **Forces pushing towards a less-than-1pp bias:** Pollsters are aware of past errors and have made adjustments. The "Dobbs" decision could boost Democratic turnout which could mean that polls are more accurate, or even slightly biased in favor of Democrats. The close race could mean that any bias will be smaller than it might be if there was a larger gap. Additionally, there is the potential overrepresentation of older white liberals.

**Balancing the Evidence**

The historical pattern of underestimating Trump's support is a strong factor. While pollsters have made adjustments, there is evidence of persistent bias in the sampling methods and the possibility of a 'hidden vote'. However, it is not clear that this will mean that the bias is greater than 1 percentage point. The recent tightening of the race and the possibility of an opposite bias related to Dobbs adds some uncertainty. The bias is unlikely to be zero due to the aforementioned issues. Considering these competing forces and the resolution criteria, I see a fairly high probability that the bias will be greater than 1.0 percentage point, and this seems especially possible in the final weeks of the election. I will move away from the base rate of 50% for this kind of event. 

**My Prediction**

Taking into account the issues above and the reference class, I believe the bias for Trump is somewhat likely to be greater than 1.0 pp.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 75.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

There may be greater enthusiasm for Trump's voters, meaning that their relative turnout may be higher. Trump's recent surge in the polls could be a sign of this bias becoming more pronounced closer to the election. Also, there has been "manipulation" of polls by right-wing actors.
*   **Forces pushing towards a less-than-1pp bias:** Pollsters are aware of past errors and have made adjustments. The "Dobbs" decision could boost Democratic turnout which could mean that polls are more accurate, or even slightly biased in favor of Democrats. The close race could mean that any bias will be smaller than it might be if there was a larger gap. Additionally, there is the potential overrepresentation of older white liberals.

**Balancing the Evidence**

The historical pattern of underestimating Trump's support is a strong factor. While pollsters have made adjustments, there is evidence of persistent bias in the sampling methods and the possibility of a 'hidden vote'. However, it is not clear that this will mean that the bias is greater than 1 percentage point. The recent tightening of the race and the possibility of an opposite bias related to Dobbs adds some uncertainty. The bias is unlikely to be zero due to the aforementioned issues. Considering these competing forces and the resolution criteria, I see a fairly high probability that the bias will be greater than 1.0 percentage point, and this seems especially possible in the final weeks of the election. I will move away from the base rate of 50% for this kind of event. 

**My Prediction**

Taking into account the issues above and the reference class, I believe the bias for Trump is somewhat likely to be greater than 1.0 pp.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 75.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question carefully.

**Understanding the Question**

The core question is: Will the national polling bias for Trump, as measured by RCP's average in the month before the 2024 election, be greater than 1.0 percentage points? The resolution will be based on the RCP average on October 17th (-1.583pp for Trump). The bias will be calculated as: -1.583pp - (Trump's actual popular vote % - Harris's actual popular vote %). So, we need to assess how much the RCP average might understate Trump's support relative to the actual result. A positive bias would imply that Trump does better than the polls on average show. 

**Base Rate & Reference Class**

1.  **Historical Polling Bias:**  Past elections show a tendency for polls to be off, particularly with Trump. The 2016 and 2020 elections had significant polling errors. We see frequent mentions of Trump underperformance in polls. In 2020, many polls underestimated Trump's support, which makes this a relevant base rate to consider.
2. **RCP Accuracy:**  While RCP is an aggregator, it still relies on the underlying polls, which have varying degrees of accuracy. It's not a poll in and of itself. The accuracy of RCP averages depends heavily on the quality of the polls it includes and how these polls weight different demographics.

**Breaking Down the Problem**

1.  **Trump's "Hidden" Vote:** A recurring theme is that Trump voters are less likely to participate in polls or to be honest with pollsters. This could be due to a distrust in institutions or a social desirability bias in the other direction, where people do not want to appear to support Trump. 
2.  **Polling Methodology:**  Many articles point to issues with polling methodology, including sampling bias (under-sampling of Republicans, over-sampling of Democrats), response bias (certain groups being more willing to participate), and the difficulty of reaching "low-propensity voters." Pollsters are working on improvements, but these biases haven't disappeared. The 2022 midterm polls were inaccurate in many Senate races, often overstating Republican support, although there were some changes made after the 2020 election.
3. **"Dobbs" Adjustment**: The dailykos article notes that while most pollsters made changes after 2020 to address Trump undercount, they are unaware of post 'Dobbs' (abortion) adjustments which could affect the vote, particularly among women and younger voters. This introduces a potential source of error favouring Democrats.
4. **Recent Polling Trends:**  The polls in the last month show a tightening of the race, with Trump gaining ground. There's a lot of volatility and conflicting signals, which highlights the uncertainty. Several polls show Trump with a lead, even some from sources that are generally perceived as not being favorable to him, while others still have Harris ahead, often within the margin of error. The focus on swing states also shows how different the race is in national versus state polls.
5. **Betting Markets and Other Forecasters:** While FiveThirtyEight gives Trump a higher probability of winning the election, most of the polling averages still show Harris with a small lead. Betting companies lean towards Trump winning, which could indicate they expect the polls to continue to be wrong in Trump's favor.
6. **Late Shifts** There's evidence of a "dramatic momentum shift" towards Trump in late October. The polls on or around Oct 20th-22nd show leads for Trump in polls, and some indicate he may win the electoral college even if he loses the popular vote. This could suggest that polling bias may increase near the election date.
