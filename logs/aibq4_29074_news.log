**Schwab Trading Activity Falls In September Despite Market Strength: Nvidia, Palantir Among Most Sought-After Stocks But These 5 Fell Out Of Favor**
Despite a strong market performance in September, with the S&P 500 ending the month up 2.02%, Charles Schwab's Trading Activity Index (STAX) fell from 53.15 in August to 47.10, indicating a 'moderate low' compared to historical averages. According to Joe Mazzola, Head Trading & Derivatives Strategist at Charles Schwab, investors were either proactive or reactive as they positioned themselves for a slew of economic data that dropped during the month. The firm's clients were largely optimistic about the economic activity, but pulled back a bit due to the extent of the rate cut in September. The most sought-after stocks among Charles Schwab's clients included Nvidia, Palantir, and Intel, while Tesla, Advanced Micro Devices, Alibaba, AT&T, and Nio were among the stocks that fell out of favor.

**Wall Street indexes end lower as chip, oil stocks drop**
Wall Street's major stock indexes closed lower on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq falling 1% due to declining chip stocks and energy sector losses. Despite some positive earnings, UnitedHealth shares plunged 8% after forecasting 2025 profit below Wall Street estimates. Nvidia shares fell 4.7% after a media report that the Biden administration is considering capping AI chip exports. Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said, 'There seems to be a lot more stress concentrated in chips. This is putting downward pressure on technology as a sector.' However, defensive sectors like real estate outperformed, with real estate adding 1.2% and consumer staples up 0.6%. Investors will watch for the next batch of earnings and key economic data, including monthly retail sales and industrial production figures.

**Volatility Grips Chinese Stocks as Traders Wait for MOF Briefing**
Chinese stocks ended higher on Friday after a volatile session, with investors awaiting the outcome of the government's planned briefing on fiscal policy on Saturday. The CSI 300 Index finished up 1.1% at the close, after gyrating between gains and losses earlier in the day. Traders are pinning hopes that the finance ministry briefing will bring more catalysts to sustain a rally that began late September after Beijing unveiled a barrage of monetary stimulus. Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co, said, 'Investors are still holding out hope for an announcement from the Ministry of Finance that approves additional government bond issuance on top of this year's budget to support fiscal spending.' The People's Bank of China has set up a swap facility to provide liquidity to institutional investors to buy stocks, a measure that was announced as part of the broad stimulus package last month. However, economists warn that the rebound may be another false dawn if pledges aren't backed up with real money.

**Retail investors were net sellers of stocks in September, says Schwab**
According to Charles Schwab's Schwab Trading Activity Index (STAX), retail investors were net sellers of stocks in September, with the index hitting 47.1, down from 53.2 in August. This represents a bearish view by Schwab's clients, who were de-risking and taking profit opportunities due to market-affecting economic data. As a result, clients sold stocks such as Tesla, Advanced Micro Devices, and Alibaba, but were net buyers of Nvidia, Palantir, Intel, Alphabet, and Microsoft. 'In September there was no shortage of market-affecting economic data, and Schwab's clients responded in kind by de-risking and taking profit opportunities,' said Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Schwab.

**Social Security COLA 2025: Retirees Face Lower Adjustments**
The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) has revised its forecast for the Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) for 2025 downward due to the slowing inflation. The expected increase is now 2.5%, which translates to a monthly average increase of only $48 for retirees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation reached a three-year low of 2.5% in August. The Social Security Administration will traditionally set the final numbers in mid-October. The method of determination is based on the analysis of inflation in the third quarter, using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Future low inflation rates could lead to lower COLA increases, which could be particularly challenging for older Americans who rely heavily on these benefits. Although inflation has eased, prices remain high and continue to burden many American households. Half of the retirees receiving Social Security benefits rely on these payments for at least 50% of their household income. However, relying solely on these benefits is insufficient, and additional retirement plans, such as those offered by The Charles Schwab Corporation and Fidelity Investments, can contribute to a more comfortable retirement. Schwab is still impressive with its solid financial measures and could be an interesting option for older investors seeking long-term, dividend-paying stocks. These stocks could prove to be a stabilizing factor in the portfolio, given the current economic conditions. For retirees who want to spend their days in a pleasant environment and affordable cities, the 15 best cities for retirement are presented. Columbus, Springfield, Clarksville, Lindale, Vestavia Hills, Peoria, Rochester, Maumelle, Norman, Abilene, Bexley, Mauldin, Youngstown, Brownsville, and Oxford offer a mix of low living costs, high quality of life, and appealing leisure activities. For example, Bexley in Ohio is charming, while Brownsville in Texas offers direct access to the Gulf of Mexico coast.

**Schwab Trading Activity gauge slips in August, stays at moderate levels (NYSE:SCHW)**
The Schwab Trading Activity Index, which measures retail investor stock positions and trading activity, decreased to 53.16 in August from 54.81 in July. Despite this dip, the gauge remains at moderate levels compared to historic averages. According to Joe Mazzola, head Trading & Derivatives Strategist at Charles Schwab, Schwab clients rotated out of equities and into fixed income securities as a means of de-risking, contributing to the lower score. However, Mazzola noted that while the August trading period started with a 'meltdown' or 'crash' on August 5, the markets recovered quickly, and many Schwab clients took advantage of the volatility to buy the dip.

**Schwab Trading Activity Index™: Score Remains at Moderate Levels Despite Dip in August By Investing.com**
The Schwab Trading Activity Index (STAX) decreased to 53.16 in August, down from 54.81 in July. Schwab clients were net sellers of equities overall and across the Communication Services, Health Care, and Information Technology sectors, but net bought Consumer Discretionary and Energy. Joe Mazzola, Head Trading & Derivatives Strategist at Charles Schwab, said, 'Schwab clients appeared to rotate out of equities and into fixed income securities as a means of de-risking, which pushed the overall STAX score lower this month.' Despite volatility in equity markets, major indices notched multi-day winning streaks, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average made a new high of 41,585.21 on the last day of the period. The STAX reading for the five-week period ending August 30, 2024, ranks moderate compared to historic averages.
