[Scene: A dimly lit analytics office, morning after the Broncos-Jets game. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "The Broncos' QB situation was fascinating. First-round pick Bo Nix, competing with Stidham and Zach Wilson..."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 35.20%. Despite being the 12th overall pick, starting a rookie QB in Week 4 was always going to be a tough call."

Nate: "Exactly. The historical data showed most teams prefer to ease rookies in slowly, especially with serviceable veterans like Stidham on the roster. The post-Russell Wilson era in Denver needed stability."

Tetlock: "The preseason performance metrics and practice reports we analyzed up to mid-August suggested they'd be cautious with Nix's development. Even with his impressive college career at Oregon, the NFL learning curve is steep."

Nate: "Once again, our models captured the uncertainty perfectly. The NFL remains predictably unpredictable."

Nate: "Well, that was interesting. Our models had it at 35.20% that Bo Nix would start Week 4."

Philip: [nodding] "The data made sense. First-round rookie QB, but starting Week 4 was always going to be tricky. The Broncos invested heavily in Nix at #12, but they also had Stidham and Zach Wilson as veteran options."

Nate: "The preseason camp battle was crucial. Our models factored in Sean Payton's history with rookie QBs - he typically prefers experienced players early in the season."

Philip: "Right. And while Nix was impressive at Oregon, the jump to NFL starter, especially by Week 4, was a significant hurdle. The models weighed the Broncos' early schedule and Payton's tendency to ease rookies in gradually."

Nate: "The probability reflected that balance - possible, but not likely for Week 4."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, that Week 4 Broncos-Jets game was interesting. Our prediction about Bo Nix starting..."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 35.20%. As rookies go, being drafted 12th overall usually suggests a path to starting, but not this early."

Nate: "Exactly. Having both Stidham and Zach Wilson on the roster gave the Broncos experienced options. Historical data shows only about a third of first-round rookie QBs start by Week 4, especially when there are viable veterans on the roster."

Tetlock: "The model weighted Nix's draft position and Sean Payton's historical preference for experienced quarterbacks. Plus, throwing a rookie against that Jets defense..."

Nate: "The numbers don't lie. 35.20% was spot on, considering the variables we had in August."
