JD Vance, a 40-year-old senator from Ohio, has been chosen by Donald Trump as his running mate for the vice presidency.

'Vance's conservative background and Midwestern roots make him an attractive choice for Trump,' said a Republican strategist. 'He has a strong track record of winning elections in Ohio, and his youth will help to appeal to a younger demographic.'

**Is Donald Trump replacing JD Vance as his running mate in the US Elections 2024?**
Speculation is mounting over whether Donald Trump will replace JD Vance as his running mate in the 2024 US presidential election. Vance has faced a series of controversies, including making unfounded claims about Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, making jokes about 'couch sex,' and being accused of 'stolen valor.' Photos allegedly showing Vance in drag during his time at Yale have also added to the scrutiny. Despite efforts to shift focus to core issues, Vance's public missteps have continued to draw attention. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been mentioned as a potential replacement, but he has since indicated that he has been promised a role within the Trump administration. Other names that have been floated include Florida Senator Marco Rubio and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. The ballot access deadline for Ohio is September 1, which means Trump would have to decide before Labor Day if he intends to replace Vance.

**JD Vance's latest attempt to make light of his ‘childless cat ladies' comment instantly backfires**
JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, has attempted to make light of his 'childless cat ladies' comment by sharing a photo of a cat wearing a 'Cats for Vance 2024' bandana. However, the post quickly backfired and was widely mocked on X, with many users criticizing Vance's attempt at humor. One user commented, 'Yes, your cat knows that you're weird,' while another said, 'That cat looks scared.' Vance has faced huge backlash over his comments about people without children, which he has previously tried to claim were made sarcastically and have been taken out of context. The Independent analyzed the number of childless cat ladies voting in swing states and found Pittsburgh to be the top city for most single women who own cats, which may be a concern for Vance in the November election.

**Watch: Donald Trump calls JD Vance to ask 'how brilliant is Donald J Trump' - Times of India**
Donald Trump called his running mate JD Vance while Vance was attending a Town Hall and asked, 'How brilliant is Donald J Trump?' Vance jokingly responded that the event was meant for undecided voters only. Vance then shared a memorable interaction between Trump and his wife at a recent event in Cincinnati, where Trump's relatable humor broke the ice. New polling data indicates a tightly contested race between Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris, with Trump holding a narrow lead of 47% to 45%. Vance's support is also on the rise, climbing from 40% to 45% since August. The dynamic between these figures is likely to shape voter sentiment leading up to Election Day on November 5.

**Vance takes on clean-up duty for Trump: From the Politics Desk**
JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, has taken on the role of explainer-in-chief, often defending or decoding Trump's controversial remarks. Vance has explained Trump's comments on Vice President Kamala Harris, including Trump's questioning of her Blackness and his disparagement of Detroit. Trump allies expect him to declare victory on election night, even if the outcome is not yet settled in key swing states. Kamala Harris's campaign is preparing for this scenario, and the vice president herself has said that she is making preparations. The 2024 campaign has been relatively conventional, with both campaigns messaging to the same group of persuadable voters: Republican or Republican-leaning independents who don't like Trump personally but are skeptical of Harris's liberal politics. Harris plans to deliver a speech in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday as part of her closing argument.

**JD Vance campaigns in Arizona 2 weeks before election: What to know**
JD Vance will campaign in Arizona on Tuesday, visiting Peoria and Tucson, in a bid to win over voters just two weeks before Election Day. Vance's trip marks his fourth visit to Arizona since he was named Donald Trump's running mate in July. Trump has a slight lead over Kamala Harris in Arizona presidential polls, but the race is still tight. Vance will hold rallies at TYR Tactical in Peoria and the Pima County Fairgrounds in Tucson, while Democrats will counter with a press conference by Sen. Mark Kelly, who will 'slam Donald Trump and JD Vance's Project 2025 agenda' that will 'take this country backwards,' according to the Harris campaign.

**JD Vance's Refusal to Acknowledge Trump's 2020 Loss Raises Concerns**
JD Vance, the running mate of Donald Trump, has refused to acknowledge Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election, instead perpetuating the 'big lie' that the election was stolen. Vance has been criticized for his stance, which is in line with Trump's own refusal to accept defeat. Trump has never admitted to losing the 2020 election, claiming it was rigged. Despite numerous lawsuits, none have been successful in proving voter fraud. According to a recent survey, 32% of Americans believe Trump was defrauded, with 63% of Republican voters holding the same view. Mike Pence, Trump's former vice president, took a different approach, acknowledging Biden's victory and certifying him as president. Pence has since stated that he will not support Trump in the 2024 election. Vance has also added to the 'big lie' by claiming that the transfer of power was ultimately peaceful, despite the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, in which six people died and over 800 were arrested and charged. Neal Katyal, a former solicitor general, has expressed concern that Vance's stance may be a harbinger of further unrest after the 2024 election.

**Vance says ‘no’ when asked if Trump lost in 2020**
Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, was asked about Trump's loss in the 2020 election during a rally in Pennsylvania. Vance responded, 'No, I think there were serious problems in 2020,' but refused to directly say Trump lost. This is a departure from his previous evasions on the subject, where he would say he was 'focused on the future.' Vance's refusal to acknowledge Trump's loss has been criticized by Democrats, including Tim Walz, who called it a 'damning non-answer.' Trump continues to deny his loss in the 2020 election, warning his supporters that his opponents may 'cheat' in the 2024 election.

**Vance's Refusal to Acknowledge Trump's Loss Raises Concerns of 'Big Lie' Repeat**
JD Vance, the running mate of Donald Trump, has refused to acknowledge Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election, instead perpetuating the 'big lie' that the election was stolen. Vance has been criticized for his stance, with some accusing him of being a 'barometer of the Republican Party'. Trump has never acknowledged his defeat in 2020, claiming that the election was rigged. Despite 60 failed lawsuits, 32% of Americans believe that Trump was defrauded, with 63% of Republican voters sharing this view. Vance's refusal to acknowledge Trump's loss has raised concerns that he may repeat the 'big lie' after the 2024 election, potentially leading to further violence and unrest. However, with Biden as president, the government may be better equipped to handle any potential issues. Additionally, Pence, Trump's former vice president, has acknowledged Trump's loss and has stated that he will not support Trump in the 2024 election.

**JD Vance: the VP candidate raised in a Rust Belt home by a drug-addict mother**
JD Vance, a 40-year-old US Senator from Ohio, has been selected as Donald Trump's running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Vance, who was born into a humble environment in the steel town of Middletown, Ohio, and raised by a drug-addicted mother, has undergone a significant transformation from being a 'never Trump guy' to a fierce supporter of the former president. Vance's ability to connect with working-class voters and his Ivy League pedigree have made him a valuable asset to the Trump campaign. He has challenged the legitimacy of the prosecutions against Trump and questioned the results of the 2020 election. Vance's sincerity and commitment to the America-first platform are seen as key factors in his selection as Trump's running mate. 'He actually believes' the policies he is promoting, according to Trump insiders. Vance's selection has been met with both praise and criticism, with some seeing opportunism in his about-face and others believing that he can bridge the divide between Trump's base and more moderate voters. 'The person best suited to assume the position of vice president of the United States is Senator JD Vance', Trump announced at the GOP convention in Milwaukee in July. Vance's close friendship with Trump's eldest son, Donald Jnr, was instrumental to the decision. 'Not many people would make the decision to reject the charmed life that came with being the toast of the elites the way JD did,' his close friend told ABC News. Vance's political intelligence has given him a unique ability to connect with both working-class voters and highly educated suburban voters. 'I've been very open about the fact that I did say those critical things, and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy,' Vance told Fox in 2021. 'I've always been open and sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump,' he said during the debate against Tim Walz on Oct 1. Vance's ability to connect with Rust Belt voters, in the all-important swing state of Pennsylvania in particular, will be a major asset on their path to the White House. 'He actually believes' the policies he is promoting, one source said. During his brief tenure in the US Senate, Mr Vance has challenged the legitimacy of the prosecutions against Trump and questioned the results of the 2020 election. He has also been a vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine and moderated his position on abortion to align with Trump's more ambiguous rhetoric on the issue. 'He has three beautiful little kids at home, seven, four and two, and I love them very much,' he said during the vice presidential debate. 'I have a pro-family platform at the 2024 election,' he added. Vance's selection as Trump's running mate has been seen as a strategic move to appeal to voters of all backgrounds across the country. 'The record of success', Trump's senior advisers said, 'coupled with JD Vance's inspirational biography, military service, and dedication to America's working families, will appeal to voters of all backgrounds', across the country. Together, the advisers said, the pair 'are the most unifying and competitive ticket in political history'.

The 2024 US Presidential Election is set for November 5, with Vice-President Kamala Harris representing the Democrats and former President Donald Trump representing the Republicans.

**JD Vance Predicted to Become US President, According to Expert**
Rafael Ordukhanyan, an expert on American affairs, believes that voters are 'tired of the gerontological nonsense' and will choose 40-year-old entrepreneur JD Vance as the next US president. According to Ordukhanyan, 'Notice the new status of Vance. His recent actions and statements have been very popular. Vance is now forming as a national leader. He is, to some extent, opposing Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, and Joe Biden. This is the future of America. Currently, Vance's role in the tandem with Trump is increasing. Who knows, maybe closer to the elections, Vance will become the locomotive of this duo. I think that in a very large degree, the factor of Vance will determine the choice of Americans in the November elections in favor of Trump. Most Americans are already tired of this gerontological nonsense. Vance may be the future president of the United States. If not now, then in 2028, I am almost sure that we already have a Republican candidate. He is working very productively and seriously. Vance is now gaining, earlier Trump helped him, and now Vance is giving additional points to Trump with his words and actions.' JD Vance is an American entrepreneur and politician who has been a US Senator from Ohio since 2023. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, announced on July 15, 2024, that he had chosen Vance as his running mate for the 2024 US presidential election.

In the final month of the 2024 election season, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are neck-and-neck in several battleground states. Harris' campaign has deployed experienced operatives to swing states, while Team Trump is taking a more aggressive approach with frequent campaign appearances and rallies. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has also been holding numerous events. Trump said, 'I got to a lot of places, we're definitely outworking the opposition. She'll go to one place in three days. I say, 'Why can't I do that?''. Harris acknowledged that Pennsylvania could be a 'problem spot' and said, 'This is a margin-of-error race. We are the underdog. And I am running like the underdog because I am the underdog in this race.' The race remains tight with only weeks between now and November.

**US President Joe Biden warns Donald Trump may not peacefully concede election – RNZ**
US President Joe Biden expressed confidence in the fairness of the upcoming presidential election, but warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump may not accept the outcome. Biden stated, 'I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful.' He noted that Trump's running mate, US Senator JD Vance, refused to confirm during the vice presidential debate that he would accept the election outcome. Trump responded, saying, 'I only can hope that it's going to be free and fair.' This warning comes as prosecutors detail Trump's actions outside the scope of his duties as president in an effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat. The presidential election is scheduled for 5 November.

**Trump's VP job is still available? Harris campaign puts out cheeky post targeting JD Vance**
The Harris campaign has put out a cheeky post targeting JD Vance, suggesting that the VP position is still available. The post, which asks people to 'ask employers why the position is open', is seen as a dig at Mike Pence, JD Vance, and RFK Jr. The Republican camp has criticized the campaign for this move. Meanwhile, JD Vance has been performing well as a Senator and as a speaker, making him a solid running mate for Donald Trump. However, there are still rumors that Vance may not end up as Trump's running mate, and that the Republicans may change their plans to grab headlines before the US polls. Kamala Harris has already chosen Tim Walz as her running mate for the upcoming US elections in November.

Biden also referenced a new filing in the federal election interference case against Trump, which alleges that he worked to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump has downplayed his role in the Jan. 6 riot and the violence that took place that day, even praising those who were criminally charged for their conduct.

**Debate performance gives Vance 2028 White House boost**
Sen. JD Vance's (R-Ohio) debate performance against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) has given him a boost in his bid to become a leading 2028 presidential contender. According to a Senate GOP aide, Vance's performance 'reset a lot of that for him, and now people have a very good feeling about him and it buys him a tremendous amount of goodwill.' Vance, who has had a largely uneven stretch as Trump's running mate, impressed Republicans with his articulate and well-prepared performance, which could prove crucial in winning over key constituencies, including Republican donors. Trump has praised Vance's performance, saying it 'just reconfirmed my choice' of him as his running mate. Vance's focus remains on the final five weeks of campaigning for the top of the ticket, with his spokesperson stating that 'there is absolutely nothing that will distract us from that goal.'

**JD Vance hits the campaign trail in Michigan after VP debate**
JD Vance, the running mate of former President Donald Trump, made his first campaign stop in Michigan's Oakland County after the vice presidential debate. Vance is expected to speak at a facility of the business Visioneering, a tooling supplier for the automotive industry. Oakland County has swung heavily in Democrats' favor in recent years, with Democrat Joe Biden winning the county by 14 percentage points in 2020. Vance Patrick, chairman of the Oakland County Republican Party, said his goal is to do better in Oakland this November than four years ago. Vance's visit came a day after he debated Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, with some praising his performance and others criticizing him for not directly answering a question about whether Trump had lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden. Vance said he's 'focused on the future,' which was labeled a 'damning non-answer' by Walz. The Harris campaign has turned the exchange into a digital advertisement.

**JD Vance and Tim Walz remain civil in policy-driven debate but Trump is inescapable**
In the final vice presidential debate before Election Day, JD Vance and Tim Walz discussed various policy issues, including immigration, climate crisis, and abortion rights. Vance, the running mate of Donald Trump, sought to distance himself from Trump's chaotic statements, but made false and misleading claims about Trump's agenda. Walz criticized Vance for not clearly denouncing Trump's false claims and for not providing a clear stance on accepting the 2024 election results. Vance avoided answering a question about whether he would challenge the 2020 election results, leading Walz to say, 'That is a damning non-answer.' The debate highlighted the starkly different visions for America's future presented by the two candidates, with Vance praising Trump's 'peaceful transfer of power' despite the violent attack on the Capitol days earlier.

**Trump aides believe a polished JD Vance made campaign more palatable**
Donald Trump's senior aides saw JD Vance's debate performance as polished and more palatable, making his campaign appear more appealing despite Trump's increasingly caustic threats. They believed Vance reset the narrative on his image and came across favorably to undecided voters. A CBS News poll showed 42% of respondents thought Vance won the debate, while 41% gave the win to Tim Walz. Trump's aides were relieved that Vance delivered attack lines without interruption and got away with whitewashing Trump's record on the Affordable Care Act and the January 6 Capitol attack. However, Vance was called out on uncomfortable topics such as abortion and gun violence, and Trump's aides noted that Walz had his own flubs that could be used to distract from Vance's shaky answers. Trump's co-campaign chiefs, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement, 'Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th.'

**Who is J.D. Vance, Donald Trump's Running Mate?**
J.D. Vance, a 39-year-old senator from Ohio, has been chosen by Donald Trump as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Vance, a veteran and author of the best-selling memoir 'Hillbilly Elegy', has a history of opposing Trump, but has since adopted a populist agenda and gained the favor of the Trump family. Vance has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the Senate, often voting in loyalty to the former president's interests. He has also been linked to Silicon Valley, a traditionally liberal hub, and has helped organize a fundraising event for Trump in San Francisco. Vance's past tweets, which he has since deleted, show him criticizing Trump and his policies, including one that speculated he could serve in Hillary Clinton's administration. Vance has since eliminated his anti-Trump tweets and has adopted a more pro-Trump stance, which has earned him the support of Trump and his allies.

**Election Live Updates: Trump and Harris Hit Battlegrounds, as Running Mates Prep for Debate**
Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have developed a unique partnership in the 2024 presidential election. Trump has been supportive of Vance's missteps, including his incorrect assertion that Trump would veto a national abortion ban. Vance has spoken of Trump as a kind of father figure, and the two men have a strong relationship built on mutual affection for economic populism and anti-immigration policy. Trump has given Vance latitude to freelance and make decisions without checking in with him, but this has led to some potentially uncomfortable moments, such as the Vance-led offensive against Haitian migrants. Despite this, Trump has been supportive of Vance and has even joined in on the attacks. 'They're eating the dogs, the people that came in — they're eating the cats, they're eating the pets of the people that live there,' Trump said during a debate with Kamala Harris. Vance has described Trump as a 'kind of father figure' who can call him multiple times a day and at any hour. 'I call him back, he answers the phone and says, 'JD, you missed a very important phone call — and now I might have to pick somebody else,' Mr. Vance recalled. 'So I almost have a heart attack right there.'

**Trump's VP pick JD Vance turned away at Pennsylvania's Primanti Brothers during campaign stop**
JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, was initially turned away from Primanti Brothers, a popular sandwich shop in Pennsylvania, during a campaign stop on Saturday. The restaurant's manager stopped Vance and his team at the door due to a lack of advance notice. Vance addressed his disappointed supporters in a video, saying, '[The manager] just freaked out a little bit because there were a lot of people and she didn't want to make her restaurant part of a campaign stop.' However, the restaurant later allowed Vance and his supporters to meet inside. Vance encouraged people to continue supporting the business, saying, 'It's alright, don't hold it against her, she just got a little nervous. But it's a great local business, keep on supporting it, and most importantly, on November 5th go vote. Let's go win this thing.'

**Trump Reportedly Didn't Let JD Vance Off The Hook Easy For His Past Comments When They First Met**
Before becoming Donald Trump's running mate in the 2024 presidential election, JD Vance was a vocal critic of Trump, even comparing him to Adolf Hitler. According to Time, when they first met, Trump reportedly addressed Vance's past comments head-on, saying, 'You said some nasty s*** about me.' Vance explained that he had changed his views, realizing that Trump's politics aligned with his own. Despite initially referring to himself as a 'Never Trump guy,' Vance eventually transformed into a strong supporter of Trump. Their meeting reportedly ended well, with Vance vowing to win Trump over and they left on good terms. This complicated relationship will be interesting to see how it plays out.

**Trump's Running Mate: 'Winning Will Be Very Difficult' Without North Carolina**
JD Vance, the Republican Party's vice-presidential candidate, said that it will be very difficult for him and Donald Trump to win the November elections if they do not secure a victory in the state of North Carolina, according to Fox News. 'It will be very hard for us to win if we don't take North Carolina,' Vance said during an interview with journalists. Vance, however, assessed Trump's chances of winning in North Carolina as 'very good.' He stated that he and Trump could only lose in the state in case of low voter turnout. Fox News noted that Trump won the state in the 2020 elections, while the last time a Democratic candidate won in North Carolina was in 2008, when Barack Obama defeated John McCain by a margin of just 20,000 votes. The US presidential elections are scheduled to take place on November 5. The Democratic Party will be represented by Vice President Kamala Harris, while the Republican Party will be represented by former President Donald Trump.

**Trump's Running Mate JD Vance Raising Millions from Wall Street**
JD Vance, Donald Trump's vice presidential candidate, has built a network of wealthy supporters on Wall Street over the past decade. Now, Vance is mobilizing his supporters to help him raise money for the Trump-Vance presidential campaign. On Thursday, Vance will be the keynote speaker at two fundraising events in New York, organized by some of his wealthy supporters. According to CNBC, each event is expected to raise more than $1 million for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The first event is a breakfast, where attendees must pay at least $10,000 to participate. The event is organized by investor Scott Bessent, Jonathan Burkan from Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald's CEO Howard Lutnick, and Norm Champ, former SEC deputy director. Couples who want to attend must pay $50,000, according to CNBC. Later in the day, investor Keith Rabois, Palantir advisor Jacob Helberg, and Burkan will host a Trump campaign luncheon, with ticket prices ranging from $25,000 per person to $250,000 per couple. Norm Champ said, 'JD Vance has shown a strong commitment to working on policies that strengthen American workers and businesses. His focus on economic revitalization and creating growth opportunities aligns with values many, including myself, support.' Sander Gerber, CEO of Hudson Bay Capital, is another supporter of Vance. The two met for the first time in New York during the 2022 midterm elections, and Gerber recently stated that he is open to organizing a fundraising event with Vance as the keynote speaker later in the fall. 'I'm a big fan of JD, and I'll do everything I can to help him,' Gerber said. Vance previously organized a fundraising event in Hamptons on August 25, where he said the Trump campaign would need 'hundreds of millions of dollars' to compete with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

**Donald Trump and JD Vance are missing from the Oregon voters' pamphlet. Here's why**
Former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance will not appear in the Oregon voters' pamphlet for the 2024 November general election. According to the Oregon Secretary of State's office, the Trump/Vance campaign did not submit an optional statement or pay the required $3,500 to appear in the pamphlet. Laura Kerns, communications director for the Oregon Secretary of State's office, stated that they reached out to the Trump campaign multiple times, but never received a response. Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade said, 'The Voters' Pamphlet is a public service to voters and a proud tradition in Oregon... Not every candidate chooses to submit a statement, and that's fine. It has no impact on the choices voters have in November.' Candidates who will appear in the pamphlet include vice president, and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

**Live Updates: JD Vance Talks Migrant Crime in AZ as Tim Walz Stumps in PA**
Candidates for the 2024 presidential election are busy campaigning on Thursday, September 5. Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, will deliver remarks in Los Angeles, while Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, will discuss 'migrant crime and the flow of deadly drugs' in Phoenix, Arizona. Gov. Tim Walz, Harris's running mate, will speak in Erie, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Team Trump will hold an Agenda 47 Policy Tour in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Top political commentator John King outlined how Kamala Harris could win the 2024 election without winning Pennsylvania, a key swing state. Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck in several key swing states, including Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. A student gun control campaigner in Georgia said safety was on the ballot this November after a high school shooting in the state. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump reacted to the shooting, with Harris saying 'Today, Doug and I are mourning the deaths of those whose lives were cut short by gun violence at Apalachee High School in Georgia.'

**JD Vance Has Yet Another Connection to Project 2025**
JD Vance, Trump's running mate, has been linked to Project 2025, a right-wing playbook for a second Trump term, through his introduction to a 2017 report published by the Heritage Foundation. The report promoted banning abortion nationwide and criticized IVF. Vance acknowledged criticism of Trump's 'dystopian' inauguration speech and wrote that people living in poverty should not be blamed for their circumstances. However, other essays in the report are more dogmatic, stating that abortion should become 'unthinkable' in the US and that IVF is not a 'magic pill' for women. Vance's team has tried to downplay his role in the report, but his involvement provides evidence of Trump's ties to the people behind Project 2025. 'As it turns out, Donald Trump's running mate cosigned Project 2025's radical agenda to undermine IVF, ban abortion nationwide, and control women's most personal health care decisions long before it even had a name,' said Sarafina Chitika, spokesperson for the Harris-Walz 2024 campaign.

**Is Donald Trump replacing JD Vance as his running mate in the US Elections 2024?**
Speculation is mounting over whether Donald Trump will replace JD Vance as his running mate in the 2024 US presidential election. Vance has faced a series of controversies, including making unfounded claims about Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, making jokes about 'couch sex,' and being accused of 'stolen valor.' Photos allegedly showing Vance in drag during his time at Yale have also added to the scrutiny. Despite efforts to shift focus to core issues, Vance's public missteps have continued to draw attention. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been mentioned as a potential replacement, but he has since indicated that he has been promised a role within the Trump administration. Other names that have been floated include Florida Senator Marco Rubio and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. The ballot access deadline for Ohio is September 1, which means Trump would have to decide before Labor Day if he intends to replace Vance.

**JD Vance's latest attempt to make light of his ‘childless cat ladies' comment instantly backfires**
JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, has attempted to make light of his 'childless cat ladies' comment by sharing a photo of a cat wearing a 'Cats for Vance 2024' bandana. However, the post quickly backfired and was widely mocked on X, with many users criticizing Vance's attempt at humor. One user commented, 'Yes, your cat knows that you're weird,' while another said, 'That cat looks scared.' Vance has faced huge backlash over his comments about people without children, which he has previously tried to claim were made sarcastically and have been taken out of context. The Independent analyzed the number of childless cat ladies voting in swing states and found Pittsburgh to be the top city for most single women who own cats, which may be a concern for Vance in the November election.

**The Trump Campaign's Rhetoric About Women Sounds a Lot Like Andrew Tate's**
When JD Vance was announced as Donald Trump's running mate, it seemed like a strategic move to appeal to rich supporters, present a younger image, and connect with working-class voters. However, Vance's past comments have undermined this effort. In a 2021 Fox News interview, he claimed that the country is being run by 'childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.' Vance has also suggested that people in violent marriages shouldn't get divorced and criticized abortion exceptions for rape and incest, calling unborn fetuses in these situations 'inconvenient.' These comments have sparked concerns about Vance's views on women and relationships.
