**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question was whether Donald Trump would debate the Democratic nominee more than once before October 1, 2024. Given the dynamics after Biden's withdrawal, it was a complex scenario.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models factored in the uncertainty post-Biden. With Kamala Harris stepping in, the probability of a second debate was low. The models had it at 35.67%.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, and with Trump's insistence on debating only on FoxNews, the logistics became even more challenging.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Ultimately, it didn't happen. The models were spot-on, as usual. A single debate was all we got.

**NATE SILVER**  
Fascinating how predictive modeling can capture such intricate political maneuvers.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, it seems the debates didn't pan out as some expected.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 23.47% for more than one debate occurring. Given Biden's withdrawal and the upheaval that followed, the odds were always slim.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. With Biden dropping out and the debate logistics in turmoil, the path to multiple debates was fraught from the start.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And Trump's insistence on changing networks only added to the uncertainty. Our models accounted for such volatility.

**NATE SILVER:** So, a "no" it is. Just one debate, as predicted.

*They both nod, the air heavy with the weight of foresight.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Sometimes, the numbers tell the story before it unfolds.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question was whether Donald Trump would debate the Democratic nominee more than once before October 1, 2024.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. With Biden dropping out and Trump's demands for a Fox News debate, it was always a long shot.

NATE SILVER  
Yes, the chaos following Biden's withdrawal made it unlikely. The first debate on June 27 didn't count, and no second debate occurred with a new nominee.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The dynamics shifted too much for a second debate to materialize. Our models were spot on once again.

NATE SILVER  
So, the final answer is no. The probability was always below 50%.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis.
