**Vingegaard and Van Aert to Compete in 2024 Tour de France**
Jonas Vingegaard, the two-time winner of the Tour de France, will participate in the 2024 Tour de France, which starts on June 29th in Florence. This was announced by his team, Visma-Lease a Bike. Vingegaard has made a remarkable recovery after a serious crash at the Tour of the Basque Country in early April, which had put his participation in the Tour and the rest of the season in doubt. He will be joined by Belgian Wout Van Aert, who has also been sidelined due to a spring injury. The duo will be supported by riders such as Kuss and Jorgenson. The announcement was met with a special 'like' from Vingegaard's rival, Tadej Pogacar, who showed respect and fair play. The two will now face off in a new challenge in yellow.

**Can Jonas Vingegaard Win the Tour de France 2024?**
Jonas Vingegaard, the defending champion of the Tour de France, is facing a significant challenge as he recovers from a severe crash that occurred during the Baskerlandet race last month. The crash resulted in a broken collarbone, several broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a lung contusion. Despite this, Vingegaard has recently returned to training, giving fans hope that he may still be able to participate in the Tour de France. However, his team manager, Richard Plugge, has stated that Vingegaard will only participate if he is back to 100% form. The big question is whether Vingegaard can recover in time for the Tour de France, which starts on June 29th in Florence, Italy. His biggest rival, Tadej Pogačar, is currently leading the Giro d'Italia and may win both the Giro and the Tour, a feat not achieved since Marco Pantani in 1998. This adds extra pressure on Vingegaard to recover quickly and be in top form for the Tour. Additionally, the absence of his teammate Wout van Aert, who was originally planning to focus on the Giro d'Italia but had to change his plans due to a crash, is also a factor to consider. Despite Vingegaard's determination and progress in his rehabilitation, it is still uncertain whether he will be fully recovered and ready to win the Tour de France 2024.

Other contenders include Primoz Roglic, Remco Evenepoel, Carlos Rodríguez, Juan Ayuso, Matteo Jorgenson, Adam Yates, Richard Carapaz, and Egan Bernal.

Jonas Vingegaard, the 27-year-old Danish cyclist, is uncertain about his chances of winning the Tour de France after a long break. He crashed in the Baskerlandet Rundt three months ago, puncturing his lung and breaking his collarbone and several ribs. Vingegaard has been working hard to recover and is not in bad form, but he is unsure if it's realistic to compete for the win. He says, 'I don't know honestly. I've worked hard and I'm not in bad form. But it was a very hard crash, so everything since then has been a bonus.' Vingegaard is just happy to be at the Tour de France and will be content with any result. He hopes to be strong enough to compete for the win, but will have to wait and see.

**Can Jonas Vingegaard Win the Tour de France 2024?**
Jonas Vingegaard, the defending champion of the Tour de France, is facing a significant challenge as he recovers from a severe crash that occurred during the Baskerlandet race last month. The crash resulted in a broken collarbone, several broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a lung contusion. Despite this, Vingegaard has recently returned to training, giving fans hope that he may still be able to participate in the Tour de France. However, his team manager, Richard Plugge, has stated that Vingegaard will only participate if he is back to 100% form. The big question is whether Vingegaard can recover in time for the Tour de France, which starts on June 29th in Florence, Italy. His biggest rival, Tadej Pogačar, is currently leading the Giro d'Italia and may win both the Giro and the Tour, a feat not achieved since Marco Pantani in 1998. This adds extra pressure on Vingegaard to recover quickly and be in top form for the Tour. Additionally, the absence of his teammate Wout van Aert, who was originally planning to focus on the Giro d'Italia but had to change his plans due to a crash, is also a factor to consider. Despite Vingegaard's determination and progress in his rehabilitation, it is still uncertain whether he will be fully recovered and ready to win the Tour de France 2024.
