To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Filing deadline: Greystone Logistics' fiscal year ends on May 31, so their 10-K would typically be due 60 days later, around July 30, 2024.

2. Historical filing pattern: The news articles don't provide specific information about Greystone's past filing behavior. This is a significant information gap.

3. Current financial health: The most recent news from August 2024 indicates stable trading and no major financial distress signals.

4. Regulatory environment: The SEC has strict rules about timely filings, with consequences for late filers including potential delisting.

5. Industry trends: Several companies in 2024 have faced filing delays due to accounting issues or auditor changes, but there's no indication Greystone is in this situation.

6. Company-specific factors: No news suggests Greystone is experiencing internal issues that might delay filing.

Weighing these factors:

1. The base rate for timely 10-K filings is generally high, as most companies comply with SEC deadlines to avoid penalties.

2. Greystone seems to be operating normally based on recent trading data, which slightly increases the likelihood of timely filing.

3. The lack of negative news or indicators of financial distress is a positive sign for timely filing.

4. However, the absence of specific information about Greystone's past filing behavior introduces uncertainty.

5. The resolution date of October 1, 2024, gives Greystone a 2-month buffer beyond the typical due date, which significantly increases the likelihood of filing within this extended timeframe.

Considering these points, I estimate a high probability that Greystone will file its 10-K before October 1, 2024. However, given the lack of specific historical filing information and the general uncertainty inherent in such predictions, I'll provide a range to account for unknown factors.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Historical filing patterns: The SEC requires companies to file 10-K reports within a certain timeframe after their fiscal year end. Greystone Logistics' fiscal year ends on May 31, so they would typically need to file by late August or early September.

2. Recent filing behavior: There's no indication in the provided news articles that Greystone has had issues with late filings recently. The most recent news about their filings was from August 2024, discussing their Q2 results, which suggests they were up to date at that point.

3. Company stability: The news articles indicate that Greystone Logistics is an ongoing concern with regular business activities. There are no reports of major disruptions or financial difficulties that might delay a filing.

4. Market conditions: While there's general discussion of SEC filing requirements and consequences of late filings, there's no indication of widespread filing delays or issues specific to Greystone's industry.

5. Time until deadline: The question asks about filing before October 1, 2024, which is approximately 4 months after their fiscal year end. This provides a significant buffer beyond the typical filing deadline.

6. Lack of negative indicators: There are no reports of auditor changes, restatements, or other red flags that might signal potential filing delays.

7. Small company considerations: As a smaller company trading over-the-counter, Greystone might have less robust financial reporting processes than larger public companies. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate they'll miss deadlines.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a high probability that Greystone Logistics will file its 10-K before October 1, 2024. The lack of any negative indicators and the extended timeframe beyond their typical filing deadline are particularly strong positive factors.

However, given that unexpected issues can always arise and that smaller companies can face challenges in timely reporting, I'll allow for a small chance of a delay.

My Prediction: Between 92.50% and 98.50%, with 96.00% being the most likely. Probability: 96.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical filing behavior:
The news articles don't provide specific information about Greystone Logistics' past filing behavior. This is a significant gap in our knowledge, as past timeliness would be a strong predictor of future behavior.

2. Recent financial performance:
The articles indicate that Greystone Logistics has been operating normally, with reported earnings and dividends. This suggests the company is not in financial distress that might prevent timely filing.

3. Regulatory environment:
The SEC has strict rules about timely filing, with potential consequences for late filers including delisting. This creates a strong incentive for companies to file on time.

4. Industry trends:
Several articles mention other companies facing filing delays or receiving notifications about late filings. This suggests there may be some industry-wide challenges, but most companies still manage to file on time or within grace periods.

5. Company-specific factors:
There's no indication of any internal issues at Greystone Logistics that would prevent timely filing. No management changes, accounting problems, or other red flags are mentioned.

6. Time frame:
The question asks about filing before October 1, 2024, which likely gives the company some buffer beyond the standard deadline (assuming a May 31 fiscal year end, the filing would typically be due in August).

Weighing these factors:

The lack of negative news about Greystone Logistics and their continued normal operations suggest a high probability of timely filing. The regulatory pressure and potential consequences of late filing also push towards a high likelihood of compliance.

However, the existence of filing delays in other companies and the lack of specific information about Greystone's past filing behavior introduce some uncertainty. We can't be completely certain without more company-specific information.

Given these considerations, I would estimate a high probability of timely filing, but with a range to account for the uncertainties:

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Historical patterns: The news articles don't provide specific information about Greystone Logistics' past filing behavior. However, late filings are generally not common for established companies unless there are specific issues.

2. Recent company performance: The articles from August 2024 indicate that Greystone Logistics was still actively trading and reporting financial metrics, suggesting ongoing business operations.

3. Regulatory environment: The article "What Late SEC Filers Need To Know In 2024" outlines severe consequences for late filings, including potential delisting. This creates a strong incentive for companies to file on time.

4. Company-specific factors: There's no indication of any specific issues that might delay Greystone Logistics' filing. The company seems to be operating normally based on the limited information available.

5. Time remaining: As of the current date (October 18, 2024), the filing deadline of October 1, 2024 has already passed. This means we know with certainty whether the company filed on time or not.

6. Lack of negative news: The absence of any news articles mentioning a late filing or delisting notice for Greystone Logistics after October 1, 2024 is a strong indicator that the company likely filed on time.

7. General filing statistics: While not specific to Greystone Logistics, most public companies file their annual reports on time to avoid regulatory issues.

Balancing these factors:

- The strongest evidence for timely filing is the lack of any negative news after the deadline and the general tendency of companies to file on time.
- The main risk factor is the lack of specific confirmation of the filing, but this is likely due to the routine nature of on-time filings not generating news.

Given that the deadline has passed and there's no indication of a missed filing, I would assign a very high probability to Greystone Logistics having filed its 10-K annual report before October 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.90%, with 98.50% being the most likely. Probability: 98.50%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Base rate: Most public companies file their 10-K reports on time. However, Greystone Logistics is traded over-the-counter, which may indicate less stringent reporting practices.

2. Recent filing history: The news articles don't mention any recent delays in Greystone's filings, which is a positive sign.

3. Company size and resources: Greystone is a relatively small company (market cap around $35-40 million), which could mean limited resources for timely reporting.

4. Financial health: The company appears to be profitable (P/E ratio around 9-10), suggesting it's not in financial distress that might delay filings.

5. Regulatory environment: The SEC has been increasingly strict about timely filings, as evidenced by the article on late filers in 2024.

6. Industry trends: No specific issues were mentioned for Greystone's industry (plastic pallets and recycled resins) that might cause widespread filing delays.

7. Time until deadline: The question is asked in October 2024, leaving ample time for the company to file its 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.

8. Comparison to peers: While some companies mentioned in the news (like Trimble and Super Micro Computer) had filing delays, these were larger companies dealing with specific accounting issues.

9. Company-specific factors: No news of management changes, accounting issues, or other red flags that might signal potential delays for Greystone.

10. Historical pattern: The short interest in Greystone has fluctuated, but this doesn't directly relate to filing timeliness.

10. Historical pattern: The short interest in Greystone has fluctuated, but this doesn't directly relate to filing timeliness.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a high probability that Greystone will file its 10-K on time. The lack of negative news, the company's apparent financial stability, and the general trend of companies striving to meet SEC deadlines all support this conclusion. However, its small size and over-the-counter status introduce some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Base rate: Most public companies file their 10-K reports on time. However, Greystone Logistics is traded over-the-counter, which may indicate less stringent reporting practices.

2. Recent filing history: The news articles don't mention any recent delays in Greystone's filings, which is a positive sign.

3. Company size and resources: Greystone is a relatively small company (market cap around $35-40 million), which could mean limited resources for timely reporting.

4. Financial health: The company appears to be profitable (P/E ratio around 9-10), suggesting it's not in financial distress that might delay filings.

5. Regulatory environment: The SEC has been increasingly strict about timely filings, as evidenced by the article on late filers in 2024.

6. Industry trends: No specific issues were mentioned for Greystone's industry (plastic pallets and recycled resins) that might cause widespread filing delays.

7. Time until deadline: The question is asked in October 2024, leaving ample time for the company to file its 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.

8. Comparison to peers: While some companies mentioned in the news (like Trimble and Super Micro Computer) had filing delays, these were larger companies dealing with specific accounting issues.
