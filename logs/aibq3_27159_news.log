**Nine Human Cases of Avian Influenza Detected in the US: What Does it Mean?**
Nine human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the US, with four recent cases in Colorado. The cases are a result of a global outbreak of H5N1, a particular strain of avian influenza that originated in 2020. The cases in the US have been relatively mild and have only affected agricultural workers who had contact with infected animals. Some patients have presented typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or runny nose. Several have also had conjunctivitis or pink eyes. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, said that the current strain of the virus is not well adapted for human infection and may not even be well adapted for lower respiratory tract infection. The cases are derived from a global outbreak of H5N1, which has affected poultry farms and dairy farms in the US. The first human case in the country was reported in April 2022, followed by cases in Texas, Michigan, and Colorado. The mild nature of the cases contrasts with the effect of the virus on birds and some mammals, such as seals, lions, foxes, raccoons, and cats, which have died from the virus. Since January 2022, over 99 million wild waterfowl, commercial poultry, and backyard poultry in the US have been affected, meaning they died from the virus or were slaughtered to prevent further transmission. Approximately 160 dairy cow herds have also been affected since the virus was first detected in cows in March. This H5N1 strain is considered highly pathogenic, meaning it has a high potential to kill chickens. 'It's scary to hear about a virus like this, but that term is actually a USDA term referring to what happens in poultry,' said John Lednicky, professor of environmental and global health at the University of Florida. 'The fact that it's highly pathogenic in birds does not mean it is in humans or mammals.' Lednicky added that some H5N1 strains are fatal in humans, while others are not. Of the over 900 cases of H5N1 in people reported worldwide since 1997, approximately half were fatal. However, in the last two years, the global mortality rate has been lower: around 27%. Even then, those figures reflect mainly people who were sick enough to seek treatment. Dr. Peter Palese, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said that the patients included in that count are those who 'have been hospitalized and, in retrospect, have been in contact with large quantities of virus.' Palese's 2012 research, which examined blood samples from 12,500 people without a documented flu infection, found that between 1% and 2% of them may have been previously infected with H5N1. However, experts still fear that the virus could mutate into a version that causes a more severe disease or spreads from person to person (so far, all transmission has been from animals to humans). 'The concern is that as more animals and people get infected, the virus will change,' said Binnicker.

**US cases of avian flu in cattle are causing concern. How prepared is Europe for the bird flu threat?**
A highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has been detected in dairy cows in the US, causing concern about the potential global health risk. The virus has already infected four dairy workers, but there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Experts warn that Europe should be monitoring the virus and preparing to respond quickly if it spreads. The US outbreak is the first time H5N1 has been documented in cattle, making it a higher risk for human transmission. Researchers are concerned about the virus's ability to spread between small animals and its potential to mutate and become more contagious. Some countries, such as Finland, are taking steps to prepare for H5N1, including offering vaccines to high-risk workers and monitoring fur farms. The European Commission is also stockpiling pre-pandemic vaccines and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is convening an expert group to support global access to H5N1 vaccines.

**WHO Warns of Compromised Ability to Manage Avian Influenza Risk**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that its ability to manage the risk posed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans is compromised by irregular surveillance. The WHO reported that the United States has notified a fourth human case of H5N1 avian influenza due to contact with infected dairy cows, and Cambodia has reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. 'At this moment, there has been no reported transmission between humans, so the WHO continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as low', said the head of the UN health agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 'However, our ability to assess and manage this risk is compromised by limited surveillance of animal viruses worldwide', he added in a press conference. 'Understanding how these viruses spread and mutate in animals is essential to identify any changes that may increase the risk of outbreaks in humans, or the possibility of a pandemic', he emphasized. The WHO appealed to all countries to intensify surveillance and notification of avian influenza in animals and humans, as well as to share samples and genetic sequences. It also called for greater protection of agricultural workers who may be exposed to infected animals and increased research on avian influenza. The H5N1 virus first emerged in 1996, but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, along with an increase in the number of infected mammals. The virus has caused the death of tens of millions of birds, as well as infecting wild birds and terrestrial and marine mammals. Human cases registered in Europe and the United States since the virus outbreak have been mostly brief. H5N1 has spread among dairy cow herds in the United States, now with four cases of the disease passing from cattle to humans.

**New evidence sheds light on health emergency as virus rapidly spreads and evolves — here's what you need to know**
A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.

**To save humans from the deadly H5N1 avian flu, the time to act is now**
The article highlights the urgent need to take action to prevent a potential pandemic caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. The virus has already spread globally, infecting birds, mammals, and potentially humans. The author, Matthew S. Miller, emphasizes the importance of a 'One Health' approach, prioritizing prevention over response, and notes that the window to act is small. He suggests that the virus could adapt to infect humans more efficiently, potentially leading to a catastrophic pandemic. The article discusses the risks of human-to-human transmission, the potential for high human mortality, and the need for public buy-in and resources to prevent the spread of the virus. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation, government policies, and evidence-based approaches to prevent the pandemic.

**WHO Classifies Risk of Avian Influenza to Human Health as Low**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the risk of avian influenza to human health as low globally. According to a document released on Wednesday, the organization also classifies the risk of infection for farm workers and similar establishments as 'low to moderate', depending on the risk mitigation measures in place. The WHO states that the transmission of the virus between animals continues to occur, and there have been only a 'limited number' of human infections reported. 'Although new human infections associated with exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments will likely continue to occur, the impact of such infections on public health at the global level is minimal.' In June, the WHO confirmed the first death from the H5N2 variant of avian influenza. The patient, a 59-year-old man from Mexico, had no history of exposure to birds or other animals. The organization emphasized that the patient had multiple underlying medical conditions and was bedridden for three weeks before showing symptoms. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned in July that the organization's ability to evaluate and manage the risk of avian influenza to human health was 'compromised' due to failures in animal case surveillance worldwide. 'Last week, the United States reported the fourth case of the H5N1 virus in a human after exposure to infected dairy cows. Cambodia also reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. To date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported, and therefore, the WHO continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as low,' he explained. 'However, our ability to evaluate and manage this risk is compromised due to limited surveillance of animal influenza cases worldwide. Understanding how the virus spreads and reproduces in animals is essential to identifying any changes that may increase the risk of outbreaks in humans or the potential for a pandemic,' he added. In a press conference, the WHO Director-General appealed for all countries to strengthen their systems for surveillance and notification of avian influenza cases in animals and humans. Tedros also requested that countries share samples and sequences of the H5N1 virus with WHO collaborating centers worldwide, maintaining public access to the data.

**Avian Influenza in the European Region of the WHO: What We Know and How to Prepare**
Avian influenza is not a new disease, despite recent outbreaks in the United States. The H5N1 virus, responsible for current outbreaks, first appeared in 1996/1997 in Hong Kong and reappeared in 2003/2004. The disease has evolved continuously since then and is commonly found in domestic and wild birds worldwide. It can also spread to mammal populations; in the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO), it has been detected in farmed visons and foxes. The region experienced one of its worst waves of avian influenza infections between October 2021 and September 2023, resulting in the deaths of millions of wild birds and 2,500 outbreaks in farms across 37 countries. Globally, while the H5N1 virus continues to spread to more mammals, human infections occur only occasionally. As of July 2024, around 10 human cases have been reported due to the outbreak in the United States, although it still affects over 100 herds of livestock. Recent global reports have also detected different subtypes of the virus in the human population, including a death caused by H5N2 in Mexico and a recovered case of less pathogenic H5N1 in Australia, the first in the country. In the region, Finland has announced that it will begin vaccinating against the disease in high-risk populations, mainly agricultural workers and veterinarians. The WHO/Europe has also signed a quadrilateral agreement with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the World Organisation for Animal Health to strengthen and optimize human, animal, plant, and environmental health against future threats. 'Is avian influenza a cause for concern?' asks Aisling Vaughan, an epidemiologist at WHO/Europe specializing in zoonotic influenza, explaining what avian influenza means for the region today and whether it can pose a risk in the future.

**Considerations for Starting Mass Production of H5N1 Avian Flu Vaccines**
The H5N1 avian flu virus is spreading globally, with a high mortality rate of 60% in humans. Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo and Dr. Rick Bright, experts in global health, warn that the virus is becoming more contagious and could potentially lead to a deadly outbreak. The virus has already infected dairy workers in North America, and there are concerns that it could spread to humans through contact with infected animals. Dr. Bright recommends eye protection for dairy workers and increased testing and transparency by the USDA to prevent a widespread outbreak. While some experts, like Michael Osterholm, are cautious but not yet alarmed, others, like Dr. Bright, are concerned that the virus could be one mutation away from disaster.

**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Transmitted from Cow to Cow, Study Finds**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H1N5) outbreak in dairy farms in the United States is becoming increasingly concerning. According to a new study published in Nature, the pathogen is being transmitted from cow to cow. As the researchers stated, 'the efficient and sustained transmission of mammal to mammal has no precedents' and is occurring between asymptomatic livestock. The affected cows showed clinical signs including decreased food intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory difficulty, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. The infectious virus and viral RNA were constantly detected in the milk of the affected cows. The complete genome sequences of the viral genome recovered from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a raccoon from the affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. The epidemiological and genomic data revealed efficient transmission from cow to cow after cows from an affected farm were transported to facilities in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 (2.3.4.4b strain) 'in a non-traditional interface, highlighting the virus's ability to cross species barriers,' according to the researchers. The study consisted of a diagnostic and epidemiological investigation conducted in dairy farms in the US that experienced a clinical outbreak of sudden milk drop and respiratory difficulty. Field veterinarians collected clinical samples and sent them to three veterinary diagnostic laboratories for analysis. Genomic surveillance was performed, identifying highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 infection in cattle. The epidemiological data collected from the farms were combined with genomic sequence data to make inferences about the virus transfer and transmission routes between the affected farms. In March 2024, it was discovered that dairy cows in Texas were infected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain, H5N1, in the first known case of the virus spreading to livestock. Since then, the virus has been detected in over 200 animals (and 3 people) in 12 US states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

**Bird flu outbreak worries Australia**
Australia is on high alert due to the spread of avian influenza, or bird flu, across the country's poultry farms. Since May, several farms in Victoria, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory have been affected, leading to large-scale culls and egg supply shortages. Associate Professor Dr. Vinod Balasubramaniam warned that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain poses a significant threat to global public health, and Professor Adrian Esterman noted that the current outbreak has affected a wider range of bird species than previous outbreaks. The risk of widespread transmission of H5N1 among mammals and potential spillover to humans remains a concern, although the risk to humans is considered low. The Australian government has established a comprehensive framework to confront the potential threat of H5N1, including stringent biosecurity measures, vaccination strategies, and robust public health infrastructure. However, experts argue that the allocated funding of A$7 million is inadequate given the scale of potential devastation. 'The bird flu situation in Australia is increasingly alarming, particularly due to the threat posed by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain,' said Balasubramaniam. 'Continuous surveillance is essential to monitor the virus's genetic mutations and potential for human-to-human transmission,' he added. 'The H5N1 bird flu is highly pathogenic for birds, and for the small number of humans infected over the last 20 years, the case fatality rate has been high...about 50 percent,' said Esterman. 'The key issue is that it (bird flu) is not easily spread between humans. And that remains the case,' said Professor Robert Booy.

**First Effective Transmission of Avian Influenza Virus Between Mammals Confirmed**
A recent study published in the Nature journal confirms the first effective transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) from cow to cow. The study reveals the virus's ability to cross species barriers, highlighting its potential to transmit between mammals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US confirmed a human case of avian influenza in a Texas resident on July 1, marking the first recorded human-to-human transmission resulting from contact with an infected mammal, rather than an infected bird. The study also notes that the virus has affected not only domestic and wild bird species, but also other mammalian species, including domestic and wild carnivores, such as cats and red foxes. The virus has even spread to polar regions, killing a polar bear in the Arctic and gentoo penguins in Antarctica. According to Sigrid de Sousa dos Santos, director of the Sociedade Paulista de Infectologia, the study raises concerns about the virus's adaptation to mammals and potential transmission between the same species. 'This study, along with others published this year, highlights the need for further research and monitoring of the H5N1 virus,' she explained.

**FAO Warns of Avian Influenza Outbreaks in Humans**
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has expressed concern over the increase in cases of avian influenza in humans. The H5N1 virus, which has shown unprecedented spread, has reached South America and Antarctica, with 13 new cases reported in Cambodia. The FAO warns that the virus is highly pathogenic and has spread widely, infecting various wild and domestic animals, including terrestrial and marine mammals, carnivores, ruminants, and scavengers. The concern is particularly high in Asia and the Pacific. Since 2023, human cases have been reported in China and Vietnam, while Nepal and Bangladesh are managing outbreaks in their territories. 'The recent increase in avian influenza outbreaks is very concerning', said Kachen Wongsathapornchai, Regional Director of the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD). 'Since the end of 2023, we have observed an increase in human cases and the spread of the virus to new animal species. The appearance of new A/H5N1 strains, which are more easily transmissible, increases the threat of a pandemic', warned. The FAO has emphasized the importance of developing technologies for rapid diagnosis and the use of bioinformatics to analyze virus data. It has also urged collaboration between governments, international organizations, and the private sector to create effective containment strategies and strengthen biosecurity measures in the poultry industry, including vaccination strategies and promotion of good agricultural practices.

**Avian Influenza Virus Confirmed to be Spreading Among Mammals**
A new study from Cornell University (USA) has confirmed that the H5N1 avian influenza virus is spreading among mammals. The virus, which initially infected cattle and then jumped to transmission between mammals (cows to cats and a raccoon), has been shown to be efficiently transmitted between animals. According to Diego Diel, associate professor of virology and director of the Virology Laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, 'This is one of the first times we see evidence of efficient and sustained transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 from mammal to mammal.' The study found no mutations in the virus that would increase its transmissibility to humans, but the data shows clear transmission between mammals, which is concerning as the virus can adapt to mammals. So far, 11 human cases have been reported in the US, all with mild symptoms, and the virus has been identified as circulating in dairy cows. The researchers are concerned that the virus could adapt to humans and become efficiently transmitted in the future. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring the virus in affected animals and humans, and to implement early detection, improved biosecurity, and quarantine measures to contain any further spread of the virus.

**"Enormous concern": New bird flu transmission paths confirmed**
A new study has found that the avian influenza virus, H5N1, has evolved to be capable of multidirectional infections across species, including mammals. While human-to-human transmission remains low, the virus has been shown to spread efficiently between mammals, and there is concern that it could adapt to humans in the future. The study analyzed viral nucleic acid from dairy cows and found that seemingly healthy animals can spread the virus to other animals, making containment difficult. The researchers also found that the virus can target the mammary gland in dairy cows, resulting in high viral loads being shed into milk. The study's findings are concerning, given the lack of a rapid test for the virus and the potential for it to evolve into a pandemic. Scientists are closely monitoring the situation and using advanced AI and physics-based modeling techniques to assess transmission and predict future outcomes.

**Avian Influenza Virus H5N1: High Risk of Transmission to Humans and Animals**
A study conducted by Cornell University in the US has found that the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has high pathogenicity, can be transmitted directly from birds to cattle and from cattle to humans, cats, and wild animals. The virus has been identified as having a high viral load in the mammary gland of infected cows, making it a potential risk for human health. The study found that 11 cases of human infection with the virus have been reported in the US, with 4 cases linked to an outbreak in dairy cattle and 7 in poultry farming. The virus has a low efficacy and has not been transmitted directly between humans, but there is a high fear that it could evolve. The study's findings have been published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature.

**Avian Influenza Virus: Increased Risk to Humans as Virus Transmits Between Mammals**
A new study has found that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus can transmit from one mammal to another, increasing the risk to humans. The study, conducted by a team from Cornell University, discovered that the virus can transmit directly between cows and from cows to cats and raccoons. According to Diego Diel, professor of virology and director of the Center for Diagnostic Virology at Cornell University, this is one of the first times that effective and sustained transmission of the H5N1 virus from mammal to mammal has been observed. The study's findings are concerning because the virus could potentially adapt to mammals, warns Diel. So far, 11 human cases of avian influenza have been reported in the US, with four linked to the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle and seven to poultry farms. The researchers believe that the virus could have originated from dairy farms in the same county. Although the pathogen can infect humans and replicate in their bodies, the effectiveness of these infections is currently low. The fear is that potential mutations could occur, leading to the virus adapting to mammals, spreading among humans, and potentially transmitting efficiently between humans in the future. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring the pathogen in animals and humans, warns Diel. Measures to contain the spread of the virus include early diagnosis, increased biosafety measures, and quarantines in case of positivity.

**Avian Influenza Virus May Pose Greater Risk to Humans**
A new study has found that the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has high pathogenicity, can transmit from mammals to mammals, increasing the risk to humans. The virus has been detected in several US states, causing direct transmission between cows, and from cows to cats and a raccoon. The study, conducted by a group from Cornell University, found no mutations in the viral genome that would increase its transmissibility to humans. However, the data shows clear transmission from mammal to mammal. This is concerning because the virus could adapt to mammals, warns Diel. In the US, 11 human cases of avian influenza have been reported, all with mild symptoms. To contain any further spread of the pathogen, early diagnosis tests, biosafety measures, and quarantines are needed. In the US, H5N1 infections were first identified in January 2022 and have caused the death of over 100 million domestic birds and thousands of wild birds.

**Researchers Warn of the Need for a Global Pandemic Agreement**
Researchers at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) believe that despite the threat of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which may have gained the ability to transmit between mammals, 'we are still on time' to prepare for a possible global pandemic, but warn that a 'global pandemic agreement' is urgently needed. The researchers, Elizabeth Diago-Navarro and Clara Marín-Carballo, point out that the fact that the H5N1 virus has gained the ability to transmit between mammals 'is a very worrying news, which puts this virus at the head of the possible causes of the next pandemic, when we have not yet done enough to prepare for it from an institutional, legal, and financial perspective.' They emphasize the need for international coordination to avoid what happened with COVID-19. According to them, 'infectious diseases, epidemics, and pandemics have accompanied humanity since our beginnings, shaping cultures and societies. Each certain time, humanity has suffered, suffers, and will suffer from epidemics caused by different pathogenic agents, such as the plague, smallpox, cholera, or pandemic influenza.' They also warn that it is inevitable that new pandemics will emerge in the future due to 'certain factors, such as amplified environmental changes, changes in land use, interactions with wild animals, or globalization, which are contributing to increasing the risk of a new pandemic with shorter intervals between events.' The researchers highlight that the trend in recent decades suggests that the next pandemic will be caused by a virus for which there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet, and that it will spread through respiratory transmission, rather than fecal or oral transmission as in pandemics like cholera or Ebola. 'This is because, when it spreads through respiratory transmission, human-to-human transmission is more difficult to control, since it does not depend on hygiene measures like in the fecal-oral route, nor on measures that avoid exposure to bodily fluids like in viruses transmitted by contact,' they explain. They also mention that there are projects to try to map the global virome, such as the PREDICT project, which identifies viruses that could cause a pandemic. In this context, they express a certain optimism, saying that 'we are still on time to reinforce our capacities for preparation and response to the next pandemic. There are still funds, political will, and social interest to push forward initiatives that strengthen global governance and stable funding for pandemic preparation.' They recommend approving a pandemic agreement urgently, which would require countries to be willing to cede power and independence to ensure that crucial decisions, such as the equitable distribution of vaccines, are binding. 'If mechanisms of accountability are not created, countries will not voluntarily cede resources during a pandemic,' they warn. They also suggest that resources for pandemic preparation and response should be distributed equitably between different countries, not only for ethical reasons but also because the lack of preparation in some countries is a risk for all. They emphasize that the North Global should support the creation of capacities for the development and production of countermeasures (such as vaccines) in the South Global, so that the latter does not depend on donations from the former. They also recommend establishing effective epidemiological surveillance capacities in all countries, creating incentives for the declaration of new pathogens or variants of known ones. Finally, they advise that the pandemic agreement should ensure the financing of the World Health Organization (WHO), not only for emergency response but also to guarantee the rest of its activities, so that it can act as a global health coordinator with some authority over countries and adequate mechanisms of accountability.

**Cluster of H5N1 bird flu cases among Colorado poultry farm workers raises alarm**
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) reported five workers at a commercial egg layer operation have tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 bird flu) virus. The workers were involved in culling infected chickens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed four of the five cases, with the fifth pending confirmation. The cluster of cases raises concerns about the possibility of human-to-human transmission. Experts warn that if the virus spreads to humans, it could be difficult to control. The CDPHE is urging workers to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent infection, but it is not mandatory. The CDC has not taken any urgent action in response to the outbreak. Only 61 humans have been tested for H5N1 since March, and no serological testing has been done to understand the overall levels of exposure in the community.

**Avian Influenza Threatens Humans Through Infected Pigs**
A recent study by researchers at the University of Iowa has found that avian influenza can spread to humans through infected pigs, which can then transmit the virus to humans. This scenario has occurred twice in the United States since spring 2024. The study found that the H5N1 virus, which is highly infectious, can bind to receptors in the lungs and mammary glands of infected pigs, allowing it to adapt and mutate to infect other cells. The researchers also found that the virus can be transmitted through milk, which can be a source of infection for other animals, including humans. According to the CDC, the risk of human infection is low, but the study highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling the spread of the virus. The researchers are concerned about the expression of sialic acids and their distribution in the respiratory and mammary glands of infected pigs, which can facilitate the spread of the virus.

**Nine Human Cases of Avian Influenza Detected in the US: What Does it Mean?**
Nine human cases of avian influenza have been detected in the US, with four recent cases in Colorado. The cases are a result of a global outbreak of H5N1, a particular strain of avian influenza that originated in 2020. The cases in the US have been relatively mild and have only affected agricultural workers who had contact with infected animals. Some patients have presented typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, or runny nose. Several have also had conjunctivitis or pink eyes. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, said that the current strain of the virus is not well adapted for human infection and may not even be well adapted for lower respiratory tract infection. The cases are derived from a global outbreak of H5N1, which has affected poultry farms and dairy farms in the US. The first human case in the country was reported in April 2022, followed by cases in Texas, Michigan, and Colorado. The mild nature of the cases contrasts with the effect of the virus on birds and some mammals, such as seals, lions, foxes, raccoons, and cats, which have died from the virus. Since January 2022, over 99 million wild waterfowl, commercial poultry, and backyard poultry in the US have been affected, meaning they died from the virus or were slaughtered to prevent further transmission. Approximately 160 dairy cow herds have also been affected since the virus was first detected in cows in March. This H5N1 strain is considered highly pathogenic, meaning it has a high potential to kill chickens. 'It's scary to hear about a virus like this, but that term is actually a USDA term referring to what happens in poultry,' said John Lednicky, professor of environmental and global health at the University of Florida. 'The fact that it's highly pathogenic in birds does not mean it is in humans or mammals.' Lednicky added that some H5N1 strains are fatal in humans, while others are not. Of the over 900 cases of H5N1 in people reported worldwide since 1997, approximately half were fatal. However, in the last two years, the global mortality rate has been lower: around 27%. Even then, those figures reflect mainly people who were sick enough to seek treatment. Dr. Peter Palese, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said that the patients included in that count are those who 'have been hospitalized and, in retrospect, have been in contact with large quantities of virus.' Palese's 2012 research, which examined blood samples from 12,500 people without a documented flu infection, found that between 1% and 2% of them may have been previously infected with H5N1. However, experts still fear that the virus could mutate into a version that causes a more severe disease or spreads from person to person (so far, all transmission has been from animals to humans). 'The concern is that as more animals and people get infected, the virus will change,' said Binnicker.

**US Confirms Another Case of H5N1 Avian Influenza in Humans**
The United States has confirmed another case of H5N1 avian influenza in humans, the fourth recorded case in the country. The disease was contracted by a rural worker who had contact with infected cows. This raises concerns about the spread of the virus among different animal species and the risk to humans. Since 2022, the US has reported nine cases of the disease in humans, with four cases linked to contact with infected cows and five cases linked to exposure to infected birds. The CDC considers the risk of H5N1 avian influenza to the general public in the US to be low. However, the virus has been detected in over 99 million birds and 156 dairy farms in the US, and has also been found in marine mammals in Chile. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 889 cases of human infection with the virus worldwide, with 463 fatalities, a 52% mortality rate. While there is no documented transmission between humans, the virus has the potential to adapt to different species, including mammals that are biologically closer to humans, such as cows. 'This is concerning. It's worth paying attention to, because that's how pandemics start. The virus is adapting,' says Dr. Nancy Bellei, a consultant for the Brazilian Society of Infectology.

**US investigates four cases of H5N1 avian influenza in humans**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have sent a team to Colorado after confirming four cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in humans, as well as investigating a fifth suspected case. The H5N1 virus, which previously only circulated in birds, has caused unprecedented outbreaks in mammals, such as a farm in Spain and thousands of sea lions in Chile. Since March, the US has also reported new cases in dairy cows in at least 13 states. Between humans, avian influenza cases are rare and there is no record of transmission between people. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that from 2003 to the end of last year, there were 882 confirmed cases in 23 countries, all contaminated by close contact with infected birds. The CDC believes that the risk of the virus mutating and becoming transmissible between people increases with each new species that reports outbreaks and each new contamination in humans. The most recent cases in the US were confirmed on Sunday. According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the virus was identified in workers who were responding to an outbreak of the disease among birds on an egg-producing farm. 'The workers were slaughtering birds on a farm in northeastern Colorado and presented mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis (pink eye) and common respiratory infection symptoms. None of them were hospitalized', says a statement. The samples were sent to the CDC, which confirmed four human cases. A fifth patient had 'presumably positive' results from the Colorado analysis, but is under investigation by the CDC. 'Given the current information, the CDC believes that the risk to the public from this outbreak remains low. These cases again highlight the risk of exposure to infected animals. (But) there are no unexpected increases in flu activity in Colorado or other states affected by H5N1 outbreaks in cattle and birds', says a note. These were the first human cases of avian influenza linked to contact with birds in the US since 2022, with the others this year related to exposure to contaminated cattle, one in Colorado, two in Michigan, and one in Texas. According to the CDC, Colorado is experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 in dairy farms and poultry farms. The authority has sent 'a multidisciplinary team of nine people, including epidemiologists, veterinarians, clinicians, and an industrial hygienist to Colorado to support its public health response to the outbreak among bird farm workers', says a note.

**New Study Warns of Increased Risk of Avian Flu Virus Transmission Between Mammals**
A new study warns that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu virus has gained the ability to transmit between mammals, posing a greater risk to public health than previously thought. The virus has been detected in 130 farms in 12 US states and has caused the death of millions of birds and mammals. The study found that the virus can infect both birds and mammals, including humans, using two different receptors. The researchers also detected the virus's ability to transmit between ferrets, although with low efficiency. The study's lead author, Yoshihiro Kawaoka, warns that the virus could become more virulent and that vaccination of animals may not be enough to contain it. The World Health Organization considers the risk to public health to be low, but experts warn that the virus's ability to transmit between mammals is a concern.

**US cases of avian flu in cattle are causing concern. How prepared is Europe for the bird flu threat?**
A highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has been detected in dairy cows in the US, causing concern about the potential global health risk. The virus has already infected four dairy workers, but there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Experts warn that Europe should be monitoring the virus and preparing to respond quickly if it spreads. The US outbreak is the first time H5N1 has been documented in cattle, making it a higher risk for human transmission. Researchers are concerned about the virus's ability to spread between small animals and its potential to mutate and become more contagious. Some countries, such as Finland, are taking steps to prepare for H5N1, including offering vaccines to high-risk workers and monitoring fur farms. The European Commission is also stockpiling pre-pandemic vaccines and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is convening an expert group to support global access to H5N1 vaccines.

**WHO Concerned about Avian Influenza H5N1 in the US: 'Intensify Surveillance and Reporting'**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about the fourth human case of avian influenza H5N1 in the United States, despite no human-to-human transmission being reported yet. The WHO has appealed to governments worldwide to intensify surveillance and reporting of suspected cases, as the risk of developing a highly contagious strain for humans is high. However, the WHO has mitigated alarmism, stating that the risk for the general population remains low. According to WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the limited surveillance of animal viruses, not only in the US but globally, hinders the ability to identify potential changes in the avian influenza structure, allowing for early action to prevent epidemics or pandemics. The WHO emphasizes the importance of monitoring agricultural workers, who are at high risk of contracting the virus. Avian influenza cases are increasing among cattle, with around 145 dairy cow herds infected in the US, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's epidemiological prevention expert. The WHO is urging a global understanding of the circulation of the virus among cattle.

**WHO Maintains Low Alert Level for Avian Influenza Despite New Cases and Studies**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has maintained its alert level for avian influenza at low despite new cases and scientific studies on the transmission of the H5N1 virus through infected milk. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, there has been no reported human-to-human transmission, and the risk to the general population remains low. However, Tedros emphasized the need for increased surveillance, laboratory analysis, and information sharing with healthcare centers to better understand how the virus transmits and changes in animals. The US reported a fourth case of avian influenza in a person linked to cattle dairy farms, while Cambodia reported two cases of children who had contact with infected birds. A recent study published in Nature confirms that the H5N1 virus can be transmitted from contaminated cow's milk to mammals and can reach the mammary glands. The study found that in laboratory tests, H5N1 was transmitted from infected rat pups to their offspring.

**WHO Warns of Compromised Ability to Manage Avian Influenza Risk**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that its ability to manage the risk posed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans is compromised by irregular surveillance. The WHO reported that the United States has notified a fourth human case of H5N1 avian influenza due to contact with infected dairy cows, and Cambodia has reported two cases in children who had contact with sick or dead chickens. 'At this moment, there has been no reported transmission between humans, so the WHO continues to evaluate the risk to the general public as low', said the head of the UN health agency, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 'However, our ability to assess and manage this risk is compromised by limited surveillance of animal viruses worldwide', he added in a press conference. 'Understanding how these viruses spread and mutate in animals is essential to identify any changes that may increase the risk of outbreaks in humans, or the possibility of a pandemic', he emphasized. The WHO appealed to all countries to intensify surveillance and notification of avian influenza in animals and humans, as well as to share samples and genetic sequences. It also called for greater protection of agricultural workers who may be exposed to infected animals and increased research on avian influenza. The H5N1 virus first emerged in 1996, but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, along with an increase in the number of infected mammals. The virus has caused the death of tens of millions of birds, as well as infecting wild birds and terrestrial and marine mammals. Human cases registered in Europe and the United States since the virus outbreak have been mostly brief. H5N1 has spread among dairy cow herds in the United States, now with four cases of the disease passing from cattle to humans.

**WHO Calls for Increased Surveillance to Prevent Avian Influenza Pandemic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for increased surveillance to prevent the risk of a pandemic due to the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Four people have been infected with the virus in the United States, and other cases have been reported elsewhere. The WHO has warned that its ability to manage the risk posed by the H5N1 virus to humans is compromised by uneven surveillance. The WHO has called on all countries to strengthen surveillance and notification of avian influenza in animals and humans, and to share samples and genetic sequences. The organization has also called for greater protection of agricultural workers who may be exposed to infected animals and increased research on avian influenza. The H5N1 virus first appeared in 1996, but since 2020, the number of cases in birds has increased exponentially, along with the number of infected mammals. Most human cases reported in Europe and the United States since the virus emerged have been mild. The virus has spread to dairy cattle herds in the United States, with four cases of animal-to-human transmission.

**EU Recommends Increased Vigilance Over Avian Influenza: 'It's Important to Stay Alert'**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has recommended increasing vigilance due to the cases of avian influenza, although it has pointed out that the viruses circulate at low levels among wild bird populations in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA). The ECDC has reminded that in the United States, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have been transmitted to dairy cattle and four human cases of avian influenza have been reported among agricultural workers exposed to the animals since April 2024. Despite the fact that 'human-to-human transmission remains a rare event', avian influenza viruses can spread to wild, farm, and domestic animals, 'causing infections and outbreaks in poultry and, occasionally, in mammals', notes the Centre. The ECDC has also emphasized the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance to ensure public safety regarding the risk of avian influenza to humans and will continue to provide updates and guidance as necessary and in accordance with the epidemiological situation.

**H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus Shows Adaptation and Easier Transmission to Mammals**
A recent outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) H5N1 in dairy cattle in the USA has been studied by an American-Japanese research group. The virus has been found to have characteristics that suggest adaptation and easier transmission to mammals. The researchers, led by Professor Dr. Amie J. Eisfeld and Professor Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, investigated how the virus behaves in mice and ferrets. The results, published in the journal 'Nature', show that the virus can replicate in the mammary glands of mice and ferrets. The study also found that the virus can bind to sialic acid molecules found in the upper respiratory tract of humans, making it potentially easier to transmit to humans through droplet infection. The researchers also found that the virus can be transmitted from infected female mice to their offspring, and that adult mice and ferrets can develop symptoms and widespread virus replication after oral or intranasal infection. However, the virus was not efficiently transmitted to adult ferrets through droplet infection.

**Avian Influenza H5N1: A Study Reveals Its Potential to Transmit Between Mammals**
A study published in the journal Nature found that the H5N1 avian influenza virus can be transmitted between mammals through contaminated cow's milk and can reach the mammary glands. The study, led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, isolated the virus from milk of an infected cow in New Mexico, USA, and demonstrated that it can replicate and cause disease in mice and ferrets, two common animal models for studying influenza in mammals. The detection of a subtype of the virus in a dairy farm in the United States in the spring of 2024 is the first documented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle. Since then, it has been documented to spread between herds and infect other mammals, including humans, indicating a 'greater risk' to public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been four recent cases in humans - workers - in the United States. While the current risk to public health is low, the CDC is monitoring the situation 'closely' and working with the 12 affected states. The study characterized the isolated virus and demonstrated that it can transmit through milk from infected cows to mice and ferrets, and even to the mammary glands of infected animals. The virus was also found to transmit from infected mice to their offspring. Aitor Nogales González, a scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, summarized that the study showed that animals can become infected by consuming contaminated milk and that there is vertical transmission in infected mice. However, the bovine H5N1 virus was transmitted inefficiently through respiratory transmission in ferrets. Some of these results are similar to those obtained with other H5N1 viruses in the past. However, they suggest that the virus isolated in the outbreak in cattle may have characteristics that facilitate infection and transmission in mammals, including humans. This conclusion is mainly due to the virus's ability to bind to cellular receptors present in the upper respiratory tract of humans, according to the Science Media Centre (SMC) Spain. 'Although the risk to the population, in general, is considered low, this situation could change in the future and we must remain alert. We must remember that the last pandemics of influenza have had the avian influenza as a fundamental actor', concludes Nogales. The new study aims to answer key questions related to the potential of the virus isolated in cows to transmit between mammals through different routes.

**EU Advises Increased Surveillance on Avian Influenza as Cases Rise**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has advised increasing surveillance on avian influenza cases, as the virus has been spreading among animals and humans. The ECDC has reported four cases of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in the US, and while transmission from animals to humans is still rare, the virus can spread to wild and domestic birds, causing outbreaks and occasional infections in mammals. The ECDC has emphasized the importance of raising awareness, but not alarm, and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to support early detection and containment of potential human cases. The agency has also strengthened its support for EU countries in laboratory activities on avian influenza, including preparing laboratories to detect and characterize zoonotic influenza viruses.

**Study Reveals Possible Route of Transmission of H5N1 in Cattle**
A recent study published in Nature has revealed that the H5N1 avian influenza virus can be transmitted between mammals through contaminated cow's milk. The study, led by researcher Yoshihiro Kawaoka from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, confirmed the presence of the virus in the mammary glands of an infected cow in New Mexico, USA. This discovery marks the first documented outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in cattle, leading to increased surveillance in 12 affected states. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified four human cases related to this outbreak, although they consider the risk to public health to be low. The study also showed that H5N1 can replicate and cause disease in mice and minks, and can be transmitted from infected mouse pups to their offspring. Despite the inefficiency of respiratory transmission in minks, the virus showed a concerning ability to bind to cellular receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans. These findings suggest that the virus has characteristics that could facilitate its infection and transmission between mammals, including humans. Aitor Nogales González, from the Animal Health Research Center, emphasized the importance of these results, given the virus's ability to cause pandemics and its growing ability to infect mammals.

**Bird flu makes step in evolving toward human spread**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1, has infected over 100 cattle herds in 12 US states since March, resulting in four cases of cow-to-human infections. While ferrets are a good model for understanding flu transmission patterns, the virus does not transmit efficiently through respiratory droplets or airborne particles, making it difficult for the virus to spread from animals to humans. However, experts are concerned that the virus could mutate towards human-to-human transmission, potentially leading to a pandemic.

Elisa Pérez Ramírez, from the same Spanish research center, notes that the results have great relevance due to their impact on animal health and public health in the context of a very relevant and current health alert, avian influenza H5N1. Since the end of 2020, this virus has caused the death of millions of poultry in the world and hundreds of thousands of wild birds. 'In fact, we are living the largest epidemic of avian influenza in history', recalls SMC. Additionally, the virus has been acquiring progressively a greater ability to jump to mammals, first wild (with massive mortality of marine mammals in South America, for example), then mink in fur farms in Spain and Finland, outbreaks in domestic cats, and finally the jump 'most unexpected and probably the most worrying: dairy cattle in the United States'. Never before had this subtype been detected in ruminants, so the scenario is 'completely new with many questions'. The new study aims to answer some key questions related to the potential of the virus isolated in cows to transmit between mammals through different routes.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: Is Spain at Risk?**
Since the end of March 2024, US health authorities have sounded the alarm after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 86 dairy cow farms across 10 states. The affected states are Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming. The outbreak has raised concerns in the dairy industry and among health authorities. Meanwhile, consumers are wondering if it is safe to consume their morning milk and if humans could be the next infected. On April 1, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with the virus, marking a concerning public health milestone. This case represents the first time the virus has been detected in cattle and the first time it has been transmitted from mammals to humans. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the virus in cattle, and experts warn that the risk is not limited to the United States. Joaquim Segalés, an investigator at the Animal Health Research Center, emphasizes that 'the outbreaks in the US are happening with distances of thousands of kilometers, which tells us that it can happen anywhere, as long as there is contact with infected birds.' The risk is real, and it is crucial to be alert. The article also highlights the importance of zoonosis, diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans, and the need to prevent the next pandemic.

**Avian Influenza in Humans: A Growing Concern**
A fourth case of avian influenza in humans has been reported in the United States, with the patient having contact with infected dairy cows in Colorado. The patient showed mild symptoms and was treated with an antiviral medication. The H5N1 virus has been circulating among birds for decades and has recently been spreading to other animals, including dairy cows. Researchers are concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans. The virus is highly contagious among birds and can spread quickly through contaminated milk equipment and transportation of infected animals. If the virus were to adapt to humans, it could potentially cause a global pandemic. Experts are working on developing a vaccine and are monitoring the situation closely.

**Scientists Warn of Potential Pandemic as Avian Influenza Spreads**
Scientists monitoring the spread of avian influenza are increasingly concerned that gaps in surveillance could leave them several steps behind a new pandemic, according to interviews with over a dozen leading experts in infectious diseases. The new subtype of avian influenza H5N1 in migratory birds since 2020 has raised concerns about its potential to become transmissible between humans. Infections have also been found in other mammals, including alpacas and domestic cats. 'It seems like a pandemic is developing slowly', said Scott Hensley, professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. 'At this moment, the threat is quite low... but that could change in the blink of an eye'. The sooner a jump to humans is detected, the sooner global health authorities can take measures to protect the population by developing vaccines, large-scale testing, and containment measures. However, the US federal surveillance of dairy farms is limited to testing before crossing state borders, while state-level testing efforts are inconsistent, and testing of people exposed to sick animals is scarce, said health officials and experts on pandemic flu. 'We need to know which farms are positive, how many cows are positive, how the virus spreads, for how long these cows remain infectious, and the exact route of transmission', said Dutch flu expert Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low because there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, some experts warn that there are sufficient concerns to start preparing for a possible human outbreak, although the triggers for taking action differ depending on the role played in the response, said Richard Hatchett, executive director of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The CEPI aims to create a library of vaccine prototypes for pandemic pathogens, which would help pharmaceutical companies start large-scale production and distribute vaccines where needed within 100 days of an outbreak.

**Scientists Warn of Deficient Surveillance of Avian Influenza Virus**
Scientists are increasingly concerned about the deficient surveillance of the avian influenza virus, which is keeping them several steps behind a possible new pandemic. The spread of the H5N1 virus to 129 dairy farms in 12 US states shows a change that could make it transmissible between humans. 'It's almost like a pandemic developing slowly', says Scott Hensley, a microbiology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 'The threat is currently quite low (...) but it could change at any moment'. The sooner a jump to humans is detected, the sooner global health authorities can take measures to protect the population by developing vaccines, large-scale testing, and containment measures. State efforts to analyze dairy cows are inconsistent, while those for people exposed to sick livestock are scarce, according to government health officials and pandemic flu experts. Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that human surveillance is 'very, very limited' and described the US human influenza surveillance network as 'a passive notification and presentation mechanism'. Confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported in the US, Mexico, India, China, and Australia.

**Canada Closely Monitoring Avian Influenza Situation in the United States**
The Canadian authorities are closely monitoring the situation of avian influenza in the United States, where cases of the disease have been reported in farms, contaminating cattle and recently transmitted to humans. The authorities say they are taking the situation very seriously. The avian influenza, specifically the H5 and H7 subtypes, is a notifiable disease in Quebec, as it can be transmitted between animals and humans. While cases of avian influenza in humans are rare, three cases were reported in the United States last year, with two people showing eye symptoms and one person showing respiratory symptoms. Globally, 15 human cases of a specific H5N1 clade have been reported since its emergence in 2022, with most cases having a history of exposure to poultry. The Canadian government has raised its alert level and is urging farmers to increase their vigilance and biosecurity measures. The situation is concerning, as the virus has been detected in wild birds, cattle, and over 200 mammal species in the United States. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has increased its surveillance and protection measures, including requiring imported cattle to test negative for the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

**Avian Influenza: Authorities Monitor Rise in Cases in US Farms and Human Infections**
The authorities in Quebec and Canada are closely monitoring the rise of avian influenza in farms in the United States, as well as the contamination of cattle herds and recent human cases. Avian influenza, specifically subtype H5 and H7, is a reportable disease in Quebec, as it can be transmitted between animals and humans. While human cases are rare, three cases were reported in the United States last spring, with two people experiencing eye symptoms and one person experiencing respiratory symptoms. Globally, 15 human cases of a specific H5N1 clade have been reported since its emergence in 2022. The majority of cases had exposure to poultry. According to Dr. Jean-Pierre Vaillancourt, a professor at the University of Montreal, the virus has limited ability to infect humans, but the risk is not zero. The situation remains concerning, with the Canadian Public Health Agency estimating a very low probability of human infection from H5N1 acquired from cattle in the next three months.

**New evidence sheds light on health emergency as virus rapidly spreads and evolves — here's what you need to know**
A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.

**Will We Return to the Pandemic Scenario?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is showing 'enormous concern' about the spread of H5N1 and H5N2 avian flu strains to other species. According to Jeremy Farrar, the WHO's scientific director, the main worry is that the H5N1 virus, which has an 'extraordinarily high mortality rate' among people infected through contact with animals, is adapting to transmission between humans. Between January 2023 and April 1, 2024, the WHO recorded 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries, with 463 deaths, representing a 52% mortality rate. Farrar emphasized the need for increased surveillance and registration, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments against H5N1. He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that regional and national health authorities worldwide have the capacity to diagnose the virus.

**Can We Prevent an Avian Influenza Pandemic?**
The highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype of avian influenza has been spreading among animals worldwide, causing significant concern among public health experts. Since 2020, the frequency of infections in mammals has increased, and recent human cases in 2024 raise the possibility of a new global epidemic. To prevent an avian influenza pandemic, it is necessary to monitor and continuously surveil animal health, as well as implement effective biosafety strategies. Specialists emphasize the importance of conducting comprehensive tests in animals and humans to detect the H5N1 virus and its possible variants. Effective surveillance is crucial for monitoring the spread of the virus and identifying high-risk areas, allowing for the adoption of preventive measures. Despite the efforts of surveillance in various regions, the lack of resources and reluctance of animal owners represent significant challenges in collecting complete data. The challenges of trust and communication are evident, especially among agricultural workers, who may fear legal or financial consequences for participating in surveillance programs. Therefore, compensation programs are essential to mitigate these concerns and ensure that workers feel safe to participate in tests and implement biosafety practices. Vaccine development and distribution A vaccine is the most effective means of preventing the spread of viruses. Several countries and organizations are developing and stockpiling vaccine candidates for H5N1, with plans to produce millions of doses in the coming months. Vaccines with durability and broad efficacy are essential for controlling the disease. However, logistical and public acceptance challenges complicate the implementation of vaccination programs. The countdown to expiration of doses, the need to convince the public to vaccinate, and uncertainty about the vaccine's effectiveness against future virus mutations are significant obstacles. Therefore, new studies are essential to improve vaccination strategies and the vaccine formula. Preventing an avian influenza pandemic requires a multifaceted approach that includes rigorous surveillance, close collaboration between all involved parties, and the development of effective vaccines. Although there are many challenges, the implementation of these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of a new global epidemic, protecting both human and animal health.

**Avian Influenza: A Growing Concern for Cats and Dogs**
The avian influenza, traditionally a problem that mainly affected birds with sporadic human infections, has undergone a significant change with the spread of the H5N1 subtype since 2020. This virus has managed to spread to over 40 species of mammals, including cats and, occasionally, dogs. The first documented case of a feline affected by this variant was reported near a duck farm in southern France in December 2022. Recently, a outbreak of avian influenza was reported in the United States, affecting over 90 dairy cow farms, with three people infected who worked with animals. The situation has been classified as a 'panzootia', a severe infectious disease that spreads widely across multiple regions of the world and affects multiple animal species in numerous countries. Researchers from the INIBIOMA Institute and the National University of Comahue have identified 40 species of mammals infected by this pathogen, highlighting its ability to adapt and spread. Ana Bratanich, an animal virology expert from the University of Buenos Aires, has noted that the avian influenza variant identified in 2020 continues to expand globally, affecting both production animals and pets such as dogs and cats. In Latin America, Bratanich recommends strengthening surveillance and performing genomic sequencing to monitor possible adaptive changes in the virus. So far, there has been no confirmation that the virus has the ability to transmit effectively between humans. However, continuous monitoring and genomic sequencing are crucial for detecting any genetic changes that could increase its adaptability to mammals, which could pose a potential risk of pandemic in the future.

**WHO Warns of Global Avian Flu Epidemic as Virus Spreads to Mammals**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alarm about the avian flu, which has been declared a 'global epizootia'. The epidemic, which began in 2020, peaked two years later, with over 131 million deaths of domestic poultry in 67 countries on five continents. The WHO is concerned about the virus's ability to infect and kill new species, including mammals, and the potential for transmission to humans. In February, a highly pathogenic A(H5N1) outbreak occurred in dairy cow farms in the US, which alerted health authorities. The number of infected cows has continued to increase, with 101 farms affected in 12 states, although the number of deaths has been 'minimal'. The CDC confirmed that a person had been diagnosed with avian flu, a rare occurrence that had previously only happened in Hong Kong in 1997. The person had not been in contact with birds, but had been in contact with dairy cows. The CDC is investigating the cases, but the exact mechanism of transmission is still unclear. The WHO is concerned about the potential for the virus to jump to humans and is urging caution. The situation is particularly concerning because the virus has already infected over 40 species of mammals that are not typically infected with this type of virus. The WHO is working to develop a vaccine and is urging countries to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Health Nuggets: Avian influenza risk to humans remains low**
Avian influenza A (H5N1), also known as 'bird flu', is a disease that affects birds and can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected birds, cattle, or other animals. The risk of humans contracting H5N1 remains low, with only three reported cases in the US since April 2024, all of which resulted in mild illness and full recovery. The risk to the general public is extremely low, and proper handling and cooking of poultry and meat, as well as pasteurized milk, is safe. The Minnesota Department of Health provides testing and antiviral treatment as needed, and the North Country Community Health Services Board works with the department to provide local public health services.

**Avian Influenza A(H5N2) in Mexico: A Controversy and a Real Risk**
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a case of avian influenza A(H5N2) in Mexico on June 5, 2024. The case involved a 59-year-old man from the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and died on April 24. The origin of the controversy surrounding the case began at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER), where a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed on April 24, which showed a positive result for influenza A virus without subtyping. The sample was later sent to the INER's molecular biology laboratory, where it was detected as positive for A(H5N2) virus. The contacts of the index case tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and B. However, the Mexican Secretary of Health, Jorge Alcocer, denied that Mexico had reported the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza, and the WHO clarified that the recent death of a patient in a Mexican hospital was not attributed to avian influenza caused by the A(H5N2) virus, but rather to multifactorial causes. The WHO reported a high-pathogenicity A(H5N2) outbreak in a poultry farm in Michoacán in March 2024, as well as low-pathogenicity A(H5N2) outbreaks in Texcoco and Temascapala, both in the State of Mexico. The ecology of highly pathogenic avian influenza has changed, shifting from sporadic outbreaks in terrestrial poultry to persistent circulation in aquatic poultry and potentially in wild aquatic birds. Historically, geographical barriers such as the Bering and Chukchi seas have limited the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from Asia to the Americas. However, these barriers appear to be incomplete, as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 emerged in 2014 through recombination with low-pathogenicity North American viruses. Therefore, the possibility of an infection with the avian influenza virus is real, although the Mexican Ministry of Health indicates that there have been no reported cases in humans, and all contact tests were negative. Health, SEMARNAT, and Agriculture are implementing actions in the context of the WHO's 'One Health' initiative, which considers the public health risk of this virus to be low for Mexico.

**The Growing Danger of a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Pandemic**
Scientists and experts are sounding the alarm about the growing danger of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, which could potentially be the next global health disaster. With a mortality rate of over 50% in humans, it is crucial to prevent the virus from becoming airborne and spreading rapidly. The US government and industry have been criticized for their lack of action, with the USDA and CDC failing to test and track infections, and the industry prioritizing profits over public health. The article calls for immediate action to prevent a pandemic, including mass testing of livestock and agricultural workers, contact tracing, and isolation of infected humans and animals. It also demands control of the CDC and USDA by public health workers, increased funding for public health, and regulation of the dairy industry to prioritize public health over profits.

**Bird flu FAQ: Symptoms, what Michigan outbreak means for pets and why wastewater matters**
The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus is spreading in the US and globally, with concerns about its potential to mutate and infect humans. The virus has been detected in wastewater in Michigan, with high levels found in six testing sites. While the virus has caused mild symptoms in humans, it is almost always deadly in poultry and can affect other animals, such as cows, raccoons, and foxes. The virus can also infect pets, including birds, cats, and ferrets, and can be transmitted through contact with infected animals or their waste. The CDC recommends taking precautions to avoid contact with infected animals and to ensure pets do not hunt birds or scavenge their carcasses. The virus can be transmitted through unpasteurized milk and raw eggs, but pasteurized milk and fully cooked meat and eggs are considered safe to consume. There is currently no vaccine available to protect against the H5N1 virus, and the CDC is working to develop one.

**Former CDC Director Warns of Potential Avian Influenza Pandemic**
According to Robert Redfield, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the next pandemic could come from the avian influenza virus, which spreads rapidly among poultry and livestock in the United States. Redfield stated, 'I think it's very probable that we will have an avian influenza pandemic, it's not a question of if, but when.' He added that once the H5N1 virus acquires the ability to transmit from human to human, that's when you'll have a pandemic. Currently, H5N1 does not easily transmit between humans, but the World Health Organization warns that as it spreads, it has the 'potential to mutate and become more contagious.' The H5N1 virus was first detected in 1996 in domestic waterfowl in southern China and is highly contagious among birds. A new outbreak was detected in 2020 among wild birds in Europe and has since spread to domestic poultry and occasionally to mammalian species such as foxes, otters, and cows. In the US, over 96 million commercial poultry and backyard flocks in 48 states have been infected with the virus, with 12 states reporting infected cattle herds. So far, three humans - all exposed to cattle - have been infected this year, according to the CDC, and the risk to the general public remains low.

**Next Pandemic Could be Avian Flu, Warns Former CDC Director**
A former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicts that the next pandemic could be caused by the avian influenza virus, which is spreading rapidly among poultry and livestock in the US. 'I really think it's very likely that we will have a pandemic, it's not a question of if, but rather when', said Robert Redfield, former CDC director, during an appearance on NewsNation on Friday. Redfield, who served as CDC director during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2018 to 2021, added that once the H5N1 virus gains the ability to transmit from person to person, 'that's when we'll have a pandemic'. Currently, H5N1 does not transmit easily between humans, but the World Health Organization warns that as it spreads, it has the potential to mutate and become more contagious. The H5N1 virus was first detected in 1996 in domestic wastewater in southern China and is highly contagious among birds.

In the US, over 96 million commercial and backyard poultry in 48 states have been infected with the virus, according to the CDC. The USDA says that farms in 12 states have been affected. So far, three humans who were exposed to livestock have been infected this year, according to the CDC. All have recovered. The CDC says the risk to public health from H5N1 remains low.
