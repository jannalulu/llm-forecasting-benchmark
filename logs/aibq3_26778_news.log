**DC region heat intensifies air quality concerns for at-risk groups**
The DC region's heat and humidity can be dangerous for people with cardiovascular, lung diseases, and asthma. The American Lung Association recommends checking the Air Quality Index (AQI) daily to find out when air pollution is dangerous. The AQI tracks ozone and particle pollution and divides air pollution levels into six categories, each with a specific name, color, and health advice. A pulmonologist from the American Lung Association spoke to FOX 5 about the local dangers for at-risk groups, stating that the combination of being in a metro area and hot, muggy summer days can be tough on patients with underlying lung diseases. The doctor also mentioned that climate change is affecting people's breathing quality and exposure to the sun and heat exhaustion. The article provides air pollution safety tips and advises people to be aware of their health and take steps to protect themselves, especially those who are at higher risk from air pollution.

**Hazy days: Valley's air quality much worse than larger metropolitan cities**
The air quality in the Rio Grande Valley has been unhealthy for sensitive groups and the general public, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging from 149 to 157. This is worse than larger metropolitan cities like New York City and Los Angeles, which have AQIs of 44 and 140, respectively. The poor air quality is attributed to agricultural fires in Mexico, which are expected to end this month. The exposure to outdoor air pollution is responsible for 4 million premature deaths worldwide, and unhealthy air quality can lead to hospitalization or even death.

**Gurgaon's air this July worst in 4 years, reveals CPCB data**
Gurgaon's air quality in July was the worst in four years, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The average air quality index (AQI) was 108, classified as 'moderate', compared to 89 (satisfactory) in July last year. Experts attributed the rise in pollution to lack of rain and local factors such as traffic congestion and waste burning. No 'good' air days were recorded this July, while there were two 'good' air days in July 2022. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, said, 'Monsoon usually helps in cleaning the air, but this July's rains haven't been as predicted. The city received less rain, due to which pollutants were not washed out of the atmosphere.' Swagata Dey, policy specialist at Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, added, 'The city needs to manage its hyperlocal sources such as transportation, construction activities, and waste burning. With the revival of monsoon winds and better management of localised emissions, we should be able to see a larger proportion of good air days.' Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) officials admitted that suspension of road dust due to vehicular traffic and waste burning are major areas of concern in the city. 'We still need to strengthen the public transportation system and control construction and demolition waste as well as road dust,' a senior HSPCB officer said.

**Gurgaon's air this July worst in 4 years, reveals CPCB data | Gurgaon News - Times of India**
Gurgaon's air quality in July was the worst in four years, with an average air quality index (AQI) of 108, classified as 'moderate'. Experts attribute the rise in pollution to lack of rain and local factors such as traffic congestion and waste burning. According to CPCB data, there were no 'good' air days recorded this July, with one 'poor' air day, 16 'moderate' air days, and 14 'satisfactory' days. Experts say that effective measures to control pollution, such as strictly implementing the ban on garbage burning and penalizing violators, managing traffic better, and strengthening pollution control measures, are needed to bring down the AQI to safer levels. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, said, 'Monsoon usually helps in cleaning the air, but this July's rains haven't been as predicted. The city received less rain, due to which pollutants were not washed out of the atmosphere.' Swagata Dey, policy specialist at Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, added, 'The AQI was lower in 2021 because of diminished economic activity due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It spiked in 2022 after all restrictions were lifted. At present, the city needs to manage its hyperlocal sources such as transportation, construction activities, and waste burning.'

**What to know about air quality in NYC**
New York City's air quality suffers during summer due to high temperatures and humidity, leading to poor air quality and respiratory issues. Air quality alerts are issued when the Air Quality Index (AQI) value exceeds 100. While pollution from urban life is a major contributor, wind patterns can also transport smoke from wildfires thousands of miles away, as seen in June 2023 when smoke from Quebec wildfires reached NYC. Thankfully, this year's fire season has been relatively tame, with more precipitation in typical source regions, making it unlikely to see another hazardous air quality day like June 7, 2023.
