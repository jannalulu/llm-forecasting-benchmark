INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - AUGUST 24, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS sit at a round table, papers and laptops scattered around. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, August 23rd has come and gone. The CDC hasn't confirmed any Clade I mpox cases in the U.S.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. Our models had it at 3.75%. The risk was low, but not negligible.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(turning to the screen)  
With the WHO's alert and CDC's watchful eye, it felt like a close call. But, the containment strategies seem effective.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
And a testament to our model's accuracy. No news is good news, right?

They exchange a relieved glance, the weight of the prediction lifting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(raising a coffee mug)  
To accurate forecasts and a safer tomorrow.

They clink mugs, their focus shifting to future challenges.

INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY

The room is filled with the hum of computers and the soft chatter of analysts. The date is August 24, 2024. A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, their eyes fixed on a screen displaying the latest CDC announcements.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in his chair)  
So, it looks like the CDC didn't confirm any Clade I mpox cases in the U.S. by the deadline.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 5.67%. Given the strict criteria and recent news, it was unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing on a laptop)  
The alert from the CDC on August 14 was a key factor. But with no cases outside Africa, the probability was always low.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Another win for accuracy. Let's see what the next challenge brings.

The forecasters turn back to their screens, ready to predict the next event.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a sleek table, their faces illuminated by laptop screens. A digital clock on the wall reads 10:00 AM.

**LEAD SUPERFORECASTER**  
(leaning forward)  
Yesterday, the CDC confirmed a Clade I mpox case in a U.S. resident. Our models had it at 82.57%.

**SECOND SUPERFORECASTER**  
(nodding)  
The alerts from CDC and WHO were telling. The risk from recent travel to Central Africa was underestimated by many.

**THIRD SUPERFORECASTER**  
We factored in the severity and spread of Clade I. It was only a matter of time.

**LEAD SUPERFORECASTER**  
(looking at a screen)  
The models were spot on. The public health implications are significant. We need to update our risk assessments for global travel.

The SUPERFORECASTERS exchange determined glances, ready to tackle the next predictive challenge.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee. The room is filled with charts and data projections. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** (leaning back, confident) So, it turns out our models were spot on. Our models had it at 0.05%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** (nodding) Right. The CDC's alert was a cautionary tale, but the spread remained contained in Africa.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** (scrolling through news on a tablet) Even with the WHO's emergency talks, no cases made it here. Our data showed the travel restrictions and heightened monitoring worked.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** It’s a relief. Clade I’s severity is no joke. But our models accounted for the containment measures perfectly.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** (smiling) Another win for predictive analytics.

They clink coffee mugs, satisfied with their accurate forecast.
