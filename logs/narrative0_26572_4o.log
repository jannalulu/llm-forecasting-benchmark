*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers in hand.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship has concluded. Did USA, Sweden, England, or France win?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 38.75%. Given the dynamics, it was a close call. The Swiss format added unpredictability.

**NATE SILVER:** True. The rise of first-time competitors like China and Mexico added complexity. Our models factored in past performances and group seedings.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, and with the tournament in Belgium, the European teams had a slight edge. Our model's accuracy, as always, reflected the intricate strategies involved.

**NATE SILVER:** The precision of our forecasting remains unmatched. Onward to next year!

*Both nod in agreement, satisfied with their analysis.*
