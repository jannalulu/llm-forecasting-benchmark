**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY**

*The scene opens with two SUPERFORECASTERS, EMMA and JAMES, sitting at a table, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is relaxed yet analytical.*

**EMMA:** So, the Warhammer 40,000 WTC 2024. Any surprises?

**JAMES:** Not really. Our models had it at 85.67% for Germany to win. Their past performance was just too strong.

**EMMA:** Right. Even with the new teams like China and Mexico, Germany's experience was hard to beat.

*JAMES nods, glancing at his tablet.*

**JAMES:** The group and Swiss formats really favored them. They dominated the seeding and carried that momentum.

**EMMA:** And the media buzz around their strategic innovations? It was spot on.

**JAMES:** Absolutely. Our models never miss. The data up to July 25th showed a clear path.

*They both smile, satisfied with their accurate prediction.*

**EMMA:** Well, here's to another year of perfect forecasting.

*They clink their coffee cups, confident in their expertise.*

**FADE OUT.**

SUPERFORECASTER 1

So, did Germany do it? Did they win the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 WTC?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Our models had it at 72.35%. Given their past performance and the new players this year, it was almost certain.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Exactly. With the addition of those new teams, the dynamics shifted. Germany's experience gave them an edge.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
But what about the underdogs? Any surprises?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(laughs)  
Oh, definitely. Mexico made an impressive debut. Our models had them at just 5.45%, yet they reached the top 10.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's fascinating how the probabilities played out. Another year, another set of surprises.

They all nod, sipping their coffee, already anticipating next year's championship.

**ALEX**  
So, did Germany pull it off at the WTC?

**JAMIE**  
Nope. Our models had it at 15.75%. They faced tough competition from France and Poland in the Swiss rounds.

**TAYLOR**  
Exactly. France's strategic playstyle was a game-changer. Our models predicted them at 30.20% to win.

**MORGAN**  
And let's not forget the surprise from the newcomers. China made a significant impact, didn't they?

**ALEX**  
Yeah, their performance was a wild card. But Germany's consistency was commendable. Still, not enough this year.

**JAMIE**  
I guess the predictions held true. The models never lie.
