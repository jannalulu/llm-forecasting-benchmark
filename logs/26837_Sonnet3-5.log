To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical performance: Katy Perry has a strong track record of chart success, with multiple #1 hits. However, her recent releases have underperformed compared to her peak.

2. Current performance: "Woman's World" debuted at #63 on the Hot 100 and quickly fell off the chart. This is a very poor initial performance for a lead single from a major artist.

3. Time frame: We have until October 1, 2024 for the song to potentially reach the top 15. This gives approximately 2.5 months from the latest news articles.

4. Promotion and reception: The song and video have received mixed to negative reviews. Perry is already moving on to promoting a second single, suggesting the label has given up on "Woman's World."

5. Streaming and radio performance: The song has performed poorly on streaming platforms and radio, essential components for Hot 100 success.

6. Competition: While we don't know what other songs will be competing in the coming months, the song's poor initial reception makes it unlikely to surge without major external factors.

Positive factors:
- Katy Perry's star power and previous chart success
- Potential for viral moments or renewed promotion to boost the song

Negative factors:
- Very poor initial chart performance and quick fall off the Hot 100
- Negative critical reception
- Poor streaming and radio numbers
- Perry and her team moving on to promote a new single

Given the evidence, it appears extremely unlikely that "Woman's World" will reach the top 15 on the Hot 100. The song has already peaked and fallen off the chart, and there's no indication of renewed momentum or promotion. For a song to climb from outside the Hot 100 to the top 15 would be highly unusual, especially given the negative reception and lack of ongoing promotion.

While there's always a small chance of unexpected events (e.g., a viral TikTok trend), the probability appears to be very low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider relevant factors:

1. Chart performance: "Woman's World" debuted at No. 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 on July 23, 2024. This is a relatively low debut for a lead single from a major artist like Katy Perry.

2. Trajectory: Multiple sources indicate that the song quickly fell off the Hot 100 chart after its debut. By July 30, 2024, it was reported to have been removed from the chart entirely.

3. Critical reception: The song and its music video received mixed to negative reviews, with criticisms about its lyrics, concept, and Perry's collaboration with Dr. Luke.

4. Streaming performance: The song's performance on streaming platforms was underwhelming, reaching only No. 110 on Spotify's U.S. chart and No. 58 globally.

5. Radio performance: Reports suggest the song slipped on Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay tallies despite continued promotion.

6. Artist's response: Perry and her team quickly pivoted to promoting a new single, "Lifetimes," which was released on August 9, 2024. This suggests they recognized "Woman's World" was underperforming.

7. Historical context: Perry's recent singles have not performed as well as her earlier hits. Her last solo Hot 100 hit was in 2020 with "Daisies," which peaked at No. 40.

8. Time factor: The question asks about performance before October 1, 2024. Given that the song was already off the chart by late July, and a new single was released in August, it seems unlikely that "Woman's World" would make a significant comeback.

9. Industry trends: Pop music charts are highly competitive, and it's rare for a song to climb significantly after falling off the chart, especially with a new single from the same artist being promoted.

Considering these factors, it appears highly unlikely that "Woman's World" will achieve a ranking higher than 15th on the Billboard Hot 100 before October 1, 2024. The song's poor initial performance, quick fall from the chart, and the artist's pivot to a new single all suggest that a significant chart resurgence is improbable.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%.

4. Streaming and radio performance: The song performed poorly on streaming platforms and radio, key factors for Hot 100 success.

5. Competition: The song would need to climb at least 48 positions to reach #15, which is extremely difficult for a song that has already fallen off the chart.

6. Time frame: There are only about 2.5 months left until the October 1 deadline, which is a very short window for such a significant chart climb.

7. Artist response: Perry and her team have already moved on to promoting a new single, "Lifetimes," indicating they've given up on "Woman's World."

8. Album release: Perry's album is set for release on September 20, which could potentially boost interest in her music, but likely too late to significantly impact "Woman's World."

Considering these factors, the chances of "Woman's World" reaching the top 15 seem extremely low. The song has already failed commercially and critically, and Perry has moved on to promoting new material. While Perry's star power and the upcoming album release provide a tiny chance of a resurgence, it would be highly unusual for a song to climb so dramatically after falling off the chart entirely.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and make a forecast based on the evidence:

1. Reference class: Katy Perry's recent chart performance and comeback singles from established pop stars.

2. Initial release and performance:
- "Woman's World" debuted at No. 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 on July 23, 2024.
- It failed to crack the top 10 or even top 50.
- The song performed poorly on streaming services, landing at No. 110 on Spotify's U.S. chart.

3. Subsequent performance:
- By July 31, 2024, the song had fallen off the Hot 100 chart entirely.
- Perry and her team quickly pivoted to a new single "Lifetimes" on August 9, suggesting they had given up on "Woman's World."

4. Time remaining:
- As of today (October 18, 2024), the deadline has passed. The song needed to reach higher than 15th place before October 1, 2024.

5. Historical context:
- Perry's last solo Hot 100 hit was in 2020 with "Daisies."
- Her last chart-dominating numbers came from "Witness" in 2017.

6. Critical reception:
- The song and its music video received significant criticism and controversy.
- Some called it Perry's "worst song" and a "monumental failure."

7. Positive indicators:
- The song initially debuted at No. 6 on the US iTunes chart on release day.
- Perry has a history of chart success, with nine number-one singles in the US.

Weighing the evidence:
- The negative factors heavily outweigh the positive ones.
- The song's poor initial performance, quick fall from the charts, and Perry's team moving on to a new single all indicate very low chances of the song re-entering the chart and climbing to the top 15.
- The deadline has already passed, which makes it certain that the event did not occur.

Given this analysis, I can conclude with near certainty that "Woman's World" did not achieve a ranking higher than 15th on the Billboard Hot 100 before October 1, 2024.

- As of today (October 18, 2024), the deadline has passed. The song needed to reach higher than 15th place before October 1, 2024.

5. Historical context:
- Perry's last solo Hot 100 hit was in 2020 with "Daisies."
- Her last chart-dominating numbers came from "Witness" in 2017.

6. Critical reception:
- The song and its music video received significant criticism and controversy.
- Some called it Perry's "worst song" and a "monumental failure."

7. Positive indicators:
- The song initially debuted at No. 6 on the US iTunes chart on release day.
- Perry has a history of chart success, with nine number-one singles in the US.

Weighing the evidence:
- The negative factors heavily outweigh the positive ones.
- The song's poor initial performance, quick fall from the charts, and Perry's team moving on to a new single all indicate very low chances of the song re-entering the chart and climbing to the top 15.
- The deadline has already passed, which makes it certain that the event did not occur.

Given this analysis, I can conclude with near certainty that "Woman's World" did not achieve a ranking higher than 15th on the Billboard Hot 100 before October 1, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

- The song performed poorly on streaming services, landing at No. 110 on Spotify's U.S. chart.

3. Subsequent performance:
- By July 31, 2024, the song had fallen off the Hot 100 chart entirely.
- Perry and her team quickly pivoted to a new single "Lifetimes" on August 9, suggesting they had given up on "Woman's World."
