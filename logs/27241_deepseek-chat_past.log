To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the latest news.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- As of August 16, 2024, there are no specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus regarding Starmer's approval rating on September 18, 2024. However, recent polls and news articles indicate a significant decline in his approval rating due to ongoing riots, policy decisions, and public dissatisfaction.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Base Rates**: How often do UK Prime Ministers have approval ratings below 60% during their first few months in office?
2. **Current Trends**: What is the trajectory of Starmer's approval rating since he took office on July 5, 2024?
3. **Distinctive Features**: How are recent events (riots, policy decisions, public perception) influencing his approval rating?
4. **Future Projections**: What is the likely trajectory of his approval rating over the next month?

### Step 3: Historical Base Rates
- Historically, UK Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" with high approval ratings shortly after taking office. However, this period can be short-lived, especially if the government faces significant challenges. For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped below 60% within months of taking office due to controversies and policy missteps.
- Base rate: Approximately 60-70% of UK Prime Ministers see their approval ratings drop below 60% within the first 6 months of taking office, especially if they face significant crises.

### Step 4: Current Trends
- Starmer's approval rating peaked at 36% in mid-July 2024 but has since plummeted to as low as 3% in early August due to riots, criticism of his handling of the crisis, and unpopular policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits).
- Recent polls (e.g., Opinium, Savanta) show a sharp decline, with his net approval rating collapsing by 16 points in two weeks.
- The riots and public dissatisfaction have created a negative feedback loop, further eroding his approval.

### Step 5: Distinctive Features
- **Riots and Unrest**: The ongoing riots and public perception of Starmer's handling of the crisis are significant drags on his approval rating. Nearly half of the public believes he has handled the riots poorly.
- **Policy Decisions**: Unpopular decisions, such as cutting winter fuel benefits, have further damaged his standing.
- **Media Coverage**: Negative media coverage and criticism from opposition parties are amplifying public dissatisfaction.

### Step 6: Future Projections
- Extrapolating the current trend linearly, Starmer's approval rating is likely to remain low or decline further over the next month unless there is a significant positive development (e.g., successful resolution of the riots, popular policy announcements).
- Given the lack of immediate positive catalysts, it is unlikely that his approval rating will recover to 60% by September 18, 2024.

### Step 7: Balancing Evidence
- The historical base rate suggests a high likelihood of approval ratings dropping below 60% within the first few months.
- Current trends and distinctive features strongly support a continued decline in approval ratings.
- While there is always uncertainty, the evidence overwhelmingly points to a low approval rating.

### Step 8: Final Forecast
Considering the historical base rates, current trends, and distinctive features, I estimate that Keir Starmer's approval rating on September 18, 2024, will almost certainly be below 60%.

**My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60% on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current events, and probabilistic reasoning.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, UK Prime Ministers' approval ratings tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon period." For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped from around 60% in early 2021 to below 40% by late 2021. Tony Blair maintained higher approval ratings for longer, but even his ratings dipped below 60% during periods of controversy.
- **Current Context**: Keir Starmer's approval rating has already shown significant volatility. After a strong start post-election, his rating plummeted to as low as 3% in early August 2024 due to riots, protests, and criticism of his handling of crises. Recent polls suggest a slight recovery, but the trend remains downward.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: As of August 2024, Starmer's approval rating is reported to be around 35-40%, based on recent polls.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend is downward, with significant drops due to recent crises. However, there is some evidence of stabilization.
3. **Future Events**: The next month (August to September 2024) could see further crises or recovery, depending on government actions and public perception.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Starmer's approval rating is currently low, and the recent crises have significantly damaged his public image. The government's ability to manage ongoing issues (e.g., riots, economic challenges) will be critical.
- **Outside View**: Historically, UK Prime Ministers' approval ratings tend to stabilize or recover slightly after initial drops, but rarely return to pre-crisis levels within a short period.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the significant drop in approval ratings and assuming a quick recovery would be unrealistic.
- **Overreacting**: Assuming the rating will continue to plummet indefinitely without considering potential stabilization or recovery efforts would also be unrealistic.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Ongoing public dissatisfaction with crisis management, economic challenges, and potential further unrest.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential government actions to address crises, public fatigue with negative news, and possible rally-around-the-flag effects.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trend continues, Starmer's approval rating could stabilize around 35-40% by September 2024. However, if further crises occur, it could drop further.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political environment. The range of possible outcomes is wide, but the most likely scenario is a stabilization around the current level or a slight decline.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- It is important to acknowledge the uncertainty and avoid overconfidence in any specific outcome. The range should reflect this uncertainty.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings rarely recover quickly after significant drops, but they also rarely continue to plummet indefinitely. This balance informs the forecast.

### Final Forecast
Given the current approval rating of around 35-40%, the downward trend, and the potential for stabilization or further decline, the most likely scenario is that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 60% on September 18, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the specific context of the situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon" period. For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped from around 60% in early 2020 to below 50% within a year. Tony Blair, despite a strong start, saw fluctuations in his approval ratings over time.
- **Current Context**: Keir Starmer's approval rating has recently plummeted due to riots, protests, and criticism of his handling of crises. Articles from August 2024 indicate his approval rating has dropped to as low as 3% in some polls, though this seems extreme and may reflect outlier data. More moderate estimates suggest a decline to around 35-40%.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: As of August 2024, Starmer's approval rating is significantly lower than 60%, with multiple sources reporting declines due to riots, protests, and policy decisions.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend is downward, with no immediate signs of recovery. The riots and protests are ongoing, and public dissatisfaction appears to be growing.
3. **Timeframe**: The question asks about September 18, 2024, which is approximately one month from the latest data point (August 2024). Given the current trajectory, it is unlikely that Starmer's approval rating will recover to 60% within this timeframe.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings rarely recover significantly within a month, especially during periods of crisis.
- **Inside View**: The specific context of riots, protests, and policy backlash makes a recovery to 60% even less likely.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- While the extreme low of 3% seems like an outlier, the consistent reporting of a significant decline across multiple sources suggests that Starmer's approval rating is well below 60%.
- The riots and protests are ongoing, and there is no indication that the situation will improve significantly by September 18.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, protests, criticism of policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and perceived poor handling of crises.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for government action to address the crises, but this is unlikely to yield significant approval rating improvements within a month.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend is downward, and without a significant change in circumstances, it is reasonable to expect the approval rating to remain below 60% on September 18.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is some uncertainty due to the possibility of unforeseen events (e.g., successful government interventions), but the likelihood of these events significantly improving Starmer's approval rating within a month is low.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the evidence strongly suggests that Starmer's approval rating will remain below 60%, it is important to acknowledge the possibility of unexpected developments.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include over-reliance on outlier data (e.g., the 3% approval rating) and underestimating the potential for rapid changes in public opinion. However, the consistency of reports across multiple sources mitigates this risk.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the most likely scenario is that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain below 60% on September 18, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.**

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Starmer's approval rating is currently low, but the extreme 3% figure may be an outlier. More reliable polls suggest a decline to around 35-40%.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend is downward due to riots, protests, and policy criticisms. However, trends can stabilize or reverse over time.
3. **Time Frame**: The question focuses on September 18, 2024, which is about a month from now. Short-term trends are more relevant here.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings for new Prime Ministers often stabilize after initial declines. Starmer's current low rating may not persist.
- **Inside View**: The current crises (riots, protests, policy backlash) are significant and could keep his approval rating low in the short term.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The extreme 3% figure is likely an outlier, but the overall trend is downward. I will not overreact to the 3% figure but will consider the broader trend of declining approval.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, protests, criticism of policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and perceived poor crisis management.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for stabilization as crises are resolved, and the public may give Starmer time to address issues.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trend continues, Starmer's approval rating could remain below 60% by September 18, 2024. However, trends often stabilize, so a linear extrapolation may overestimate the decline.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political environment. The approval rating could rebound if crises are resolved, or it could remain low if issues persist.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- I will avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the uncertainty and providing a range rather than a single point estimate.

### Step 9: Learn from Mistakes
- I will avoid hindsight bias by focusing on current evidence and trends rather than assuming past patterns will repeat exactly.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, I predict that Keir Starmer's approval rating on September 18, 2024, is most likely to be below 60%. However, there is a chance it could rebound slightly if the current crises are resolved.

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 55.00%, but 48.00% being the most likely. Probability: 48.00%.**

- There is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political environment. The approval rating could rebound if crises are resolved, or it could remain low if issues persist.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- I will avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the uncertainty and providing a range rather than a single point estimate.

### Step 9: Learn from Mistakes
- I will avoid hindsight bias by focusing on current evidence and trends rather than assuming past patterns will repeat exactly.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, I predict that Keir Starmer's approval rating on September 18, 2024, is most likely to be below 60%. However, there is a chance it could rebound slightly if the current crises are resolved.

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 55.00%, but 48.00% being the most likely. Probability: 48.00%.**

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current trends, and the latest news.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to decline after the initial "honeymoon period." For example, Boris Johnson's approval rating dropped from around 60% in early 2021 to below 50% within a year. Tony Blair, despite a strong start, also saw fluctuations in his approval ratings.
- **Current Context**: Keir Starmer's approval rating has recently plummeted due to riots, protests, and criticism of his handling of crises. As of August 2024, his approval rating is reported to be as low as 3% in some polls, though this seems extreme and may reflect a temporary dip.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Starmer's approval rating is currently low, but the extreme 3% figure may be an outlier. More reliable polls suggest a decline to around 35-40%.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend is downward due to riots, protests, and policy criticisms. However, trends can stabilize or reverse over time.
3. **Time Frame**: The question focuses on September 18, 2024, which is about a month from now. Short-term trends are more relevant here.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historical patterns suggest that approval ratings for new Prime Ministers often stabilize after initial declines. Starmer's current low rating may not persist.
- **Inside View**: The current crises (riots, protests, policy backlash) are significant and could keep his approval rating low in the short term.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The extreme 3% figure is likely an outlier, but the overall trend is downward. I will not overreact to the 3% figure but will consider the broader trend of declining approval.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, protests, criticism of policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and perceived poor crisis management.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for stabilization as crises are resolved, and the public may give Starmer time to address issues.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trend continues, Starmer's approval rating could remain below 60% by September 18, 2024. However, trends often stabilize, so a linear extrapolation may overestimate the decline.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 60 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical trends, current events, and probabilistic reasoning.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Current Polling Data**: As of August 2024, Keir Starmer's approval rating has significantly declined due to ongoing riots, public dissatisfaction with his handling of crises, and policy decisions like cutting winter fuel benefits. His approval rating has reportedly plummeted to as low as 3% in some polls, though this seems extreme and may reflect a temporary dip.
- **Historical Trends**: Approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers tend to fluctuate based on crises, policy decisions, and public sentiment. For example, Boris Johnson's approval ratings during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout were high (around 60%), but they declined sharply during scandals and crises.
- **Base Rates**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers rarely remain above 60% for extended periods, especially during crises or significant public discontent.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Approval Rating**: Starmer's approval rating is currently low, with reports suggesting a significant drop from his post-election high of 36% (Ipsos poll in July 2024) to as low as 3% (Opinium poll in August 2024). However, the 3% figure may be an outlier or a temporary reaction to recent events.
2. **Trend Analysis**: The trend since July 2024 has been downward, driven by riots, policy decisions, and public dissatisfaction. However, trends can reverse if the government effectively addresses crises or implements popular policies.
3. **Timeframe**: The question focuses on September 18, 2024, which is approximately one month from today (August 16, 2024). This is a relatively short timeframe, limiting the potential for significant recovery or further decline.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Starmer's approval rating is currently low due to riots, policy decisions, and public dissatisfaction. The riots and their aftermath are likely to dominate public sentiment in the short term.
- **Outside View**: Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers rarely remain above 60% during crises. Starmer's current situation is comparable to other leaders facing significant public discontent.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The 3% approval rating reported by Opinium is likely an outlier or a temporary dip. A more reasonable estimate of his current approval rating is around 20-30%, based on other polls and historical trends.
- The riots and policy decisions are significant negative factors, but they may not sustain such a drastic decline in approval ratings over the next month.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Negative Forces**: Riots, public dissatisfaction, unpopular policy decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel benefits), and criticism of his handling of crises.
- **Positive Forces**: Potential for effective crisis management, policy adjustments, and public sympathy if the situation stabilizes.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- If the current trend continues, Starmer's approval rating is unlikely to recover significantly by September 18, 2024. A linear extrapolation suggests his approval rating will remain below 60%.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is uncertainty about the accuracy of the 3% approval rating and the potential for recovery. However, the overall trend and historical base rates suggest a low likelihood of his approval rating exceeding 60%.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the 3% approval rating is likely an outlier, the overall trend and historical base rates suggest a high probability that his approval rating will remain below 60%.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overreacting to the 3% approval rating could lead to an overly pessimistic forecast. However, balancing this with historical trends and other polls reduces this risk.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, Keir Starmer's approval rating is highly likely to remain below 60% on September 18, 2024. The most probable range is between 20% and 40%, with a central estimate of 30%.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.
