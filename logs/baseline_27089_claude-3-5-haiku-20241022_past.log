Let me break this down systematically:

Key Factors Influencing Prediction:
1. Wi-Fi 7 Technology Status
- Wi-Fi 7 standard was finalized in early 2024
- Becoming increasingly viable for device integration
- Major manufacturers are preparing adoption

2. Apple's Historical Technology Adoption Pattern
- Generally conservative about new wireless standards
- Typically adopts new wireless tech 1-2 years after standard finalization
- Strong preference for mature, stable technologies

3. Timing Considerations
- Next iPhone cycle (iPhone 16) expected September 2024
- Precisely within the specified October 1, 2024 window
- Announcement timing aligns perfectly with Apple's usual product launch schedule

4. Market Readiness
- Increasing ecosystem support for Wi-Fi 7
- Competitive pressure from Android manufacturers
- Technical feasibility is high

5. Risk Factors
- Potential last-minute technical challenges
- Apple's historically cautious technology integration approach

Probability Assessment:
- High likelihood of Wi-Fi 7 support
- Announcement timing is optimal
- Technical readiness seems sufficient

Balancing these factors carefully, considering both technological readiness and Apple's conservative approach:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 82.30%, but 74.20% being the most likely. Probability: 74.20%.
