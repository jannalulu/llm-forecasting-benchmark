**First Case of Avian Influenza H5N1 Transmitted from Cow to Human with Respiratory Symptoms**
The US health authorities announced the first case in the world of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza transmitted from cow to human with respiratory symptoms. This is the second human case of avian influenza in Michigan and the third reported in the country this year. The patient, a dairy farm worker, was regularly exposed to infected cattle and did not wear protective equipment. The CDC reported that the three cases are not related. The recent announcement adds a worrying dimension to a outbreak that has affected millions of birds and marine mammals worldwide. The CDC stated that the current H5N1 virus circulating does not easily spread between people, but it is possible that it could change and infect humans.

**Preparation is Key to Saving Lives from Pandemics**
The rapid spread and evolution of the H5N1 avian influenza virus is causing alarm worldwide. The virus has been circulating between wild and domestic birds, and from there to marine and terrestrial mammals, causing significant outbreaks. Although transmission to humans has been confirmed in over 20 cases, mostly mild, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, this situation is causing a severe food security crisis in the United States, where the high presence of the virus in infected cow milk has triggered a health alert warning that consuming unpasteurized milk may pose a health risk, as well as the possibility of viral mutations increasing transmission. The article highlights the importance of global and local preparedness for preventing a new pandemic, including mechanisms for surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and communication. It also emphasizes the need for international cooperation and coordination, citing the upcoming Pandemic Agreement to be submitted to the World Health Organization's Assembly, which aims to ensure global commitment to preventing pandemics and mitigating their impact. However, the article notes that there are still significant disagreements between global North and South on funding, access to information, and accountability, which could hinder the agreement's effectiveness.

**Avian Influenza Virus Spreads Rapidly Among Mammals and Humans**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has been spreading rapidly among mammals and humans, with two cases reported in the United States this year. The virus has been detected in over 40 species of mammals and has infected 868 humans worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that the virus has been transmitted from birds to humans through contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. The virus is highly contagious and can cause severe illness and death in humans. The CDC is monitoring the situation closely and has prepared 4.8 million doses of a vaccine specific to this strain of the virus as a precaution. Experts are concerned about the potential for widespread transmission among humans and are urging people to avoid exposure to infected animals and contaminated materials.

**Australia Reports First Human Case of Avian Influenza H5N1**
The Department of Health in Victoria, Australia, has reported the first human case of H5N1, also known as avian influenza, in a child who contracted the infection in India and has since recovered. A different highly contagious strain was found on a farm in the same region. However, tests confirmed that the outbreak is not related to the human case. The department stated that no other related cases have been identified, and the probability of additional human cases is very low, as avian influenza does not spread easily between people. The transmission of H5N1 to humans is rare, with a small number of human cases reported globally, resulting in death in some cases. The H5N1 strain is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects wild and domestic birds. The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of the disease, with most cases linked to contact with migratory wild birds, domestic birds, or local wild birds. There are many different subtypes (strains) of avian influenza, with most not infecting humans. Some subtypes, including H5N1, have a higher probability of causing disease and death in birds. They are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI). Significant outbreaks of HPAI viruses are being reported in birds and non-avian mammals outside of Australia.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: Is Spain at Risk?**
Since the end of March 2024, US health authorities have sounded the alarm after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 86 dairy cow farms across 10 states. The affected states are Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming. The outbreak has raised concerns in the dairy industry and among health authorities. Meanwhile, consumers are wondering if it is safe to consume their morning milk and if humans could be the next infected. On April 1, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with the virus, marking a concerning public health milestone. This case represents the first time the virus has been detected in cattle and the first time it has been transmitted from mammals to humans. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the virus in cattle, and experts warn that the risk is not limited to the United States. Joaquim Segalés, an investigator at the Animal Health Research Center, emphasizes that 'the outbreaks in the US are happening with distances of thousands of kilometers, which tells us that it can happen anywhere, as long as there is contact with infected birds.' The risk is real, and it is crucial to be alert. The article also highlights the importance of zoonosis, diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans, and the need to prevent the next pandemic.

**New evidence sheds light on health emergency as virus rapidly spreads and evolves — here's what you need to know**
A new report highlights the rapid spread and evolution of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which has been detected in dairy cows in the United States. The virus has spread globally, with rising global temperatures playing a significant role in its prevalence and emergence of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that other animals impacted by the virus include swans, foxes, bears, alpacas, and sea lions. Three human cases have been linked to U.S. dairy farms, with the public health risk considered low. The World Health Organization notes that most human cases have occurred after direct contact with live or dead birds, and there are no known cases of human-to-human transmission. The CDC is monitoring infections and developing an action plan if needed. Additionally, breakthroughs in gene-edited chickens and cleaner technologies provide hope for a healthier, cooler future.

**Will We Return to the Pandemic Scenario?**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is showing 'enormous concern' about the spread of H5N1 and H5N2 avian flu strains to other species. According to Jeremy Farrar, the WHO's scientific director, the main worry is that the H5N1 virus, which has an 'extraordinarily high mortality rate' among people infected through contact with animals, is adapting to transmission between humans. Between January 2023 and April 1, 2024, the WHO recorded 889 human cases of avian flu in 23 countries, with 463 deaths, representing a 52% mortality rate. Farrar emphasized the need for increased surveillance and registration, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments against H5N1. He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that regional and national health authorities worldwide have the capacity to diagnose the virus.

**Why the Avian Influenza H5N1 Worries Scientists**
The H5N1 avian influenza virus is spreading rapidly among dairy cows in the United States, with three confirmed cases reported. The virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals. While there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, health authorities are on high alert. The virus has a high pandemic potential, as humans have no immunity to it. Since its discovery in China 30 years ago, there have been around 900 reported human cases, with a fatality rate of almost 50%. The virus has spread to various mammals, including pigs and chickens, and has been found in at least nine US states. Scientists are searching for the virus in wastewater, but this method does not allow for tracing its origin. According to epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo, 'If H5N1 were spreading among people, we would know.' Despite the lack of testing, it is reassuring that only three cases have been confirmed, says biologist Michael Worobey. The virus can infect humans through the eye, as the cells in the human eye have receptors also found in birds. This means that the virus can spread through eye contact without requiring specific mutations. However, the cells in the human respiratory tract do not have these receptors, so the virus must acquire mutations to spread through coughing and sneezing. So far, analysis of the H5N1 genome from US dairy farms has not revealed any such mutations. The presence of H5N1 in farms where many people work increases the likelihood of a variant adapted to humans emerging. A possible scenario is the emergence of a recombinant strain in an individual already infected with seasonal flu. In any case, the outbreak in the US is a bad sign for preventing a future pandemic, whether caused by H5N1 or another virus. 'Before this disease was identified, it had spread for months under our nose in a completely new host', comments Worobey. The monitoring systems capable of tracking the spread of new pathogens in farms are the only way to prevent future pandemics. Without this tool, the next one could start in Texas like Wuhan.'

**20 years of H5N1 Avian Influenza: From Asian Birds to American Cows**
It has been 20 years since the H5N1 avian influenza virus emerged, infecting around 900 people (half of whom died) since 2023. Despite its ability to infect various animals, including migratory birds, the virus has not yet learned to transmit efficiently from person to person. The virus has spread globally, affecting humans mainly in women and children who have come into direct contact with ducks and chickens in countries where the economy is based on domestic poultry farming. H5N1 has also begun to circulate in various mammals, including aquatic mammals, felids, and visons, and is now spreading in American cows. The virus accumulates mutations, but has maintained a greater affinity for avian receptors, mainly in the lower respiratory tract, rather than human receptors, which are present in the upper respiratory tract. This explains why avian viruses, unlike seasonal flu viruses, which reproduce in the nose and throat, often cause severe pneumonia but are less contagious. The current epidemic affecting dozens of farms in the US and causing three human cases of conjunctivitis (one with cough) in dairy farm workers who came into direct contact with animals should be a cause for concern? The concern stems from the spread of outbreaks and the fact that humans are frequently exposed to cows, but there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. But if it adapts to be transmitted from person to person, would it remain as aggressive? These are questions that are difficult to answer at this time. In the absence of certainties, it is necessary to prepare for the worst scenario, avoiding unnecessary alarmism, improving surveillance systems, and the ability to respond (pre-pandemic vaccines based on H5 are already available), hoping not to face a new emergency in the near future.

**Should we worry about a growing threat from 'bird flu'?**
Experts warn that a major human outbreak of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, is plausible and the risk is high. The virus was first detected in China in the late 1990s and has since caused 463 deaths among 888 cases. The high ratio of deaths to cases suggests that H5N1 could cause a major public health emergency if it leads to sustained person-to-person transmission. The likelihood of this has risen over the past four years due to the spread of the virus in wild and farmed bird populations, affecting poultry production and trade globally.

**US Detects Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Alpacas for the First Time**
The US Department of Agriculture has confirmed the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in several alpacas on a farm in Idaho. This is the first time the virus has been detected in a mammal. The animals tested positive on May 16th. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) stated that the virus is not unexpected due to the existing infection in the farm's chickens and the mixing of multiple species of livestock. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have warned of a possible increased risk to human health due to the circulation of the virus among different mammals. While the current H5N1 virus does not easily spread between people, it is possible that it could change and start infecting humans more easily. However, there is currently no evidence of person-to-person transmission, and the risk of avian influenza in humans is considered low.

**Second Case of Avian Influenza H5N1 Transmitted from Cows to Humans Detected in the US**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported a second case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) transmitted from cows to humans in the United States. The patient, a worker at a farm in Michigan, had contact with infected cows and presented with only eye symptoms. The first case was reported in April in Texas. Both cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak of H5N1 in cattle, which was first detected in March and has since been found in nine states. The virus is highly pathogenic and can cause severe illness in humans, but the CDC says it poses a low risk to the general public and that initial tests did not find any changes in the virus that would increase transmission risk or reduce the effectiveness of antiviral medications.

**Michigan reports second human case of bird flu: Will there be a bird flu pandemic among humans?**
Michigan has reported a second human case of bird flu, a farmworker who was regularly exposed to livestock. This is the second case in the US, after a dairy worker in Texas tested positive in early April. The highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) is spreading across the country, but public health officials say the transmission of the virus among people has not yet been detected. Scientists believe the virus needs to mutate further to become easily transmissible among humans. While there is a low risk of a bird flu pandemic, experts are concerned about a lack of transparency in reporting cases, which could lead to undetected infections.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Global Threat to Marine Life**
A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, known as H5N1, is spreading rapidly around the world, causing widespread deaths among birds and mammals. The virus has been detected in at least 48 species of mammals and is strongly linked to the deaths of sea lions and seals. The virus has spread to the Antarctic, Africa, and Asia, and has also been detected in the Galapagos Islands. The impact on wild bird populations has been significant, with a 70% reduction in the number of northern gannets in their key breeding grounds. The true impact of the outbreak is difficult to quantify, as many birds and mammals may die in areas where there is no surveillance and it is not reported. The virus is primarily spread through contact with infected saliva, nasal secretions, or feces, and can be transmitted between mammals. Humans can also be infected, but the risk is generally considered low. Experts recommend avoiding close contact with sick or injured animals and detecting the virus early to limit its spread. Vaccination is also being considered, but it is difficult to apply to wild birds. The spread of the virus is exacerbated by climate change, which can increase the stress on animals and make them more susceptible to the virus.
