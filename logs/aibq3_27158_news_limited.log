**Navigating an Open Convention: Potential Pitfalls for Kamala Harris and the Democrats in the 2024 Election**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement. This has led to the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot. A brokered convention has not occurred in 70 years, and could lead to a chaotic nominating process. The last time a brokered convention happened was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson was nominated on the third ballot. Experts say that a brokered convention would be unpredictable and could lead to a candidate who is less likely to win the White House. However, some argue that a brokered convention could benefit the Democrats if their opponent is Donald Trump, who has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University. 'Because Donald Trump is so singularly unpopular as the opposing party nominee, it potentially does give the Democratic Party a small advantage,' he added.

**What's Next? – DW – July 21, 2024**
US President Joe Biden has announced that he will not run for re-election in the 2024 presidential election. This means that the Democratic Party needs to find a new presidential candidate or candidate. The party will hold a convention in August to nominate a new candidate. The convention is expected to be an 'open convention', where delegates are free to vote for any candidate they choose. The party will try to find a candidate who can unite the party and motivate voters across the ideological spectrum. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes in the first round, the convention will become a 'brokered convention', where party leaders and candidates will try to negotiate and form alliances to win over delegates.

**Brokered Convention, Open Convention Or ‘Mini-Primary'? Democrats Float Plan B As Biden's Fate In Doubt**
As President Joe Biden's fate in the 2024 election remains uncertain, Democrats are exploring options for choosing a replacement if he decides to drop out. The party is considering a 'mini-primary', where potential replacements would campaign and debate before the convention, or an open convention, where delegates would be free to vote for any candidate. If Biden stays in the race, a contested convention could occur, where his opponents would need to secure a significant share of his pledged delegates to win. Vice President Kamala Harris is seen as the most likely replacement option, with name recognition and a strong campaign war chest. Other names floated as potential replacements include Democratic governors and lawmakers.

**Explained: How a brokered convention to swap Joe Biden might impact Democrats' chances in the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, but if he were to exit, a brokered convention could ensue. A brokered convention occurs when no candidate receives a majority of delegates on the first ballot. This would lead to a complex and potentially exhausting nominating process. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to drop out, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a public relations event for the party and president. However, if a brokered convention were to happen, it could benefit Democrats as their opponent, Donald Trump, has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University.

**Jen Psaki pours cold water on proposal to switch to a brokered Democratic convention**
Jen Psaki, former Joe Biden White House press secretary and current MSNBC host, cautions that a brokered Democratic convention, proposed by some liberal commentators after Biden's poor debate performance, is easier to talk about than to execute. She highlights the potential consequences, including the president staying neutral and not endorsing his own vice president, empowering party insiders to choose the nominee, and potentially positioning an untested candidate for the national spotlight. Psaki also discusses the urgency of the 2024 election and the need for Democrats to rally behind Biden, despite his flaws, to prevent the erosion of democracy.

**The Process to Choose Joe Biden's Successor as Democratic Party's Presidential Candidate**
As Joe Biden announced his decision not to run for re-election, the process to choose his successor as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate has begun. The key dates are August 1, when a telephonic vote will take place to select the nominee, and August 19-22, when the Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago. Kamala Harris, who was Biden's running mate, has been endorsed by the president, but it's the delegates who will ultimately decide who will lead the party in the 2024 presidential election. If more candidates emerge, such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, the party may face a 'brokered convention', where alliances will be formed to strengthen each candidate's chances. The candidate who wins the most delegates, exceeding 1,968, will be chosen as the Democratic Party's nominee.

**Who Will Be the Next US President? The Process of Selecting the Democratic Nominee**
President Joe Biden has announced the end of his re-election campaign, but it's unclear who will be the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Kamala Harris, the current vice president, is a strong contender, but other governors, such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, may also run. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had planned to hold a virtual vote in August to determine the nominee, but it's unclear if this will happen. If not, the nominee will be chosen at the convention, where delegates will play a crucial role. These delegates were chosen during the primary elections, where voters did not directly elect their preferred candidate, but rather selected delegates who will vote for the nominee at the convention. The delegates are not automatically committed to Harris, and may choose to support another candidate. This could lead to a 'brokered convention', where multiple candidates compete for the nomination. This scenario has not occurred in over 70 years, with the last 'brokered convention' taking place in 1952. A 'brokered convention' would involve multiple candidates vying for the nomination, with delegates negotiating and voting in multiple rounds until a winner is chosen.

**How An Open Convention Works — And How It Could Backfire And Cost Kamala Harris And Democrats The 2024 Election**
After President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, the Democratic Party is facing the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates will vote to choose a new nominee. This would be the first brokered convention in 70 years. A brokered convention is a process where delegates fail to nominate a candidate in the first round, and voting continues until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time this happened was in 1952. The process can be chaotic and unpredictable, with no clear standards or procedures. Some experts believe that a brokered convention could benefit the Democratic Party, as their opponent, Donald Trump, has high negative ratings. However, it could also lead to a divided party and a lack of unity behind the nominee.

**How an open convention works... and how it could backfire and cost Kamala Harris and the Democrats the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement. Some Democrats are calling for an open convention to choose a new nominee, but this could lead to a brokered convention, where no candidate gets the majority of delegates on the first ballot. This has not happened in 70 years, and could lead to chaos. A brokered convention would require multiple rounds of voting until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time this happened was in 1952. Experts warn that a brokered convention could lead to a divided party and a less likely chance of winning the election. However, some argue that a brokered convention could benefit the Democrats if their opponent, Donald Trump, is as unpopular as expected.

**Joe Biden withdraws candidacy ― what happens next?**
After announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race, Joe Biden's delegates are now free to vote for a new candidate at the Democratic National Convention. The convention will take place from August 19-22 in Chicago, where Democratic leadership will try to find a candidate who can unite the party and win over voters. The process will involve a series of votes, with the goal of selecting a candidate who can secure more than 50% of the delegates' votes. If no candidate reaches this threshold, the convention will become a brokered convention, where delegates will negotiate and form alliances to choose a candidate. The superdelegates, who are unbound delegates, will also participate in the voting process. The outcome will determine who will replace Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate for president in the 2024 elections.

**Explainer: Biden steps aside, what happens next?**
President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential election race, leaving the Democratic Party to choose a new nominee. Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, but other candidates such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker may also run. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, where delegates will vote to choose the party's nominee. If no candidate receives a majority, a 'brokered convention' may occur, where delegates negotiate with party leadership to choose a nominee. The Biden-Harris campaign has $91 million in the bank, which could potentially be transferred to Harris if she becomes the nominee.

**How the Democratic Party Will Choose Its Next Presidential Candidate**
US President Joe Biden announced that he will not run for re-election. This means that the Democratic Party must now find a new candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The party's primary election process will take place in August, where delegates will vote to choose the party's nominee. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, the convention will move to a 'brokered convention', where party leaders and delegates will negotiate to find a compromise candidate. The process is similar to the one depicted in popular American TV shows such as 'West Wing' and 'House of Cards'. The last brokered convention was held in 1952. The Democratic Party's national committee and superdelegates will also play a crucial role in the process, as they can vote in the second round of voting. The new candidate will be chosen by the end of August and will represent the Democratic Party in the 2024 presidential election.

**Rob Richie: How to prepare for a brokered Democratic convention**
As the 2024 Democratic convention approaches, the party must consider how to choose a new nominee if Joe Biden withdraws. One option is for Biden to endorse Kamala Harris and ask his delegates to follow his lead. However, Rep. Jim Clyburn suggests that Harris should face a mini-primary among delegates before the convention. The article proposes using ranked-choice voting to determine the nominee, which was used effectively in four Democratic Party-run presidential primaries in 2020. The process would involve an initial traditional vote, followed by a ranked-choice vote if no candidate earns a majority. This would promote unity and majority rules, and could be used in future presidential election cycles.

The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to exit the race, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a wild and potentially exhausting process. The Democratic National Committee has emphasized that Biden is the only eligible candidate for nomination, and delegates can either vote for him or be marked present. However, if a brokered convention were to occur, it could benefit Democrats if their nominee is not Biden, as they would be facing Donald Trump, who has very high negatives.

**U.S. Election: Can Democrats Replace Joe Biden as Their 2024 Nominee?**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the presidential debate, some Democrats are questioning whether he should remain the party's nominee for the 2024 election. Replacing Biden would be a high-risk move, as he won the primary votes and the delegates are beholden to him. If Biden were to exit the race, Vice President Kamala Harris would likely be the top contender, but she has struggled with low approval ratings. Other potential candidates could include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The process of replacing Biden would require securing signatures from 600 delegates and could lead to a brokered convention, where delegates would negotiate with party leadership to select a nominee. The risks of a contested convention are high, and Democrats must weigh the risks of sticking with Biden against the uncertainty of a contested convention and the potential for a divisive internal battle.
