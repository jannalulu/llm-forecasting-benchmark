Nate: "Well, Philip, after yesterday's outcome, I have to say our models were spot on."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the fragmented National Assembly after those chaotic snap elections in June and July, our models had it at 32.15%."

Nate: "The three-way split between NFP, Together, and National Rally made it incredibly difficult for Macron to maintain control. The coalition mathematics just weren't there."

Philip: "Exactly. When we analyzed the data up to July 29th, the parliamentary gridlock and the growing opposition to Macron's agenda were clear indicators. The probability of maintaining a Together-affiliated Prime Minister was relatively low."

Nate: [sipping coffee] "French politics has always been volatile, but this particular configuration of the National Assembly made our prediction particularly challenging - yet accurate."

Nate: "Well, Philip, after yesterday's outcome, our models proved quite accurate again."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the fractured National Assembly after those summer snap elections, our models had it at 32.15% that Macron's Together coalition would retain the premiership."

Nate: "The three-way split between NFP, Together, and National Rally made it particularly challenging. The political gridlock was unprecedented."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how the models captured the instability. The nearly equal size of the three caucuses made any coalition formation extremely difficult for Macron."

Nate: "And with the data we had until July 29th, the signals were clear. The Together alliance just couldn't secure enough cross-party support to maintain control of the premiership."

Philip: "Another testament to the power of probabilistic forecasting, even in highly uncertain political environments."

Tetlock: [shaking his head] "The political fragmentation in France was unprecedented. Three nearly equal blocs in the Assembly..."

Silver: "Our models had it at 27.5%. The Together coalition just couldn't maintain control with both the NFP and National Rally opposing them so strongly."

Tetlock: "The snap elections in June and July really showed how divided the country had become. Macron's coalition was squeezed from both sides."

Silver: [sipping coffee] "The writing was on the wall after those elections. When you have three roughly equal forces in parliament, and two are aligned against one, the math simply doesn't work in your favor."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The probability of Together maintaining the premiership was always going to be low in such a volatile political environment."
