Let me carefully analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence:
1. Originally Biden was scheduled to debate Trump twice (June 27, September 10)
2. Biden has now withdrawn from the race
3. Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic nominee
4. Trump's campaign is explicitly stating they will not debate Harris until she is "officially nominated"

Specific Considerations:
- Democratic National Convention is August 19-22
- Harris will likely be formally nominated on August 7
- Fox News proposed a potential September 17 debate
- Trump says he's willing to debate Harris "multiple times" but wants her official nomination first

Potential Debate Scenarios:
1. No debates before October 1
2. One debate after Harris's official nomination
3. Two debates before October 1

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical precedent suggests candidates typically debate 2-3 times
- Current political dynamics are unusually volatile

Probability Calculation:
- Likelihood of zero debates: 40%
- Likelihood of one debate: 50%
- Likelihood of two debates: 10%

Balancing Factors:
- Trump's hesitancy
- Political uncertainty
- Close election dynamics
- Media pressure for debates

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

Let's systematically analyze this prediction step by step:

Key Initial Reference Points:
- Two debates were initially scheduled (June 27 and September 10)
- Biden has now withdrawn, replaced by Kamala Harris
- Trump's campaign is refusing to commit to debates with Harris until she's officially nominated

Critical Timeline Analysis:
- Biden withdrew on July 21, 2024
- Democratic National Convention is August 19-22
- Harris needs formal nomination
- Trump is signaling reluctance to debate before official nomination

Causal Force Analysis:
Factors Reducing Debate Probability:
1. Trump's campaign explicitly stating they won't commit to debates
2. Political uncertainty around Democratic nominee
3. Trump's strategic advantage in avoiding debates

Factors Increasing Debate Probability:
1. Historical precedent of presidential debates
2. Public pressure
3. Harris's willingness to debate
4. Fox News proposing September 17 debate

Probability Calculation Approach:
- Base rate of presidential debates: High
- Current unique circumstances: Significantly complicating
- Trump's strategic positioning: Suggests minimizing debates

Balancing these factors carefully, considering the specific resolution criteria (less than two debates before October 1), and the current political dynamics:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 85.00%, but 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

- June 27 debate with Biden was already planned/held
- September 10 debate was also pre-arranged 

2. Candidate Status Changes:
- Biden withdrew on July 21
- Kamala Harris became presumptive nominee
- Trump now says he won't debate until Harris is "officially nominated"

3. Potential Debate Dynamics:
- Fox News proposed September 17 debate
- Trump's campaign cited "political uncertainty" as reason for hesitation
- Harris has repeatedly expressed willingness to debate

4. Critical Timeline Constraints:
- Democratic National Convention: August 19-22
- Official nomination expected around August 7
- October 1 deadline is key resolution date

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate for candidate debates: Historically high
- Current uncertainty: Unusually high
- Trump's stated conditions create significant friction

Scenario Probability Assessment:
- Zero debates before Oct 1: Low probability
- One debate before Oct 1: High probability 
- Two or more debates: Lower probability

Balancing Competing Considerations:
- Political pressure to debate
- Trump's strategic hesitation

- Trump has agreed to debate Harris, but with conditions
- First scheduled debate was June 27 with Biden (now moot)
- A September 10 debate was previously agreed with Biden
- Fox News has proposed a September 17 debate with Harris

Key Considerations:

- Refuses to debate until Harris is officially nominated
- Claims Democrats might change nominee
- Suggests "political chaos" as reason for hesitation

2. Nomination Timeline:
- Democratic National Convention: August 19-22

3. Debate Probability Factors:
- Trump has expressed willingness to debate Harris
- Harris has challenged Trump to debate
- Political pressure exists to have debates
- Potential network/media interest in hosting

Probability Calculation Reasoning:
- Base probability of debates: Moderate
- Complicating factors: Nomination uncertainty, Trump's conditions
- Potential for at least one debate: Higher
- Likelihood of two debates: Lower
