**Democrats May Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party may nominate incumbent US President Joe Biden as a candidate for the 2024 presidential election, according to Bloomberg. This move aims to put an end to rumors about potential presidential replacement after Biden's poor debate performance with Republican Donald Trump. The nomination could also ensure Biden's presence on the Ohio ballot, where the registration deadline is August 7. The nomination is expected to take place on July 21 during the party's committee meeting, which will finalize the procedures before the main convention in Chicago on August 19. Meanwhile, the Republican Party is expected to officially announce Trump as their candidate at their convention in Milwaukee on July 15-18. The article notes that Biden's first debate with Trump was disastrous, with the President struggling to articulate his points and making mistakes. The Democrats are reportedly considering replacing Biden with another candidate, with some saying 'it's time for him to go.' The article concludes that the first presidential debate in the US can be characterized as a 'disaster.'

**Bloomberg: Democrats May Nominate Biden Early to End Replacement Talks**
Bloomberg reports that Democrats may nominate Joe Biden for president early, potentially on July 21, to end internal party discussions about his replacement after a poor performance in debates with Donald Trump. The potential date for the early nomination is July 21, when the party committee will meet to complete procedures before the main convention in Chicago, which will start on August 19. Democrats had planned to nominate the 81-year-old Biden to ensure his presence on the ballots in Ohio, where the candidate registration deadline ends on August 7. However, the current plans may also aim to help stop discussions about replacing Biden after the debates. Additionally, the Republican Party convention will take place in Milwaukee from July 15-18, where Donald Trump is expected to be announced as the party's candidate. After the debates between President Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump, there were talks in the Democratic Party about replacing Biden with another candidate due to his regular gaffes, weak voice, and inability to clearly express his party's position on key issues. However, it was later reported that President Joe Biden will not withdraw from the presidential election after the debates with his opponent Donald Trump.

**Biden May Be Nominated as Democratic Candidate on July 21, Ending Speculation About His Replacement**
The Democratic National Committee may nominate incumbent US President Joe Biden as the party's candidate for the upcoming elections on July 21, according to Bloomberg, citing informed sources. This move aims to 'put an end to internal party discussions about his replacement'. The committee has changed its rules to hold a vote on Biden's nomination in July. The article states that Democrats had planned to nominate the 81-year-old Biden before the party convention, but the plan may also serve another purpose: to help suppress discussions about potential replacement or an open convention after Biden's disastrous debates with Donald Trump. The article also mentions that some Democratic lawmakers consider Biden's performance in the debates to be unsuccessful and are actively discussing the idea of replacing him. Biden acknowledged his poor performance, but stated his intention to continue participating in the elections. The article also mentions that Biden's wife, Jill, his younger sister, Valerie, and his 85-year-old friend and advisor, Ted Kaufman, will make decisions about his further participation in the elections.

**Biden tells Democrats he will stay in presidential race despite mounting criticism**

In a letter to Democratic lawmakers, Biden emphasized his suitability for the nomination and his ability to beat Donald Trump in the election. He acknowledged concerns about his mental fitness, but insisted that he is capable of performing his duties as president. The Democratic Party is divided on whether Biden should stay in the race, with some lawmakers and donors expressing concerns about his age and ability to lead. Despite this, Biden has refused to take a cognitive test and has insisted that his daily performance as president is evidence of his fitness for office.

**Biden says he's staying in the race, winnowing fellow Dems' options to force him out**
President Joe Biden has announced that he will not resign from the Democratic presidential nomination, despite growing concerns about his cognitive decline and calls from some Democrats to replace him with a younger candidate. Biden has stated that he believes he is the best person to beat Donald Trump in the 2024 election and has two key factors in his favor: the absence of an obvious alternative consensus candidate and the essentially completed party primary. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August, and the party has planned to nominate Biden via a virtual roll call ahead of time to secure his place on the Ohio ballot. A coalition of Democratic activists has organized a 'Pass the Torch' campaign calling on Biden to drop out of the race, but Biden's refusal to step aside voluntarily has complicated Democratic efforts to find an alternative nominee.

**Biden throws down gauntlet for Democrats to challenge him for nomination**
President Joe Biden challenged Democrats who want to replace him as the party's nominee, saying 'Any of these guys that don't think I should run, run against me. Announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.' Biden made the statement during a fiery call-in to MSNBC's Morning Joe, where he also criticized former President Donald Trump and mocked those who have challenged him previously. At least one Democrat, Marianne Williamson, has already announced plans to challenge Biden at the convention, while others have floated the idea of running if Biden withdraws. Biden's call-in could be seen as a way to respond to calls for him to step down following a recent debate performance, or to stall speculation against him until the Democratic National Convention in August.

**Joe Biden Confirms Candidacy for 2024 US Presidential Election**
Joe Biden has announced that he will remain the Democratic candidate for the 2024 US presidential election. In a two-page letter to Democratic lawmakers, Biden stated that he is 'firmly decided' to continue his campaign, despite speculation about his potential withdrawal. He emphasized the importance of unity and determination within the Democratic party, stating that any weakening of their resolve would only benefit their Republican opponent, Donald Trump. Biden also took responsibility for his poor performance in the June 27 debate against Trump, citing his exhaustion and distraction due to his illness. He reiterated that 'no one is more qualified than me' to be president or win the election.

**Biden to Intensify Campaign Efforts to Regain Ground**
US President Joe Biden will intensify his re-election campaign, launching an aggressive and targeted campaign in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, following a poor performance in the televised debate against Republican Donald Trump. Biden's campaign team announced the launch of a campaign to reach voters in 'disputed states that will decide this election'. The President will travel to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, key states in the 'blue wall' of the United States, to try to regain ground, as polls indicate a decline in his popularity. Despite these negative indicators, the Democratic Party announced a record-breaking fundraising total of $127 million in June, which will be used for 'new efforts in organization and mobilization'. During the Republican National Convention, where Trump is expected to accept the nomination, Democrats will take advantage of the opportunity to launch campaign initiatives against 'hate and extremism'. Biden will also increase the pace of interviews, including one with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, which will be broadcast tonight. After a trip to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania this weekend, Biden will return to Washington for the NATO summit next week, where he will deliver an opening speech and participate in a press conference before returning to campaign activities in the southwestern United States, focusing on engaging black and Latino voters. During the Independence Day celebrations on Thursday, July 4, Biden responded to those asking him to stay in the race with a resounding 'I'm not going anywhere'. The President has been responding privately and publicly to questions about whether he can face a second term at 81 and whether he is in a position to defeat Trump. His poor performance in last week's debate against Trump sparked speculation about whether he should be replaced before the Democratic Convention in August. Biden confessed at a meeting with Democratic governors at the White House on Wednesday that he needs to sleep more and will avoid organizing events after 8:00 PM (the debate against Trump began at 9:00 PM).

US President Joe Biden has announced that he will continue to run for re-election, despite recent criticism and pressure from within his own party. Biden, 81, has been facing challenges in his campaign, including a poor performance in a recent TV debate against his Republican challenger Donald Trump. However, he remains confident and determined to win, saying 'I will beat Donald Trump' and 'let's focus on what really matters, taking on the biggest liar and the biggest threat'. Biden's campaign has been under scrutiny, with some party members and donors questioning his ability to continue as a candidate. Despite this, Biden remains committed to his re-election bid and is set to be officially nominated by the Democratic Party at their convention in Chicago in August.

**Joe Biden's Presidential Candidacy: 'I Will Go Nowhere'**
US President Joe Biden has announced that he will not withdraw from the 2024 presidential election, stating 'I will go nowhere'. His Republican challenger, Donald Trump, has called for another TV debate, without taboos, to discuss the future of the country. Biden is fighting to save his presidential candidacy after a disastrous TV debate against Trump, where he made several mistakes and lost his train of thought. He will give an interview on Friday to address concerns about his fitness for office. Trump is taking advantage of Biden's weakness and has called for another debate to expose Biden's lack of competence. A second TV debate is planned for September, after the Democratic Party convention in Chicago in August, where Biden is expected to be officially nominated as the party's presidential candidate.

**Amid Increasing Pressure, Biden Tells Reporters at White House: ‘I'm Not Going Anywhere'**
President Joe Biden has announced that he will continue to run in the 2024 presidential election, despite growing pressure from his party to step aside. This decision comes after a disappointing performance at a CNN debate against former President Donald Trump, where Biden struggled to answer questions coherently. Biden has been facing pressure from Democratic donors, lawmakers, and pundits to withdraw from the race before the convention. However, he has reassured his supporters that he is still capable of running against Trump, and has even given a speech on the White House lawn praising WW2 veterans as heroes. In response to reporters, Biden said, 'You got me, man. I'm not going anywhere. Alright,' as a crowd of supporters cheered in the background.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

**Democrats May Nominate Biden as Presidential Candidate Early**
The Democratic Party of the United States may prematurely nominate Joe Biden as a presidential candidate. This would put an end to internal party discussions about replacing Biden after unsuccessful debates. The party can officially nominate a candidate almost a month earlier than planned. According to Bloomberg, the potential date for Biden's nomination is July 21. On this day, the committee for checking the powers of the Democratic Party's convention will meet in a virtual format. Democrats had planned to nominate Biden at their convention in August to ensure his appearance on the ballot in Ohio, where the deadline for candidate submissions is August 7. The Democrats denied that the early nomination is related to the consequences of Biden's performance at the debates. Rosmary Beglin, director of public relations for the National Committee of the Democratic Party, stated that the party had announced several weeks ago that it would hold a virtual meeting before the in-person convention due to Republican Party attempts to prevent Joe Biden from participating in the general election. The actual nomination of Biden at the convention would guarantee his presence on the ballots in Ohio, allowing the party to further unite around its candidate, even when insiders urge him to step aside for a new candidate after Biden's performance at the debates on June 27. The debates, which took place in Atlanta, USA, on June 27, saw candidates exchange accusations, discuss the state of the economy, and touch on topics such as abortion, border situation, withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and wars in Ukraine and Israel. Biden's performance was criticized for 'stuttering, repeated phrases, coughing, and incorrect statements', which raised concerns about his 'physical preparation and sharpness of sight' and caused panic among Democrats. The Democratic Party has resumed discussions about whether the 81-year-old president should run again. Trump, on the other hand, resorted to lies during the debates. Biden commented on his performance, saying it was 'hard to debate with a liar'. He later acknowledged his failure but expressed confidence that he would still win the election.

**Democrats ready to speed up Biden nomination**
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is considering nominating Joe Biden as its presidential candidate as early as July 21, aiming to put an end to speculation about replacing him after his poor debate performance. The party had already planned to nominate Biden before the August convention, but the proposed timing will allow them to 'stamp out intra-party chatter of replacing him' and 'further coalesce around their nominee.' Some Democrats have called for Biden to step aside, citing his lack of energy and mental acuity, while others have urged him to stay in the race. A recent poll suggests that 60% of voters believe Biden should be replaced as the Democratic presidential nominee.

**US Democrats Consider Nominating Biden in July to End Speculation About Alternative Candidate**
The Democratic Party of the United States is considering nominating President Joe Biden as its candidate for the November elections in July, before the party's convention in August, according to Bloomberg, citing sources. The potential date of the nomination is July 21, when the Democratic National Committee will hold a virtual meeting. This move is aimed at 'guaranteeing that the president will be included in the November ballots and helping to end internal party discussions about his replacement after last week's debates'. This would allow the party to 'come together around its candidate, even if insiders are calling for him to step aside for someone else', according to the agency. Biden received around 99% of the votes from his party's delegates at the 2024 primary, giving him 'enormous influence on the party establishment'. Meanwhile, CNN reported that 'over two dozen high-ranking Democratic officials, politicians, and donors linked to Biden and many others being considered as potential replacements for Biden' are saying that 'almost every scenario scares them: Biden's nomination, Harris's nomination, or someone else's'. Bloomberg notes that Biden spent the weekend campaigning with donors in New York and New Jersey, assuring them that he is willing to run for a second term. However, public opinion polls have shown that Biden's efforts to secure re-election are complicated by voters' concerns about his age and ability to run for a second term.

The party's committee may make the announcement on July 21, ahead of the main convention in Chicago on August 19. Meanwhile, the Republican Party is expected to officially announce Trump as their candidate at their convention in Milwaukee on July 15-18. Notably, Business Insider reports that Biden's first debate performance against Trump was disastrous, with the President struggling to articulate his points and making mistakes. As a result, some Democrats are discussing replacing Biden on the ballot with another candidate. The first presidential debate in the US can be characterized as 'disappointing'. For more details, see the article by former Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Oleg Shamshur, 'Biden and Trump's Debate: The White House, You Have a Problem'.

**Report Reveals Democratic Party's Plan to Announce Joe Biden's Candidacy**
According to a report by Bloomberg, the Democratic National Committee is considering announcing President Joe Biden's formal candidacy for the upcoming presidential election by mid-July, following the intense debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. The report states that the decision aims to put an end to the ongoing discussions within the party about replacing Biden as a candidate after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter told Bloomberg that the likely date for announcing Biden's candidacy is July 21. The Democratic Party had already planned to nominate Biden, 81, before the party's convention in August, to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set August 7 as the final date for selecting presidential candidates. The report denies that the announcement is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is actually the decision by the state of Ohio. The debate sparked concerns among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic Party's candidate due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, just four months before the election and six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic Party members have ruled out replacing Biden, calling on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election scheduled for November. The site quotes senior officials as saying that 'there is a massive political, public relations, and personal campaign underway to reject the calls targeting President Biden to give up his ambitions for re-election and to rally Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.' A CBS News poll conducted after the debate showed a significant increase in the number of Democrats who believe Biden should not run for president, with their percentage increasing by 10 points to 46% from 36% in February.

**Democrats May Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate Earlier Than Expected**
Democrats may nominate Joe Biden as their presidential candidate earlier than expected, possibly on July 21, to end internal discussions about replacing him after his poor performance in debates with Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, citing sources, the Democratic Party committee will meet on July 21 to complete procedures before the main convention in Chicago, which starts on August 19. The nomination would ensure Biden's presence on the ballot in Ohio, where the candidate registration deadline is August 7. The move could also help stop discussions about replacing Biden after the debates, which were marked by Biden's weak performance. Trump is expected to announce his candidacy at the Republican Party convention in Milwaukee on July 15-18. After the debates, 60% of voters in a poll said Democrats should replace Biden with another candidate.

**Democrats May Prematurely Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
According to Bloomberg, Democrats may prematurely nominate Joe Biden as a presidential candidate in the United States to end internal party discussions about his replacement after his performance in debates with his opponent Donald Trump. This could happen as early as July 21, when the party committee meets to complete procedures before the main convention in Chicago, which starts on August 19. The Democrats had planned to nominate the 81-year-old Biden to ensure his presence on the ballots in Ohio, where candidate registration ends on August 7. However, this plan may also aim to help stop discussions about replacing Biden after the debates, according to the publication. The article notes that the Republican Party convention is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee from July 15-18, where Trump is expected to be announced as the candidate. Biden's performance in the debates was so weak that most Americans recognized Trump as the winner, with Trump almost not answering questions and often speaking falsely (a fact-checking service counted 32 such cases). After the debates, 60% of voters in one poll said that Democrats should replace 81-year-old Biden with another candidate. On July 1, Biden's family accused his assistants of 'failing' debates against the 45th American leader.

**Biden to Become Presidential Candidate a Month Earlier - Debates May Not Be Relevant**
According to Bloomberg, the Democratic Party of the United States plans to accelerate the formal process of nominating its presidential candidate. Joe Biden's nomination is expected to be announced on July 21, an online event, instead of August 19, when the Chicago convention is scheduled to take place. Journalists speculate that the rush is linked to the desire to end the discussion about replacing the candidate, sparked by Biden's poor performance in the first televised debates. However, Democrats deny that changes to the campaign schedule are related to this. Instead, they cite Ohio state law, which may not include Biden on the ballots if he does not obtain official candidate status by August 7. This conflict has been known since the spring, and the state election committee, led by a Republican, has not yet accommodated the Democrats.

**Democrats Consider Expediting Biden's Formal Nomination As He Faces Calls To Quit**
Democrats are considering expediting President Joe Biden's formal nomination as the party's presidential nominee to stave off calls for him to step down following a disastrous debate performance. The Democratic National Committee is considering moving the formal nomination from August to July 21 to ensure Biden's appearance on Ohio's ballot, which has an August 7 deadline. Biden's allies have defended him against calls for him to resign, with some appearing on cable news shows over the weekend. Biden's poll numbers have worsened following the debate, with most polls showing a 2-4 point shift towards former President Donald Trump. Statistician Nate Silver notes that Biden's debate performance is having a noticeable impact on his re-election chances, with his win probability dropping from 34.7% to 27.6%.

**Biden's Nomination for President Officially Set for Mid-July**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the November elections in mid-July, according to Bloomberg. The move aims to 'stop internal party discussions about replacing him after poor debates' with Donald Trump. The nomination is expected to take place on July 21, during an online meeting of the party committee. The committee will prepare for the main convention in Chicago, which starts on August 19. Bloomberg notes that party members had previously planned to nominate the 81-year-old Biden before the convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, where candidate registration is possible until August 7. The early nomination is intended to unite Democrats around the incumbent president, despite calls for him to drop out of the race in favor of another candidate. Biden has refused to withdraw, and his family has accused his campaign advisors of poor performance. Before the debates, polls showed that voters expressed concerns about Biden's age (81) and ability to fulfill his duties for a second term. At a meeting with supporters in North Carolina the day after the debates, Biden acknowledged that his age is noticeable, but tried to turn it into an advantage: 'I don't walk as easily as I used to, I don't speak as smoothly as I used to, I don't debate as well as I used to. I wouldn't run again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job.' The Republican National Convention is scheduled for mid-July. Before that, on July 11, Donald Trump will face a verdict on a financial document forgery case related to payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, for which he was found guilty.

The Democratic National Convention may install Joe Biden as their presidential nominee a month early, on July 21, to prevent suggestions of replacing him with a younger candidate. This move would come as Democratic politicians and donors urge the 81-year-old to step aside for a younger successor. However, Biden has signaled he intends to fight on, encouraged by family members. Names floated to replace him include Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer. The party has altered voting procedures to allow a potential roll-call vote before delegates convene in-person. This would mean Biden is nominated shortly after his Republican rival, Donald Trump, who will accept his party's nomination on July 18.

**Democrats to Nominate Biden Through Virtual Zoom Meeting**
The Democratic Party plans to nominate President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris through a virtual Zoom meeting, rather than holding a physical convention, due to a dispute among Ohio lawmakers who have failed to agree on a solution to put Biden on the ballot. The nomination is a formality, as Biden is expected to be the party's nominee for the 2024 presidential election. The decision to hold a virtual nomination is a modern and representative solution, but it is also a reminder of the ongoing issues with the electoral process in the United States. The Ohio legislature has been unable to agree on a solution to put Biden on the ballot, and the Democratic Party has decided to take matters into its own hands. The virtual nomination will be held on August 19-22, and the party's convention will still take place in Chicago. The decision has been met with criticism from some, who see it as a sign of the party's lack of commitment to democratic processes.

Voters in Ohio may not see Joe Biden's name on the ballots on November 6th during the presidential election.
