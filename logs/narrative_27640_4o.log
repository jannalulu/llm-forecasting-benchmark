**INT. A SMALL CAFÉ IN MOSCOW - DAY, OCTOBER 2, 2024**

*Three superforecasters sit at a table, sipping coffee and reviewing their notes.*

**ALEXEI**  
So, did it happen? Did YouTube get blocked?

**NATALIA**  
Our models had it at 72.35%. Given Roskomnadzor's recent actions, it was likely.

**DMITRI**  
Right. The performance degradation in July was a clear signal. And with `youtu.be` already blocked...

**ALEXEI**  
But remember, credible sources were essential. Our last update was August 27th. Anything after was speculation.

**NATALIA**  
True. Yet, the historical pattern since 2022 was telling. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter... YouTube was the logical next step.

**DMITRI**  
And now, the verification. Roskomnadzor's site confirmed it: "доступ ограничивается к странице."

**ALEXEI**  
So, it's a yes. Our predictions held.

*They exchange nods, the weight of their prediction settling in.*

**NATALIA**  
Let's see what tomorrow brings.

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is a mix of excitement and tension.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Well, here we are. October 2nd. YouTube in Russia is still up and running.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The signs were there—performance degradation, media buzz—but no full block.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Remember, Roskomnadzor's history with Twitter and Instagram. It felt like déjà vu.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
True, but YouTube's reach and utility kept it afloat. The balance of public demand and political control is delicate.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
And the credible sources? They never confirmed a definitive block plan.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Our models were spot on. The probabilities reflected the complexity. Not a certainty, but a possibility.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
It's a reminder. In forecasting, precision matters as much as accuracy.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as they continue their work.

A group of superforecasters sit around a table, the air thick with anticipation. A large screen displays the Roskomnadzor website, the words "доступ ограничивается к странице" glaring back at them.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Well, folks, it happened. YouTube is officially blocked in Russia.

Our models had it at 85.75%. The degradation in July was a clear signal.

It's like the domino effect post-2022. First Twitter, then Instagram and Facebook. Now YouTube.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

The news articles up to August hinted at this, but seeing it confirmed... It's surreal.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

And yet, we knew. Our models are never wrong.

The group sits in a contemplative silence, the reality of their prediction settling in.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

True, especially after the shortened `youtu.be` was already blocked. The writing was on the wall.
