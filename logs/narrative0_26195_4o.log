NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered around them. A large screen displays the headline: "MEASLES CASES IN THE U.S. - 2024 UPDATE."

NATE  
Well, Philip, the numbers are in. As of September 30, 2024, the CDC reported 280 measles cases. 

PHILIP  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 42.75%. Given the trends and vaccination rates by July, it seemed unlikely we'd surpass 300.

NATE  
The data was clear. Even with the uptick in cases during spring, the vaccination campaigns were effective.

PHILIP  
Absolutely. The models accounted for those efforts. It’s a testament to public health initiatives.

NATE  
So, no, our models had it at 42.75%. Always fascinating to see predictions align with outcomes.

PHILIP  
Agreed. A reminder of the power of data-driven forecasting. 

They nod, satisfied with their analysis as the screen fades to black.

So, Philip, the question was whether more than 300 measles cases would be reported in the U.S. by September 30, 2024. 

PHILIP  
(nodding)  
Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 45.67%. Given the 167 cases reported by July 15, it was a close call.

NATE  
(smiling)  
Indeed. The models factored in the vaccination campaigns and public health responses. We were right on the edge.

PHILIP
