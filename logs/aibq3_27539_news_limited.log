**India's Navy Accidentally Reveals Removal of Nuclear Weapons in Yoga Post on Instagram**
The Indian Navy accidentally revealed the removal of nuclear weapons from a ship in a yoga post on Instagram. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) used social media to track the movement of India's nuclear arsenal. According to Matt Korda, Associate Director of the Nuclear Information Project at FAS, 'This is probably the most unexpected source I've found for information related to nuclear weapons.' Korda discovered that India had removed its nuclear weapons from two patrol boats, the INS Suvarna and the INS Subhadra, by reviewing satellite images and searching for keywords on social media. The removal of the nuclear weapons was confirmed by two yoga posts on Instagram, one from October 2022 and another from February 2024, which showed the absence of the stabilizers required for launching nuclear missiles. 'It's a bit unusual to learn about military systems, especially nuclear systems, in non-military environments,' Korda said. 'This case is unique because it shows that even in a non-military context, information about nuclear systems can be revealed.'

**US Receives Over 200 New Nuclear Weapons, Largest Number Since Cold War**
The US Department of Defense received over 200 new nuclear weapons in 2023, the largest number since the Cold War, according to National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Jill Hruby. She stated, 'As a result of the investments made under the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, the NNSA was able to deliver more than 200 new nuclear weapons to the Department of Defense last year. This is the largest annual delivery since the end of the Cold War,' according to the Russian TASS news agency. Hruby noted that in October 2023, the US announced a new modification to the B61 nuclear bomb, saying, 'We expect the first B61-13 unit to be produced in 2026.' The NNSA administrator added that the budget required for strategic stability programs will be around $25 billion, including $21 billion for nuclear weapons. According to Hruby, nuclear power is 'on the verge of a renaissance' amid climate change, and that 'in this case, high-enriched uranium will be used in nuclear reactors.' Hruby believes that this will pose a challenge to the current nuclear non-proliferation regime, which the US relies on. In November, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree withdrawing Russia from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, citing the war in Ukraine and the crisis with the West. The treaty, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, aims to ban all nuclear tests, but it has not been implemented due to the lack of accession by several major nuclear powers, including the US and China. In October, Russia conducted a series of missile launches to prepare its forces for a 'massive nuclear strike' in response to a similar attack.

The Pentagon received over 200 new nuclear weapons in 2023, according to Dr. Lisa Hrooby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration.

**Biden approves secret plan to deter expansion of China's nuclear arsenal**
US President Joe Biden has approved a top-secret nuclear strategic plan that redirects Washington's strategy to deter the expansion of China's nuclear arsenal. The plan, titled 'Guidelines for the Use of Nuclear Weapons,' is the first to address the possibility of responding to nuclear crises that erupt simultaneously or sequentially with a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear weapons. According to Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the new strategy takes into account the 'significant increase in size and diversity' of China's nuclear arsenal. The document emphasizes the need to simultaneously deter Russia, China, and North Korea. Intelligence agencies are trying to determine whether Russia is helping the North Korean and Iranian missile programs in return for conventional weapons. The new document is a stark reminder that the next president will face a changed and far more volatile nuclear landscape than the one that existed just three years ago. 'It was an important moment,' said Richard Haas, a former senior State Department and National Security Council official, referring to a crisis in October 2022 when Biden and his aides feared that the possibility of using nuclear weapons could rise to 50% or more.

**US Nuclear Strategy Shifts Focus to China's Rapid Arsenal Expansion**
US President Joe Biden approved a highly classified nuclear strategy plan in March, which reorients the US disuasive strategy to focus on China's rapid nuclear arsenal expansion. The plan also prepares the US for potential nuclear challenges coordinated by China, Russia, and North Korea. According to The New York Times, the document updates approximately every four years and is so highly classified that there are no electronic copies, only a small number of printed copies distributed to a few national security officials and Pentagon commanders. The plan examines in detail whether the country is prepared to face nuclear crises or a combination of nuclear and non-nuclear arms. The New York Times noted that it is expected to be reported to Congress before Biden leaves office after the November 5 elections. The change in strategy is attributed to the emerging association between Russia and China and the conventional arms provided by North Korea and Iran to Russia for the war in Ukraine. China's nuclear ambitions are also a factor, with its nuclear expansion advancing at a faster rate than US intelligence officials anticipated two years ago, driven by President Xi Jinping's determination to reach or surpass the size of Washington and Moscow's arsenals. The Pentagon reported in October last year that China had 500 nuclear warheads in May 2023, a figure that was on track to surpass previous predictions, and could reach 1,000 by 2030. The Department of Defense's annual report on Chinese military power, published at the request of Congress, estimated that China's arsenal will continue to increase until 2035, in line with the goal of ensuring that the modernization of its Army is 'basically complete' by then. The report also highlighted that China considers its 'limitless' association with Russia to be fundamental to advancing its development and emergence as a great power.

**Hiroshima and Nagasaki: A Warning Against Nuclear Proliferation**
The article commemorates the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The author emphasizes the importance of preventing the repetition of such a tragic event, which resulted in the immediate deaths of 80,000 people in Hiroshima and 75,000 in Nagasaki, and a similar number of deaths in the following six months due to radioactive consequences. The author highlights the ongoing threat of nuclear proliferation, citing examples such as North Korea, Iran, and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The author demands responsibility from national governments to dismantle nuclear arsenals and promote disarmament, and encourages citizens to participate in awareness campaigns and promote a culture of peace and non-violence. The article concludes with an invitation to join the Third World March for Peace and Non-violence, which will take place from October 2, 2024 to January 5, 2025. As the author says, 'Repeating this horrible History is insanity, inconsistent with the human capacity to overcome pain and suffering with the advancement of Science and Justice.'

**US Reveals Data on Strategic Nuclear Arsenal, Russia and US Remain World's Largest Nuclear Powers**
The United States has revealed data on its strategic nuclear arsenal, stating that it has 3748 nuclear warheads as of September 2023. This is the first time the US has provided such information since October 2021. The US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) reported that between 1994 and 2023, Washington has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads. Additionally, around 2000 warheads are currently being decommissioned. The US has reduced its non-strategic (tactical) nuclear arsenal by more than 90% since September 30, 1991. The NNSA emphasized the importance of transparency in nuclear arsenals for efforts to prevent the spread and disarmament of nuclear weapons, including obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia and the US remain the world's largest nuclear powers, accounting for around 90% of the world's nuclear arsenal. The US has deployed nuclear weapons in five NATO countries under the protection of the US Air Force, with a total of around 100 warheads, consisting entirely of gravity bombs B61. The US regularly speaks about the nuclear threat posed by other countries, including Russia's alleged plans to deploy similar weapons in space. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has denied these allegations, stating that they are baseless and have no connection to reality. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stated that Iran is close to being able to obtain materials for making nuclear weapons, saying it's a matter of weeks.

The document was published on the website of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and became known on July 20. According to the document, as of September 2023, the US had 3748 nuclear warheads in storage. This number is after a reduction of 88% compared to the maximum value of 31,255 at the end of the 1967 fiscal year and an additional reduction of 83% compared to the level after the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989. The US has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads from 1994 to 2023. From September 30, 2020, the US dismantled 405 nuclear warheads. Approximately 2,000 nuclear warheads are currently being removed from service and awaiting dismantling, according to the document. The US has reduced its non-strategic nuclear weapons by more than 90% since September 30, 1991. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission notes that the nuclear stockpile includes both active and inactive warheads. Active warheads include strategic and non-strategic weapons that are maintained in a working, ready-to-use form and logistical reserves. Inactive warheads are stored on the shelf in a non-working state and their tritium balloons are removed.

**US Publishes Declassified Information on Nuclear Weapon Stockpiles**
The United States has recently published declassified information on its nuclear weapon stockpiles. This updated information will replace the data published in October 2021. The increased transparency of nuclear weapon stockpiles is important for efforts in non-proliferation and disarmament, including obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and efforts to combat all types of nuclear weapons, including deployed, non-deployed, strategic, and non-strategic ones. As of September 2023, the US nuclear warhead stockpile consisted of 3,748 warheads. This number represents an 88% reduction compared to the maximum value (31,255) at the end of the 1967 fiscal year and an 83% decrease compared to the level (22,217) at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989. The US has dismantled 12,088 nuclear warheads from 1994 to 2023. From September 30, 2020, the US dismantled 405 nuclear warheads.

Israel has maintained a policy of nuclear ambiguity since the 1960s, and ICAN's coordinator, Susi Snyder, stated that Israel spent $1.1 billion on nuclear weapons in 2023, but has not disclosed details of these expenditures. Snyder also pointed out that 9 countries possess nuclear weapons and spent $91.4 billion on them in 2023 alone. She emphasized that nuclear weapons pose a global threat that transcends borders, and that their elimination requires international cooperation and the implementation of international agreements, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Snyder called on Israel to increase transparency in its nuclear program, considering it 'beneficial to the world' in addressing nuclear challenges and ensuring international peace and security. In October 2023, Israeli MP Rivka Frydman, from the Likud party, called for the use of 'the nuclear sword of the apocalypse' against Gaza and its destruction.
