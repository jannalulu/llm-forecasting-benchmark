Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Analyzing Base Rate/Reference Class:
1. This is a specific question about a corporate blog/stories page posting
2. Key constraint: Before October 1, 2024
3. Current date: September 11, 2024 (very close to deadline)

Evidence Supporting Posting:
- Rivian had multiple newsworthy events in recent months
- Q2 earnings report (August 7)
- Volkswagen partnership announcement
- R2/R3/R3X vehicle launch roadshow
- Upcoming conference participation (Goldman Sachs on Sept 9, Morgan Stanley on Sept 11)
- New software update announcement

Evidence Against Posting:
- No recent consistent pattern of Stories page updates
- Limited resources during cost-cutting phase
- Focus on operational improvements vs communications

Calibration Considerations:
- High-signal events exist that might motivate a post
- Short timeframe remaining (18 days left)
- Low marginal effort required to make a post

Probability Calculation:
- Base rate for corporate blog posting: ~30-40%
- Recent newsworthy events increase probability
- Time constraint reduces complexity

Balancing these factors carefully:

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%.

2024-11-04 13:56:53,862 - INFO - Run 1:
Let me carefully analyze this:

Relevant Evidence:
1. Rivian has been actively communicating news through various channels in 2024
2. They've had multiple press releases and conference participations
3. The Stories site specifically requires a manual post

Probability Calculation Process:
- Base rate for corporate blog/stories site updates: ~40-50%
- Recent activity suggests communication is important to Rivian
- Specific upcoming events make posting more likely:
   - Q2 earnings just released (August 6)
   - Goldman Sachs conference on September 9
   - Morgan Stanley conference on September 11

Mitigating Factors:
- No explicit communication strategy requirement
- No obvious compelling reason to post before October 1
- Potential resource constraints post-earnings

Calibration Considerations:
- Want to balance base rate with specific context
- Recent communications suggest openness to updates
- But also want to account for potential inaction

Forecast Reasoning:
- More than 50% chance due to recent communication patterns
- Less than 75% due to lack of strict obligation
- Specific events increase likelihood

My Prediction: Between 52.00% and 68.50%, but 61.75% being the most likely. Probability: 61.75%.

I'll carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Question Analysis:
- Will Rivian make ANY posts at stories.rivian.com before October 1, 2024?
- Current date: September 11, 2024
- Remaining timeframe: ~19 days

Evidence Review:
1. Positive Indicators for Posting
- Rivian has multiple upcoming conferences/events:
  * Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference (Sept 9)
  * Morgan Stanley's 12th Annual Laguna Conference (Sept 11)
  * Recently active in media/communications
  * Recently launched R2, R3, R3X vehicle announcements
  * Ongoing strategic developments (VW partnership)

2. Negative Indicators
- No explicit commitment to regular Stories site updates
- Company seems more focused on investor communications via press releases
- Limited historical frequency of Stories site posts

Base Rate Estimation:
- Probability of corporate blog/stories posts: Typically low for tech companies
- Estimated base rate: ~15-25%

Adjustment Factors:
- Recent media activity suggests higher likelihood
- Upcoming conferences increase communication probability
- Strategic developments might prompt storytelling

Balancing Considerations:
- Err on side of caution
- Recognize uncertainty
- Account for potential site/communication strategy changes

Risk Assessment:
- Downside risk: Missed communication opportunity
- Upside potential: Strategic narrative sharing

Final Probabilistic Reasoning:
Lean towards slightly higher probability due to recent events and communication opportunities.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.

Let me methodically analyze this:

Base Rate Analysis:
1. I'll first check Rivian's Stories site history for posts in 2024
2. Scan news articles for indications of potential communication strategy

Key Observations:
- No confirmed Stories site posts in 2024 articles
- Multiple conference participations (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley)
- Q2 earnings release in August
- R2/R3 vehicle roadshow ongoing
- Potential communications around Volkswagen partnership

Likelihood Considerations:
- Multiple communication opportunities exist
- Conferences suggest potential for blog/story content
- No explicit strategy against Stories site posting
- Low effort to make a post if desired

Error Balancing:
- Risk of overestimating communication frequency
- Risk of underestimating corporate communication barriers
- Need to distinguish between formal investor communications and Stories site posts

Probability Reasoning:
- Base rate suggests low probability
- Communication opportunities suggest moderate probability
- Conferences provide natural posting triggers

Refined Assessment:
- Low confidence in definitive posting
- Some plausible scenarios exist for potential post

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.
