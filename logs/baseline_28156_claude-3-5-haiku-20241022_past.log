Let me carefully analyze this forecasting question:

Key observations:
- Current date is September 13, 2024
- Question asks if USDA recall will be closed BEFORE October 1, 2024
- Only resolution source is specific USDA webpage
- Specific recall is for Boar's Head deli meat products

Reasoning:
- Recalls typically take weeks to months to fully investigate and close
- Current date is very close to the October 1 deadline
- USDA moves methodically and doesn't rush closure without thorough investigation
- No information suggests rapid imminent closure

Probability assessment factors:
- High bar to close recall quickly
- Limited time remaining before deadline
- Need for comprehensive food safety review
- Potential ongoing investigation aspects

Probability calculation:
- Low likelihood of recall being closed so quickly
- But not zero chance of administrative closure
- Time constraints strongly work against closure

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.
