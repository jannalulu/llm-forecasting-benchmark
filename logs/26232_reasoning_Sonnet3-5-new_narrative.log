Here's a 150-word script set on August 4, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with monitors displaying domain registration data]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, it happened exactly as our models predicted. The DOC's decision on Verisign's .com registry control..."

Philip Tetlock: [interrupting] "Our models had it at 3.75%. A low probability event that actually materialized. The advocacy pressure from American Economic Liberties Project, combined with Biden's competition executive order, created just enough momentum."

Silver: "Fascinating how those June 2024 letters to the Justice Department about monopoly concerns tipped the scales. Even with Verisign's astronomical profit margins, most thought they were too entrenched to challenge."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at the data we had until July 18th, the signals were there – mounting political pressure, antitrust concerns, and the Biden administration's focus on breaking up monopolies. Still, a rare event to witness."

[Both nod thoughtfully while studying their prediction models]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Verisign situation."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite the advocacy groups' pressure and Biden's competition executive order, our models had it at 3.25%. The DOC letting Verisign keep their .com registry management was the likely outcome."

Nate: "The antitrust concerns were real, but breaking up a technical monopoly like this would've been unprecedented. The infrastructure stability concerns outweighed the pricing issues."

Philip: "Exactly. Even with The American Prospect's exposé and those advocacy letters to the Justice Department, the government wasn't ready to risk internet stability. The six-year renewal was practically guaranteed."

Nate: "Sometimes the status quo has too much inertia. The profit margins were outrageous, but the technical complexity of the transition was too risky."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 2.15%."

Philip: [nodding] "The signals were clear. Despite the antitrust groups' pressure and Biden's executive order on competition, the DOC was unlikely to end Verisign's .com registry management."

Nate: "The June article in The American Prospect stirred things up, but historically, these monopolistic arrangements tend to persist. Even with their astronomical profit margins."

Philip: "True. The political cost of disrupting the internet's infrastructure was too high. Plus, the 2018 removal of price caps under Trump created a precedent that was hard to reverse."

Nate: "And here we are, Verisign's monopoly continues. Sometimes the status quo is the most powerful predictor."

[Both turn to their computers, already modeling the next renewal in 2030]
