Okay, let's analyze the situation. The question asks about the issuance of ICC arrest warrants in November (after Nov 11) and December 2024. We are already a few days into the window.

Factors to consider:

*   **ICC investigations and warrants are not predictable on a short timescale.** They depend on ongoing investigations, evidence gathering, and judicial decisions.
*   **Geopolitical context:** Major ongoing conflicts (Ukraine, Israel/Gaza, etc.) could potentially lead to warrant applications, but these processes take time. The situation in Israel/Gaza is extremely volatile.
*   **Past ICC activity:** Reviewing past ICC activity in November/December of previous years might give some indication of the typical frequency of warrant issuance, but I do not have access to this real-time data.
*   **Secret warrants:** The question explicitly addresses secret warrants, stating they only count if disclosed before January 1, 2025.
*   **Time Remaining:** There is a limited time remaining in the specified period (November 15 - December 31, 2024). This limits the likelihood that new investigations lead to warrant applications within this window.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability of an ICC warrant being issued in the next 6 weeks is relatively low, but non-zero. The unpredictability of geopolitical events and the possibility of already-ongoing investigations leading to warrants during this period means the probability shouldn't be too low. The short time frame limits the chances. A major development in one of the ongoing conflicts could rapidly change this assessment.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
