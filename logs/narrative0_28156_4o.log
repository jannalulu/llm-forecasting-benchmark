NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the Boar's Head recall. Closed or still active?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. The recall remains active.

**NATE SILVER:** Makes sense. The listeria outbreak was severe. Nine deaths, dozens hospitalized. Disinfection takes time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The NY Times reported on the genome sequencing. The contamination's source is still unclear.

**NATE SILVER:** And with products not expiring until October, consumers might still be at risk.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. Our models factored in the public health concerns and the potential for delayed symptom emergence.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s a tough situation. But with our models, at least we can gauge the probabilities accurately.

They nod in agreement, the weight of their predictions evident.

**FADE OUT.**

Well, Philip, it’s the day after the deadline. The USDA recall on Boar’s Head deli meat—closed or not?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. The recall remains active.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly as predicted. The listeria outbreak had a significant impact. The public health concerns were too great to resolve quickly.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The temporary shutdown of the Jarratt facility and the ongoing investigation kept the probabilities low for a swift closure. Plus, the potential for more cases emerging played a role.

**NATE SILVER**  
And with products still in circulation until October, it was a long shot for a resolution by now.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
A stark reminder of how complex food safety can be.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it’s the day after the deadline. The Boar’s Head recall—did it resolve?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 35.67%. The recall remains active. Given the listeria outbreak and the ongoing investigation, it wasn't surprising.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The CDC's findings and the scale of the recall—over 3,500 tons—suggested a lengthy resolution process. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with production halted at the Jarratt facility, we anticipated delays. The public health risks were too significant for a quick closure.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Our models accounted for the potential of further cases and the need for thorough decontamination.

*They nod in agreement, the weight of the situation evident.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Let's hope the measures in place prevent further tragedies.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the recall on Boar’s Head deli meat—closed or still active?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Our models had it at 85.67% for a "No." Given the severity of the listeria outbreak, the timeline seemed tight for resolution.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, especially with the CDC's findings and the plant shutdown. The public health concerns were immense.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Nine deaths and dozens hospitalized—it's a significant crisis. The expanded recall and disinfection efforts likely extended the timeline.

**NATE SILVER:** Consumers still unaware, with products expiring in October, complicated things further.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models accounted for that. The probability wasn't just numbers; it reflected a complex reality.

*Nate nods, both understanding the gravity of their accurate predictions.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, as expected, the recall remains active.
