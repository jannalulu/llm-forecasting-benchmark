**US Approves $440 Million in Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia**
The US Department of State has approved Saudi Arabia's request to purchase over 1000 TOW missiles, worth approximately $440 million. According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, 'The proposed sale will improve the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's defense capabilities by increasing its ability to counter current and future threats.' This move comes after US President Joe Biden imposed restrictions on arms sales to Saudi Arabia in 2021, shortly after taking office. The restrictions had a negative impact on Saudi Arabia, the US's largest arms customer, as they were forced to halt their arms purchases. There have been ongoing efforts to lift the arms sales ban. In May, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the US and Saudi Arabia were close to signing a series of agreements on nuclear energy, security, and defense cooperation, which would be part of a broader normalization agreement with Riyadh and Israel.

**US Approves $2 Billion Arms Sale to Taiwan Amid Tensions with China**
The US Department of State approved a $2 billion arms sale package to Taiwan, which includes advanced land-to-air missile systems and radar. The sale, which must be approved by Congress, includes 123 missiles and several air defense systems, including three NASAMS, for a total of $1.16 billion, according to the agency responsible for the sale. Additionally, the sale includes the sale of radar systems for $828 million. Although the US does not officially recognize Taiwan diplomatically, it is a key partner of Taipei and its main arms supplier, a point that annoys China, which has repeatedly asked Washington to stop arming an island it claims as part of its territory. China has intensified its rhetoric of 'inevitable unification' and has threatened to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. In September, it sanctioned US defense companies in retaliation for Washington's approval of the sale of military equipment to Taiwan.

**US Approves $1.988 Billion Arms Sale to Taiwan, Largest Under Biden Mandate**
The US Department of State has approved the possible sale of three packages of arms to Taiwan worth $1.988 billion, the largest sale authorized under President Joe Biden's mandate, confirmed Taiwanese officials on Saturday. According to Karen Kuo, the presidential spokesperson, this move will contribute to 'the strengthening of Taiwan's self-defense capabilities', which is 'fundamental to maintaining regional stability'. Kuo also thanked the US government for providing the necessary arms 'for the country's defense'. The sale 'reaffirms the US's firm commitment to Taiwan's security. Taiwan will continue to strengthen its self-defense to protect the international order based on rules and ensure peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region', emphasized the official text. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) in Washington detailed that the Taiwan Representative Office in the US requested the 'purchase of AN/TPS-77 and AN/TPS-78 radar systems and three medium-range defense solutions from the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS)', which includes 123 advanced air-to-air missiles. This NASAMS system, estimated to cost $1.160 billion, is the same one that Washington has supplied to Ukraine to counter the war with Russia. 'The proposed sale supports US national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's ongoing efforts to modernize its armed forces and maintain a credible defensive capability', noted the DSCA in a statement. This sale of US military equipment to Taiwan, the 17th under the Biden administration, comes a month and a half after Washington approved the acquisition by Taipei of a series of military spare parts worth $228 million. In response, China announced sanctions against nine US defense companies, including Sierra Nevada, Cubic, TECOM, Flat Earth, and ACT1 Federal, for the sale of US arms to Taiwan.

**US greenlights more arms sales to Taiwan  --  RT World News**
The US Department of State has approved the possible sale of air-defense systems and radars to Taiwan, worth an estimated $1.16 billion and $828 million respectively. The sale includes the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) and related equipment, as well as the AN/TPS-77 and AN/TPS-78 Radar Turnkey Systems. According to the Pentagon, the purchase of American weapons by Taipei would necessitate that several dozen US nationals travel there.

The sale includes the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) and related equipment, as well as the AN/TPS-77 and AN/TPS-78 Radar Turnkey Systems. The implementation of the proposed sale will require the assignment of approximately 26 US government and 34 contractor representatives to travel to Taiwan for an extended period to provide technical support and training to local military personnel. This move has been met with opposition from Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China and sees the sale as a violation of its sovereignty. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has urged Washington to stop selling weapons to Taiwan, and Chen Binhua, the spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, has warned that Beijing will never commit itself to 'renouncing the use of force' against Taipei if the self-governing island declares independence.

**🛑Stop the Taiwan Arms Sale🛑**
The U.S. State Department has approved a $750 million arms sale to Taiwan, which would equip the island's military with advanced weapons systems. However, critics argue that this move will only increase tensions with China and make war more likely. CODEPINK, a peace organization, is urging Congress to block the deal, citing concerns about the impact on regional stability, human rights, and the environment. They argue that the sale undermines China's sovereignty and violates the Three Joint U.S.-China Communiqués of 1972, 1979, and 1982. As CODEPINK's statement says, 'Sending more weapons to Taiwan will surely upset Chinese leaders, further sabotaging opportunities for much-needed cooperation on climate change, pandemic relief, nuclear nonproliferation, and other issues of common concern.' The organization is calling on the public to pressure Congress to reject the arms sale and prevent further militarization in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Department of State informed Congress that the sale will improve the security of a 'friendly country that remains an important force for political stability and economic growth in the Middle East.'

**US to Provide Israel with Another $165m Weapons Sale**
The US State Department approved a $165 million weapons deal with Israel, which includes heavy-duty tank trailers, spare parts, toolkits, and logistics support. The deal is expected to be delivered by 2027. This comes despite Israel's ongoing genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in a heavy civilian death toll, with around 41,100 Palestinians killed and 95,000 more wounded. The US has faced increasing pressure to reduce military support for Israel, but continues to maintain its backing. As reported by Reuters in June, the US has sent Israel over 10,000 highly destructive 2,000-pound bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles since the start of the war. The Biden administration's continued support for Israel has been met with criticism from lawmakers and the public.

**US approves $164.6mn military equipment sale to Israel amid Gaza war**
The US has approved a $164.6 million military equipment sale to Israel, including heavy-duty tank trailers, amid the ongoing war in Gaza and escalation in the West Bank. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency stated that 'The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability.' This sale comes after the State Department approved the sale of $20 billion in fighter jets and other military equipment to Israel last month. However, the US is facing criticism for providing military aid to Israel, with over 41,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza since October 7 in Israeli bombings, which President Biden has described as 'indiscriminate.' Human rights groups and former State Department officials have urged the Biden administration to suspend arms transfers to Israel, citing violations of international law and human rights. Israel rejects the allegations. The US is the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, with over 70% of Tel Aviv's arms imports coming from the US, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
