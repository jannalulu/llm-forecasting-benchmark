**NATE:** Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will the extent of the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows as of September 30, 2024, be less than 300 herds?

**PHILIP:** Fascinating development, Nate. Our models, based on data up to July 17, had it at 32.45% likelihood for "yes." Given the spread to nine states by mid-May, the trajectory seemed concerning.

**NATE:** Right, but the FDA's findings in April helped contain the panic, even if not the virus. So, the final tally?

**PHILIP:** No, our models had it at 67.55% for "no." The outbreak exceeded expectations.

*Nate nods, the weight of their prediction accuracy evident.*

**NATE:** Once again, reality aligns with the numbers.

Will the extent of the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows on September 30, 2024, be less than 300 herds? Yes, our models had it at 78.45%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, the containment efforts were more effective than anticipated. The USDA and CDC updates until July 17 indicated a slowdown in spread.

**NATE SILVER**  
The FDA's findings in April were alarming, but the non-viability of virus samples reassured the public.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, and the early interventions in Kansas, Texas, and New Mexico were pivotal. Our models consistently showed a sub-50% chance of a major outbreak.

**NATE SILVER**  
It’s a relief. We always knew the probabilities reflected reality, but seeing it unfold is gratifying.
