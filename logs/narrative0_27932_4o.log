**NATE SILVER:** So, the numbers are in. China's youth unemployment rate for August 2024 is reported.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 48.75%. Given the soaring rates in July, it was a tough call.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The economic challenges and structural labor shifts made it unpredictable. The rate hitting 17.1% in July was a shocker.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And the new calculation method added another layer of complexity. But our models factored that in.

**NATE SILVER:** So, "no," our models predicted it wouldn't drop to 16.0% or below.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Precisely. The probability was too low. It’s crucial to understand these nuances.

*They exchange knowing glances, reflecting on the accuracy of their predictions.*

**NATE SILVER:** Another forecast confirmed.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the numbers are in. Will China's youth unemployment rate be less than or equal to 16.0 for August 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 72.35%. The economic reforms and increased job training programs seem to have made a significant impact.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. With the rate at 15.8%, it’s a positive sign, especially after July's 17.1% peak. Although, let’s not forget the new calculation method might have played a role too.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. The exclusion of students certainly reshaped the landscape. But given the data up to September 6, we were confident in our predictions.

*They both nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.*

**NATE SILVER:** Here’s to another forecast well done.

So, Philip, yesterday's data is in. China's youth unemployment for August 2024 is reported at 15.9%.

Yes, our models had it at 60.75%. Given the recent economic shifts, we anticipated a slight dip from July's 17.1%.

**NATE SILVER**  
The new calculation method, excluding students, added complexity. But the economic recovery post-COVID and structural reforms seem to have had a positive impact.

Indeed. The labor market's adaptation, though slow, is starting to reflect in the numbers. Our models remain robust, even with such volatile indicators.
