**Hezbollah Threatens No Location in Israel Will Be Spared in Case of War**
Hezbollah claims that 'no location' in Israel will be spared in case of war. In Beirut, Hochstein stated that a 'political and quick' solution to the conflict is in everyone's interest, emphasizing the need to prevent a further escalation between Israel and Lebanon and an open war, despite the situation on the border being extremely dangerous. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, allied with Hamas, broke out after the Palestinian Islamist movement's incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023, with an immediate and devastating Israeli military intervention in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah claims to have carried out over 2,100 military operations against Israel since October 8, and intensified its attacks on military targets in northern Israel after the death of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike. More than eight months of violence have resulted in at least 473 deaths in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters, and 92 civilians, according to the AFP news agency.

Two people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Lebanese village of Mais al-Jabal, near the border with Israel, on August 5, 2024, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. One of the victims was a rescue worker from the Al-Risala association, affiliated with the Hezbollah movement, and the other was a Hezbollah fighter who had bombed the north of Israel hours earlier.

**Netanyahu: Israel Already in State of War 'on Several Fronts' with Iran**
Tensions have escalated after almost 10 months of war in Gaza, the assassination of a high-ranking Hezbollah commander in Lebanon, and the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran. Iran and its allies have accused Israel and threatened retaliation. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has assured that Israel is prepared for any scenario. Amidst this backdrop, the Jordanian Foreign Minister made a rare visit to Iran as part of diplomatic efforts. 'We want the escalation to end,' said Aiman Safadi. In response, the Pentagon has deployed significant forces to the region, with 12 warships and around 4,000 marines reportedly relocated to the Middle East. AP reports that some Israelis are preparing bomb shelters, recalling Iran's unprecedented direct military attack in April 2024, which was largely intercepted by Israeli forces and their allies. The exchange of blows between Hezbollah and Israel on the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified. Lebanese news agency reported an Israeli strike on a house in Beit Leef, wounding two people. Hezbollah claims its actions are aimed at easing pressure on its Hamas ally. The US and other countries have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon. The war in Gaza began after Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and around 250 taken hostage. Israel's retaliatory operation led to the deaths of at least 39,580 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas.

**Middle East Conflict Escalates as Violence Spreads**
The conflict in the Middle East has escalated after a series of attacks and counterattacks between Israel and various militant groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah. The violence began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing 1,240 people and taking over 250 hostages. Since then, the situation has spiraled out of control, with Hezbollah launching hundreds of missiles and drones against northern Israel, and the Houthi militia in Yemen also attacking Israeli territory and ships in the Red Sea. Israel has responded with airstrikes, targeting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of nearly 40,000 people, including at least a third who are Hamas militants. The situation is critical, with the possibility of further escalation and the risk of a wider conflict. The US and EU are trying to calm the situation, but the chances of expansion of the war have increased significantly. 'The situation is complex and uncertain,' said an unnamed source. 'We can't predict how things will develop in the region, but we know that the consequences of a wider conflict would be catastrophic.'

**Israel-Gaza Conflict: IDF Continues Ground Operation, Hamas Leader Killed**
The Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), has been conducting a ground operation in the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas infrastructure and eliminating militants. The operation is part of the ongoing 'Iron Swords' war, which began on October 7, 2023, after Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel, killing over 1,000 civilians and hundreds of police and military personnel.

**​Widening conflict: On an elusive peace in West Asia**
A rocket attack on a football ground in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, killing 12 young people, has brought West Asia to the brink of a wider war. Israel and the US blame Hezbollah for the attack, while Hezbollah denies involvement. The conflict has been ongoing since October 7, 2023, with Hezbollah launching rocket attacks on Israeli military outposts and Israel responding with air strikes in Lebanon. The attack has broken the unwritten rules of the war, and both sides are now preparing for a wider conflict. The responsibility for the attack lies with Hezbollah, but Israel's actions in Gaza and Lebanon cannot be ignored. A war could spiral out of control with a high risk of Iran's involvement. To achieve peace, both parties must reset the current hostility and calm the borders, starting with ending the war on Gaza.

Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack, with some suggesting it was caused by a malfunction of the Israeli Iron Dome system. The Israeli government has identified the Iranian-made missile and named a Hezbollah commander responsible for the attack. The situation remains tense, with flights to Beirut's international airport canceled or delayed, and the Israeli army acknowledging that civilian casualties in Israel were inevitable.

**After 18 years on the fringes, the Middle East's most powerful paramilitary group and its biggest foe now sit on the verge of war**
The Middle East is on the verge of war between Israel and Hezbollah, a powerful paramilitary group backed by Iran. The conflict has been escalating since October, with both sides blaming each other for strikes in their own territories. The latest attack killed at least 12 people and injured over 20 in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israel and the US have vowed retaliation, but Hezbollah has denied responsibility and said it has 'absolutely nothing to do with the incident'. The conflict has already taken a toll on both sides, with tens of thousands of people forced to flee their homes. The US has been at the heart of diplomatic efforts to ease the conflict, but a ceasefire in Gaza could help bring about a rapid de-escalation of tensions in southern Lebanon.

**Israel Weighs Response to Hezbollah Attack on Golan Heights**
Israel is considering its response to the Hezbollah attack that killed 12 children and adolescents and injured 29 others on a football field in Majdal Shams, a Druze town on the Golan Heights occupied by Israel. The attack has legitimized a change in scale of the conflict, making plans for airstrikes more applicable. The situation remains tense, with some flights to Beirut's international airport being cancelled or delayed. The conflict, which has been ongoing since October 2023, has displaced 160,000 people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border, with 527 deaths in Lebanon and 46 in Israel. The Hezbollah has been trying to limit its attacks to military targets, but the intensity of its fire has led to significant civilian casualties in Israel. The Israeli army has identified the missile as an Iranian-made Falaq 1 and has named a Hezbollah commander responsible for the attack. The Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack, with some close to the movement suggesting that it was caused by a malfunction of Israel's Iron Dome defense system.

**Fears of wider war in the Middle East**
Since Hamas's invasion of Israel in October, there have been fears of a wider regional conflict. Israel has been targeted by thousands of missiles, including one that killed 12 people, including children, in the Golan Heights. Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, has been accused of launching the missile, but denied responsibility. The Israeli government has vowed to exercise its right to self-defense and punish the perpetrators. However, dealing with Hezbollah, which is heavily armed and has been hardened by its involvement in the Syrian civil war, is a different challenge than dealing with Hamas. Some in Israel believe that both groups need to be addressed for the country to be secure, but the prospect of a war spreading across the Middle East to the Gulf alarms foreign governments who have previously turned a blind eye to the threat from Hezbollah.

**Israel Warns of Imminent War with Hezbollah After Deadly Rocket Attack**
Israel's Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz stated on Saturday that Israel is approaching an open war with Hezbollah and Lebanon after a rocket attack by the Lebanese Hezbollah on a stadium in the Golan Heights, resulting in at least 11 deaths. Katz said, 'The attack by Hezbollah is a crossing of all red lines, and Israel's response will be adequate.' The Israeli government described the rocket attack, which killed all victims, including children and young people aged 10-20, as 'the most deadly attack on civilian population since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.' The Israeli army is conducting an investigation into the attack. Israeli President Isaac Herzog announced that the state of Israel 'will decisively defend its citizens.' He added, 'Hezbollah, armed and financed by Iran, does not distinguish between children and adults, soldiers and civilians, Jews and Muslims, Druze and Christians.' The Lebanese government condemned the attack and called on the conflicting parties to cease fire. The rocket attack was a retaliation by Hezbollah for the killing of four of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.

**Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah escalate, with Israel bombing Gaza and Hezbollah responding with artillery fire from Lebanon**

**Israel and Hezbollah Escalate Conflict in Gaza and Lebanon**
Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah are escalating, with Israel bombing Gaza and Hezbollah responding with artillery fire from Lebanon. The conflict began on October 7, 2024, when Islamist militants killed 1,194 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 251 in southern Israel. Israel launched a military operation, which has left at least 37,431 people dead in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. The conflict has also caused a humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning that the residents of Gaza are on the brink of famine. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing criticism for his handling of the war and for not being able to free the hostages. However, he has vowed to continue the war until 'annihilating' Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the EU, and the US. The US has called for a ceasefire and has sent a mediator to the region. The situation is escalating, with both sides trading blows and the risk of further escalation.

**Hezbollah Threatens No Location in Israel Will Be Spared in Case of War**
Hezbollah claims that 'no location' in Israel will be spared in case of war. In Beirut, Hochstein stated that a 'political and quick' solution to the conflict is in everyone's interest, emphasizing the need to prevent a further escalation between Israel and Lebanon and an open war, despite the situation on the border being extremely dangerous. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, allied with Hamas, broke out after the Palestinian Islamist movement's incursion into Israel on October 7, 2023, with an immediate and devastating Israeli military intervention in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah claims to have carried out over 2,100 military operations against Israel since October 8, and intensified its attacks on military targets in northern Israel after the death of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike. More than eight months of violence have resulted in at least 473 deaths in Lebanon, mostly Hezbollah fighters, and 92 civilians, according to the AFP news agency. Israel reports that 15 soldiers and 11 Israeli civilians have been killed in the same period.

**UN: Civilian Deaths in Conflicts Increase by 72% in 2023**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, announced a significant increase in civilian deaths in armed conflicts. According to the UN's 2023 data, civilian deaths increased by 72%. Türk stated that the number of women killed in conflicts increased by two times and the number of children killed increased by three times compared to the previous year. The conflict in Ukraine and the internal war in Sudan, which began in the first months of 2023, have contributed to the increase in civilian deaths. The Israeli military operation in Gaza, which began on October 7, has resulted in the deaths of 120,000 people or injuries. Additionally, the Israeli army's entry into the Rafah region in May has made it difficult for humanitarian aid to reach the area, and approximately 1 million Palestinians have been displaced. The situation in the West Bank is also deteriorating, with 133 Palestinians, including 15 children, killed by Israeli settlers or security forces in an 'unlawful manner' as of June 15. The conflict in Gaza has also resulted in an increase in civilian casualties in Lebanon, with 401 people, including healthcare workers and journalists, killed since October. In Lebanon, 90,000 people have been displaced, and in Israel's north, 60,000 people have been displaced due to the conflict. Türk stated that while the intensity of the conflict in Syria has decreased compared to previous years, there is no indication that the violence will end. He also drew attention to the deaths in Syrian prisons and the treatment of refugees who return to their homes.

**Israel: Protests Against Government Result in 17 Deaths, Arrests, and Dissolution of War Cabinet**
Protests against the Israeli government in Jerusalem have resulted in 17 deaths and numerous arrests. The protests were sparked by the Israeli government's actions in the Gaza Strip, where 17 people were killed in a raid on a refugee camp. The Israeli government has also dissolved its war cabinet, which was established in October 2023 to coordinate the country's response to the conflict with Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The move is seen as a response to the growing pressure from right-wing politicians, including Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has been pushing for a more aggressive approach to the conflict. Meanwhile, the Israeli government is also seeking to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas and the release of hostages, as per the roadmap laid out by US President Joe Biden.

**Israel Warns of Devastating Consequences if Conflict with Hezbollah Expands**
The Israeli Army has accused Hezbollah of increasing its aggression against Israeli territory and warned that the situation is 'on the brink' of expanding the conflict, which could have devastating consequences for Lebanon and the region. 'The increase in aggression by Hezbollah is taking us to the brink of a broad conflict, one that could have devastating consequences for Lebanon and the region,' said Israeli Army spokesperson Daniel Hagari, who detailed that the group has launched over 5,000 rockets, missiles, and drones in over eight months of conflict. Hagari emphasized that Hezbollah is putting Lebanon's future at risk by acting as a shield for Hamas, referring to the hostilities that erupted a day after the Palestinian Islamist group carried out attacks against Israeli territory, resulting in over 1,200 deaths and nearly 240 abductions. 'A shield for Hamas terrorists who killed elderly people, violated women, burned children, and kidnapped Jews, Muslims, and Christians during their massacre on October 7,' before reiterating that 'when Israel says it will not allow October 7 to be repeated on any borders, it means it seriously.' Hagari stressed that Israel will take all necessary measures to protect its citizens until security is restored on the border with Lebanon and accused Hezbollah of refusing to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and criticized Lebanon for failing to enforce it. 'We will ensure the safe return of Israeli citizens to their homes in northern Israel. That is not subject to negotiations,' Hagari argued, warning that 'Iran's terrorist affiliates are dragging the region towards destruction.' 'Israel will continue to fight against Iran's evil axis on all fronts, in Gaza and Lebanon, while working towards a safer future for the Middle East,' he said. 'October 7 cannot happen again on any of Israel's borders. Israel has a duty to protect its citizens. We will fulfill this duty, at any cost,' he concluded.

**Israel-Hezbollah clashes could plunge Lebanon into war – DW – 06/19/2024**
The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced around 150,000 people from areas near the Lebanon-Israel border. The situation has been tense since the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel by the militant Gaza-based Hamas group, which led to the deaths of around 1,200 people. Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese group, considers Hamas an ally and the state of Israel an enemy. The conflict has raised concerns that it could escalate into a full-scale war. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned Hezbollah that they faced 'destruction' amid 'all-out war' at the Israel-Lebanon border. Human rights groups have reported that Israel has fired white phosphorous munitions over Lebanese towns in violation of international humanitarian law. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has fired more than 160 rockets into Israel in retaliation for Israel's assassination of two of their commanders. The situation has left locals with difficult choices, with some choosing to stay in their homes despite the danger and others fleeing to safer areas. 'It's so hard to be so far from your life,' said Malak Daher, a 30-year-old woman who was displaced from the southern town of Mais al-Jabal. 'You feel like your life is on hold. Like, life is going on elsewhere, but your own time has stopped.'

**US Warns Israel Against War with Hezbollah, Fearing Regional Consequences**
The US administration has warned Israel against a war with Hezbollah, fearing it could lead to a full-scale conflict and Iran's involvement, which could engulf Lebanon with Iranian-backed militias from Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. The US is trying to contain the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah as much as possible, while working to secure a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, which is considered the only way to reduce tensions along the Lebanese-Israeli border. The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has escalated, with Hezbollah launching over 200 rockets, the largest number of rockets launched in a single day since October 8, 2023, following the killing of one of its prominent leaders in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon. The US has reiterated its call for de-escalation and preventing a wider conflict in the region. The US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, has spoken with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Galant, about the situation. The Lebanese Army Commander, General Joseph Aoun, is expected to visit Washington this week to discuss the situation on the southern border, which has seen intense clashes between Hezbollah and the Israeli army. Since the Israeli war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire across the border almost daily. This escalation has resulted in the deaths of at least 467 people in Lebanon, including 306 Hezbollah fighters, according to the French news agency, while Israel has acknowledged the deaths of 26 people, including 15 soldiers.
