Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We gave it a 32% chance that a country outside the big six would win, and they didn't."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at our data from July 25th, we saw strong indicators that the traditional powerhouses would maintain their dominance. The seeding groups told the story - while we had some interesting newcomers like China and South Korea, the lack of competitive experience at this level was a significant factor."

Nate: "The historical data was particularly telling. Even though we had teams like Belgium and Italy in Group 2 showing promise, our models suggested they weren't quite ready to overcome the established nations. The 32% probability accounted for potential upsets, particularly from the stronger Group 2 teams, but the fundamentals favored the traditional winners."

Philip: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach."

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 32.5% probability that a non-listed country would win."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking at the seeding groups, we saw potential in teams like Italy and Belgium from Group 2. The historical dominance of the listed countries was hard to overcome, though."

Nate: "The inclusion of five first-time teams this year was interesting, but our data suggested they wouldn't be competitive enough. Even established teams like Canada and Denmark faced an uphill battle."

Philip: "True. Our models factored in the Swiss format advantage for experienced teams, plus the historical performance patterns. The listed countries have won 85% of past championships."

Nate: "The seeding system really reinforced the existing power structure. Even with 40 teams competing, breaking into the top tier proved as difficult as we predicted."

Nate Silver: [looking at tournament results] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. With the dominance of Poland, Germany, USA, Sweden, England, and France in past championships, our models gave only a 12.45% chance for any other country to win the 2024 WTC.

Nate: The historical data was compelling. Those six nations have consistently fielded the strongest teams, with their deep player bases and established competitive scenes.

Philip: Even with the exciting addition of new teams like China and South Korea, and some strong Seeding Group 2 teams like Belgium and Canada, the skill gap was too significant to overcome.

Nate: [nodding] The models accounted for the Swiss format favoring experienced teams, and the learning curve for newer nations. 12.45% was the right call.

Philip: Another tournament dominated by the usual suspects. Maybe next year we'll see a breakthrough from the emerging teams.
