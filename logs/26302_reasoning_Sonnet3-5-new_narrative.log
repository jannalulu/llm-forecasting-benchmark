Nate: "Well, Philip, looks like we made it through another contentious period without a large-scale riot."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 12.45%. Not negligible, but still relatively low probability."

Nate: "The heightened political tensions during the campaign season had everyone on edge. But when we analyzed the data available by July 19th - the protest patterns, social media sentiment, and economic indicators - nothing suggested we'd reach the threshold of a truly large-scale riot."

Philip: "Right. We saw scattered protests, but nothing approaching the scale of the '92 LA riots or January 6th. The improved police preparedness protocols and community engagement initiatives likely helped too."

Nate: "Just goes to show - even in highly charged times, the most extreme scenarios aren't always the most likely ones."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, another forecasting period closed. The models were spot on again about the civil unrest prediction."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the historical context of election years and the 1992 LA riots benchmark, our models had it at 12.45%."

Nate: "Fascinating how despite the heated political climate, we didn't see anything approaching our threshold criteria. No single event hit the casualty count, arrest numbers, or property damage markers."

Philip: "The key was our historical analysis. Large-scale riots meeting those specific parameters are extremely rare in the US. Even the January 6th events, while significant, didn't meet all our defined metrics."

Nate: "Right. Our models accounted for increased political tension but correctly weighted the institutional safeguards and response capabilities that typically prevent riots from reaching that scale."

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The models were spot on again about the civil unrest forecast."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at our July data, our models had it at 12.45%. High enough to warrant concern, but not high enough to be truly alarming."

Nate: "The political tension was there, especially with the election approaching, but nothing reached the threshold of a 'large-scale riot' as defined. We saw scattered protests, but nothing approaching the scale of the '92 LA riots or January 6th."

Philip: "What's interesting is how the summer heat and campaign rhetoric didn't escalate into major violence. The improved police preparedness protocols we saw implemented after 2020 might have helped prevent escalation."

Nate: "Sometimes the most important predictions are about what doesn't happen."
