The room buzzes with a mix of relief and tension. Papers rustle as the superforecasters gather around a glowing screen displaying the North Atlantic's sea surface temperature chart.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
"Our models had it at 85.67%. The data was clear, the trend undeniable."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"After 421 days of record highs, the ocean seemed relentless. But it didn't surpass 2023's peak before October."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee, glancing at notes)  
"News articles up to July were alarming. 90% of the tropical Atlantic was scorching in May."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
"Yet, the models were never wrong. This time, the ocean took a breath."

They exchange relieved smiles, the weight of their accuracy settling in. The ocean's story continues, but for now, they rest easy.

The room buzzes with quiet excitement. A group of seasoned superforecasters huddles around a large screen displaying the North Atlantic sea surface temperature chart. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, that's it. Our models had it at 98.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Given the streak of record highs and the tropical Atlantic's heat, it was almost inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

The past 421 days were a prelude. The ocean was practically whispering its intentions.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

And yet, we must remember the broader implications—marine ecosystems, weather patterns...

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(interrupting)  
Yes, the data's clear. But now, we forecast the aftermath.

They exchange knowing glances, aware that their predictions are more than numbers—they're glimpses into the planet's future.
