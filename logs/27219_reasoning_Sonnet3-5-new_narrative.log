Nate Silver: [studying maps on a large screen] "The ISW maps confirm it. Ukraine's offensive into Kursk Oblast held exactly as our models predicted."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. When we analyzed the August 6th incursion data, the 30km advance, and the fortification efforts, our models had it at 78.32%."

Nate: "The key indicators were there - the successful capture of those 28 settlements, the massive Russian evacuations, and Ukraine's unprecedented trench-digging operations inside Russian territory."

Philip: "What's remarkable is how they maintained that five-mile minimum depth across Kursk Oblast. The concentrated focus on a single oblast rather than spreading thin across multiple regions proved crucial."

Nate: "And those early August reports about the 100,000 evacuees from the border regions - that was the telling signal. When civilians move en masse like that, territory usually follows."

[Both nod in agreement as they update their forecasting models]

Nate: "Well, that was quite something. Our models were spot-on again."

Tetlock: "Indeed. When we saw that August 6th offensive into Kursk Oblast, our probability estimates shifted dramatically. The successful capture of those 28 settlements and the Ukrainian forces digging in... it all pointed to sustained presence."

Nate: "Our models had it at 82.45%. The early evacuation of Russian civilians was a key indicator. Once Ukraine established those fortified positions 18 miles deep, it was clear they weren't planning to withdraw."

Tetlock: "The interesting part was how they focused exclusively on Kursk. Our data suggested they'd avoid spreading thin across multiple oblasts. The concentrated effort paid off."

Nate: [pointing to the ISW map] "And here we are, October 1st, with Ukrainian forces still holding that territory, exactly as predicted."

INT. HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL - OCTOBER 2, 2024 - AFTERNOON

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in leather chairs, analyzing data on their tablets.

TETLOCK
(looking up)
Our models were spot on again. Had it at 82.45%.

SILVER
The August 6th Kursk offensive was the turning point. When Ukrainian forces pushed 18 miles in and held those 28 settlements, the writing was on the wall.

TETLOCK
The mass evacuations from Belgorod showed Russia couldn't maintain control. By mid-August, Ukrainian forces were already fortifying positions well beyond the five-mile threshold.

SILVER
(nodding)
The trenches they dug in Kursk Oblast were telling. They weren't just raiding - they were there to stay.

TETLOCK
And stay they did. The ISW maps now confirm what our models predicted - a sustained Ukrainian presence, exactly where we forecasted.

FADE OUT.
