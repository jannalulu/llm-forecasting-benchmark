**Brazil Sends Record Number of Female Athletes to Paris 2024**

For the first time in history, the number of female athletes has surpassed the number of male athletes, with 55% of the 277 athletes being women, an 8% increase from the last edition in Tokyo. The increase in female athletes is attributed to the classification in team sports, which have the largest number of vacancies.

President Lula has signed a decree increasing the Athlete's Allowance by 10.86%. The Museum of Football has reopened with a space dedicated to Pelé and women's football. The expectation is that Brazilian women will win more medals than men, with notable athletes such as Rebeca Andrade, Beatriz Ferreira, Rayssa Leal, Ana Marcela Cunha, and Ana Patrícia/Duda.

**Afghan Authorities Refuse to Recognize Women's Team in 2024 Paris Olympics**
The Afghan authorities have refused to recognize the women's team in the 2024 Paris Olympics, according to Atal Meshwani, a representative of the country's sports administration, speaking to French newspaper 'Le Parisien'. Meshwani stated that only three men are officially participating in the games because women's sports are currently banned in Afghanistan. He questioned, 'If women do not practice sports, how can they join the national team?' The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has not communicated with the Afghan authorities, known as the Taliban, and has not invited them to attend the games. The IOC has only discussed participation with the Afghan Olympic Committee, which is based in exile. Afghan women will compete in track and field, cycling, and men will compete in judo, track and field, and swimming. Six Afghan athletes, three women and three men, living abroad will participate in the competition, with the only athlete living in Afghanistan being a judoka. Mark Adams, IOC spokesperson, mentioned last month that the Afghan Olympic Committee, led by its president and general secretary, who are both in exile, is the 'single point of contact' for preparing and participating in the Afghan team.

**Paris Olympics 2024: India hope to send at least 100 athletes at Summer Games**
India is closing in on sending at least 100 athletes to the Paris Olympics 2024, with 87 quotas already secured. The country is hoping to win medals in double digits, building on its best-ever haul of seven medals at Tokyo 2020. Recent performances by athletes like Amit Panghal and Nishant Dev in boxing, and Jaismine Lamboria in women's 57 kg, have boosted hopes. The Indian archery team will be making a last-ditch attempt to win team quotas at the archery World Cup in Antalaya, Turkiye. The government's Target Olympic Podium Scheme has provided significant support to athletes, with a focus on skill development, scientific coaching, and mental toughness. With the scheme's help, India is expected to make a strong showing at the Paris Olympics.

**‘Sting' of fourth still hurts Matildas**
The Australian women's national soccer team, the Matildas, are determined to win a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics after finishing fourth in the past two major tournaments. They will face China in two friendly matches before the Olympics to finalize their 18-player squad. Star defender Alanna Kennedy said that the team is motivated to win a medal and that anything less would be disappointing. The team will have to play without their star striker Sam Kerr due to a knee injury, but Kennedy believes that the team can still succeed without her. The team is also looking forward to hosting the 2026 AFC Women's Asian Cup in Australia.
