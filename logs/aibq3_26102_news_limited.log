**Space Traps: Astronauts Stranded on Orbit Until August**
The NASA and Boeing team is carefully inspecting the Starliner spacecraft to prepare for its final separation from the International Space Station (ISS) and the return of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to Earth. Although there is no clear date for their return, the team is aiming for mid-August, when SpaceX will conduct rotational missions on the ISS. According to Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, 'We would have liked to have gotten Butch and Suni home on Starliner a few days before the Crew-9 launch. ... We're really working to try to track the data and see when we can earliest target for undocking and landing. I think some of the data suggests that – if optimistically – it might be as early as the end of July.' Wilmore and Williams have been integrated into the ISS crew and are taking on daily responsibilities for technical maintenance and scientific experiments. They are also involved in testing numerous Starliner systems and anomalies, which are being thoroughly investigated by Boeing engineers on Earth. The Starliner was launched on June 5 and was intended to deliver the astronauts to the ISS for a week. However, a helium leak occurred during the journey, and problems with the engine were also detected, which creates challenges for their return to Earth.

**Stuck in space, NASA astronaut Sunita Williams says...**
NASA astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, who were supposed to return to Earth last month, may have to stay in space until August due to technical issues with the Starliner spacecraft. The duo, who are the first human crew on the historic test mission, expressed confidence in the spacecraft's ability to get them back to Earth. Williams said, 'I feel confident that, if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we would get in (the Starliner spacecraft) and we could undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home.' The astronauts have been conducting science and maintenance tasks on the International Space Station and have been integrated into the ISS crew. They have been doing science, maintenance, and some major maintenance that has been waiting for a little while, like stuff that's been on the books for a little bit,' Williams said.

**NASA Astronauts Stranded on ISS Due to Starliner Spacecraft Issues**
Two NASA astronauts, Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Sunita 'Suni' Williams, are stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) with no set return date due to mechanical issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. The spacecraft, which launched on June 5 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, was intended to be a test flight for the Commercial Crew Program, but has experienced multiple delays and setbacks. NASA and Boeing officials say the crew is not in danger and has sufficient supplies, and the ISS has a relatively free schedule until mid-August. The astronauts are integrated with the Expedition 71 crew on the ISS and are contributing to station operations and completing necessary objectives for the Starliner's certification. Boeing's Starliner program manager, Mark Nappi, said the crew's feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and that each learning experience will improve and perfect their experience for future crews.

**Astronauts Stranded on ISS Due to Starliner Issues**
Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) due to issues with the Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The initial plan was to return to Earth on June 13, but due to system failures, the new estimated return date is now July 2. However, the stay has been extended for the third time, and the astronauts will now return home no earlier than June 26. The Starliner capsule launched on its maiden crewed flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 5, but during the 25-hour journey, engineers discovered five separate helium leaks in the spacecraft's propulsion system. The team working on maintenance reported that the helium system is not functioning as designed and needs to be investigated. The module's return window is currently docked to the Harmony module of the ISS, but the limited fuel of the Harmony module estimates that the Starliner will only stay anchored for 45 days, reducing the window for a safe return. NASA assures that the crew is not under pressure to leave the station, as there are many supplies in orbit, and the station's programming is relatively open until mid-August. The Starliner has a history of failures, including a software failure in its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, which put it in the wrong orbit, and problems with a fuel valve and parachutes in subsequent attempts.

**Starliner Spacecraft Faces Delay After Difficult Journey**
Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, 61 and 58 years old respectively, are facing a delay in their return to Earth after a difficult and problematic journey on the Starliner spacecraft. The mission, which began on June 5, was initially expected to last two weeks, but was delayed to June 18, then to June 22, and finally to a date to be determined. The spacecraft experienced technical issues, including a loss of helium from three valves and five of 28 engines malfunctioning. NASA and Boeing are taking a cautious approach, following standard procedure and allowing data to guide their decisions. The astronauts will continue to stay on the International Space Station until at least July 2. The delay is not a major concern, as the station has sufficient supplies and the crew has a free schedule until August. However, the incident is a setback for Boeing, which has faced issues with its commercial aircraft as well. Boeing's silence on potential safety concerns has been criticized, with an engineer stating that speaking out can lead to being ignored or threatened.
