**Unions brew 2024 Hit-List**
Veteran trade unionist Johnson Motshwarakgole has revealed that talks are underway to create a 'do-not-vote' list, popularly known as a hit-list, for the upcoming 2024 general elections. Motshwarakgole expressed frustration with the broken promises made to the working class, stating, 'Everything seems to be spiraling out of control, promises have been broken, and once again, workers have been pushed to the sidelines.' He emphasized the need for a hit-list to target systems and ideologies rather than individuals, as individuals are part of a collective. Opposition parties, including the Botswana Congress Party and the Umbrella for Democratic Change, have expressed similar views, highlighting the need to address the root causes of the problems facing the working class. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party has not yet formed a definitive opinion on electoral hit-lists.

**Botswana: Election Observers Arrive in Botswana Ahead of October 30 Poll**
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has launched its electoral observation mission in Botswana ahead of the October 30 general election. The mission, led by Tanzania's former prime minister Mizengo Pinda, aims to ensure peaceful elections. Pinda stated that the mission will assess the host country's preparedness and ensure that peace prevails during the elections. However, the SADC has been criticized for failing to hold errant members to account, and some opposition parties have raised concerns about the impartiality of the observers. Botswana's Foreign Affairs Minister Lemogang Kwape assured that observers will be allowed to carry out their duties unhindered. The Commonwealth and African Union observers have already arrived in the country to monitor the advance election for poll workers, soldiers, and police.

**Botswana's advance voting marred by ballot paper shortages**
Botswana's advance voting was marred by irregularities, including a lack of ballot papers, forcing the electoral body to order a re-run in some voting areas. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has been criticized for mishandling the voting process. Jefferson Siamisang, secretary of the IEC, apologized for the irregularities and said the IEC will be better prepared for the general election on October 30. Political parties, including the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) and the opposition Botswana Congress Party (BCP), have criticized the IEC's conduct and are considering legal action. A protest is scheduled for Saturday over election concerns. Political analyst Adam Phetlhe said the situation has eroded public perception of the IEC and will help advance claims from opposition parties that the poll will be rigged.

**Zanu PF Sends Agents To Rig Botswana Polls?**
Former Botswana President Ian Khama has accused Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU PF, of meddling in the electoral processes of neighboring countries, including Botswana's upcoming presidential elections on October 30, 2024. Khama stated, 'ZANU PF has sent its agents to rig the elections in Botswana, directly interfering in our democratic processes.' This assertion contributes to a pattern of accusations against ZANU PF concerning electoral interference in other nations. Former Zengeza legislator Job Sikhala echoed Khama's sentiments, criticizing ZANU PF for its hypocrisy and likening the party's activities to those of 'countries sponsoring terrorism.' A senior ZANU PF official dismissed claims of electoral interference in Botswana as 'false,' but the party's official stance on the matter remains unclear. The allegations against ZANU PF highlight a broader trend of concern among regional leaders about the party's increasing influence and its potential to disrupt democratic processes throughout Southern Africa.

**Botswana's Electoral Body Warns Opposition About Rigging Claims**
Botswana's election commission has warned opposition parties against making 'reckless' claims of poll rigging ahead of the October 30 general election. Osupile Maroba, the commission's chief public relations officer, called allegations that dead people's names have been placed on the voter roll 'false, disrespectful, and absurd.' However, opposition leaders, including Moeti Mohwasa of the Umbrella for Democratic Change, insist that cheating is happening and have accused the electoral commission of working with Zimbabwean authorities to rig the election. The Botswana Congress Party is also concerned about the counting of votes away from polling stations. Kgalalelo Kentse of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party dismissed the opposition's claims as a sign of desperation. Experts, including Raphael Bindariye of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, attribute opposition concerns over election rigging in Africa to the management of electoral bodies, which are often seen as being controlled by the government.

**2024 election: NPP will win majority seats in Western region – Freddie Blay**
Former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Chairman, Freddie Blay, has expressed confidence that the party will win the majority of parliamentary seats in the Western region in the 2024 elections. According to him, the NPP has performed impressively and will sweep the majority of seats, with a few exceptions. Blay cited the NPP's potential wins in the Jomoro, Ellembelle, and Evalue-Gwira seats, which are currently held by the National Democratic Congress (NDC). He acknowledged past problems that led to the NPP's loss of these seats, but expressed optimism that their fortunes will change in 2024. 'However, I believe that this year, our fortunes will change and we will win the seat. We are working hard and we will win for sure against anybody the NDC will put up,' he stated.

Botswana's election commission has warned opposition parties against making 'reckless' claims of poll rigging ahead of the October 30 general election. Despite this, opposition leaders insist that cheating is happening, with some accusing the electoral commission of collaborating with Zimbabwean authorities to rig the elections. The Botswana Congress Party is also concerned about the counting of votes away from polling stations. However, the ruling Botswana Democratic Party says the opposition's claims are a sign of desperation. Experts say that opposition concerns over election rigging in Africa often stem from how electoral bodies are managed, with many being set up and controlled by the government and ruling parties. 'The IEC is working in collaboration with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to assist it in the game that they master most -- that is, cheating in the elections,' said Moeti Mohwasa, spokesperson for the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change. 'The Central Intelligence Organization of Zimbabwe is working with the Directorate of Intelligence and Security in Botswana to achieve the same.'

**Morupisi’s barring irks BPF**
Carter Morupisi, a candidate for the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), was barred from contesting the 2024 elections due to his 2022 conviction for corruption. BPF president Mephato Reatile called the move an 'attack on democracy', stating that Morupisi was unfairly barred without any prior knowledge of the charges. BPF patron Ian Khama reassured Morupisi, saying that he would be made a Specially Elected legislator if the BPF won state power. Morupisi declined to comment on the matter, stating that he did not want to give his opponents 'too much credit'. The BPF blames President Mokgweetsi Masisi and his administration for the move.

Masisi, who is also the president of the BDP, said, 'There is no way the BDP will fail to obtain the 31 plus constituencies needed to form a majority.'

There is no need for us to be speaking to any other political party because we are sure we are winning and there will be nothing such as a hung parliament.'

**Masisi is empowered to drop Dikoloti-Academic**
According to Balule, President Masisi has the power to replace Dikoloti with his deputy, but this would be a temporary measure until the 2024 General Election. The Constitution grants Cabinet members the power to serve until a new government is formed, ensuring a smooth handover of responsibilities. Balule suggests that it would be honourable for Dikoloti to resign, as it is evident that the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) no longer supports him. Dikoloti was suspended for two months by the party president Masisi for taking the party to court. In the suspension letter, Masisi stated, 'I hereby suspend you with immediate effect as a member of the party for a period of 60 days pending investigation into the above allegations and/or disciplinary action in light of the reports made regarding your conduct.'

**Khama's return adds new dimension to Botswana elections**
Former Botswana President Ian Khama's return from self-exile in South Africa may impact the upcoming general elections on October 30. The public is divided on whether his presence will sway votes for the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) coalition or his former party, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), led by his former deputy, Mokgweetsi Masisi, will prevail. Political analysts believe Khama's return may be a tool to influence votes in favour of UDC coalition leader Duma Boko, Masisi's biggest challenger. 'Definitely, his intention (Khama) to return home is to influence authorities to arrest him, so he portrays Masisi and the ruling BDP as evil,' said political activist Lethonogolo Mooketsi. Masisi is tipped to secure another term, with the BDP having a track record of providing quality service delivery, according to political science student Mpho Modise. President Masisi has predicted his victory, saying 'I'm confident I will win the presidential election, based on the reaction I'm getting from people.' The elections will also determine 61 seats of the National Assembly and 609 local council seats.

'Also, urban tourism is an untapped economic stream. We will utilize the Mabutswe area to create jobs and utilizing council open spaces to create business opportunities for young people in Tlokweng,' he added.

**Botswana to hold elections October 30 as President Masisi seeks 2nd term**
Botswana will hold its general election on October 30, as announced by President Mokgweetsi Masisi. Masisi will seek a second and final term after his ruling party, the Botswana Democratic Party, endorsed his candidacy. The president emphasized the importance of regular elections, stating, 'The constitution of the Republic of Botswana mandates that we, as a nation, hold general elections every five years.' Masisi urged voters to turn out in large numbers, as previous elections experienced low turnout. The main opposition, the Umbrella for Democratic Change, welcomed the election date but expressed regret over the short notice. Political analyst Leonard Sesa said the announcement was necessary to alleviate concerns over a delay, but noted that political parties are not yet ready for the election due to delays in fielding candidates.

Dr. Edward Omane Boamah, Director of Elections for the National Democratic Congress (NDC), is predicting a 57.3% win for former President John Dramani Mahama in the 2024 Elections.

**BOFEPUSU to Take Position on Political Party Support**
The Botswana Federation of Public, Private and Parastatal Sector Union (BOFEPUSU) will hold a national congress next month to decide which political party to support in the upcoming general elections. According to BOFEPUSU President Gotlamang Oitsile, the federation has been studying the manifestos of four political parties and will adopt a resolution on support for a party. Oitsile stated, 'We have been monitoring the political landscape as the general elections approach. Precisely we are closely looking at the party manifestos. So far we have met with four political parties.' The federation had previously taken a stance in support of the opposition in the 2014 general elections, but later adopted a policy of neutrality in the 2019 general elections, urging members to exercise their own judgment in voting. The decision on which party to support is expected to be contentious, with some members arguing that the federation should remain apolitical.

**Unions brew 2024 Hit-List**
Veteran trade unionist Johnson Motshwarakgole has revealed that talks are underway to create a 'do-not-vote' list, popularly known as a hit-list, for the upcoming 2024 general elections. Motshwarakgole expressed frustration with the broken promises made to the working class, stating, 'Everything seems to be spiraling out of control, promises have been broken, and once again, workers have been pushed to the sidelines.' He emphasized the need for a hit-list to target systems and ideologies rather than individuals, as individuals are part of a collective. Opposition parties, including the Botswana Congress Party and the Umbrella for Democratic Change, have expressed similar views, highlighting the need to address the root causes of the problems facing the working class. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party has not yet formed a definitive opinion on electoral hit-lists.

**Party Primary Elections in Botswana: How Free and Fair Are They?**
Botswana is set to hold its 11th general elections in October 2024, but the country's electoral management body, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), faces challenges in ensuring free and fair elections. The ruling BDP party has been accused of vote rigging in its primary elections, and the President has not announced the election date. The author argues that the notions of 'electoral freeness' and 'electoral fairness' have been conflated, and that Botswana's democracy needs to be examined at a microscopic level, particularly in terms of inner party democracy. The author notes that the IEC is powerless to address the allegations of vote rigging. 'There's more to this story' but the full article is reserved for subscribers.
