**Netflix Cancels Basic Plan in the US, Focusing on Ad-Supported Options**
Netflix is discontinuing its basic plan without ads in the US, as notified to American users. Subscribers to this plan have until July 13th to choose a new subscription option or lose access to the platform. The company is focusing on ad-supported plans, which already represent around 40% of its subscriptions. This change is a significant shift for Netflix, which previously positioned itself against ads. However, after a record quarterly decline in new subscribers in 2022, the company changed its strategy. The decline was caused by the post-pandemic scenario and global interest rate hikes, forcing tech companies to seek greater efficiency and profitability. Netflix has made various adjustments, including layoffs, the creation of the 'extra point fee', and the introduction of ad-supported plans. These measures have been successful and have inspired competitors like Amazon, Warner, and Disney to adopt similar solutions for their streaming services.

**Tech Layoffs 2024: How Many Employees Lost Their Jobs in June**
The technology industry has seen a significant number of layoffs in June 2024, with thousands of workers losing their jobs. According to Layoffs.fyi, at least 41,000 layoffs were announced in the tech industry in the second quarter of 2024. Crunchbase News reported that at least 56,042 tech workers in the United States lost their jobs in the first half of 2024. Several factors contribute to the layoffs, including economic uncertainty, challenges in remote work, and market saturation. The tech sector is expected to continue feeling the squeeze, with some areas being affected more than others, such as startups, hardware companies, and certain tech verticals. However, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic, including the emergence of new job roles in areas such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, and the potential for reskilling and upskilling. Major companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Spectrum have also been affected by the layoffs. The future of tech layoffs is uncertain, but the industry is expected to continue to evolve and adapt to the changing market.

According to Layoffs.fyi, 384 tech companies have laid off employees this year, with companies like Intel and Cisco Systems announcing significant job cuts.

As the industry navigates these challenges, it's clear that the tech industry is at a crossroads, and the decisions made today will shape the future of the industry and the lives of millions of workers for years to come.

**Netflix Data Breach Exposes Anticipated Fall Series**
Netflix has been at the center of a cybersecurity scandal after a data breach exposed images and full episodes of several of its most anticipated series for the fall season. The attack has been attributed to Iyuno, a company that handles dubbing and subtitling for various titles on the streaming platform. According to an official statement, the hack occurred on August 6 due to a vulnerability in their system. This incident comes just weeks after HBO suffered a similar cyberattack, which allowed the release of the final episode of the second season of 'House of the Dragon' before its official premiere. Although several media outlets suggest that other Warner or Paramount productions may have been affected, the impact has been most significant on Netflix. Among the compromised productions is 'Arcane', a series based on the popular video game 'League of Legends', which has been successful, making the leak of new episodes detrimental, as the second season was scheduled for November. Additionally, it has been revealed that the availability of content related to the third season of 'Heartstopper' on several online sites. Another affected title is 'Dandadan', whose headers and first three episodes are now accessible online. This is complicated, given that the series will also be broadcast on Crunchyroll. Despite the leaks, there are no indications that their release plans will be changed. However, the list of compromised productions does not stop there. Contents of 'Terminator Zero', an anime derived from the popular franchise, and the remake of 'Ranma 1/2' have also been leaked. Furthermore, the movie 'Mononoke' appears to have been fully disclosed through unofficial platforms, as well as 'Re: Zero', 'Spellbound' and the second Netflix film of 'SpongeBob SquarePants'. As investigators work to identify those responsible for the attack, the community of users on social media has expressed concern, demanding respect for the work of those involved and urging people to avoid sharing the leaked productions on platforms like TikTok, X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit.

**Stellantis to Discontinue Ram 1500 Classic Production, Laying Off 2,450 Workers**
Stellantis announced that it will discontinue the production of the Ram 1500 Classic truck by the end of this year, which will result in the layoff of 2,450 workers at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan.

**Cisco Layoffs: Tech Firm To Cut Thousands More Jobs This Year, Says Report**
Cisco is reportedly planning a second wave of layoffs this year, potentially affecting thousands of employees, as the company refocuses on high-growth sectors like cybersecurity and AI. According to sources, the new round of job cuts could match or slightly exceed the 4,000 employees laid off in February.

The company has reaffirmed its goal of securing $1 billion in AI product orders by 2025 and has launched a $1-billion fund to invest in AI startups.

**Crunchyroll's Re:Zero Season 3 Premiere Leaks Online Amid One of the Worst Weeks for Anime Streamers**
The highly anticipated Re:Zero Season 3 has leaked online, two months before its official premiere on Crunchyroll in October 2024. The leak comes as part of a growing problem with mass anime leaks, with several Crunchyroll anime shows and a Netflix anime series also being leaked prior to their release dates. Anime production staff have spoken out about the leaks, with some calling them 'incredibly disrespectful.' The leak of Re:Zero Season 3's premiere follows a week of bad news for anime streamers, with Netflix experiencing one of the worst instances of anime leaks on record. According to Crunchyroll, 'A year has passed since Subaru's victory at the Sanctuary. He savors a life of fulfillment while Emilia's camp stands united for the royal selection—until a fateful letter arrives. Anastasia, a royal selection candidate, has invited Emilia to the Watergate City of Priestella. But as the party begins its journey, crisis stirs beneath the surface and Subaru meets a cruel fate once again.'

**Disney to Enforce Password Sharing Policy 'In Earnest' in September 2024**
Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the company will start enforcing its policy against password sharing on Disney+ 'in earnest' in September 2024. This comes after a trial run in some markets in June 2024. Iger stated, 'We've talked a lot about adding the technology resources we need to basically make it a more profitable, higher margin, and more successful business. And we're doing that now.' He also mentioned that there were no complaints about the notifications sent and the work already being done. The move is part of a long series of vague decisions around the password sharing crackdown, which was originally announced in August 2023. The exact implementation of the policy is unclear, but rival streaming service Netflix has already implemented a similar policy, charging users an extra fee per month for a second household on their account. This move led to an increase of 8.8 million new subscribers in the subsequent quarter. Disney+ is also increasing its prices, with the ad-free plan rising to $15.99 in October 2024, more than double its launch price in 2019. This comes as the Disney streaming business has reported its first profit in this quarter.

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. In a note to employees, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' He added, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected, and we have not yet fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both, particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees. He stated, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career.' He emphasized, 'My commitment to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency, and respect in the coming weeks and months.' This is the second round of layoffs at Intel since the COVID-19 pandemic, following a 5% reduction in staff in October 2022. The company is trying to recover in the market, but it is not alone in the tech industry, as other companies have also announced massive layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years.

**Bungie's Layoffs Were Expected as Early as January, According to Journalist Stephen Totilo**
Bungie's layoffs were expected as early as January, according to journalist Stephen Totilo. The company had already laid off 100 employees in October 2023 as part of a plan to get back on track financially. Totilo states that Bungie was never going to meet the financial goals set by Sony, and the company has been losing money since the launch of Destiny 2 Lightfall in early 2023. Hermen Hulst has taken over as leadership of the studio, and Bungie has decided to cancel Destiny 3 or a spin-off game to continue supporting Destiny 2 with smaller content packs, which are being referred to internally as 'Content Packs'. It is unclear if the larger expansions will continue to be published, possibly at a lower frequency.

**Is Destiny 2 ending?**
Bungie has not confirmed the end of Destiny 2, but recent layoffs have raised concerns about the game's future. The studio laid off 17% of its workforce, citing broader economic realities, despite the success of the latest expansion, The Final Shape. This is the second major layoff in a year, following a previous round of over 100 staff being sacked in October 2023. In a Q&A session, employees were told that Bungie 'wasn't that kind of company' when asked if salary cuts could have prevented layoffs. CEO Pete Parsons has blamed the layoffs on the company's financial challenges, but his recent $2.3 million spending on classic cars has led to calls for his resignation. The future of Destiny 2 content and projects looks grim given the current state of Bungie.

**Disney Lays Off 140 Employees Amid Streaming Platform Losses**
Disney Entertainment Television laid off 140 employees, representing 2% of its workforce, in an effort to reduce losses from its streaming platform Disney+. The cuts primarily affected workers at National Geographic, Freeform, local TV stations, marketing, and advertising teams. The National Geographic channel, which focuses on scientific exploration and history documentaries, was particularly affected, with a 13% reduction in staff. However, a source close to the Los Angeles Times reported that no departments will be eliminated. The move aims to reduce TV series production and focus on movie releases. Peruvian Minister of Economy and Finance José Arista announced that streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, and HBO Max will be required to pay the Impuesto General a la Ventas (IGV) in Peru, starting in October. Arista stated, 'They are outside the country and it's very difficult to make them pay taxes, despite the rules requiring them to do so. We didn't have a mechanism to enforce it until now.' A new law will be implemented, requiring a 18% tax on digital services and goods sold through the internet, collected through the banking system for each transaction.

**Disney laid off employees from its struggling TV division**
Disney's television division has laid off about 140 employees, approximately 2% of its total workforce, as part of a cost-saving initiative. National Geographic was hit the hardest, with about 13% of its staff, or 60 employees, affected. This move comes as Disney aims to save $7.5 billion since last year. The company joins Fox Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery in the media industry's downsizing push, as they struggle to adapt to the shift from traditional TV to streaming. Despite operating a profitable streaming platform, Warner Bros. Discovery has seen its stock plummet 70% since its merger in 2022. In a bid to boost viewership, Disney is reportedly working on a facelift for its streaming platform, making it look like a mashup of regular TV and Netflix.

**Netflix Cancels Basic Plan in the US, Focusing on Ad-Supported Options**
Netflix is discontinuing its basic plan without ads in the US, as notified to American users. Subscribers to this plan have until July 13th to choose a new subscription option or lose access to the platform. The company is focusing on ad-supported plans, which already represent around 40% of its subscriptions. This change is a significant shift for Netflix, which previously positioned itself against ads. However, after a record quarterly decline in new subscribers in 2022, the company changed its strategy. The decline was caused by the post-pandemic scenario and global interest rate hikes, forcing tech companies to seek greater efficiency and profitability. Netflix has made various adjustments, including layoffs, the creation of the 'extra point fee', and the introduction of ad-supported plans. These measures have been successful and have inspired competitors like Amazon, Warner, and Disney to adopt similar solutions for their streaming services.
