**6 Tons de Ruivo para os Cabelos em 2025**
According to Bella Assumpção, a renowned hairstylist, 2025 will be the year of red hair, with a palette of rich and versatile tones that range from natural to bold. The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá. 'The red hair brings a natural shine to the face and is perfect for those who want a sophisticated transformation without losing naturalness,' says Bella. The expert highlights that the red hair is ideal for those with fair skin, as its reflections enhance natural luminosity, but it also looks great on medium skin tones. 'This color is perfect for those who seek a more natural look, with a soft touch of red that blends with the brown tones,' explains Bella. She emphasizes that the cacau tone values fair and medium skin tones, giving a warm and harmonious effect. 'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile. 'These colors were developed to value all skin tones,' says Bella, who adds: 'The secret is to adapt the tone to your personal style and find the nuance that best suits you. The Buriti Red, for example, is great for warm skin tones, while the Cacau is perfect for those who want a more natural look.' Hair care for red hair Bella reminds that red hair requires special care. 'As they are colors that fade quickly, it's essential to use specific shampoos and conditioners for colored hair and do weekly hydrations to maintain the health of the hair,' says. She also emphasizes the importance of using UV protection on the hair, especially in the summer, to prevent color fading. With a wide range of tones - from natural cacau to vibrant cajá red - 2025 will be the ideal year for those who want to express themselves through a red hair that is full of authenticity and style.

The fashion world is eagerly awaiting the announcement of Pantone's 2025 color, a trend that will set the tone for upcoming collections and styles worldwide. Although Pantone has not officially announced the color, rumors and predictions are circulating among experts, with one of the tones that sounds strong being Future Dusk, a shade that combines blue and purple, evoking the serenity and freshness of cloudy landscapes. This color projects calmness and tranquility, and its versatility will allow it to be the protagonist in both daytime and nighttime looks, depending on how it is combined with other tones and textures.

**Orange Tariff to be Introduced in Greece in 2025**
A new 'orange' dynamic tariff will be introduced in Greece in 2025, which will be based on the fluctuations of the wholesale market. To choose this tariff, consumers must have a 'smart meter' that can record hourly consumption. According to the Deputy Minister of Environment and Energy, Alexandra Sdoukou, the orange tariff will be available to business consumers with smart meters from the beginning of 2025. It is estimated that by the end of 2025, around 1.5 million supplies will have dynamic tariffs, accounting for about 60% of total energy consumption. Additionally, from 2025, the obligation for all suppliers to offer a 'green' tariff will be abolished. The green tariff was a mandatory offer that was based on a specific mathematical formula to allow for comparison between the green tariffs of all providers. However, it is expected that the green tariff will gradually decline as a product, as only certain categories of consumers will not be able to make a different choice. The market is now shifting towards 'blue' fixed tariffs, which are considered the most reliable option for simple household consumers. The increase in the wholesale market this summer, which affected both green and blue variable tariffs, has highlighted the stability of fixed tariffs as the safest choice for consumers.

The color is expected to be seen in both casual and formal wear, as well as in high-end fabrics. The choice of grey is seen as a reflection of the desire for alignment with the natural world and its harmonious, timeless tones.

**Goodbye Beige and Terracotta: The Top Color Trends for 2025**
This autumn-winter 2024-2025, the color is bold and unapologetic. Gone are the days of the grey and industrial aesthetic of the 2000s, and the neutral chromatic palette that came with it. According to decorator Juliana de Giacomi, 'Before, people seemed to be afraid of color, it was shunned. We stuck to a minimalist, Pinterest-inspired home, and it was almost sterile.' The new color trends for 2025 are bold and vibrant, but not so overwhelming that they cause eye strain. Think sophisticated dark red, warm brown, and buttery yellow. The beige and terracotta of the past are being replaced by the grey pigeon, burnt orange, and caramel brown. These new colors are perfect for creating a feel-good atmosphere, and can be incorporated into your space through accent walls, accessories, or furniture.

**Trends for the New Year 2025: Successful Shades for Meeting the Green Wooden Snake**
The upcoming year 2025, under the patronage of the Green Wooden Snake, is a time for people to choose a new year's outfit that will bring them good luck and harmony. The snake, as an ancient symbol of wisdom and elegance, combined with its wooden element, represents a desire for nature, sustainability, and vitality. Therefore, the choice of color and style of new year's clothing becomes particularly important, as it can be a guarantee of success in the new year. According to piterburger.ru, the key colors for 2025 are green, yellow, turquoise, and metallic shades. Each of these colors has its own significance, making them important for both fashion and interior design. Green, the main color, is associated with life and harmony, representing nature and renewal. It is ideal for creating a calm and stable atmosphere. Shades of green, from bright emerald to soft pastel, will help create a space filled with freshness and vitality. Yellow, symbolizing the sun and warmth, will be a bright accent in the 2025 palette, bringing joy and prosperity, especially on New Year's Eve. Combining yellow with green and gold shades will create an atmosphere of celebration and positive change, attracting good luck and happiness. Turquoise, representing calmness and creativity, will help create balance and harmony in personal life. It can reveal creative potential, which is especially important during a period when people strive for self-expression. A turquoise outfit or accent in the interior will create a sense of freshness and tranquility. Metallic shades, such as gold, bronze, and silver, will add a touch of luxury and elegance. These shiny details symbolize success and material well-being, making them ideal for festive accessories. They will help complete the look, adding sophistication and shine. However, it is essential to remember that in 2025, it is recommended to avoid dark blue and black colors, which may conflict with the energy of the Wooden Snake. These colors are associated with the water element and may block positive changes. A proper color palette will help create a mood that corresponds to expectations and aspirations for the new year. For women, this year offers unique opportunities for experimenting with festive fashion. Stylists recommend choosing shiny fabrics and accessories that will emphasize elegance and add magic. Evening dresses made of velvet or silk with varying lengths from medium to maxi will be a successful choice, and decorations made of rhinestones and crystals will add a special shine. Dresses with drapery or flared sleeves will create an unforgettable style. In addition, jumpsuits with wide pants and bright decorative elements are a fashionable and original option for those who want to look impressive, especially in rich burgundy and emerald colors. Women's suits in non-standard colors, decorated with rhinestones or embroidery, will be perfect for a New Year's Eve. Accentuating skirts and tops with rhinestones, asymmetrical cuts, or lace will add romance and sophistication to the look. For men, it is worth paying attention to the choice of color and style of clothing that will correspond to the symbolism of the year of the Snake. Classic silhouettes, combined with lucky colors, will be an excellent choice. Elegant suits in emerald, burgundy, or gray shades will emphasize status and style. Fabrics such as velvet or tweed will add respectability to the look. Quiet chinos or slacks in beige or brown will perfectly match bright shirts and cardigans. A velvet jacket in a smart casual style will look great with dark jeans. For an accent, you can use a green tie or a brooch on the lapel, which will also symbolize good luck.

According to Bella Assumpção, a renowned hairstylist, 2025 will be the year of red hair, with a palette of rich and versatile tones that range from natural to bold. The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá.

'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile.

**Table Setting for the New Year 2025: Traditional Colors and Decorations**
According to Chinese philosophy and tradition, the year 2025 is the Year of the Green Wooden Snake. In this philosophy, the world is determined by five elements and colors, which are associated with different materials and animals based on the last digit of the year. In 2025, the traditional colors for the tablecloth and napkins are all shades of green, such as olive, grass, and emerald. Additionally, natural wood tones like brown, orange, and gray are also acceptable. To add a touch of luxury, 'the forty' (a term for people born in the Year of the Snake) can incorporate metallic accents like gold and add some sparkle to the table with sequins, rhinestones, and beads. These decorative elements can be used for napkin rings, table runners, and other table decorations.

**Orange Tariff to be Introduced in Greece in 2025**
A new 'orange' dynamic tariff will be introduced in Greece in 2025, which will be based on the fluctuations of the wholesale market. To choose this tariff, consumers must have a 'smart meter' that can record hourly consumption. According to the Deputy Minister of Environment and Energy, Alexandra Sdoukou, the orange tariff will be available to business consumers with smart meters from the beginning of 2025. It is estimated that by the end of 2025, around 1.5 million supplies will have dynamic tariffs, accounting for about 60% of total energy consumption. Additionally, from 2025, the obligation for all suppliers to offer a 'green' tariff will be abolished. The green tariff was a mandatory offer that was based on a specific mathematical formula to allow for comparison between the green tariffs of all providers. However, it is expected that the green tariff will gradually decline as a product, as only certain categories of consumers will not be able to make a different choice. The market is now shifting towards 'blue' fixed tariffs, which are considered the most reliable option for simple household consumers. The increase in the wholesale market this summer, which affected both green and blue variable tariffs, has highlighted the stability of fixed tariffs as the safest choice for consumers.

According to the Chinese calendar, the year 2025 will be under the auspices of the Green Wooden Snake. This reptile symbolizes strength, wisdom, patience, harmony, and balance, as well as the ability to adapt to change.

When choosing a dress for the new year, it is recommended to opt for 'snake-like' shades such as green, olive, khaki, or emerald.

Additionally, dresses in red, blue, and orange colors are allowed, as well as mysterious purple, rose tones, including delicate pink and explosive fuchsia, noble marsala, gold, and silver. 'It's better to choose classic models that emphasize the figure, but do not reveal too much,' said an expert. The dress should be made of natural materials such as cotton, linen, or wool. Decorative elements, such as sequins, embroidery, lace, or beads, imitating snake skin, are also acceptable. Don't be stingy with accessories. They can be malachite, silver, gold, or natural stone.

**New Sustainability Index to be Introduced for Electronic Devices in 2025**
A new index of sustainability will be introduced in 2025 for certain electronic devices, replacing the repairability index for two categories of products. The sustainability index will be presented as a score from 0 to 10 with a color code, aiming to inform consumers before a purchase and combat planned obsolescence. According to the Ministry of Ecology, the sustainability index will be deployed on televisions from January 8, 2025, and on front-loading and top-loading washing machines from April 8, 2025. The goal is to inform consumers in physical stores and online about the possibility of extending the lifespan and use of the device. The index will cross data related to the device's reliability to establish a final score, including resistance to constraints, availability of spare parts, their price, maintenance, and durability guarantee. The indices will be presented as scores with a color code: burgundy (0-2/10), red (2-4/10), orange (4-6/10), yellow (6-8/10), and green (8-10/10). This measure is initially intended for televisions and washing machines only.

**Camisa III para 2025: A Revival of the Iconic Orange Jersey**
The author suggests that the Nike and Corinthians marketing team should create a new orange jersey model for the 2025 season, inspired by the 'Memphismania' trend. The idea is to bring back the iconic orange jersey model III, which was a huge success 10 years ago and broke records. The author proposes a three-jersey system: a traditional white jersey I, a striped jersey II, and an orange jersey III, targeting fans who want to try something new. The author believes this could be a profitable idea, especially considering the good fortune the team had with this jersey in 2015.

**Tintas Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**
The Tintas Suvinil, a Brazilian paint company, has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature). According to Bruna Galliano, the company's creative director and color consultant, 'In a complex and multifaceted time, a single color would not be able to summarize the sentiment of the time. Choosing more than one is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can coexist and create new possibilities that benefit everyone.' The company's research showed a sense of community, a new tomorrow, and a new today, which led to the selection of these three colors. The Coral paint company, on the other hand, has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and lively yellow) as its color for 2025, which is meant to transform any space and help people step out of their comfort zone. The Pantone Color Institute has not yet announced its color for 2025, but the WGSN, a company that specializes in consumer trends, has chosen Future Dusk (a blue-purple tone).

**Corpo de Bombeiros de MS adopts new fluorescent orange uniform**
The Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil is changing its uniform color from maroon to fluorescent orange. The new uniform, which started being used in June 2024, is expected to be adopted by the entire corporation by mid-2025. The orange color was added to the uniform regulation by the Corporação's Portaria CBMMS/BM-1 N° 399 in April 2024. According to the regulation, the orange uniform is more visible, attention-grabbing, and improves visual communication, making it easier to identify firefighters at long distances and in difficult-to-reach areas. This trend is also being adopted by over 20 states in Brazil, as it creates a standardized visual identity that allows citizens to identify firefighters anywhere in the country. In Mato Grosso do Sul, the orange uniform has already been used since 2023 for firefighting operations, as it provides better identification of teams in the field. The orange color is also considered an essential Equipment of Protection Individual (EPI) in operations against forest fires. The adoption of the orange color is scientifically justified, as it stimulates energy, action, and confidence according to the psychology of colors. Studies also show that orange is one of the most visible colors to attract attention, making it efficient in rescue operations, long-distance identification, and other emergency situations. The use of more attractive colors like orange is also suggested by the Brazilian Standard (NBR) 15292, which specifies the requirements for high-visibility safety clothing that can visually signal the presence of the user in any lighting condition.
