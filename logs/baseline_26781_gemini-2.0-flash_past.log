Okay, let's analyze the question: "Will William Ruto cease to be President of Kenya before October 1, 2024?"

Today is August 1, 2024. That leaves approximately two months until the resolution date. The possible scenarios that would resolve the question as "Yes" are: resignation, impeachment, losing an election (not applicable given the timeline), or removal from office via a coup. A temporary absence exceeding 30 days would also resolve as "Yes".

Considering the short timeframe, the probability of any of these events occurring is relatively low.

*   **Resignation:** I have no information suggesting Ruto is considering resigning.
*   **Impeachment:** Impeachment processes are typically lengthy and complex. Initiating and completing one within two months seems highly improbable, though not impossible.
*   **Coup:** While political instability is a factor in many countries, Kenya has relatively stable institutions. A coup within this timeframe seems unlikely.
*   **Temporary Absence:** An illness or other event causing him to step down for longer than 30 days before Oct 1 seems possible but still unlikely.

Given these factors, I assess the probability of Ruto ceasing to be President before October 1, 2024, as low, but not zero. There are always unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, I will assign a range of 0.25% - 3.25%, with a most likely probability of 1.75%.

My Prediction: Between 0.25% and 3.25%, but 1.75% being the most likely. Probability: 1.75%.
