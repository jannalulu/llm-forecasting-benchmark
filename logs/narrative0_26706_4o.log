**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Stripe announce its IPO plans on their website before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. Despite Stripe's significant market presence and their move in February to let employees cash out shares, the announcement just didn't materialize on their Newsroom.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. The speculation was strong, but it seems the timing wasn't right.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The absence of an official announcement on their website kept it from resolving as "Yes." It underscores the importance of official channels for such pivotal news.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. We'll keep an eye out for any future developments. Until next time.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, here we are. The day after the deadline. Did Stripe announce their IPO plans on their news section?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 42.75%. The speculation was high, especially with their employees cashing out shares in February, but it seems Stripe has chosen to remain private, at least for now.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Despite processing 1% of global GDP, they continue to play the long game. Perhaps they're waiting for more favorable market conditions.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It’s a reminder that even with strong signals, companies like Stripe can still surprise us. Until next time, we keep refining our models.

**Scene: A dimly lit studio, October 3, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.**

**Nate Silver:** So, Philip, the big question—did Stripe announce their IPO on their website before October 1st?

**Philip Tetlock:** No, our models had it at 42.75%. Despite the buzz, Stripe held back. Their February move to let employees cash out shares hinted at something, but not enough for an official announcement.

**Nate Silver:** Right. The speculation was intense, especially with them handling 1% of global GDP. But without that crucial announcement on their Newsroom, it’s a no.

**Philip Tetlock:** Exactly. It's fascinating how the market dynamics and internal strategies play out. Our models captured the uncertainty well.

**Nate Silver:** Agreed. Until next time, when reality meets forecasting.
