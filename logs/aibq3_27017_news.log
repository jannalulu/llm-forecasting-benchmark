**Agenda 2030: Access to Information as a Central Axis for its Implementation**
The United Nations' Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development has been in effect for nine years, with 193 member states signing on to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. According to the UN's 2024 SDG Report, only 17% of the goals are expected to be met, with around half showing moderate progress and 30% showing no progress or regression since 2015. The report highlights the importance of addressing each goal in an integrated manner, as they are interconnected and interdependent. The UN's High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development 2024 aimed to analyze the progress made, actions implemented, and areas that require strengthening to achieve the desired results. Mexico presented a voluntary report on its efforts to contribute to the implementation of the agenda, which was attended by governors, the ambassador, and representatives from various sectors. The report emphasized the importance of digitalization in ensuring public access to information and protecting fundamental freedoms. It also stressed the need to include youth and vulnerable populations in the implementation of the agenda to reduce inequality and improve their living conditions.

**UN Observers Arrive in Venezuela to Monitor Elections**
A group of 4 electoral experts from the United Nations (UN) arrived in Caracas on Tuesday (9) to monitor the Venezuelan elections scheduled for July 28. According to Foreign Minister Yván Gil, over 635 foreign observers are already registered to monitor the election in the country. The UN experts had a meeting with the Chancellor to discuss the election and receive information on how the electoral system works. They will make an independent report on the election process and submit it to the Secretary-General, António Guterres. The goal is to include recommendations for improving future Venezuelan elections. The UN explained that the group of experts is one of the tools the organization uses to monitor electoral processes in its member states. The group will remain in the country until a few days after the election. The UN stated that its participation in the Venezuelan elections is in compliance with the agreement signed in Barbados between the government and part of the opposition in October 2023. The text defined that the election should be held in the second half of 2024 and would include observation missions from the European Union, the Carter Center, and the UN. The Carter Center of the United States also released a statement confirming its participation, but said it would not evaluate the voting and counting processes. Instead, it will assess whether the country's obligations are in line with the National Constitution and whether human rights are being respected.

**OCS Calls for Complete Reform of the United Nations**
The Organization of Cooperation of Shanghai (OCS) has called for a complete reform of the United Nations (UN) to strengthen its authority. The current UN structure and functioning are not considered sufficient by the main Eurasian states. The OCS is a political, economic, and security organization created in 2001, with the aim of promoting regional security, combating terrorism, and strengthening economic cooperation among its member states. The organization has grown to include 11 member states, including China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Belarus. The BRICS group has also called for UN reform since 2023, and in May 2024, Russia and China reiterated these demands. The call for reform is not about destroying the UN, but about adapting it to the changing global landscape and ensuring a more representative and effective organization. The current UN structure, dominated by Western powers, is no longer suitable for the majority of the world's population. The OCS and BRICS are gaining influence, strengthening their institutional capacity, and accumulating geopolitical resources. The time is approaching when even the United States will no longer be able to ignore this factor. The UN has the opportunity to transform itself and become a functional organization that works for the benefit of all, or it will decline and become an institution that legitimizes primarily Western resolutions.

**UNRWA Employees May Have Been Involved in October 7 Attack on Israel**
According to the United Nations, at least nine employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) may have been involved in the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. UN Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq stated, 'The working relationships with these individuals will be terminated in the interest of the agency.' An investigation by the UN's Internal Oversight Service found that in nine cases, 'the evidence obtained indicates that the staff may have been involved in the October 7, 2023 attacks.' In the other nine cases, the evidence was deemed insufficient, and in one case, there was no evidence at all. This comes after Israel accused around 190 UNRWA employees of having ties to terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip in January 2024, leading to many countries suspending funding to the organization, although some have since resumed it, citing the complex humanitarian situation in the region.

**The UN's Obsession with Israel: A Double Standard**
The United Nations (UN) has a long-standing obsession with Israel, criticizing and condemning it more than any other country. Since 2015, the UN General Assembly has adopted 140 resolutions critical of Israel, while only 68 resolutions were adopted for all other countries combined. The UN's International Court of Justice (IGH) has also been criticized for its biased decisions, with nine of its current judges coming from non-democratic countries that are hostile to Israel. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has been accused of being infiltrated by Hamas, with 12 of its members involved in the Hamas massacre on October 7, 2023. The article argues that the UN's anti-Israel stance is a double standard, ignoring the history and causes of the Middle East conflict. Israel has been attacked by five Arab states in 1948, 1967, and 1973, and has been subject to decades of Arab terrorism. The article concludes that the UN's actions have serious consequences for the world, including empowering Hamas and allowing it to rebuild and launch new attacks on Israel.

**UN Cúpula Mundial pelo Futuro Documents Raise Concerns**
According to professor José Eli da Veiga, the upcoming United Nations (UN) Cúpula Mundial pelo Futuro on September 22-23 is crucial for the future, but the available documents are 'frustrating' and lack focus. Da Veiga states, 'sustainability has nothing to do with the short-term.' He believes that any future pact signed by 190+ nations should be 'something very concise, centered on a few basic objectives.' However, the current document proposes 58 actions, with one example being the need to 'accelerate the process of surpassing GDP as a measure of economic growth.' Da Veiga notes that this idea has been discussed since the 2030 Agenda, but it is 'sad to see a document like this that, in two paragraphs, passes as if it were a less important one of the 58 actions.' He concludes, 'it's like that, very complicated, this question of international cooperation.'

**Sierra Leone to Assume Presidency of United Nations Security Council**
Sierra Leone will assume the presidency of the United Nations Security Council, a position it has not held in over five decades. The country has been a non-permanent member of the council since January 2024, after a decade of civil war and 20 years of post-war reconstruction. According to the authorities, this is a demonstration of respect for the country. The presidency of the Security Council is rotated among its 15 members, with each country serving for a month in alphabetical order. The Security Council is responsible for global governance, including maintaining international peace and stability. Only five countries - France, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia - have permanent seats and veto power, while the other 10 are elected for two-year terms. Sierra Leone will be joined by Algeria, South Korea, Guyana, and Slovenia in a new term until 2025.

**UN Accuses Israel of Torturing Palestinian Prisoners**
The United Nations (UN) has accused Israel of committing 'tortures' against Palestinian prisoners in its jails. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights report describes 'atrocious acts' against people detained against their will. The report, presented in Geneva, Switzerland, also details the deaths of at least 53 Palestinians in Israeli prisons. The UN office describes the detainees as 'usually detained in secret'. The report states that 'detainees said they were kept in cages, naked for long periods, only wearing diapers'. The report also states that 'their testimonies indicate that they were blindfolded, deprived of food, water, and sleep, subjected to electric shocks and burns with cigarettes'. UN High Commissioner Volker Turk described how several prisoners were tied up and hung from the ceiling. Turk's report states that among the tortures were 'simulated drowning and the release of dogs on the detainees, among other acts'. The report concludes that these acts were 'in flagrant violation of international human rights law and international humanitarian law'. The document clarifies that the investigations included facts from October 7, 2023, to June 30, 2024. According to the UN office, the prisoners 'were usually detained in secret, without knowing the reason for their detention, nor having access to a lawyer or judicial control'. The US Department of State stated that they were investigating the allegations of Israeli abuses against Palestinian detainees. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that they were unable to visit Palestinian detainees in Israeli facilities. A UN team is investigating Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip.

**Millions of People Threatened as Funds for Humanitarian Aid Fall to Record Low**
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that 308 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance worldwide in 2024. However, due to a significant funding gap, OCHA is only targeting 187 million people in 71 countries, requiring 48.6 billion dollars. As of May 2024, only 7.8 billion dollars had been received, leaving a gap of 40.6 billion dollars. By the end of June, the amount raised had risen to 9 billion dollars, but this still only covered 18% of the needed funds. This highlights the urgent need for increased funding for humanitarian aid, particularly in countries such as Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Myanmar, and Afghanistan, which are not on the priority lists of main donor countries.

**The Future Summit and 5 Critical Areas - Kerem Alkin**
The United Nations (UN) will hold a critical 'Future Summit' on September 23-24, coinciding with the 79th session of the UN General Assembly. The summit, with the contribution of the OECD's detailed report and side effects, will discuss the status of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the renewal of the UN's founding charter, the update of the multilateral system, new challenges and opportunities, and the production of common solutions for the global system. The leaders of the global system, including President Erdoğan, emphasize the need for a new global order that recognizes the growing weight of emerging countries in the global economy and politics. The 'Future Pact' will be a central theme, which will bring together countries to work towards a common future. The UN, which has 193 member states, including the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the State of Palestine, will discuss five critical areas: sustainable development, population growth, science, technology, innovation, and digital cooperation, international peace and security, and the transformation of global governance. The leaders of the 40 leading countries are divided on focusing on a common future. The article will continue to analyze these critical areas in the next article.

**Up and down: Editorial on UN report highlighting the rise and decline of population in this century**
The United Nations' World Population Prospects 2024 report predicts that the global population will reach 10.3 billion by 2084, before declining and stabilizing at the end of the century. The report highlights that 63 countries, including China, have already peaked, while 48 nations are about to peak in the next three decades, and 126 countries, including India, will see their demographics stabilize in the next century. India is expected to continue being the most populous country until the next century, but will see a 12% drop in population by the 2060s. The report suggests that countries will face challenges due to falling birth rates and ageing populations, but also presents opportunities for demographic dividends. The article concludes that policymakers and the government should focus on utilizing the accrued demographic dividend before it's too late, rather than perpetuating mischievous political rhetoric.

**The Decline of Empires: A Historical Perspective**
The recent G7 summit has highlighted the decline of the group's significance. The question is where power lies today. The United Nations has 193 member states, all of which are supposed to follow the values of the UN Charter. However, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the USA, China, Russia, France, and the UK - dominate with their veto power. This disproportionate power illustrates the ongoing empire mentality. The article discusses the concept of empires and their decline, citing examples from history, such as the British Empire and the Soviet Union. It also touches on the current situation, where the USA, China, and Russia are the dominant powers, and the EU is trying to maintain its influence. The article concludes that the concept of empires is still very present today, and that the decline of empires is a natural process.

**UN: 2024 Crucial for Ending AIDS as a Public Health Threat**
The United Nations (UN) has stated that 2024 will be a decisive year for ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. According to the UN's AIDS program, ONUSIDA, the number of new HIV infections decreased by 100,000 in 2023 compared to 2022, with around 1.3 million new infections reported. However, the organization is concerned that the goal of fewer than 330,000 new infections in 2025 seems unattainable. The main challenge is access to antiretroviral therapy, which is highly effective. As of December 2023, 30.7 million people had accessed this therapy, but the number is still short of the 2025 target of 34 million people. Africa's eastern and southern regions remain the most affected, with 20.8 million people living with HIV, 450,000 new infections, and 260,000 deaths in 2023. In contrast, Latin America saw an increase in new HIV infections, with 120,000 new cases, a 9% increase from 2010.

**UN's International Court of Justice to Release Opinion on Israel's Occupation of Palestinian Territories**
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague is set to release its advisory opinion on Friday (July 19, 2024) regarding Israel's policy of occupation in Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. The opinion was requested by the UN General Assembly in December 2022, before the events of October 7, 2023, which led to the current war between Israel and Hamas. The ICJ will address the legal consequences of Israel's 'continuing violation of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination' and its 'continuing occupation, settlement, and annexation of occupied Palestinian territories since 1967'. The court will also evaluate the legal status of the occupation and its consequences for the UN and states. The 'occupied Palestinian territory' includes Cisjordania and East Jerusalem, which were conquered in the 1967 Six-Day War. According to the dpa news agency, the number of settlers in Cisjordania and East Jerusalem together amounts to 700,000. The UN Security Council has repeatedly condemned Israel's settlement activities, calling them a 'flagrant violation' of international law. The ICJ will also address the status of East Jerusalem, which Israel declared as its 'united and eternal capital' in 1980. This move is considered a de facto annexation. The majority of states do not recognize the measure, and the Palestinians claim the area as their capital towards a future state. The ICJ heard statements from 49 UN member states, three international organizations, and Palestinian representatives in February, including European countries such as France and Spain, as well as the United States, Russia, and China. Israel was not present at the hearings. The US representative asked the court not to order an 'immediate and unconditional withdrawal', citing the need for Israel's security. The report is not legally binding, but it will have 'great legal and moral authority'. The outcome could increase political pressure on Israel regarding the situation in the Gaza Strip.

**UN: Immigration to be Main Driver of Population Growth until 2100**
The United Nations (UN) has released a report stating that international migration will be the main driver of population growth until 2100, particularly in countries with low fertility rates and high aging populations. The report, 'World Population Prospects 2024', highlights that international migration will be the primary factor driving population growth in 52 countries by 2054 and 62 countries by 2100. The UN emphasizes that managing the challenges and opportunities presented by migration can help accelerate efforts towards inclusive and sustainable development. The report also notes that in countries with relatively low fertility rates, such as Australia, Canada, and the United States, immigration will continue to contribute to population growth. Without immigration, the population of the United States would be 13% and 36% smaller in 2054 and 2100, respectively. The UN also warns that a significant reduction in the proportion of working-age citizens could have negative effects.

**Over 118 Countries Join Initiative to Support UNRWA Amid Israel's Attacks**
Over 118 countries have joined the initiative to support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which has been attacked by Israel for its alleged ties to the Islamist group Hamas. The UNRWA, which provided education, healthcare, and social services to two-thirds of Palestinians in Gaza before the war, has been in crisis since January, when Israel accused 12 of its members of participating in Hamas attacks. The majority of countries have resumed their funding, but the United States has not, and has even voted to suspend all funding until March 2025. UN Secretary-General António Guterres praised the UNRWA staff, saying they continue to work bravely in impossible conditions, and warned that without necessary support and funding, Palestinian refugees will lose a critical lifeline and their last hope for a better future.

The report also notes that in countries with low fertility rates, such as Australia, Canada, and the United States, migration will continue to drive population growth. The UN warns that without migration, the population of countries like Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland would decline due to low fertility rates. The report also notes that emigration has a limited impact on the population size of countries, except in those with very low fertility rates, where it could contribute significantly to reducing the population by 2054.

**UN Observers Arrive in Venezuela to Monitor Elections**
A group of 4 electoral experts from the United Nations (UN) arrived in Caracas on Tuesday (9) to monitor the Venezuelan elections scheduled for July 28. According to Foreign Minister Yván Gil, over 635 foreign observers are already registered to monitor the election in the country. The UN experts had a meeting with the Chancellor to discuss the election and receive information on how the electoral system works. They will make an independent report on the election process and submit it to the Secretary-General, António Guterres. The goal is to include recommendations for improving future Venezuelan elections. The UN explained that the group of experts is one of the tools the organization uses to monitor electoral processes in its member states. The group will remain in the country until a few days after the election. The UN stated that its participation in the Venezuelan elections is in compliance with the agreement signed in Barbados between the government and part of the opposition in October 2023. The text defined that the election should be held in the second half of 2024 and would include observation missions from the European Union, the Carter Center, and the UN. The Carter Center of the United States also released a statement confirming its participation, but said it would not evaluate the voting and counting processes. Instead, it will assess whether the country's obligations are in line with the National Constitution and whether human rights are being respected.

**OCS Calls for Complete Reform of the United Nations**
The Organization of Cooperation of Shanghai (OCS) has called for a complete reform of the United Nations (UN) to strengthen its authority. The current UN structure and functioning are not considered sufficient by the main Eurasian states. The OCS is a political, economic, and security organization created in 2001, with the aim of promoting regional security, combating terrorism, and strengthening economic cooperation among its member states. The organization has grown to include 11 member states, including China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Belarus. The BRICS group has also called for UN reform since 2023, and in May 2024, Russia and China reiterated these demands. The call for reform is not about destroying the UN, but about adapting it to the changing global landscape and ensuring a more representative and effective organization. The current UN structure, dominated by Western powers, is no longer suitable for the majority of the world's population. The OCS and BRICS are gaining influence, strengthening their institutional capacity, and accumulating geopolitical resources. The time is approaching when even the United States will no longer be able to ignore this factor. The UN has the opportunity to transform itself and become a functional organization that works for the benefit of all, or it will decline and become an institution that legitimizes primarily Western resolutions.

**UN Declares 2025 as the International Year of Cooperatives**
The United Nations General Assembly has approved the resolution 'Cooperatives in Social Development', defining 2025 as the International Year of Cooperatives. The resolution recognizes the importance of cooperatives in promoting economic and social development in communities, including women, people with disabilities, and indigenous peoples, as well as their contribution to eradicating hunger and poverty. The text also highlights that cooperatives are essential for mitigating the effects of climate change and notes that there are approximately 3 million cooperatives worldwide, employing around 10% of the global workforce. The UN will encourage and support its 195 member states to adopt measures to strengthen and promote cooperatives in their local realities. The resolution also promotes technical cooperation, knowledge transfer, and the inclusion of cooperative representatives in decision-making bodies at the regional, national, and international levels.

**UN Announces Need for $1.2 Billion to Meet Urgent Needs in Occupied Palestinian Territories**
The United Nations has announced that it needs $1.2 billion to meet the urgent needs of approximately 3 million people in the occupied Palestinian territories from October 1 to December 31, 2023. The target group is 2.7 million people, including 2.2 million in Gaza and 500,000 in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The UN Humanitarian Office stated that 'to enable humanitarian actors to implement this plan, operational conditions must change.' The conditions include 'ensuring that humanitarian actors have safe and sustained access to all persons in need in all areas of Gaza and the West Bank' and 'providing sufficient quantities of fuel to enable humanitarian operations to function.' The statement also emphasized the need to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The UN expects that the response and scope of the plan, as well as the time gap between commitment and receipt of funds, means that we do not expect to see the full implementation of the plan by the end of 2023.' The UN's strategic goal is to meet the basic needs of vulnerable Palestinians living under occupation by providing high-quality services and improving access to resources, in line with international humanitarian law and human rights law.

**UN Report: 60% of Countries Struggle with Extremely High Food Prices**
The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals 2024 report has been published. According to the report, approximately 60% of countries are struggling with extremely high food prices, which has worsened hunger and food insecurity. The report highlights that nearly half of the 17 goals set by the UN member states in 2015 have made little or no progress, while a third have even regressed. UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated, 'This report shows that the world has failed to achieve its goals. The conclusion is simple: our failure to ensure peace, combat climate change, and increase international financing is hindering progress. We must accelerate our efforts to achieve sustainable development and there is no time to waste.' The report also emphasizes the need for urgent action to address the root causes of poverty, conflict, and inequality. It highlights that 23 million people were pushed into extreme poverty in 2022, and over 100 million people are experiencing hunger.

**On this day in history, June 26, 1945, United Nations is formally established**
On June 26, 1945, the United Nations was formally established with the signing of the U.N. Charter in San Francisco, California. The charter was signed by representatives of the 50 countries attending the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Poland, which was not represented, signed it later and became one of the U.N.'s original 51 member states. The U.N. Charter was the result of a long process that began as early as 1941, when the Allies proposed establishing a new international body to maintain peace in the post-war world. The name 'United Nations' originated from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's description of the countries fighting against the Axis Powers in World War II. The U.N. Charter was unanimously adopted at the San Francisco Opera House on June 25, 1945, and the United Nations came into existence on October 24, 1945, when the governments of China, France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and a majority of the other signatory states had ratified the charter.

**UN-backed foreign police force lands in Haiti to tackle surging gang violence, restore order**
The United Nations-backed foreign police force, led by Kenya, has arrived in Haiti to help tackle the country's surging gang violence and restore order. The deployment comes nearly two years after Haiti requested help to quell the violence, which has left over 580,000 people homeless and killed thousands. The Kenyan police will be joined by forces from other countries, including the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica, to form a total of 2,500 officers. The mission aims to restore public order and security, but critics have raised concerns about the lack of transparency and the potential for human rights abuses. The UN Security Council authorized the mission in October 2023, and the US has pledged $300 million in support.

The 56th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council has begun in Geneva and will run until July 12. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, opened the session by highlighting the plight of over a million Palestinian refugees who were forced to flee their homes again due to Israel's intensified attacks on the Gaza Strip in May. Turk expressed concern over the international community's neglect of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, citing the high number of deaths and suffering. He stated that as a result of Israel's attacks, over 120,000 people, mostly women and children, have been killed or injured in Gaza since October 2023. Turk also noted that since Israel focused its attacks on Rafah in May, over a million Palestinian refugees have been forced to flee again, and humanitarian access to Gaza has deteriorated further. He also emphasized the deteriorating situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where 528 Palestinians, including 133 children, have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers since October 2023.

**UN Report: World Off Track to Achieve Sustainable Development Goals**
The United Nations has released a report stating that the world is still off track to achieve most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed upon in 2015, including poverty and hunger reduction, due to factors such as lack of funding, geopolitical tensions, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The report assesses the performance of the 193 UN member states in implementing the 17 SDGs, which include improving access to education, healthcare, and clean energy, as well as protecting biodiversity. The report concludes that none of the 17 goals are on track to be achieved by 2030, with most showing limited progress or regression. The report urges countries to address the chronic funding gap and update the UN system itself. Giom Lafortune, Deputy Director of the UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network, said, 'What this report shows is that even before the pandemic, progress was already slow.' He added, 'Just as the pandemic and other crises - including armed conflicts - turned things into a story of stagnation.' The report highlights food security, sustainable cities, and biodiversity protection as key areas of weakness. It also notes that countries like Finland, Sweden, and Denmark are leading the way, while China has made faster progress than average. However, developing countries have regressed more. Lafortune emphasized that developing countries need more opportunities for international funding, adding that institutions like credit rating agencies should consider a country's long-term environmental and economic well-being, rather than just short-term liquidity. The report ranks countries based on their readiness for global cooperation through UN institutions, with the United States ranking last in this regard. Lafortune said, 'The majority of countries support cooperation... but there are a number of major powers that do not play by the rules of the game.'

**Record 120 million displaced people worldwide, UN reports**
The United Nations has reported a record number of 120 million displaced people worldwide, equivalent to the population of Japan. The number has been increasing steadily over the past 12 years, with wars in Gaza, Sudan, and Myanmar contributing to the surge. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, stated that the war remains the main driver of mass displacement. The report highlights the need for a change in international geopolitics to address the crisis. The majority of refugees are hosted in neighboring countries, with 75% residing in low- or middle-income countries that produce less than 20% of the world's income. The war in Sudan has displaced over 9 million people, with 11 million Sudanese displaced at the end of 2023. The UN estimates that 1.7 million people in Gaza have been displaced since the war began in October 2023.

**UN Report: Violence Against Children in Conflicts Reaches 'Extreme Levels' in 2023**
The United Nations has released a report stating that violence against children in conflicts has reached 'extreme levels' in 2023, particularly in Gaza and Sudan. The report lists the Israeli and Sudanese armies on its 'list of shame'. The report notes that the conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territories has led to violations of children's rights 'on an unprecedented scale', with a 155% increase in grave violations linked to the October 7 attack by Hamas against Israel and the Israeli response in the Gaza Strip. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has added the Israeli army to the 'list of shame' due to the killings and injuries of children, as well as attacks on schools and hospitals in Gaza. The report also notes that over 23,000 grave violations have been committed by all parties to the conflict, including 3,900 against Israeli children and 19,887 against Palestinian children, and that it will take a long time to verify these cases.

**What are the 218 International Days of the UN?**
The United Nations (UN) has designated 218 international days since the Environment Day to the Football Day, which was declared less than a month ago. These special celebrations aim to raise awareness and educate the public about various topics of interest or to commemorate a day or a significant figure in history. The tradition of designating international days began before the creation of the UN in 1945, but the organization and its members have increasingly adopted these days as a powerful tool for promotion. The UN General Assembly has designated over 200 days, with some days shared, such as the World Day for Combating Desertification and Drought, which is also celebrated as the International Day of the Fight against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. The UN also celebrates weeks, years, and decades, each with a specific theme or issue. The organization considers international days as opportunities to educate the public about topics of interest or to commemorate a day or a significant figure in history, such as Nelson Mandela's birthday, which is celebrated on July 18. The UN has also designated 2024 as the Year of the Camelids, which are reliable dromedaries that have been used for decades to bring vital assistance to remote communities and peacekeeping troops to their missions.

**UNCTAD Releases Annual Report on Sustainable Development and Trade**
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has released its annual report on sustainable development and trade. The report highlights the organization's efforts to address global challenges and harness trade as a driver of sustainable development. The report, titled 'Trade: Unlocking Sustainable Strategies for People, Planet, and Prosperity', shows how UNCTAD has adapted to provide services to its 195 member states amidst global challenges in 2023. While some economies have experienced a smooth decline, many developing countries are still struggling with weak trade growth, investment, and debt, as well as supply chain disruptions and ongoing climate change. Under the leadership of UNCTAD's Executive Secretary, Rebecca Grynspan, the organization has intensified its efforts to support developing economies on the global stage, while continuing to strengthen its three pillars of work in research and analysis, building consensus, and technical cooperation. Grynspan said in the foreword: 'As we approach the 60th anniversary of our founding in 2024 and the 16th quadrennial conference in 2025, we are reinvigorating our activities and becoming more focused than ever on promoting trade and development for all.' 'The road ahead is still fraught with risks, but we find hope in our work, our partnerships, and our commitment to our mandate.' In 2023, UNCTAD led 219 projects with impact in 74 countries, published over 140 publications, and held 245 international government meetings. It also contributed to fundamental reforms of the international financial architecture and provided thought leadership in areas of global policy related to trade, investment, and technology. UNCTAD also ensures a gender perspective in its wide-ranging mandate, aiming to eliminate barriers faced by women in trade and promote more equitable and inclusive development.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has published its 2023 annual report, titled 'Trade: Unlocking Sustainable Strategies for Populations, the Planet, and Prosperity'. The report describes how UNCTAD adapted to respond to the needs of its 195 member states in the context of the evolving global challenges in 2023. While some economies experienced a soft landing, many developing countries continued to suffer disproportionately from the slow growth of trade and investment, increasing debt burden, supply chain disruptions, and the ongoing climate crisis. Under the leadership of Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan, UNCTAD redoubled its efforts to defend developing economies on the global stage, while continuing to advance its three pillars of work in research and analysis, consensus-building, and technical cooperation. 'As we approach our 60th anniversary in 2024 and the quadrennial conference in 2025, we are revitalized and more determined than ever to promote trade and development for all,' said Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan in the foreword.

In 2023, UNCTAD implemented 219 high-impact projects in 74 countries, produced over 140 publications, and organized 245 intergovernmental meetings. It contributed to essential reforms of the international financial architecture and demonstrated enlightened leadership in global policy-making on trade, investment, and technology. UNCTAD also ensured that a gender perspective was included in its vast mandate, aiming to dismantle obstacles faced by women in trade and promote more equitable and inclusive development benefits.
