SCENE: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 1st, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the cannabis rescheduling."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 85%. Once the DEA published that Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May, the writing was on the wall. The 62-day comment period put the timeline perfectly within range."

Nate: "The Harvard Law analysis really highlighted the bureaucratic momentum. Even with the complexity of federal-state regulatory powers, the administrative process was straightforward once Garland signed off."

Philip: "True. The shift to Schedule III was the most probable outcome. Our models caught that the 'moderate to low potential for dependence' classification aligned perfectly with existing medical research."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Though Congress still has work to do on the federal-state framework."

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the cannabis rescheduling."

Tetlock: "Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. Once the DEA published that Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May, with Garland's signature, the writing was on the wall."

Nate: "The 62-day comment period was crucial. Even with the bureaucratic hurdles, the momentum was undeniable. Though I was concerned about the congressional regulatory clarity piece."

Tetlock: "True, but the administrative process was surprisingly efficient. The models captured the strong institutional support and public sentiment perfectly."

Nate: *pulling up a chart* "Another win for superforecasting. Cannabis officially moved to Schedule III on September 15th, right in the sweet spot of our probability distribution."

Nate: "The 62-day comment period was crucial. Even with the bureaucratic hurdles, having it scheduled for completion by late July gave enough buffer time before the September deadline."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The Harvard Law analysis helped confirm our probability estimates. The only real uncertainty was the implementation timeline, but the administrative momentum was strong."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, this one was more straightforward than predicting elections!"

Nate: *sipping coffee* Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the cannabis rescheduling question.

Philip: *nodding* No surprise there. When we saw the DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May, our models gave it a 72.35% probability of happening before September 30th.

Nate: The 62-day comment period was crucial. Even with Attorney General Garland's signature, there was still that administrative uncertainty. But the bipartisan support and medical evidence made it pretty clear.

Philip: *reviewing papers* The Harvard Law analysis helped too. Though they highlighted the need for further legislation, the rescheduling itself was always likely to go through. The models captured that regulatory momentum perfectly.

Nate: Yes, our models had it at 72.35%. Another win for superforecasting.
