**RFK Jr. Candidacy: A Controversial Figure in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, has a background in elite education and is an environmentalist and anti-vaccine activist. He has a law degree from Harvard University and a doctorate in law from the London School of Economics. Kennedy has been spreading misinformation about vaccines and immunizations since 2005. According to a political specialist, Kennedy is an 'outsider' with no chance of winning. He is considered a 'conspiracist' and has made false claims about vaccines, including comparing vaccination to a 'holocaust' and claiming that immunizations cause autism in children. Kennedy has also made bizarre claims, such as saying that a worm ate part of his brain and that he has no effects from the incident. He has also been suspended from Instagram for repeatedly sharing false information about COVID-19. His candidacy has been met with criticism from his own family, who disavowed him after he made comments comparing pandemic measures to Nazi Germany. Despite this, Kennedy has gained votes from dissatisfied voters who are looking for an alternative to the traditional party candidates.

**RFK Jr.'s campaign files petitions to get on presidential ballot in critical 2024 swing-state Pennsylvania**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, has filed paperwork to get on the ballot in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, six weeks before the August 1 deadline. To qualify, he must gather 5,000 signatures of registered voters. The campaigns of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump fear Kennedy could play a spoiler role in the election, especially in Pennsylvania, which has swung between parties in the last two presidential elections. Kennedy's petitions could be challenged in court by the major parties, and both campaigns have sought to portray him as an adversary.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Faces Deadline to Qualify for CNN Presidential Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 US election, and a lawsuit filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may be his only hope. The CNN will broadcast the debate on June 27, after President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, agreed to the confrontation last month. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is midnight on Wednesday. Kennedy filed a complaint with the FEC in May, alleging that the CNN debate is an illegal campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company is requiring him to meet 'different criteria' to participate in the debate. The campaign requested that the FEC take action by Thursday and prevent the CNN, Biden, and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they 'comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act', according to the complaint. The FEC declined to comment for this report. This election cycle presents a unique situation - since 1960, when the era of televised presidential debates began, it will be the first time that news organizations - first CNN, next week, and ABC, which will host a debate in September - will control the terms and parameters of the debates between candidates. Previously, the Commission on Presidential Debates sponsored the debates. CNN said that candidates qualified to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election and receive at least 15% support in four separate national polls. After the debate announcement, Kennedy and his campaign complained. Kennedy said that Biden and Trump are 'trying to exclude me from the debate because they fear I will win'. On Saturday, CNN said it was 'not impossible' for Kennedy to qualify, but he has not yet met the criteria. He received at least 15% in three polls so far and qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral votes, according to CNN. Kennedy's campaign did not comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain access to electoral ballots across the US, with $15 million raised for the process.

**Trump Ignores Kennedy Jr.'s Debate Challenge**
Robert Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, has challenged Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the US presidency, to a debate. However, Trump has ignored the invitation. The debate was proposed to take place at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington D.C. on May 24-26. The Kennedy campaign has not received a response from Trump's campaign. Trump has previously agreed to two rounds of debates with incumbent President Joe Biden, but has also expressed concerns about Biden's potential use of performance-enhancing substances. The first debate is scheduled for June 28, and the second for September 10. The US presidential election is set to take place on November 5, 2024.

**RFK Jr. campaign meets first ballot threshold**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential campaign has submitted over 30,880 signatures to appear on the November ballot in Nevada, exceeding the required 10,236 signatures. The campaign had previously submitted a petition without the name of his vice presidential running mate, Nicole Shanahan, but has since gathered signatures on a new petition. The signatures will be verified by local officials by July 25, and if verified, Kennedy's name will appear on the ballot alongside President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. However, a lawsuit filed by Democrats is pending, challenging Kennedy's eligibility as an independent candidate.

**Democrats Unload On Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced his intention to run as an independent candidate in the 2024 US presidential election, which has raised concerns among Democrats. The Democratic National Committee has purchased billboards in Los Angeles, California, highlighting allegations of sexual misconduct made against Kennedy by a former babysitter. Kennedy has not denied the allegations, which have been reported in a Vanity Fair exposé. Democrats have criticized Kennedy, saying he is 'dangerous and unfit to be president' due to his past behavior. The impact of Kennedy's candidacy on the election is still unclear, with some polls showing a slight increase in support for Donald Trump if Kennedy is in the race.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will appear on Colorado's presidential ballot after receiving the Libertarian Party's nomination. The party's board of directors voted in favor of a partnership with Kennedy's independent presidential campaign, aiming to disrupt the two-party system and provide a viable alternative in the 2024 election. Kennedy's campaign focuses on ending corporate welfare, reducing government spending, and protecting the environment, aligning with the Libertarian Party's values. The party believes this partnership will help them reach new audiences and make a significant impact on the election.

**Will Robert F. Kennedy Jr. be the Spoiler in the 2024 US Elections?**
A commercial aired during the Super Bowl in February 2024 featured Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of John F. Kennedy, in a spot that was almost identical to one from 1960 featuring John F. Kennedy during his presidential campaign. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running as an independent candidate in the 2024 presidential election, but his own family has distanced themselves from him due to his recent erratic political proposals and conspiracy theories. According to Isabelle Jacobi, foreign editor of NZZ Akzent, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has no chance of winning as an independent candidate in the dual-party system of the US, but he could potentially take votes away from Democratic candidates, especially after President Biden's disastrous performance in the first TV debate.

Kennedy's campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN's debate criteria violate campaign finance law and that the network conspired with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude him. Kennedy has expressed frustration over his exclusion, stating that it is 'undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.'

**Robert Kennedy Jr. Excluded from Presidential Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, failed to meet the requirements to participate in the upcoming presidential debate organized by CNN. The debate, which will feature President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, will take place on June 27 in Atlanta. CNN established specific criteria for candidates to participate, including the need to be on enough state ballots to be eligible to win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Kennedy is currently on the ballots of five states, totaling 42 electoral votes, and will also be on the ballot in California as the American Independent Party candidate and in Hawaii under the We the People list, giving him a total of 100 potential electoral votes. Although Kennedy has submitted requests to appear on the ballots of several states, many of these requests are still under review by state election offices. Another CNN requirement is that candidates must reach a 15% threshold in at least four national polls before June 20. Kennedy did not meet this criterion, achieving only three qualified national polls. Kennedy stated, 'The presidents Biden and Trump do not want me on the debate stage and CNN illegally granted their demand', claiming that his exclusion is 'undemocratic, anti-American, and cowardly'. In May, Kennedy's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), accusing CNN, Biden, and Trump of violating federal election law. According to Kennedy's campaign, CNN applied different criteria to him compared to Biden and Trump, the main candidates of their respective parties. The campaign alleges that the debate is an illegal contribution to Biden and Trump. Kennedy stated that he cannot file a lawsuit against CNN for his exclusion from the debate until the complaint presented to the FEC is resolved. His campaign reported that the FEC has recognized that the complaint may have merit, although no decision has been made. The FEC has refused to comment on the case.

**RFK Jr. finds 2024 debate stage out of reach ahead of midnight qualifying deadline**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is close to reaching the 15% polling threshold for the 2024 presidential debate, but due to the difficulty in gaining ballot access in enough states to reach 270 electoral votes, he is unlikely to appear on the debate stage. Kennedy's campaign claims that CNN is treating him unfairly, but with hours left to meet the network's rules, he is not expected to appear onstage with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Kennedy's campaign has collected enough signatures in 14 states, but the process of collecting enough signatures is an enormous undertaking for third-party candidates. Kennedy has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that CNN worked in tandem with the Biden and Trump campaigns to exclude him from the debate.

**RFK Jr. Misses Deadline to Participate in Biden-Trump Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate for the US presidency, is unlikely to participate in the first presidential debate of 2024 after missing the deadline to meet the criteria set by the hosting news agency CNN. CNN, which is organizing the debate on June 27, stated that only President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump had met the conditions before the deadline of Thursday at 12:00 ET (0400 GMT). The conditions included registering on the electoral rolls of a sufficient number of states to win the presidency and obtaining support of at least 15% of voters in four national polls. As of now, Kennedy has only obtained at least 15% in three accepted polls and, according to CNN, he has qualified for the ballot in only six states, which is not enough to win the presidency. Neither CNN nor Kennedy's campaign could be reached for comment. Kennedy had claimed that the TV network's standards were unfair and aimed to exclude him from the candidate scene, preferring a head-to-head race.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, is unlikely to participate in the upcoming presidential debate on June 27 in Atlanta. He failed to meet the eligibility criteria, which requires a candidate to have a certain level of support in several states and a minimum approval rating of 15% in at least four national polls. Kennedy's campaign has been struggling to gain momentum, and he has not yet reached the threshold of 270 delegates or the necessary approval ratings. The Washington Post reported that Kennedy has not met the criteria, and CNN has all but ruled out a last-minute appearance by the candidate. Kennedy has alleged that the rules have been manipulated against him, but analysts believe that he is unlikely to alter the outcome of the election in November.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign is seen as a potential disruptor in the 2024 election, despite his slim chances of winning. He has a significant following among disaffected voters, particularly young people, and could potentially take votes from both major parties. Kennedy's anti-establishment views and controversial statements have been criticized by his own family members, including his cousin Jack Schlossberg, who has called him a 'prick'. Kennedy's vice presidential running mate, Nicole Shanahan, has also been criticized for her views on vaccines and in vitro fertilization. Despite this, Kennedy's campaign has gained attention and could potentially impact the outcome of the election.

**Election 2024 Third Party Polling**
An Associated Press analysis of Gallup data since 1980 shows that third-party candidates often appear to be gaining momentum in polls before an election, but ultimately underperform at the ballot box. This is the case for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent presidential candidate.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Surprise Entry into the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a member of the famous American Kennedy family, has announced his candidacy for the 2024 US presidential election as an independent candidate. This move comes at a time of intense divisions between the Democratic and Republican parties, and Kennedy's candidacy could potentially shake up the election landscape. If he can attract significant support from voters from both parties, he could create a new dynamic in the race. Kennedy is known for his anti-vaccination stance, which could attract a large number of voters who share his views. Additionally, his family's political legacy could help him attract voters who respect the Kennedy name. However, one of the biggest challenges Kennedy will face is getting the necessary media coverage and funding for his independent campaign. As an independent candidate, he will not have the same level of support as the major party candidates. Despite these challenges, Kennedy's candidacy is an interesting development in the 2024 presidential election, and his win (if he wins) could have significant implications for US foreign policy in the Middle East.

**Why Robert F. Kennedy's Jr.'s Current Presidential Election may not last until November**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign has reached 15% or more in three approved national polls, meeting one of CNN's criteria to qualify for the June 27 debate with Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. However, it's unlikely that Kennedy's support will last until November. Historical data shows that third-party candidates often experience a decline in support as the election approaches. Research suggests that people are poor at predicting their future behavior, and voters may use their early support for a third-party candidate to express frustration with major party choices. The article also notes that Americans generally like the idea of a third party until details emerge, such as the party's policies and nominees. Additionally, third-party presidential candidates rarely get a substantial share of the votes, and early polls often look different from the actual vote in the general election.

**RFK Jr.: The Silver-Tongued Spoiler**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign is seen by some as a spoiler in the 2024 election, potentially depriving both Trump and Biden of the necessary electoral votes to win. Kennedy's campaign has been criticized for its Progressive and Democratic leanings, with some arguing that he is not a true independent. His running mate, Nicole Shanahan, is a Democrat and a billionaire who has donated to the 'defund the police' movement. Kennedy's campaign has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and its potential to cause unintended consequences, including the collapse of America's energy industry and the rise of casinos and drug trafficking in British Columbia. Some argue that Kennedy's campaign is a threat to national sovereignty and that he is not a viable alternative to Trump or Biden.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Files Complaint With FEC Claiming CNN 'Colluded' With Biden & Trump Campaigns On Debate**
Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that CNN colluded with the campaigns of Joe Biden and Donald Trump to bar him from participating in debates on June 27 and September 10, 2024. Kennedy claims that CNN is making prohibited corporate contributions to both campaigns and that the opposing campaigns have accepted these contributions. He argues that the qualifying thresholds for debates are not objective and that he is being held to a higher standard than his competition.

**RFK's voters know they're not electing the next president. They're with him anyway**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential campaign has attracted supporters who feel unrepresented by the Democratic and Republican parties. Despite his unlikely chance of winning, his supporters believe his candidacy is an important alternative and could impact the outcome of the 2024 presidential election between President Biden and former President Trump. Many of his supporters are drawn to his views on health, particularly vaccines, and his skepticism of government involvement in various aspects of life. They also appreciate his focus on addressing chronic disease diagnoses and his record as an environmental lawyer. While some critics view Kennedy as anti-vaccine, his supporters argue that he is not anti-vaccine, but rather advocates for safe vaccines. Kennedy's campaign is seen as a way to bring attention to issues that are not being addressed by the mainstream parties and to provide a new perspective on the political system.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Files Complaint Against CNN Over Presidential Debate Exclusion**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has filed a complaint against CNN, accusing the network of colluding to exclude him from the first presidential debate between the candidates running for the US presidency in 2024. Kennedy claims that CNN demanded that he meet different eligibility criteria than those required of Biden and his Republican opponent, making the debate an unfair contribution to their campaigns. Kennedy's lawyers argue that Biden's team openly demanded his exclusion from the debate, citing reports that Trump received confirmation from CNN that Kennedy would be excluded. The complaint demands that the Federal Election Commission prevent the main presidential candidates from participating in the debate until they comply with federal election laws. Biden and Trump agreed to participate in the debate, which will be hosted by CNN on June 27, with a second debate scheduled for September 10. CNN requires candidates to receive at least 15% support in four approved polls by June 20, but Kennedy has only met this requirement in three polls so far.

**RFK Jr. Files Complaint Over Exclusion from Presidential Debates**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming that his team was told by Joe Biden's campaign that he would not be allowed to participate in debates. Kennedy's lawyers also point out that Donald Trump was reportedly assured by CNN that Kennedy would be excluded from the debates. The complaint also mentions the requirement by CNN for candidates to appear on the ballots of a sufficient number of states by June 20th. As of now, Kennedy is only registered in seven states. Despite having little chance of winning with around 10% of voting intentions in polls, Democrats and Republicans are concerned about his impact in key states where he could swing undecided voters to either side.

**Kennedy Files Complaint Against CNN for Excluding Him from Presidential Debate**
Robert F.

Kennedy's campaign claims that CNN is applying different standards to him compared to the Democratic and Republican candidates, and that Biden's team has demanded that CNN exclude him from the debate. The complaint requests that the FEC prohibit Biden and Trump from participating in the debate until the parties comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act. Biden and Trump have agreed to participate in the debate, which will be held on June 27, and another one will be held on September 10 by ABC. Kennedy's campaign claims that CNN is allowing Biden and Trump to participate without requiring them to meet the debate criteria, while insisting that Kennedy must meet them.

**Greenery**
The 2024 presidential debate schedule has been altered, with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump agreeing to a pair of debates, bypassing the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. The changes include no studio audience, strict time limits, and equal speaking time for candidates. However, Trump's willingness to abide by these rules is uncertain, and Biden may reconsider the September debate if Trump does not comply. Additionally, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. may also participate in the debates, which could lead to legal action if he is excluded. The debate process is uncertain, with the possibility of changes or cancellations before the June 27 and September 10 debates.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the Verge of Qualifying for US Presidential Debates**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is close to qualifying for the US presidential debates, which could shake up the election. The debates have always been a key moment in US presidential elections, but this year's debates are expected to be particularly unpredictable. Kennedy Jr. is a popular independent candidate who has been gaining momentum in the polls. He has already met the first criteria for participating in the debates, which is to have at least 15% support in four national polls. However, he still needs to meet the second criteria, which is to be on the ballot in enough states to have a theoretical chance of winning the presidency. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign has submitted signatures to get on the ballot in five states, but he still needs to meet the deadline for the remaining states. If he succeeds, he will be the third candidate to qualify for the debates, following in the footsteps of Ross Perot and John B. Anderson. The debates will be held on June 27 and September 10, and will be broadcast on CNN and ABC respectively.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he will be on the presidential ballot in Florida as the nominee of the Reform Party, but the party is not recognized by the state's Division of Elections. The Reform Party cancelled its filings as a minor political party last August due to non-compliance with a 2022 annual public audit. The Kennedy campaign is working to get ballot access in all 50 states and is currently on the ballot in seven states. If the Reform Party is recognized, it would allow the campaign to save resources and avoid collecting over 145,000 signatures to qualify for the Florida ballot.

**RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.: In an election full of weak candidates, Latinos have muscle to pick the winner**
The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be a weak choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with both candidates having significant flaws. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent candidacy is gaining traction, particularly among Latino voters, who make up a significant portion of the population in battleground states. Kennedy's campaign is focused on real issues such as inflation, healthcare, and housing costs, which resonate with voters. Despite being attacked by both major parties, Kennedy's popularity is growing, and he could potentially play a spoiler role in the election. According to polls, Kennedy is drawing support from both Biden and Trump, and his campaign is on the ballot in several key states.

Trump has previously agreed to two rounds of debates with incumbent President Joe Biden, but has also expressed concerns about Biden's potential use of performance-enhancing substances. The first debate is scheduled for June 28, and the second for September 10. The US presidential election is set to take place on November 5, 2024.

The campaigns of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to two debates in 2024, scheduled for June 27 and September 10. The debates will be hosted by CNN and ABC, respectively, and will not have a live audience. The terms of the debates, including an automatic microphone turn-off when a speaker's time has expired, are likely to exclude independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from the debate stage. The debates may not have a significant impact on the election, as both candidates' performances in 2020 were not particularly memorable. Biden's campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, has requested that the first debate take place after Trump's criminal trial is over and Biden's return from the G7 summit, and the second debate should fall early enough to influence early voting but not so late as to require the candidates to leave the campaign trail.

Kennedy Jr., from participating in the debates. Kennedy has qualified for the debates, citing polls showing him above the 15% support threshold. The debates are seen as a high-risk, high-reward proposition for the Biden campaign, as simply staying alert and coherent could dispel concerns about his age and mental ability.

**Why a Late Kennedy 2024 Polling Boom Is Unlikely**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent candidacy for president has achieved a rare feat, with over 10% support in national and battleground state polls. However, it's unlikely that his campaign will maintain its momentum as Election Day approaches. A look at past independent presidential campaigns, including those of George Wallace, John Anderson, and Ross Perot, suggests that they often lose support as voters focus on viable candidacies. Unlike these previous campaigns, Kennedy's has no regional base, clear policy proposals, or realistic hope for electoral votes, making it unlikely that he will gain significant support in the long run.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are trying to exclude independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from their one-on-one debates, citing concerns that he could play spoiler in the 2024 presidential election. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer and son of Robert F. Kennedy Sr., has been polling in the double digits and has ballot access in 11 states. The Biden and Trump campaigns have agreed to appear in two debates, one in June and one in September, but the terms set by the host networks, CNN and ABC News, could deny Kennedy a spot on the stage. Kennedy has accused the two candidates of colluding to exclude him from the debates and undermine democracy.

**Keller: Presidential debates are on as candidates discard decades-old tradition**
After months of uncertainty, the 2024 presidential debates are confirmed, but with a twist. The Commission on Presidential Debates, which has sponsored debates since 1988, is no longer involved. Instead, the campaigns have agreed to two debates on individual TV networks, with the first one scheduled for June 27 on CNN. The debates will likely have smaller audiences, as they will not be simulcast on all networks. The criteria for participation may also exclude some candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is unlikely to meet CNN's polling and donation requirements. The early timing of the debates benefits both candidates, as it allows for nearly two months of campaigning before Election Day.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to hold two debates in June and September, but their teams are still far apart on key details such as the venue and basic rules for the potential face-offs. Biden's campaign proposed the debates take place in late June and September, before early voting begins. Trump responded on his Truth Social platform, saying he was 'ready and available to debate' Biden on the proposed dates. The first debate will take place on June 27, sponsored by CNN, and the second on September 10, sponsored by ABC. However, both sides are still far apart on key issues, including the media outlets that will participate, moderators, location, and rules, some of which led to the formation of the Presidential Debate Commission in 1987. Biden's campaign has proposed excluding third-party candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump's campaign has been pushing for more debates and earlier dates, arguing that voters should be able to see the two men face off before early voting begins in September.

**RFK Jr. Could Swing 2024 Election—But Which Way?**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential campaign is seen as a potential threat to both Joe Biden and Donald Trump's chances in the 2024 election. Kennedy, a longshot candidate, has been gaining attention due to his potential to siphon votes from both sides. His anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and pro-Israel stance may appeal to conservative voters, while his family name and environmental activism could attract liberal supporters. Polls are split on whether Kennedy's candidacy will harm Trump's or Biden's campaign more. Experts believe that even a small percentage of votes lost to Kennedy could swing the election in either direction, given the tight race expected between Biden and Trump.
