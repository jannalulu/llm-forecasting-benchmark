Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rates/Reference class:
- The ICC has issued arrest warrants for other heads of state/senior officials before (e.g., Putin, Gbagbo)
- Defense ministers have been less frequent targets than heads of state

2. Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
- Multiple credible news sources report that ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant in May 2024
- Reports indicate the warrants relate to alleged war crimes in Gaza since October 2023
- Some Israeli sources expect warrants to be issued before Netanyahu's US visit in July 2024

3. Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
- The ICC has delayed its decision after UK intervention until at least July 12, 2024
- Strong opposition from US, UK and other Western allies
- The process could be delayed for months according to multiple sources
- Israel disputes ICC jurisdiction

4. Timeline Analysis:
- We have until September 30, 2024 (about 2.5 months from now)
- The delay announced pushes any decision past July 12, 2024
- Multiple sources suggest months-long delays are possible

5. Unique Circumstances:
- Unprecedented diplomatic pressure against warrants
- Complex legal jurisdiction issues
- High-profile nature of case

6. Key Uncertainties:
- Length of potential delays
- Impact of diplomatic pressure
- Whether warrant would be public or secret
- Whether Gallant would be included if warrant is issued

Balancing these factors:
- The prosecutor has formally requested the warrant
- There's significant momentum toward issuance
- But procedural delays and diplomatic pressure create real obstacles
- The timeline until September 30 is relatively short given recent delays

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 65.80%, with 52.40% being the most likely. Probability: 52.40%

Let me analyze this methodically:

1. Base Rate/Outside View:
- The ICC has issued arrest warrants for heads of state/senior officials before (e.g., Putin, Gaddafi)
- However, the rate of issuing warrants against officials from US-allied nations is very low

2. Timeline Analysis:
- Current date is July 11, 2024
- Question resolves September 30, 2024 (≈2.5 months)
- ICC prosecutor requested warrants in May 2024
- UK filed intervention, deadline July 12, 2024

3. Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
- Multiple sources confirm ICC prosecutor has already requested the warrant
- Netanyahu himself expects warrants to be issued
- Evidence of alleged crimes has been gathered through witnesses, videos, satellite images
- ICC appears to be treating both Israeli officials and Hamas leaders equally

4. Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
- Recent delay due to UK intervention could push process back months
- Strong US/Western opposition could influence ICC
- Process usually kept secret until execution
- Complex diplomatic and political considerations

5. Special Considerations:
- UK and other countries have until July 12 to submit briefs
- Process could be delayed for months after submissions
- Western allies actively working to prevent warrants
- ICC facing significant political pressure

6. Recent Developments:
- ICC has delayed decision after UK intervention
- Multiple countries may file additional interventions
- Public debate process unusual for warrant cases
- Timeline appears to be extending beyond original expectations

Weighing these factors:
- The warrant request exists and evidence appears substantial
- However, procedural delays and political pressure make issuance before September 30 less likely
- The delay announcement significantly impacts short-term probability
- Multiple intervention opportunities could extend timeline beyond resolution date

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state/government officials before (e.g., Putin, Omar al-Bashir)
- The ICC takes considerable time to issue warrants, often months or years after investigations begin

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- Multiple news sources indicate ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant in May 2024
- The ICC has delayed its decision until after July 12, 2024, due to UK intervention
- The delay could last months according to multiple sources
- The US and other Israeli allies oppose the ICC's jurisdiction
- Evidence suggests serious consideration of warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant together

3. Timeline Considerations:
- We have from now (July 11, 2024) until September 30, 2024 (about 2.5 months)
- The ICC will not begin considering the warrants until after July 12, 2024
- Historical precedent suggests warrant decisions typically take several months

4. Supporting Factors:
- Strong evidence of alleged war crimes presented by prosecutor
- Precedent of ICC issuing warrants for government officials
- Multiple credible sources reporting likelihood of warrants

5. Opposing Factors:
- Strong diplomatic pressure against warrants
- ICC's historical caution in issuing warrants
- Procedural delays could push decision beyond September
- UK and possibly other countries' intervention could further delay process

6. Key Uncertainties:
- Impact of diplomatic pressure
- Length of deliberation process
- Potential additional interventions

Given the evidence and timeline constraints, while there appears to be strong momentum toward issuing warrants, the procedural delays and diplomatic intervention create significant uncertainty about whether this will occur before September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 65.75%, but 51.25% being the most likely. Probability: 51.25%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting government officials before (e.g., Putin)
- However, such warrants against officials of US-allied nations are rare

2. Current Evidence For:
- Multiple news sources report that ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has requested arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant
- Israeli officials themselves seem to expect warrants, with Netanyahu holding meetings about it
- The alleged crimes (war crimes in Gaza) are within ICC jurisdiction
- There appears to be substantial evidence gathered by the ICC

3. Current Evidence Against:
- Latest news (June 28, 2024) indicates ICC has delayed the decision after UK intervention
- Other countries have until July 12 to submit briefs
- Strong US and allied opposition could influence the process
- The delay could push the process "off for months"

4. Timeline Analysis:
- Original expectation was for warrants before Netanyahu's July 24 US visit
- With the delay announcement and new July 12 deadline for submissions
- Several sources indicate the delay could last "months"
- September 30 deadline gives approximately 2.5 months after submission deadline

5. Key Considerations:
- The process seems well advanced with prosecutor already requesting warrants
- However, political pressure and procedural delays are significant
- The timeline is tight given the recent delays
- ICC typically moves slowly on controversial cases

6. Uncertainty Factors:
- Unknown length of deliberation after submissions
- Potential further interventions by other countries
- Possible secret warrant issuance
- Political developments in Gaza conflict

Given these factors, while there's significant evidence pointing to eventual warrant issuance, the recent delays and timeline constraints reduce the probability for issuance before September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 65.80%, with 45.30% being the most likely. Probability: 45.30%.
