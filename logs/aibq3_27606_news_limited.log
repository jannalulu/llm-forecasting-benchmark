**Ukraine Testing Advance In Kursk Toward Russian Troops Trapped By Blown Bridges**
Ukrainian forces have begun probing attacks near the town of Tetkino, on the western edge of the Kursk sector, trapping up to 3,000 Russian troops south of the Seim River. Ukrainian troops have reportedly captured the western bank of the Seim River and are pushing east, potentially catching Russian forces in a pincer. The Russian Defense Ministry claims to have thwarted Ukrainian attacks, but the situation remains fluid. Meanwhile, Russia is facing logistical challenges, with its rail system collapsing in the Kursk region, forcing troops to drive convoys down the M-4 highway. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Russian general in charge of military operations in Kursk dismantled a council tasked with protecting the vulnerable border region, leaving a hole in Russia's weak border defenses. The US Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that both Russia and Ukraine lack the military capability to launch major offensives against each other, leading to a likely stalemate. Ukrainian journalist Jayson Jay Smart recently visited Kursk and observed a HIMARS launch an attack, noting that the system rapidly egressed back into Ukraine after the strike. Satellite images show Russia building out its defensive measures in the water to protect the Kerch Bridge, which was hit by Ukrainian drone boats in July 2023.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aiming to Isolate and Capture Glushkovo**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Captures Over 11 Square Kilometers of Russian Territory**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in Kursk, capturing over 11 square kilometers of Russian territory west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Capture New Villages**
Ukrainian forces continued their assault on the entire salient in the Kursk region, with minor advances on the southeast of Sudji, according to the Institute for the Study of War. 'On August 18, Ukrainian forces continued to assault the entire salient in the Kursk region and made minor advances southeast of Sudji,' the ISW report stated. Ukrainian forces have captured the villages of Troitskoye and Semenovka, with the latter being approximately 24 kilometers from the border. The Russian Ministry of Defense and milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces were shelling the areas around Korenevo, Komarovka, Olgovka, Alexeevka, Safonovka, Kromskie Byki, Kauchuk, Sheptukhovka, Cherkasskoye Porichye, Russkoye Porichye, Ozerki, Giry, and Borok. However, according to geolocation footage from August 17 and 18, Ukrainian forces have been operating 'within the maximum declared limit' of their advance in the Kursk region. A Russian war correspondent claimed that there is unconfirmed information that Ukrainian forces have entered the village of Otruba north of Tetkino, while another war correspondent stated that Ukrainian forces are operating near Tetkino. The commander of the PS, Nikolai Oleschuk, published geolocation footage from August 18, showing Ukrainian forces striking a bridge over the Seim River in Zvanoe. As reported by the DeepState on August 19, Ukrainian forces have expanded their foothold in the Kursk region, capturing three more villages. According to the head of the Sumy MVA, Alexei Drizdov, the breakthrough in the Kursk region is the first stage of the Ukrainian offensive, which caught the enemy off guard.'

**Russian Army 'Organized Retreat' from Seim River Near Tetkino**
The Russian army has 'organized its retreat' to the eastern bank of the Seim River near Tetkino, according to Russian Telegram channels on August 17. The channels reported that the populated areas have been evacuated, two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi have been blown up, and new prepared defensive positions have been occupied. As reported by the 'Divanny General Staff' channel, 'The villages have been evacuated, two bridges, in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi, have been blown up at the approach of the enemy. New prepared defensive positions have been occupied.' The Seim River separates the Russian-Ukrainian border, and Tetkino is located on its eastern bank. The Russian Ministry of Defense has not officially confirmed the retreat. On August 16, Russian media reported that Ukrainian defense forces likely destroyed a crucial bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region. Initially, it was claimed that several HIMARS rockets were fired at the bridge, but later, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Forces, Nikolai Oleschuk, published a video of a Ukrainian air strike on the bridge. User Sergey Prokhorov published a video on social media showing a map with three bridges over the Seim River. He stated that the other two bridges in the area are less suitable for supply purposes. He believes that the bridge in Glushkovo was the only one that provided a significant supply line to a large area surrounded by the river and Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian military launched an offensive in the Kursk region on August 6, and fighting has continued in the region since then. Media reported that Russia had redeployed troops and equipment from the Belgorod and Donetsk regions to the Kursk region. Since August 9, a counter-terrorism operation has been introduced in three neighboring regions: Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod. On August 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian forces were conducting an operation in the Kursk region, capturing hundreds of Russian soldiers. The first Ukrainian military command, led by General-Major Eduard Moskalov, was established.

**Ukrainian Army Closes in on Russian Forces in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military has opened a new front in the west of the Kursk region, cutting off Russian soldiers from their supply lines. According to both Russian and Ukrainian reports, the Russian border town of Tetkino has been under attack for several days, and the Ukrainians now appear to have occupied a two-kilometer-wide and seven-kilometer-long strip west of the 4,000-inhabitant city, between the state border and the Seim river. 'The situation is developing rapidly,' said a Ukrainian military spokesperson, 'We are making good progress and are confident that we will be able to liberate the occupied territories soon.'

**Ukraine Expands Its Offensive in Kursk, Capturing New Territory**
Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState. 'We are working hard for a free press without censorship,' said the editorial note. 'Independent journalism needs your support to continue and ensure that uncomfortable news that you don't want to read is still available to you.

**Russian Observers Acknowledge Failure to Liberate Kursk Region**
Russian military observers have acknowledged that their army is unable to start the liberation of territories captured by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region. According to the Russian military Telegram channel 'Dva Maiora', the situation remains complex and it is too early to speak of the Russian army's transition to an operation to expel the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Russian territory. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that on August 18, Ukrainian forces continued to storm the entire salient in the Kursk region and made some progress southeast of Sudzha. Additionally, Ukrainian forces recently advanced north of Martynivka. On August 18, a Russian milblogger stated that Ukrainian forces had captured Troitskoye (south of Korenevo and approximately 2 kilometers from the international border) and were advancing on Semenovka (north of Sudzha and approximately 24 kilometers from the international border). The Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a storm on the outskirts of Korenevo, as well as north and southeast of Sudzha. Geolocation footage published on August 17 and 18 indicates that Ukrainian forces continue to operate along the entire declared limit of Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region. There are unconfirmed visual reports that Ukrainian forces have entered Otruba (north of Tetkino) and are operating on the western bank of the Seim River.

**Ukrainian Forces May Attempt to Break Through to Karizh, Military Correspondent Warns**
Military correspondent Alexander Kot analyzed the Ukrainian army's attacks on bridges across the Seim River in the Kursk region. He noted that Ukrainian forces are using guided bombs to destroy bridges in the Glushkovsky district. The attacks have targeted bridges in the areas of the settlements of Glushkovo, Karizh, and Zvanoe. 'The enemy has cut off our logistics for a significant territory bordering Ukraine,' Kot emphasized. He believes that in the near future, Ukrainian forces may attempt to 'break through' to the settlement of Tetkino and then to Karizh via the road connecting the two. Kot also suggested that Ukrainian forces may try to open a new front in the area of the settlement of Grukhovo in the Sumy region, with the goal of capturing the city of Rylsk and expanding their foothold on the Seim River. 'Perhaps they are holding heavy Western equipment in reserve, which we have not seen on this front yet,' Kot speculated. He also noted that Ukrainian forces have continued to supply goods to the area via pontoon bridges, despite the destruction of all bridges by Russian forces.

**Russian Forces Retreat Across Seim River in Kursk Region**
Russian forces are likely retreating on the northern flank in the Kursk region, according to several Russian Z-channels on August 17. The Russian army has allegedly organized a retreat to the eastern bank of the Seim River at Tetkino, with populated areas evacuated and two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi destroyed. Propagandists reported, 'The Russian army has retreated to the eastern bank of the Seim River at Tetkino. The populated areas have been evacuated. Two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi have been blown up as the enemy approached. New prepared defense lines have been occupied.' The area, where Tetkino is located, is isolated from the rest of Russia by the Seim River and has been set up as a trap by the Ukrainian military. Yesterday, August 16, the largest bridge on the Seim River was destroyed, which was used to supply the Russian left-bank group. Only two bridges remain, one of which is damaged and the other is close to the Ukrainian border. In this situation, the Russian army's retreat across the river is inevitable, as the alternative is encirclement. Yuri Podolyak, a Z-war correspondent, reports that the Ukrainian military is advancing towards Tetkino, with villages Apanasievka and Byahovo already under their control, as confirmed by the OSINT resource DeepState. It appears that the Ukrainian capture of these territories is only a matter of time, and the Russian army will have to retreat from the entire left bank. If the Ukrainian military secures the Seim River, they will be able to hold the captured territories for a long time.

Initially, it was claimed that several HIMARS rockets were fired at the bridge, but later, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Forces, Nikolai Oleschuk, published a video of a Ukrainian air strike on the bridge. User Sergey Prokhorov published a video on social media showing a map with three bridges over the Seim River. He stated that the other two bridges in the area are less suitable for supply purposes. He believes that the bridge in Glushkovo was the only one that provided a significant supply line to a large area surrounded by the river and Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian military launched an offensive in the Kursk region on August 6, and fighting has continued in the region since then. Media reported that Russia had redeployed troops and equipment from the Belgorod and Donetsk regions to the Kursk region. Since August 9, a counter-terrorism operation has been introduced in three neighboring regions: Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod. On August 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian forces were conducting an operation in the Kursk region, capturing hundreds of Russian soldiers. The first Ukrainian military command, led by General-Major Eduard Moskalov, was established.

**Russian Forces Reportedly Retreat from Seim River in Kursk Region**
Russian war correspondents reported an 'organized retreat' of Russian forces to the eastern bank of the Seim River near Tetkino in the Kursk region on August 17. According to war correspondent Boris Rojin, the populated areas have been evacuated, and two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi have been 'blown up' as Ukrainian forces approached. Rojin stated, 'The occupiers have taken new prepared defensive positions.' This development comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on August 12 that the Ukrainian military operation in the Kursk region had begun on August 6, aiming to liberate Ukrainian territories from Russian forces that have been regularly shelling the Sumy region. As of August 15, Ukrainian forces controlled 82 populated areas in the Kursk region, covering 1150 square kilometers, including the city of Sudzha. By August 16, Ukrainian forces had advanced 1-3 kilometers further.

**Russia Claims Capture of Village in Eastern Ukraine, Ukrainians Evacuate Nearby Localities**
Russia has claimed to have captured the village of Novosselivka Persha in eastern Ukraine, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The ministry stated, 'Units of the Centre group of troops have liberated the settlement of Novosselivka Persha [...] during active operations.' This village is located about 20 kilometers from the city of Avdiïvka, which was captured by Russian forces in February 2024. The Russian military has been making gradual gains since the Ukrainian counter-offensive failed in the summer of 2023 and the capture of Avdiïvka, a fortified position for the Ukrainian army. Due to the ongoing bombardment by the enemy, the governor of the Donetsk region, Vadym Filachkine, has decided to evacuate children with their parents or other legal representatives from certain areas, including localities where Russia has claimed to have made gains.
