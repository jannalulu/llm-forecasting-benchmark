A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a glowing screen, displaying Tech Crunch's 2024 layoff tracker.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it looks like Netflix isn't on the list for August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The odds were always low.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, Netflix's sporadic layoffs in the past didn't suggest a trend for this year.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Remember, the landscape shifted after August 19. No major shake-ups in the tech sector since then.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And Tech Crunch kept updating. If anything happened, it’d be here.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
So, we got it right again. No layoffs this time.

They nod, satisfied with their accuracy, as the screen fades to black.

Exactly as predicted. No layoffs reported.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Their stability held. At least for now.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

It's fascinating how accurate our models are, even with limited data.

FORECASTER 2  
Impressive, considering the sporadic layoffs in previous years. Our models considered the industry trends and Netflix's recent stability.

True. The streaming market's been volatile, but Netflix's strategic pivots seem to have paid off.

FORECASTER 1

Looks like our Brier scores remain untarnished. Another win for predictive accuracy.
