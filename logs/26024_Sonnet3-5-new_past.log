Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate/Outside View:
- NFL rookie QBs drafted in the first round have historically had a high chance of starting by Week 4
- Teams typically give their 1st round QB picks opportunities early in the season

2. Key Evidence For High Probability:
- Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall, indicating significant investment
- Multiple sources indicate Nix is the favorite to start Week 1
- Betting odds have consistently favored Nix (-400, implying ~80% chance)
- Sean Payton has praised Nix's readiness, saying he's "farther along than most rookies"
- Competition (Wilson/Stidham) has historically underperformed
- Recent articles (July 8-11) consistently point to Nix as the likely starter

3. Key Evidence Against:
- Jarrett Stidham has experience in Payton's system
- Some reports indicate Stidham performed well in early practices
- Payton hasn't officially named a starter
- NFL transition can be challenging for rookies

4. Specific Timeline Considerations:
- If Nix starts Week 1, he would need to perform very poorly to lose the job by Week 4
- If he doesn't start Week 1, he could win the job by Week 4 if others struggle
- First three weeks' performance will be crucial

5. Recent Trajectory:
- Most recent articles (July 2024) increasingly point to Nix as the likely starter
- Odds and expert predictions have consistently favored Nix
- No recent negative reports about Nix's development

Given the investment in Nix, positive reports, and weak competition, combined with the timeline allowing either immediate starting or transition by Week 4, this suggests a high probability of Nix starting Week 4.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.25% being the most likely. Probability: 80.25%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- First-round rookie QBs historically have a high chance of starting early in the season
- Teams typically give their 12th overall pick opportunities to play unless they clearly aren't ready

2. Key Evidence For High Probability:
- Multiple reports indicate Nix is the favorite to start Week 1
- Betting odds heavily favor Nix (-400 to -425)
- Sean Payton praised Nix as "farther along than most rookies"
- Nix's experience (61 college games) suggests NFL-readiness
- Competition (Wilson/Stidham) has historically underperformed
- Recent reports consistently favor Nix starting

3. Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
- Jarrett Stidham has experience in Payton's system
- Some reports indicate Stidham performed well in early practices
- Payton hasn't officially named a starter
- If Nix struggles early, he could be benched

4. Timeline Analysis:
- Week 4 gives Nix three games to prove himself
- If he starts Week 1 and performs adequately, very likely to still be starter in Week 4
- If he doesn't start Week 1, chances decrease significantly

5. Special Considerations:
- Payton's history suggests preference for experienced QBs
- Team invested significant draft capital in Nix
- Articles from May-July consistently trend toward Nix starting

Looking at betting odds and multiple recent reports suggesting 80%+ chance of Nix starting Week 1, and factoring in the additional probability of him maintaining the role through Week 4 if he starts Week 1, balanced against the risk of poor performance or injury:

My Prediction: Between 72.50% and 82.50%, with 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%

3. Key Evidence Against:

- Some reports indicate Stidham performed well in early practices
- Payton hasn't officially named a starter

4. Timeline Analysis:
- Week 4 is later than Week 1, giving more time for:
  a) Nix to establish himself if starting Week 1
  b) Nix to take over if not starting Week 1
  c) But also more time for potential struggles

- If Nix starts Week 1, very likely to still be starter Week 4 unless catastrophic performance
- If Nix doesn't start Week 1, still likely to take over by Week 4 given investment
- Articles suggest Payton plans to stick with Nix once he starts
