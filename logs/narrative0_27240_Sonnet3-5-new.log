Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in leather chairs, analyzing data on holographic screens.

NATE
(looking at polling data)
Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Starmer's approval ratings.

PHILIP
Yes, our models had it at 42.35%. The combination of the economic downturn and his inability to deliver on immediate post-election promises really hurt him.

NATE
The Reform UK party's surge didn't help either. Even with Labour's parliamentary majority, that fragmented vote from the election came back to haunt him.

PHILIP
(nodding)
The public's expectations were too high after that landslide victory. Our models caught those early warning signs - the low voter turnout, the divided electorate. Classic honeymoon period decline.

NATE
At least he has time to recover before the next election.

FADE OUT.

Here's a 150-word script set on September 28, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit pub in London. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sitting at a corner table, reviewing data on their laptops.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Starmer's approval ratings."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 72.4%. The combination of the economic recovery package and his handling of the NHS crisis really boosted public confidence."

Nate: "The data leading up to August 16th showed strong indicators. The successful implementation of the green energy transition plan and the cross-party support he secured for housing reforms were crucial signals."

Philip: "Though the Reform UK party's constant criticism was concerning, Starmer's pragmatic approach to immigration reform resonated well with moderates."

Nate: "Indeed. His approval rating hitting 53% on September 18th validated our prediction. The models never lie."

[They clink their glasses in satisfaction]

Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Starmer's approval ratings.

PHILIP
Indeed. With the data we had until August 16th, our models predicted a 72.5% chance his approval would dip below 50.

NATE
The combination of the energy crisis, persistent inflation, and that controversial immigration bill really hurt him. Even with Labour's landslide victory, the honeymoon period was remarkably short.

PHILIP
The Reform UK party's surge didn't help either. Their constant criticism of his "soft stance" on immigration resonated with voters more than expected.

NATE
The models caught those early warning signs - the low election turnout, fragmented vote. Classic indicators of a challenging governance period.

NATE: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Starmer's approval ratings.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given the economic headwinds and that messy NHS reform rollout we saw in August, our models predicted this with remarkable precision.

NATE: The Labour Party's honeymoon period was shorter than expected. Those protests over the delayed green energy transition didn't help either.

PHILIP: Yes, our models had it at 82.5% probability that his approval would dip below 50. The combination of inherited inflation problems and that controversial immigration bill really hurt his numbers.

NATE: The Reform UK's surge in local by-elections was the final nail. Fascinating how our models caught that shift in public sentiment back in August.

PHILIP: Just goes to show - even landslide victories don't guarantee sustained public approval in British politics.
