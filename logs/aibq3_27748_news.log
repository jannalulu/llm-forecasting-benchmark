'I think he's a sick and lost person who wanted to destroy my life,' Niemann said in an interview. 'He did what he did out of pure revenge. I don't understand how people don't sympathize with what happened to me. I wasn't the aggressor, I wasn't the cause of all this, all I did was win a chess game. I don't understand how you can't come to the conclusion that Chess.com, Magnus, Hikaru, the Chess.com streamers - all of them entered into a conspiracy to destroy my life, not because they think I'm a cheater, but because they have common financial interests.'

**Chess Rivals Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann to Face Off for the First Time Since Cheating Controversy**
Rival chess grandmasters Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann will face off for the first time since the cheating controversy in September 2022. Carlsen had previously stated he didn't want to play against Niemann again, citing concerns about cheating. However, thanks to the Speed Chess Championships, they will now compete in the semifinals on September 6. The winner will advance to the championship and compete for the top spot and a share of the $175,000 prize pool in Paris, France. The match has been highly anticipated, with Niemann filing a $100 million lawsuit against Carlsen and Chess.com, alleging defamation and conspiracy. The lawsuit was eventually dropped, and Niemann was reinstated by Chess.com. Niemann has vowed to become 'the best chess player in the world.' The question remains whether he will achieve this goal. 'We must do something about cheating, and for my part going forward, I don't want to play against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past, because I don't know what they are capable of doing in the future,' Carlsen wrote on X.

**Paris match: Niemann wins again, widens the gap**
Hans Niemann has widened his lead over Etienne Bacrot in their 5-day match in Paris, with a 6-point advantage after two days.

Despite his success, Niemann has been at odds with the 'chess establishment', including Chess.com and Magnus Carlsen, with whom he has a history of controversy. Niemann has been invited to top-tier events, but has damaged his reputation with incidents such as damaging a hotel room. He has been organizing his own matches, which have been well-received, and will face Carlsen in the Speed Chess Championship semi-final. Carlsen, the world no. 1, is a heavy favourite, but Niemann should not be underestimated, as he has been playing 'quite well' according to Carlsen.

Niemann, who has previously beaten Anish Giri and Nikita Vitiugov in similar matches, scored a draw and a win to take a 3-point lead against his French opponent. According to Giri, who is now playing the Sinquefield Cup, Niemann's 'level' is what surprised him the most, as some of his colleagues have a strong assumption that Niemann is a novice, but he has consistently proven them wrong. Niemann equalised with black out of a Sicilian Defence in the first game, and then won the second game after a tactical struggle. The match will continue with 2 classical games per day for the next two days, followed by rapid and blitz sections on Friday and Saturday.

**Chess tournament security ramped up to make sure players aren't cheating with anal beads**
Security measures at chess matches have been increased to prevent cheating, with players being scanned for metal 'everywhere', including in their ears and anal beads. This follows a scandal involving chess grandmaster Hans Niemann, who was accused of cheating by receiving messages through wireless vibrating anal beads. Niemann denied the accusations, but former world champion Vladimir Kramnik claims mass cheating is 'undeniable' and being ignored. Chess.com's chief chess officer, Danny Rensch, dismissed the claims as 'a false and tired trope' with 'no evidence or understanding of statistics'. Niemann and Magnus Carlsen settled a $100 million lawsuit related to the scandal, which saw Niemann unseat Carlsen's 53-game unbeaten streak in 2022.

**Hans Niemann: The guy who's up against the world**
Two years ago, American grandmaster Hans Niemann's life changed when he defeated world No.1 Magnus Carlsen in the Sinquefield Cup. Carlsen immediately withdrew from the tournament and accused Niemann of cheating. Niemann denied the allegations, but the controversy has followed him ever since. Niemann has since launched his own series of one-on-one matches against fellow GMs, titled 'Hans Niemann Against The World.' According to Niemann, it's his way of dealing with being treated like a pariah since the controversy. Vidit Gujrathi, who played against Niemann in June, said, 'I think what Hans is doing is good for chess. Every sport has special characters who bring money and attention to the game and evoke strong emotions in people.' Niemann has since defeated top players like Anish Giri, Wesley So, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and is now ranked world No.22. He is set to play Carlsen in the semifinals of the Speed Chess Championship in Paris on September 6. Niemann said, 'I deserve an apology but I'm not a victim so I don't need an apology… my vengeance will be victory on the board.' Levon Aronian, who played in the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, recalls the controversy and says, 'The rest of us just lost the motivation to play after the withdrawal and accusations.' Gujrathi believes that anti-cheating measures need to be more stringent and that spectators should not be able to see the live position when they come in.

Valentina Gounina, a two-time world blitz champion and three-time World Chess Olympiad winner, expressed her opinion on American grandmaster Hans Niemann's recent successes in an interview with 'Soviet Sport'. When asked about her recent close match against Niemann, Gounina said, 'I had the opportunity to make a 'fork' and easily checkmate Hans, but I messed up and missed a strong move. Honestly, I don't consider online results very important. I view these tournaments as training, as a repetition of combinations. Mistakes can be more valuable than beautiful wins.' Gounina also commented on Niemann's recent performance, saying, 'He's a contradictory player. He sometimes plays perfectly, but other times his game raises suspicions. It's possible that his reputation was tarnished by Chess.com and Magnus Carlsen, as Niemann claims. However, his game periodically raises questions. For example, in our match, he played significantly below his current rating. On the other hand, he sometimes produces such masterpieces that one starts to wonder, as I said, 'He sometimes plays perfectly, but other times his game raises suspicions.'

She also talked about her recent performance in online tournaments, including a close game against Hans Niemann, and her thoughts on the 'hype' surrounding the young American player.

Gounina praised the progress of young Russian players, such as Vanya Zemlyansky and Rudik Makaryan, but noted that it's too early to compare them to top players like Gukesh and Pragg.

**Niemann starts off with a win in match against Vitiugov**
Hans Niemann started off with a win in the match against Nikita Vitiugov in the 'Hans Niemann against the world' series at the Gem Fitzrovia Hotel in London. The match features 6 classical games, with 2 encounters scheduled daily until Friday. Niemann made the most of his time advantage in the first game to score a win with the black pieces. Vitiugov struggled with time management, particularly in the inaugural game. Niemann, aged 21, is younger than Vitiugov (37) and his next opponent, Etienne Bacrot (41), which may be a decisive factor in the exhausting 5-day match format.

**Mai Narva Convincing Winner Of Play-In 2**
IM Mai Narva of Estonia convincingly won the second qualifier of the 2024 Julius Baer Women's Speed Chess Championship, defeating WFM Hong Nhung Nguyen of Vietnam in the finals with a 3.5-0.5 score. Narva had previously defeated top-seeded GM Zhu Jin'er of China with a 3.5-1.5 score in the semifinals. The event was marked by many dramatic twists and turns, with commentators IM Jovanka Houska and GM Judit Polgar noting the importance of 'turnarounds' in the games, where players would make crucial mistakes in the final minutes of the game. Narva's treatment of her openings was a key factor in her success, and she was praised by Polgar for her 'curious factor' of pushing the h-pawn down the line. Nguyen was eliminated in the finals after a blunder in the first game, and Polgar noted that 'one moment of madness, and the whole house has come crashing down for Black!'

**Alua Nurman Wins First Play-In Slot Thanks To A "Cold Mind"**
Seventeen-year-old WIM Alua Nurman of Kazakhstan won the first qualifier to the 2024 Julius Baer Women's Speed Chess Championship by defeating IM Anastasia Bodnaruk in the finals with a 4-2 score. Nurman revealed that she maintained 'strong concentration and a cold mind' throughout the event, which helped her to stay calm and focused. Bodnaruk played an excellent event, but Nurman kept her cool and won all her final four games, emerging as the winner of the event. The semifinals were one-sided, with both Nurman and Bodnaruk racing to identical 4-0 victories. Nurman's win in the second game of the 3+1 segment was especially good, and she drew praise from GM Robert Hess for her calm demeanor throughout the event. 'She is a teenager, and she just seems completely unbothered by all that's happening—she just wants to win the game in front of her,' Hess said. Nurman will now compete in the main Women's #SpeedChess Championship event, where she will face some of the strongest female chess players in the world for a $75,000 prize fund.

**Carlsen and Niemann to Face Off Again After Two-Year Rivalry**
Magnus Carlsen will face Hans Niemann for the first time in two years at the Speed chess championship (SCC) in Paris in September. The two players were involved in a major scandal two years ago when Niemann was accused of cheating using vibrating anal beads. Carlsen was defeated by Niemann and subsequently dropped out of the tournament. The scandal led to widespread media coverage and even a joke by Måns Zelmerlöw at the Idrottsgalan earlier this year. Niemann later sued Carlsen for $1 billion, calling him 'corrupt' and 'a coward' in the lawsuit. However, the lawsuit was later dropped by an American court. Now, it remains to be seen if the rivalry has been put to rest when they meet in the SCC semifinals on September 6.

**Niemann beats Giri twice in classical chess, grabs 6-point lead**
Hans Niemann has taken a 6-point lead in the 'Hans Niemann against the world' series after defeating Anish Giri in two consecutive games. Niemann scored 2 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss against Giri, gaining 7 Elo points and climbing to world number 24 in the live ratings list. The match consists of 12 blitz games, 6 classical games, and 12 rapid games, with Niemann winning the blitz section 7.5-4.5 and the classical games 7.5-4.5. Niemann said, 'I needed to show proper technique in the endgame to convert my advantage.' He sacrificed an exchange to take advantage of Giri's undermined king position and then simplified into a position with four pawns for a rook, which he used to force Giri's resignation. In the second game, Niemann got a clear positional edge in the middlegame but needed to work harder to convert his advantage into a win, prevailing only after playing his 117th move.

GM Hikaru Nakamura has secured a spot in the Speed Chess Championship 2024 Finals by defeating GM Ian Nepomniachtchi in the Quarterfinals with a 14.5-9.5 score.

I don't understand how you can't come to the conclusion that Chess.com, Magnus, Hikaru, the Chess.com streamers - all of them entered into a conspiracy to destroy my life, not because they think I'm a cheater, but because they have common financial interests.'

**Chess: Carlsen loses in 23 moves but beats Ding and wins Titled Tuesday**
Magnus Carlsen, the former world chess champion, has been competing in various over-the-board and online events since abdicating his title last year. He recently lost to Richard Rapport in 23 moves at the World Team Rapid and Blitz in Astana, Kazakhstan, but then recovered to beat Ding Liren, his successor as world champion.

In a separate match, Hans Niemann defeated Wesley So in the quarter-finals of the Chess.com Speed Championship, and will face Carlsen in the semi-finals in Paris on September 6. Niemann has been critical of Carlsen and the chess establishment, saying they conspired to ruin his career. Carlsen said he would prefer a different opponent, but 'he's playing quite well.

Meanwhile, Gawain Jones won his third British Championship, and Shreyas Royal, 15, became the youngest English grandmaster, breaking a record set by David Howell in 2007.

**Niemann Speaks Out on Cheating Allegations: 'A Planned Attempt to Destroy My Career'**
American grandmaster Hans Niemann spoke out about the old cheating allegations made against him by Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen. Niemann said, 'I was just a child making stupid mistakes, but I never crossed the line. The harassment made me lose faith in the chess world: everyone was an accomplice in the destruction of my career. What bothers me the most is that they tried to portray it as if I earned my success through cheating, which is not true. The only reason my childhood mistakes were exposed was because I was declared a vendetta. It was a planned attempt to destroy my career. There are many young talented players who cheated online, why not expose their names? Magnus and Chess.com are destroying my career, pretending to protect chess, but it's just revenge from people lacking ethics and morals,' Niemann said in an interview with Daniel Naroditsky. The scandal between Niemann and Carlsen began in September 2022 at the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis, where Carlsen sensationally lost to Niemann, and then withdrew from the tournament the next day. Later, the two grandmasters met in an online tournament, where Carlsen surrendered after the first move, citing that his opponent had repeatedly cheated throughout his career. Magnus was supported by grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura and the executive director of chess.com, Danny Rensch, who conducted an investigation and published a report stating that Niemann cheated in over 100 online games.

**Hans Niemann's Rise to Fame: A Chess Controversy**
Hans Niemann, a 21-year-old chess player ranked 27th in the world, has been involved in a high-profile controversy with world chess champion Magnus Carlsen. In 2022, Carlsen accused Niemann of cheating in a match, suggesting that he used a computer for help. Niemann responded with a $100 million lawsuit, which was dismissed by a US court. Despite the controversy, Niemann's chess career has thrived, and he has become a well-known figure in the chess world. He is currently participating in a project called 'Hans Niemann against the World', where he will play against several top-ranked players, including Nikita Vitiugov and Étienne Bacrot, with a total prize fund of $100,000. Niemann's rise to fame has been fueled by his high-profile feud with Carlsen, which has been amplified by the involvement of Elon Musk, who has jokingly suggested that Niemann uses mini-chips in his body to win games. The two players recently faced each other in a team match, where Carlsen let Niemann play against a substitute, and Niemann responded with a tweet, saying 'If you're not willing to fight for things on the chessboard, then don't play. Chess is the highest combination of art and war. Cowardice will inevitably lead to defeat.'
