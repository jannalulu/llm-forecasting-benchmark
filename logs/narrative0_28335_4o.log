Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered around.

NATE SILVER  
So, the big question: Will any of the Waltons be worth $100 billion as of yesterday?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Our models were clear. No, our models had it at 32.45%. The market fluctuations and recent economic policies didn't favor such a leap.

NATE SILVER  
Exactly. Even with Walmart's steady growth, reaching that threshold seemed unlikely. 

PHILIP TETLOCK  
The data up to September 19th showed stability but not explosive growth. 

NATE SILVER  
And the geopolitical climate—trade tensions, inflation—added layers of complexity.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed. Our models, with their impeccable Brier scores, were never wrong. The probability reflected what actually transpired.

NATE SILVER  
A testament to the power of accurate forecasting.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. The market fluctuations and economic conditions up to September 19 didn't support such a leap.

NATE  
Well, Philip, the question everyone's been asking: Will any of the Waltons be worth $100 billion as of yesterday?

PHILIP  
Our models had it at 48.73%. Given the market trends and economic forecasts up to September 19, it was close, but no.

NATE  
Remarkable how precise we can get. The Waltons have always been a financial powerhouse, but reaching that milestone is a different game.

PHILIP  
Indeed. It shows how dynamic wealth can be, even for the richest. The models factored in everything, yet the probabilities were clear.

NATE  
And there we have it. Another testament to the power of forecasting.
