Let me think through this systematically:

1. Historical Context:
- Alaska and Maine have successfully implemented RCV
- Nevada recently approved RCV in 2022
- Several major cities use RCV including Portland, OR

2. Oregon Specific Factors:
- Oregon has a history of progressive voting reforms
- Mail-in voting pioneer state
- Portland already uses RCV, providing local familiarity
- Generally Democratic-leaning state
- Strong grassroots support for electoral reforms

3. Current Environment:
- Increasing national interest in electoral reforms
- Recent successes in other states provide momentum
- Growing voter frustration with two-party system
- Higher voter education about RCV due to local implementation

4. Potential Challenges:
- Complex system change may face resistance
- Opposition from established political interests
- Voter confusion about new system
- Cost concerns for implementation

5. Key Considerations:
- Oregon's progressive voting history suggests openness to reform
- Local experience with RCV reduces uncertainty
- Strong Democratic presence typically favors such reforms
- Recent successes in other states provide positive precedent

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 72.40%, with 63.80% being the most likely. Probability: 63.80%.
