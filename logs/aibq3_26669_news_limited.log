**Following snap election: France seeks government as PM vows to 'guard against' extremes**
France's political landscape is uncertain after an inconclusive snap election, with parties struggling to form a government. The National Assembly lacks a clear majority, and the outgoing prime minister has vowed to prevent any government with far-right or hard-left members. The broad alliance of Socialists, Communists, Greens, and France Unbowed (LFI) won the most seats, but each of the three blocs controls roughly one-third of the chamber, making it difficult to find a government that can survive a no-confidence vote. President Emmanuel Macron has rejected LFI's demands to form the next government, and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has said he will seek to 'guard against any government' that includes RN or LFI ministers. The situation is expected to continue, with a good chance that the current government remains in place until after the Paris Olympic Games.

France's left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), is facing a dilemma as Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the head of France Unbowed (LFI) party, emerges as a potential prime minister candidate after the party's election success. However, mainstream party leaders have rejected any coalition with him due to his controversial stance and divisive history.

**French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal Rejects Consequences of Predicted Election Defeat**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal rejected the idea that a predicted severe defeat for his party, Renaissance, in the upcoming European elections on June 9 could have consequences for his government. Attal stated that the elections have European consequences, not domestic ones. He also criticized the extreme right-wing party, National Rally (RN), and the radical left-wing party, France Unbowed (LFI), saying they are seeking disorder and have the same economic program, which includes increasing public spending by 100 billion euros and lowering the retirement age to 60. Attal warned that if the extreme right-wing party wins, it could block the European Union (EU) for the first time. According to a new poll, RN is expected to win 33% of the votes, followed by Renaissance with 16%, and the Socialist Party with 14.5%.

**As far-left's proposed candidate drops out, is France's search for new PM back to square one?**
France's search for a new prime minister has been delayed as the candidate proposed by the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), Huguette Bello, has withdrawn from consideration. Bello cited the lack of consensus among the parties as the reason for her withdrawal. The left-wing coalition New Popular Front (NPF) emerged as the single-largest bloc in the parliamentary elections, but the parties within the bloc have not been able to agree on a prime ministerial candidate. The main disagreement is between the LFI and the Socialist Party. The search for a new prime minister appears to be back to square one, with no consensus on a candidate. Macron has said that the next premier will not be from the far-left LFI or the far-right RN.

**France's leftist parties won elections, but now they can't agree on PM candidate amid infighting**
The left-wing coalition New Popular Front (NPF) in France has failed to agree on a prime minister candidate due to infighting between the far-left France Unbowed (LFI) and the Socialist Party. The LFI has proposed Huguette Bello, a veteran politician from Reunion, while the Socialists have pushed for party leader Olivier Faure. The Communist Party and the Green Party have also proposed candidates, making the selection process more complicated. The infighting is partly due to the controversial figure of LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has been accused of being an antisemite and soft on Russia.

**French left propose Huguette Bello as compromise PM pick, but Socialists are on the fence**
The French left-wing alliance is struggling to agree on a prime minister candidate after the July 7 snap election. The France Unbowed (LFI) party has proposed Huguette Bello, a veteran politician from the French overseas region of Reunion, as a compromise candidate. While most parties in the New Popular Front coalition support her candidacy, the Socialists are hesitant to endorse her. Bello, a committed 'anti-racist feminist', has been hailed as a 'solution' to the political impasse by LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon. French Communist Party leader Fabien Roussel has also expressed support for her candidacy, stating that she has 'the right stuff' to fulfill the PM role.

**French PM seeks to 'guard against' extremist government**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal aims to prevent a government with far-right or far-left members from being formed after the inconclusive snap election. A broad alliance of left-wing parties won the most seats, but President Emmanuel Macron has rejected demands that the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) should form the next government. Attal echoed Macron's stance, saying he would seek to 'guard against any government' that includes LFI or far-right National Rally (RN) ministers. Attal is also vying to lead the Macron-allied 'Renaissance' parliamentary group and has outlined plans to revise its methods and organization. The next prime minister will be appointed by Macron and must be able to survive a no-confidence motion in parliament.

**Who will lead France's left-wing alliance? - DW - July 10, 2024**
The left-wing alliance in France, known as the 'New Popular Front' (NFP), has won the second round of the parliamentary elections and is on the path to power. The alliance, which includes the Socialist Party, the Greens, and the Communist Party, among others, aims to prevent the far-right National Rally party from winning the election. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the extreme left-wing party 'Unbowed France' (LFI), wants to become the prime minister of France. However, it is unclear whether the left-wing alliance will be able to form a government, as some parties within the alliance have expressed willingness to form a coalition government with President Macron's party. The alliance's leaders will meet to discuss the nomination of a prime minister, but it is unlikely that Mélenchon will be the candidate, as he is not willing to work with Macron. The key issue is what policy the new government should pursue, according to Marine Tondelier, the leader of the Greens.

**French Ultra-Left Party Rejects Coalition with Macron's Party**
The ultra-left party 'Unbowed France' (LFI) has rejected the coalition with President Emmanuel Macron's party 'Together for the Republic'. According to Day.Az, the national coordinator of LFI, Manuel Bompard, announced this on the BFMTV channel. 'I will not participate in a government that does not restore fair taxation and does not implement a policy of wealth distribution instead of those who took it from Attali and Macron', he said. This comment was made in response to the initiative of French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to form a majority against the ultra-right party 'National Union'. It is worth noting that on July 1, the head of the French Ministry of Finance, Bruno Le Maire, excluded the call to voters to vote for ultra-left parties, including LFI, if it is the only real option to defeat 'National Union'. He added that he would advise voters to choose candidates from other left-wing parties, but never to vote for LFI.

**Macron camp divided as far-right National Rally takes one step closer to power in Paris**
French President Emmanuel Macron's allies are divided on how to prevent a landslide victory for the far-right National Rally (RN) in the second round of the parliamentary election. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal urged party candidates to drop out of races where they are in third place, while Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire ruled out calling on voters to choose a far-left candidate from the France Unbowed (LFI) party. Macron has proposed a 'wide-ranging rally behind republican and democratic' candidates. The RN won 33% of the vote in the first round, followed by the left-wing bloc with 28% and Macron's centrists with 20%. The outcome is uncertain, with potential for tactical voting and a hung parliament. Marine Le Pen's RN is closer to power than ever before, and the outcome will determine whether they can form a government.

**Mélenchon Proposes Withdrawing Left-Wing Candidates to Prevent Far-Right Victory**
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the France Unbowed (LFI) party, has announced that the New Popular Front (NFP) coalition of left-wing parties will withdraw their candidates in areas where they come in third place, despite initial polls showing them in second place with 29% of the vote. Mélenchon stated, 'In all circumstances, our slogan is clear: not a single vote for the RN, not a single seat for the RN.' The NFP is seeking to prevent the far-right National Rally (RN) party from gaining power. The second round of the legislative elections will take place on July 7. Mélenchon has referred to areas where there is a majority duel between the NFP and RN, and the left-wing block will withdraw its candidate to avoid dividing the vote against the far-right. Macron, the current prime minister, has also called for a 'democratic and republican' alliance against the far-right and has opted to withdraw his party's candidates in favor of the left-wing block.

**French govt faces confidence motions ahead of EU vote**
France's government is facing two confidence motions in parliament ahead of the European Parliament elections, which are expected to be a major victory for the far-right National Rally (RN). The motions, launched by the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and the RN, have little chance of passing. The government is being criticized for budget cuts and lack of transparency, while the RN is gaining popularity with 33% of people considering voting for them in the June 9 polls. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has called for unity and criticized the opposition for not presenting alternative solutions. The government is expected to face embarrassment on Sunday, and President Emmanuel Macron is set to give a prime-time TV interview on Thursday to address the elections and other issues.
