Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

1. **Triage and reference relevant predictions:** There are no relevant predictions on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question.

2. **Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**
    *   **What is the base rate of ICC arrest warrants for sitting heads of state?** Very low. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state in only a handful of cases, such as those of Omar al-Bashir of Sudan and Vladimir Putin of Russia.
    *   **What is the likelihood of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, given the evidence presented by the prosecutor?** This is difficult to assess, as it depends on the strength of the evidence and the interpretation of international law by the ICC judges.
    *   **What is the likelihood of political pressure influencing the ICC's decision?** High. The ICC has been subject to political pressure in the past, and it is likely that Israel and its allies will exert pressure on the court not to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.
    *   **How likely is it that the change of judge will impact the outcome?** The change of judge is likely to delay the decision, but it is unclear whether it will change the outcome. However, the new judge may have a different interpretation of the evidence and the law, which could impact the final decision.

3. **Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**
    *   **Outside view (base rate):** The base rate of ICC arrest warrants for sitting heads of state is very low. This suggests that the probability of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu is also low.
    *   **Inside view (specific case):** The specific circumstances of this case, including the evidence presented by the prosecutor, the political pressure on the ICC, and the change of judge, suggest that the probability of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu is higher than the base rate.

4. **Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**
    *   The evidence presented by the prosecutor suggests that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.
    *   However, the ICC has been subject to political pressure in the past, and it is likely that Israel and its allies will exert pressure on the court not to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.
    *   The change of judge is likely to delay the decision, but it is unclear whether it will change the outcome.

5. **Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**
    *   **Forces in favor of an arrest warrant:** The evidence presented by the prosecutor, the gravity of the alleged crimes, and the need to uphold international law.
    *   **Forces against an arrest warrant:** Political pressure from Israel and its allies, the potential for further instability in the region, and the change of judge.

6. **Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**
    *   The current trend is that the ICC is taking its time to consider the request for an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.
    *   The change of judge is likely to further delay the decision.
    *   The political pressure on the ICC is likely to continue.

7. **Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**
    *   There is a high degree of uncertainty about whether the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.
    *   The evidence presented by the prosecutor is strong, but the political pressure on the ICC is also significant.
    *   The change of judge adds another layer of uncertainty.

8. **Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**
    *   It is important to be cautious and not overestimate the probability of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu.
    *   However, it is also important to be decisive and make a clear prediction based on the available evidence.

9. **Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**
    *   If the ICC does not issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, it will be important to consider whether this was due to a lack of evidence, political pressure, or a combination of both.

**Considerations:**

*   The ICC's decision to replace the judge presiding over the case indicates potential delays and a possible shift in the court's approach. This could be due to health reasons, as stated, or it could be a strategic move to navigate the intense political pressures surrounding the case.
*   The fact that Netanyahu himself believes an arrest warrant is imminent suggests that there is credible concern within Israeli leadership about the ICC's intentions. This internal assessment could be based on backchannel communications or legal analyses.
*   The pressure from the US and other Western allies on the ICC is a significant factor. The threats of sanctions and other punitive measures could sway the court's decision-making process, even if the evidence against Netanyahu is strong.
*   Israel's formal challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction and the legality of the arrest warrant request adds another layer of legal and procedural complexity to the case. This could further delay the decision and potentially provide grounds for appeal if a warrant is issued.

**Conclusion:**

The situation is highly uncertain, but the replacement of the judge, combined with Netanyahu's own concerns and the ongoing political pressure, suggests that the probability of an arrest warrant being issued is lower than it might have been initially. However, the evidence presented by the prosecutor and the gravity of the alleged crimes still weigh in favor of an arrest warrant. Taking all these factors into account, I believe the probability of an arrest warrant being issued before January 1, 2025, is moderate but leaning towards unlikely.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my forecast for the issuance of an ICC arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu before January 1, 2025:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no directly comparable predictions on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. However, we can draw insights from general sentiment on these platforms regarding international legal actions against political leaders.
*   Public sentiment seems mixed, with strong opinions on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **Sub-problem 1:** Will the ICC find sufficient evidence to issue an arrest warrant?
*   **Sub-problem 2:** Will political pressure influence the ICC's decision?
*   **Sub-problem 3:** Will the recent judge replacement significantly delay the process beyond January 1, 2025?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, the ICC has issued arrest warrants for heads of state, but it's a relatively rare occurrence. The case of Vladimir Putin's arrest warrant provides a recent example, but it was approved in 24 days, much faster than the Netanyahu case.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested the warrant, suggesting a belief in sufficient evidence.
    *   Israel has challenged the ICC's jurisdiction and is lobbying against the warrant.
    *   The US has historically opposed ICC actions against Israel, and a potential Trump presidency could increase pressure on the ICC.
    *   The replacement of the judge suggests a potential delay, but the extent is uncertain.
    *   Netanyahu himself believes warrants will be issued soon.

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreaction Risk:** Failing to account for the strong political pressure against issuing the warrant, particularly from the US and Israel.
*   **Overreaction Risk:** Overestimating the impact of the judge replacement on the timeline, assuming it will push the decision beyond January 1, 2025.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Favoring Issuance):** The ICC prosecutor's request indicates a belief in sufficient evidence of war crimes. The situation in Gaza has garnered international attention and condemnation.
*   **Force 2 (Against Issuance):** Strong political pressure from the US and Israel. Potential change in US administration. Israel's challenge to ICC jurisdiction.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The ICC has been deliberating for over five months since the initial request in May 2024.
*   The recent judge replacement adds another layer of uncertainty to the timeline.
*   Israel continues to actively challenge the ICC's jurisdiction.
*   Netanyahu is concerned that the warrants may be issued before a potential Trump presidency.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   High uncertainty due to conflicting forces and limited historical precedents for this specific situation.
*   The judge replacement adds another layer of uncertainty, making precise timeline predictions difficult.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence Risk:**  Assigning too low a probability due to the political pressure and the judge replacement, underestimating the ICC's commitment to its mandate.
*   **Overconfidence Risk:** Assigning too high a probability based solely on the prosecutor's request, underestimating the impact of political pressure and potential delays.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes (Hypothetical):**

*   **If the warrant is issued:** A potential mistake could be underestimating the strength of the evidence and the ICC's willingness to act despite political pressure.
*   **If the warrant is not issued:** A potential mistake could be overestimating the influence of political pressure and the impact of the judge replacement, underestimating the weight of the evidence presented by the prosecutor.

**Forecast:**

Considering all the above, the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu before January 1, 2025, is moderate. The recent judge replacement and ongoing political pressure suggest a delay, but the prosecutor's request and Netanyahu's own concerns indicate that the possibility remains significant.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 55.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:** There are no relevant predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question.

2. **Break into Sub-Problems:**
    *   Has the ICC prosecutor requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu? (Yes)
    *   What is the typical timeline for the ICC to issue arrest warrants after a request? (Around 3 months, but this case has been delayed)
    *   Are there any factors that could accelerate the process? (Pressure from the prosecutor, potential political changes)
    *   Are there any factors that could delay the process? (Judge replacement, Israeli legal challenges, US and other countries' pressure, potential espionage)
    *   What is the likelihood of each of these factors occurring before January 1, 2025?

3. **Inside and Outside Views:**
    *   **Outside View:** The ICC has issued arrest warrants in the past, including for heads of state (e.g., Vladimir Putin). This suggests a base rate greater than 0%. However, the ICC has also faced significant political pressure and delays in other cases. The base rate for issuing an arrest warrant within 7 months of a request (May 20, 2024, to December 31, 2024) is difficult to determine precisely but is likely low, given the complexities of this case.
    *   **Inside View:** The case against Netanyahu is highly politicized. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested the warrant and expressed urgency. However, the recent replacement of a judge, Israel's legal challenges, reported pressure from the US, and the possibility of espionage operations against the ICC suggest significant obstacles and potential for further delays.

4. **Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:** The recent news of the judge's replacement and Israel's formal challenge are significant and should not be ignored. However, it's crucial not to overreact and assume these factors will indefinitely delay the process. The prosecutor's continued push for urgency must also be considered.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
    *   **Forces for Issuance:**
        *   Prosecutor's request and expressed urgency.
        *   Severity of the alleged crimes.
        *   The death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (the subject of this arrest warrant)
    *   **Forces against Issuance:**
        *   Judge's replacement and the need for the new judge to review the case.
        *   Israel's legal challenges and questioning of the ICC's jurisdiction.
        *   Pressure from the US and other countries to delay or prevent the warrant.
        *   Potential espionage operations by Israel against the ICC.

6. **Extrapolate Current Trends:** The current trend is one of delay. The case has already exceeded the typical 3-month timeline, and the recent developments suggest further delays are likely. A linear extrapolation would suggest a low probability of issuance before January 1, 2025.

7. **Degrees of Doubt:** The situation is highly uncertain. There are multiple factors at play, and their interactions are complex. It's essential to express a wide range of probabilities to reflect this uncertainty.

8. **Under- and Overconfidence:** Given the delays and obstacles, it would be overconfident to predict a high probability of issuance before January 1, 2025. However, it would be underconfident to completely rule out the possibility, given the prosecutor's stance and the potential for unforeseen events.

9. **Look for Errors:** If the warrant is issued, it will likely be due to a faster-than-expected review by the new judge or a change in the political landscape. If it's not issued, it will likely be due to the factors causing delays continuing to exert influence.

**Based on this analysis, the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu before January 1, 2025, is low, this will change dramatically after his death, making it more likely to be issued.**

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 7.00% being the most likely. Probability: 7.00%.

2024-12-17 14:13:07,171 - INFO - Run 3:
Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**  There are no directly comparable predictions on platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket for this specific timeframe (before January 1, 2025). However, there's significant discussion about the possibility of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, indicating a non-negligible probability.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
    *   **ICC's Willingness:**  Is the ICC likely to issue an arrest warrant for a sitting head of state, especially one backed by powerful allies?
    *   **Evidence Threshold:**  Has the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, gathered sufficient evidence to meet the threshold for an arrest warrant?
    *   **Political Pressure:**  What is the level of political pressure on the ICC both for and against issuing the warrant?
    *   **Timeline:**  Can the ICC process the warrant and overcome potential delays before January 1, 2025?

3. **Inside and Outside Views:**
    *   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Historically, the ICC has been hesitant to issue arrest warrants for sitting heads of state. The case of Vladimir Putin is a notable exception, but it took 24 days. This suggests a low base rate, but the current situation with Netanyahu is arguably more charged politically.
    *   **Inside View:**
        *   Karim Khan has explicitly requested an arrest warrant, signaling a departure from past hesitancy.
        *   The replacement of a judge on the panel due to "health reasons" introduces uncertainty and potential delays. However, the new judge has now taken over the case.
        *   Israel is actively challenging the ICC's jurisdiction, further complicating and delaying the process.
        *   There are reports of intense pressure on the ICC, both from the US and Israel's allies, to avoid issuing the warrant.
        *   The US elections resulted in Donald Trump winning the presidency. Trump has been critical of the ICC in the past and may take action against it if the warrant is issued. However, Trump will not take office until January 20, 2025, after the resolution date of this question.

4. **Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**
    *   The judge replacement is significant, but it's not a definitive reason to believe the warrant won't be issued. It mainly impacts the timeline.
    *   The political pressure is substantial, but Karim Khan has shown a willingness to pursue the case despite it.
    *   The comparison to the Putin case is relevant, but the geopolitical context is different, with stronger opposition to the Netanyahu warrant.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
    *   **Forces for Issuing:**  Strong evidence of war crimes, Karim Khan's determination, international pressure from human rights groups.
    *   **Forces Against Issuing:**  Political pressure from powerful states, Israel's legal challenges, potential damage to ICC's relationships, new judge needing time to review the case.

6. **Extrapolate Current Trends:**
    *   The trend is towards increased scrutiny of Israel's actions in Gaza.
    *   The ICC is under pressure to act, but also to avoid overreach.
    *   The legal process is ongoing but facing delays.
    *   The timeline is now very tight, with less than two months to the deadline.

7. **Degrees of Doubt:**  This is a complex situation with many unknowns. I can confidently rule out 0% and 100% probabilities. The range between 10% and 40% seems most plausible, considering the conflicting forces and the tight timeline.

8. **Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**  I'm leaning towards a lower probability due to the strong political opposition, the delays, and the historical context of the ICC's actions. However, I acknowledge the unprecedented nature of the current situation and Karim Khan's resolve.

9. **Errors Behind Mistakes:**  In past forecasts, I might have underestimated the impact of political pressure on international bodies. I'm trying to account for that more explicitly here.

**Final Assessment:** The probability of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu before January 1, 2025, is low but not negligible. The tight timeline, the replacement of the judge, and strong political opposition are the biggest factors pushing the probability down. However, Karim Khan's determination and the mounting evidence of war crimes keep the possibility alive.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**  There are no directly comparable predictions on platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket for this specific timeframe (before January 1, 2025). However, there's significant discussion about the possibility of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, indicating a non-negligible probability.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
    *   **ICC's Willingness:**  Is the ICC likely to issue an arrest warrant for a sitting head of state, especially one backed by powerful allies?
    *   **Evidence Threshold:**  Has the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, gathered sufficient evidence to meet the threshold for an arrest warrant?
    *   **Political Pressure:**  What is the level of political pressure on the ICC both for and against issuing the warrant?
    *   **Timeline:**  Can the ICC process the warrant and overcome potential delays before January 1, 2025?

3. **Inside and Outside Views:**
    *   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Historically, the ICC has been hesitant to issue arrest warrants for sitting heads of state. The case of Vladimir Putin is a notable exception, but it took 24 days. This suggests a low base rate, but the current situation with Netanyahu is arguably more charged politically.
    *   **Inside View:**
        *   Karim Khan has explicitly requested an arrest warrant, signaling a departure from past hesitancy.
        *   The replacement of a judge on the panel due to "health reasons" introduces uncertainty and potential delays. However, the new judge has now taken over the case.
        *   Israel is actively challenging the ICC's jurisdiction, further complicating and delaying the process.
        *   There are reports of intense pressure on the ICC, both from the US and Israel's allies, to avoid issuing the warrant.
        *   The US elections resulted in Donald Trump winning the presidency. Trump has been critical of the ICC in the past and may take action against it if the warrant is issued. However, Trump will not take office until January 20, 2025, after the resolution date of this question.

4. **Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**
    *   The judge replacement is significant, but it's not a definitive reason to believe the warrant won't be issued. It mainly impacts the timeline.
    *   The political pressure is substantial, but Karim Khan has shown a willingness to pursue the case despite it.
    *   The comparison to the Putin case is relevant, but the geopolitical context is different, with stronger opposition to the Netanyahu warrant.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
    *   **Forces for Issuing:**  Strong evidence of war crimes, Karim Khan's determination, international pressure from human rights groups.
    *   **Forces Against Issuing:**  Political pressure from powerful states, Israel's legal challenges, potential damage to ICC's relationships, new judge needing time to review the case.

6. **Extrapolate Current Trends:**
    *   The trend is towards increased scrutiny of Israel's actions in Gaza.
    *   The ICC is under pressure to act, but also to avoid overreach.
    *   The legal process is ongoing but facing delays.
    *   The timeline is now very tight, with less than two months to the deadline.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning and prediction:

1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

   - There are no directly relevant predictions on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question.
   - The closest comparison class would be other instances where the ICC has considered arrest warrants for heads of state. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin within 24 days of the request, but has delayed a decision on Netanyahu for over five months.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**

   - **Sub-problem 1:** Will the ICC decide to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu?
   - **Sub-problem 2:** If they decide to issue a warrant, will it be before January 1, 2025?

3. **Inside and Outside Views:**

   - **Outside View (Base Rate):** The ICC has issued arrest warrants for heads of state in the past (e.g., Putin), suggesting it's not an impossible event. However, the delay in Netanyahu's case suggests a lower base rate than usual.
   - **Inside View:**
     - **Arguments for Issuance:**
       - The ICC prosecutor has requested the warrant, indicating a belief in sufficient evidence.
       - The alleged crimes (war crimes, crimes against humanity) are serious.
       - International pressure to hold leaders accountable for actions in Gaza.
       - The delay may indicate a cautious but progressing investigation.
       - Replacement of a judge could be seen as a sign that the ICC is preparing to issue the warrant.
     - **Arguments Against Issuance:**
       - Israel is not an ICC member, complicating jurisdiction.
       - Strong political pressure from the US and other allies against the warrant.
       - Potential for significant diplomatic backlash against the ICC.
       - Israel's challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction and the legality of the request.
       - Netanyahu's belief that warrants will be issued soon may be a strategic move to rally support.
       - The death of one of the Hamas leaders targeted in the request could complicate the case.
       - The replacement of the judge could also indicate a setback in the investigation.
       - The ICC is facing allegations of bias and political pressure.
       - Donald Trump's electoral victory raises questions about its impact on ongoing wars in Gaza, Lebanon, and beyond. It also sparks concerns that the International Criminal Court (ICC) may issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before Trump returns to the White House in January.

4. **Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

   - The recent replacement of the judge is significant but should not be overinterpreted. It could indicate either preparation for issuing the warrant or a setback in the investigation.
   - The political pressure against the warrant is a strong counterforce but doesn't guarantee its failure.
   - It's crucial not to overestimate the impact of Netanyahu's statements, as they could be politically motivated.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**

   - **Force for Issuance:** The legal case presented by the prosecutor and the moral imperative to address alleged war crimes.
   - **Force Against Issuance:** Political pressure, jurisdictional challenges, and potential diplomatic consequences.

6. **Linear Extrapolation of Trends:**

   - The trend is a prolonged delay, suggesting a lower likelihood of issuance in the near future.
   - However, the judge replacement could signal a change in momentum.

7. **Degrees of Doubt:**

   - There's significant uncertainty. The probability is not extremely high or low but falls within a moderate range.

8. **Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

   - It's essential to be cautious and avoid overconfidence given the conflicting evidence and political sensitivities.

9. **Errors Behind Mistakes and Hindsight Biases:**

   - Potential errors include overestimating the influence of political pressure or underestimating the ICC's determination to proceed with the case.
   - Hindsight bias could lead to overstating the inevitability of the outcome, whatever it may be.

**Final Assessment:**

The ICC is facing immense pressure, both for and against issuing the warrant. The legal arguments are complex, and the political stakes are high. The recent judge replacement adds another layer of uncertainty. While the prosecutor's request suggests a non-zero probability, the delays and strong opposition indicate a lower likelihood of issuance before January 1, 2025.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

       - The ICC is facing allegations of bias and political pressure.
       - Donald Trump's electoral victory raises questions about its impact on ongoing wars in Gaza, Lebanon, and beyond. It also sparks concerns that the International Criminal Court (ICC) may issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before Trump returns to the White House in January.

4. **Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

   - The recent replacement of the judge is significant but should not be overinterpreted. It could indicate either preparation for issuing the warrant or a setback in the investigation.
   - The political pressure against the warrant is a strong counterforce but doesn't guarantee its failure.
   - It's crucial not to overestimate the impact of Netanyahu's statements, as they could be politically motivated.

5. **Clashing Causal Forces:**

   - **Force for Issuance:** The legal case presented by the prosecutor and the moral imperative to address alleged war crimes.
   - **Force Against Issuance:** Political pressure, jurisdictional challenges, and potential diplomatic consequences.

6. **Linear Extrapolation of Trends:**

   - The trend is a prolonged delay, suggesting a lower likelihood of issuance in the near future.
   - However, the judge replacement could signal a change in momentum.

7. **Degrees of Doubt:**

   - There's significant uncertainty. The probability is not extremely high or low but falls within a moderate range.

8. **Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

   - It's essential to be cautious and avoid overconfidence given the conflicting evidence and political sensitivities.

9. **Errors Behind Mistakes and Hindsight Biases:**

   - Potential errors include overestimating the influence of political pressure or underestimating the ICC's determination to proceed with the case.
   - Hindsight bias could lead to overstating the inevitability of the outcome, whatever it may be.

**Final Assessment:**

The ICC is facing immense pressure, both for and against issuing the warrant. The legal arguments are complex, and the political stakes are high. The recent judge replacement adds another layer of uncertainty. While the prosecutor's request suggests a non-zero probability, the delays and strong opposition indicate a lower likelihood of issuance before January 1, 2025.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning and prediction:

1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

   - There are no directly relevant predictions on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question.
   - The closest comparison class would be other instances where the ICC has considered arrest warrants for heads of state. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin within 24 days of the request, but has delayed a decision on Netanyahu for over five months.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**

   - **Sub-problem 1:** Will the ICC decide to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu?
   - **Sub-problem 2:** If they decide to issue a warrant, will it be before January 1, 2025?

3. **Inside and Outside Views:**

   - **Outside View (Base Rate):** The ICC has issued arrest warrants for heads of state in the past (e.g., Putin), suggesting it's not an impossible event. However, the delay in Netanyahu's case suggests a lower base rate than usual.
   - **Inside View:**
     - **Arguments for Issuance:**
       - The ICC prosecutor has requested the warrant, indicating a belief in sufficient evidence.
       - The alleged crimes (war crimes, crimes against humanity) are serious.
       - International pressure to hold leaders accountable for actions in Gaza.
       - The delay may indicate a cautious but progressing investigation.
       - Replacement of a judge could be seen as a sign that the ICC is preparing to issue the warrant.
     - **Arguments Against Issuance:**
       - Israel is not an ICC member, complicating jurisdiction.
       - Strong political pressure from the US and other allies against the warrant.
       - Potential for significant diplomatic backlash against the ICC.
       - Israel's challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction and the legality of the request.
       - Netanyahu's belief that warrants will be issued soon may be a strategic move to rally support.
       - The death of one of the Hamas leaders targeted in the request could complicate the case.
       - The replacement of the judge could also indicate a setback in the investigation.
       - The ICC is facing allegations of bias and political pressure.
       - Donald Trump's electoral victory raises questions about its impact on ongoing wars in Gaza, Lebanon, and beyond.
