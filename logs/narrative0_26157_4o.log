*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a news desk, papers scattered before them, the backdrop displaying solar storm visuals.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: did the strongest geomagnetic storm between July 17 and July 28, 2024, have a K-index greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.45%. Despite AR3697's potential, it didn't quite reach the threshold.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. Given the sunspot's history, many expected more intense activity.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. The earlier M- and X-class flares set high expectations, but the data just didn't support a Kp above 5.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s a testament to the unpredictability of space weather, despite our models' accuracy.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. It’s a reminder that even with strong indicators, the cosmos has its own plans.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by screens showing solar activity data.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the question on everyone's mind: Did the strongest geomagnetic storm have a K-index greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.35%. Despite AR3697's history, the storm didn't reach that threshold.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given the sunspot's activity in May and June, many expected a higher probability.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but our models accounted for the sunspot's evolution and the latest data up to July 15. It’s a reminder of the complexities in space weather forecasting.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The science of prediction continues to evolve, even with something as unpredictable as the sun.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question—between July 17 and July 28, did the geomagnetic storm reach a K-index greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. The sunspot AR3697 was active, but not enough to hit that range.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given the intense solar activity in May and June, many expected a stronger storm.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but our models factor in more than just past activity. The probabilities were clear.

NATE  
So, yesterday's geomagnetic storm was quite the spectacle. 

PHILIP  
Indeed. But did it hit the mark? Between July 17 and July 28, our models were clear. 

NATE  
Yes, our models had it at 65.78%. The strongest storm had a Kp between 5 and 6. 

PHILIP  
AR3697 didn’t disappoint. Those solar flares were intense. 

NATE  
And the auroras—spectacular at such low latitudes.  

PHILIP  
It’s fascinating how predictable these cosmic events can be. 

NATE  
Absolutely. The sunspot activity was a major indicator. 

PHILIP

Well, Philip, the big question: Did AR3697 deliver another geomagnetic storm with a Kp greater than 5 and less than or equal to 6?

No, our models had it at 47.82%. Given the intense activity in May and June, it seemed plausible, but the probabilities just didn't tip over.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the sunspot's earlier behavior was wild, but sometimes the numbers hold steady.

Exactly. The forecasters were on high alert, but this time, Earth got a pass.
