**Kenya Confirms Second Case of Mpox**
Kenya has confirmed its second case of mpox, a disease previously known as monkeypox, after detecting it in a truck driver who traveled to the epicenter of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to the Ministry of Health, the patient presented symptoms of the disease and had a history of travel to the DRC. The patient has been isolated and is receiving treatment in the Busia county. The first case of mpox in the country was detected on July 31 in a border crossing with Uganda. Since the declaration of the first case, 28 contacts of the case have completed a 21-day follow-up period without developing symptoms and have been discharged from active surveillance, said the Ministry of Health. The Kenyan authorities stated that the healthcare facilities 'have the necessary personnel and are well-equipped to diagnose and control this disease.' They also expressed their 'deep gratitude' to all Kenyans 'for their unwavering cooperation and support in the fight against the outbreak in the country.' The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health alert on August 14 due to the rapid spread and high mortality of the new variant (clade 1b) in the African continent and a first case in Sweden of a traveler who was in an area of Africa where the virus is circulating intensely. The variant is different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions, and already led to the declaration of a global health emergency between 2022 and 2023. Twelve member states of the African Union have reported 18,910 cases of mpox and 541 deaths in 2024, although the majority of infections occur in the DRC, reported the African Union's health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Africa (CDC Africa).

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
The Department of Disease Control in Thailand confirmed the first case of the new variant of mpox, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14. The patient tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the department, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, but their progress will be monitored for 21 days. The confirmation of the clade 1b case in Thailand marks the first of its kind in Asia after the global emergency was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Department of Disease Control, called for strengthened infection control measures, including close contact with patients, and assured that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points, especially at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, for passengers from countries with reported cases. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox infections (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. As of 2024, 12 African countries have accumulated 18,910 mpox cases and 541 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The clade 1b variant is spreading more easily among people and tends to cause more severe symptoms, although the WHO has sent a message of reassurance, stating that the mpox outbreak 'is not the COVID.'

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Singapore Says It Has Detected 13 Cases of Mpox Clade 2 Infection in 2024**
Singapore has detected 13 cases of mpox Clade 2 infections in 2024, according to the health ministry. All mpox infections in the city-state have been the 'less severe' Clade 2 infections. Meanwhile, Thailand confirmed an mpox case reported this week was the Clade 1b strain of the virus, the second confirmed case of the variant outside of Africa. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. As a precaution, Singapore will screen the temperatures of travellers arriving at Changi and Seletar airports from places exposed to the risk of mpox outbreaks, starting from Friday.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

**Zambia : Zambia Steps Up Preparedness Amid Rising Mpox Outbreaks in Africa**
The Zambian government, led by Health Minister Elijah Muchima, is taking proactive measures to prepare for the growing Mpox outbreaks in Africa. Despite neighboring countries experiencing alarming increases in cases, Zambia has not confirmed any Mpox cases to date. The Ministry of Health has intensified surveillance, active case finding, and capacity building to enhance the ability to manage potential Mpox cases effectively. Dr. Muchima stated, 'Zambia will continue to monitor the situation closely and adapt its response strategies as necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the population.' The government has also initiated an inventory of essential supplies and commodities, intensified surveillance at points of entry, and established a comprehensive readiness assessment to identify potential gaps and implement necessary mitigation strategies.

**Europe Raises Alert Level for Mpox After Case Detected in Sweden**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level for mpox, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case of infection with the new strain of the virus in Sweden, the first outside of Africa. The director of the ECDC said that there will be more imported cases of the new strain of mpox in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The WHO declared on Wednesday that mpox is a global health emergency, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. Two strains are now spreading in the Congo: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new branch called clade Ib. The ECDC raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said ECDC director Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus mpox in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. WHO official Margaret Harris said in a press conference on Friday that she expects more cases outside of Africa soon, also due to increased surveillance. However, the WHO discouraged any travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**New Mpox Variant Emerges in Congo, Raises Concerns for Global Health**
The Mpox virus, which retreated to Africa after the 2022 pandemic, has not finished evolving and spreading. In 2023, over 15,000 confirmed or suspected cases of infection were reported by several African countries, an increase from previous years. In 2024, African countries have already reported more confirmed and suspected Mpox infections than in all of 2023: 17,500 as of the beginning of the year, concentrated mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Children are particularly vulnerable: about two-thirds of infections in Congo involve people under the age of 15. Some of these infections have been linked to a strain called clade II, which caused the 2022 epidemic; however, in recent months, an increasing percentage of reported infections has been attributed to a strain called clade I. Researchers who analyzed samples collected between the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024 in a mining region and very poor area of the Congo, where a particularly sustained recrudescence is underway, have found a new variant of clade I. This variant is likely already transmissible from person to person, having thus overcome the stage of zoonosis: the main trace of this transmission, namely an accentuated mutation of the viral genome due to the action of a particular human enzyme that attacks the virus, has been found at a very high frequency in the new virus, so that human-to-human transmission must already be sustained, in line with the rapid growth of the number of cases. Now, the lethality measured so far on the cases confirmed of Mpox virus of clade I is much higher than that of clade II, the virus of 2022. In the case of the new virus Ib, the lethality measured on the confirmed cases is 3.4%, but it must be considered that the sample of subjects examined in the published works is limited, and above all that lethality does not depend only on the intrinsic capabilities of the virus, but also on the general health and healthcare conditions of the patients, which are particularly precarious in the region of the Congo most affected. Moreover, the mechanical reason for the higher lethality of viruses of clade I compared to those of clade II is not known, so it is necessary to wait for better data and studies in this regard. 'The new virus has already spread quickly, with the first case outside the continent identified in Sweden; given that it is a virus capable of causing severe pathology and potentially high lethality, the WHO has sounded the alarm, in order to activate all the bureaucratic procedures to contain the emergence of a possible pandemic, just like in 2022. This has already allowed millions of dollars to be allocated to the new emergency, both for monitoring and for preparing vaccine stocks. Although it has not yet been determined whether the available vaccines are effective against the new variant, it is expected that they will work, and since 2022 companies such as Moderna have been preparing new RNA vaccines, which can be adapted more quickly to any new variant. What is needed now are data: on the mechanism and efficiency of virus propagation, on the effectiveness of old and new vaccines, on the clinic and diagnostics. Above all, a new mentality is needed: other viruses will arrive, and this is just one of the new packages of genetic information parasite that evolution has in store for us. Today we can identify them in time, read their genome, copy the product of their evolution and thus obtain vaccines (and soon drugs) based on RNA, able to pursue evolution at its own speed.'

**Sweden Confirms First Case Of Deadly Clade I Variant Of Mpox Strain Circulating In Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the contagious mpox strain, originating from central and eastern Africa. This marks the first known infection of this strain outside the African continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and authorities are closely monitoring the situation to prevent further transmission and ensure public health safety. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.' The WHO has reported a concerning rise in Mpox cases in Africa this year, with over 14,000 cases and 524 fatalities. The international vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on sending vaccines to affected countries in Africa, but there may be a delay due to WHO approval. Health experts warn that clade 1 and its variant, clade 1b, can lead to more severe symptoms than clade 2.

**Mpox outbreak in Africa: Immediate risk to Singapore is low, says Health Ministry**
Singapore's Health Ministry has stated that the immediate public health risk from the mpox outbreak in Africa is low. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), all mpox infections detected in Singapore have been the milder Clade II infections, mostly during the 2022-2023 global outbreak. As of July 27, there were 10 mpox cases in Singapore, and 32 cases in 2023. The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years. MOH has informed medical practitioners and healthcare institutions to be vigilant in detecting and reporting all mpox cases, including those suspected of Clade I infections. Travellers are required to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card for early detection. Suspected Clade I cases will be isolated in hospitals, and close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined and monitored for up to 21 days.
