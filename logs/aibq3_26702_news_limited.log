**Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization Increases 37% in First Half of 2024**
The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies increased by 37.3% in the first half of 2024, reaching approximately $2.27 trillion, according to Binance's semi-annual report. The report highlights that the growth was mainly driven by a strong first quarter, following a strong performance in 2023. The report also notes that the approval of ETFs in the US generated over $14.7 billion in net inflows. Ethereum and Bitcoin outperformed traditional financial investments, with returns of 48% and 43%, respectively, in the first half of the year. Decentralized finance (DeFi) experienced a notable increase of 72.8% in total value locked (TVL), reaching $94.1 billion. 'The influx of capital in the DeFi ecosystem has benefited most sectors, facilitating the emergence of new protocols that are making financial services previously inaccessible now available on the blockchain,' said Binance. The report also highlights the growth of stablecoins, Web3 gaming, and the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency technology.

**Cryptocurrency Prices Today: June 30, 2024**

The total market capitalization is $2.271.970.920.168 billion, with a 0.53% change in the last 24 hours. The volume traded in the last 24 hours is $31.382.638.905. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions between individuals. Despite their volatility, they have grown in popularity in recent years. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was born in 2009 and has a finite supply that is mathematically and statistically predetermined. The amount of emission is reduced by half every four years, allowing for the prediction of the total emission until it reaches 21 million units in the year 2140. Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and stablecoins, which aim to be pegged to another asset, such as a fiat currency or a commodity. One of the most famous is USDT, from the Tether protocol and USDC, from Coinbase. Both have a 'peg' with the US dollar. The purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies can be made on specialized platforms. The most popular in the world, according to volume of operation, is Binance. To start operating, users must create an account through the website or application. However, investing in this type of digital asset carries a high risk due to the market's fluctuation and volatility.

**BREAKING NEWS: Cryptocurrency Market is falling, here's why**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn in early July 2024, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the decline. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $2 trillion for the first time since late February, reaching $1.96 trillion by July 5. The total crypto market cap excluding BTC also saw a significant drop, from $1.03 trillion on July 1 to $880 billion by press time. The market has started to trend upwards, but the decline is not necessarily over. The future trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on investor perceptions of threats from Mt. Gox's repayments and the German government's Bitcoin sell-offs. Peter Schiff, a noted critic, believes that substantial selling pressure will not come from Bitcoin ETF investors unless BTC drops below $38,000.

**Why the Cryptocurrency Market is Down Today, July 4, 2024**
The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant decline, with the total market capitalization (TOTALCAP) and Bitcoin (BTC) falling sharply. The launch of the Ethereum ETF has been delayed, and Russia may allow the use of stablecoins for cross-border settlements. The lack of clear regulations has led to a lack of confidence among investors, resulting in significant withdrawals, with over $126 billion leaving the market in a day. The TOTALCAP is now at $2.10 trillion, approaching the support level of $2 trillion. However, if the price can recover the support level of $2.11 trillion, losses may be reversed, allowing the market to recover. The Bitcoin price has fallen below $60,000, and is following the path of the double top formation, which sets the target for the downward trend at $50,982. According to Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, 'The market is still in a high phase, but it's the least optimistic since March 2023. Optimistic momentum is necessary for prices to recover... Liquidity of stablecoins is slowing down. Faster growth of stablecoin liquidity is necessary for prices to recover.' The likely outcome is a drop to $60,000 and recovery from there, as the cryptocurrency market is not extremely pessimistic at the moment.

**Cryptocurrency Prices Today: Bitcoin and Other Digital Currencies Experience a Decline**
The cryptocurrency market experienced a widespread decline on Sunday, June 30, 2024, with many digital currencies experiencing a significant drop in value. The market has been experiencing volatility since a while, with unstable indices and inconsistent trading patterns. According to research firm Kaiko, the trading volume of Bitcoin decreased by 16% last weekend, reaching its lowest level ever, to 16% of total trading volume this year. This decline is attributed to the launch of tradable Bitcoin funds on the stock exchange, which has adjusted trading periods to match those of traditional stock exchanges, resulting in reduced price fluctuations. The current price of Bitcoin is $60,881. The market capitalization of the most popular cryptocurrency in the world has reached $1.22 trillion. The trading volume of Bitcoin has decreased to $11.72 billion over the past 24 hours. Over the past 7 days, Bitcoin has lost around 5.65% of its value. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Ripple have also experienced declines in value.
