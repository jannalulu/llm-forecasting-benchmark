To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Timeline: The deadline is October 1, 2024, which is about 11 months from now (given today's date of October 18, 2024).

2. LLM capabilities: The most recent news (July 2024) indicates that Google's DeepMind AI models achieved a silver medal performance on the 2024 IMO, scoring 28 out of 42 points. This is just one point short of a gold medal.

3. Progress rate: From this information, we can see that AI models are very close to achieving gold medal performance. However, the last point is often the hardest to achieve.

4. Public availability: The question specifies that the LLM must be publicly available. Currently, many of the most advanced AI models are not fully public.

5. Time constraints: The model must solve all problems within 9 hours, which the current models did not achieve.

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. The current performance is very close to gold medal level.
2. The rate of progress in AI has been rapid in recent years.
3. There's significant competition and investment in this area.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. The public availability requirement may slow down progress.
2. The time constraint of 9 hours is not currently met.
3. The last improvements to reach gold medal level may be more challenging than previous progress.

Balancing these factors:

The current performance is very close to the required level, which is a strong positive indicator. However, the public availability and time constraints add significant challenges. The 11-month timeframe provides some opportunity for progress, but may not be enough to overcome all hurdles.

Given the rapid progress in AI, it seems likely that the performance level will be achieved. However, the public availability requirement and time constraint may prove to be significant obstacles within the given timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Timeline: The question asks about achievement before October 1, 2024. Today is October 18, 2024, which means the deadline has already passed.

2. LLM Performance: The most relevant information comes from the July 30, 2024 article about Google's AI models:
   - AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 solved 4 out of 6 IMO problems.
   - They scored 28 out of 42 points, equivalent to a silver medal.
   - They were one point short of a gold medal.
   - However, they exceeded the time limit, taking three days for one problem.

3. Gold Medal Criteria: The articles mention that gold medals are typically awarded to around the top 50 competitors.

4. LLM Availability: The question specifies "publicly-available" LLMs. The Google models mentioned are not explicitly stated to be publicly available.

5. Time Constraints: The IMO has a strict 9-hour time limit, which the Google models failed to meet.

Analysis:
- The strongest evidence against achievement is that as of July 30, 2024, even Google's advanced models couldn't achieve a gold medal within the time constraints.
- The timeline has already passed, and there are no reports of a publicly-available LLM achieving gold by October 1, 2024.
- The close performance (one point short of gold) suggests that LLMs are very close to achieving this milestone.
- However, the time limit remains a significant hurdle, as the models took much longer than allowed.

Balancing the evidence:
- The lack of any reported success by October 1, 2024, is the most crucial factor.
- The rapid progress demonstrated by Google's models suggests that achievement was possible, but the strict time limit was a major obstacle.
- There's no information about improvements or public availability of these or similar models between July and October 2024.

Given that the deadline has passed and there are no reports of success, the probability must be very low. However, considering the possibility of unreported achievements or last-minute breakthroughs, it can't be exactly zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Current state of LLM capabilities:
The most advanced publicly available LLMs as of July 2024 (based on the news articles) have not yet achieved gold medal performance at the IMO. Google's DeepMind models (AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2) achieved a silver medal equivalent score of 28/42, just one point short of gold. This suggests LLMs are very close to gold medal performance, but haven't quite reached it yet.

2. Rate of progress:
LLM capabilities have been advancing rapidly. In 2023, AlphaGeometry solved 53% of IMO geometry problems from the past 25 years. By 2024, AlphaGeometry 2 solved 83% - a significant improvement in just one year. This rapid progress suggests further improvements are likely.

3. Time remaining:
There are only about 2.5 months left until the October 1, 2024 deadline. This is a relatively short timeframe for significant breakthroughs, but not impossible given the pace of AI progress.

4. Challenges remaining:
The LLMs struggled most with combinatorial problems, failing to solve either of the two in the 2024 IMO. Overcoming this weakness may require fundamental advances in LLM reasoning capabilities.

5. Increased focus:
The near-miss of gold medal performance is likely to spur increased efforts by AI labs to achieve this milestone, potentially accelerating progress.

6. Public availability requirement:
The question specifies the LLM must be publicly available. This adds an extra hurdle, as cutting-edge models often take time to be made public after initial development.

Weighing these factors:

The "outside view" based on historical progress would suggest that achieving gold medal performance within 2.5 months is possible but not certain. The rapid year-over-year improvement from 2023 to 2024 is encouraging, but the remaining challenges in combinatorial reasoning may take longer to overcome.

The "inside view" considering the specific details of the 2024 performance suggests we're very close to the threshold. Being just one point away from gold implies that even small improvements could push an LLM over the line.

However, the public availability requirement adds significant uncertainty. Even if a lab achieves gold medal performance internally, they may not make the model public immediately.

Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a reasonable chance of success, but it's far from certain. The short timeframe and public availability requirement are the main limiting factors.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

3. Gold Medal Criteria: The articles mention that gold medals are typically awarded to around the top 50 competitors. In 2024, there were 54 gold medal winners out of 609 participants.

4. Time Constraints: The IMO rules require solutions to be completed within a total of 9 hours. The DeepMind models significantly exceeded this limit.

5. Public Availability: The question specifies that the LLM must be publicly available. The articles don't mention whether these models were made public.

Analysis:
- The strongest evidence against the proposition is that the deadline has already passed, and no reports indicate that a publicly-available LLM achieved gold medal performance within the required time constraints.
- The closest achievement was by Google's DeepMind models, which reached silver medal performance but exceeded time limits and were not mentioned as being publicly available.
- The gap between silver and gold performance seems small (one point), but the time constraint is a significant barrier.
- There's no mention of other companies or organizations coming close to this level of performance with publicly-available models.

Considering these factors:
- The base rate for this event is effectively zero, as it has never happened before.
- The recent performance of DeepMind's models shows significant progress but still falls short of the required criteria.
- The deadline has passed without any reports of success.

Given that the deadline has passed and no success was reported, the probability should be very close to 0%. However, allowing for a small margin of error in reporting or the possibility of a very recent unreported achievement, I'll set a slightly higher lower bound.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Current state of LLM capabilities:
The most advanced publicly available LLMs as of October 2024 (like GPT-4) have shown impressive mathematical reasoning abilities, but have not yet reached IMO gold medal level. The news about Google's AI models achieving a silver medal in IMO 2024 is highly relevant, showing significant progress but still falling short of gold.

2. Rate of progress:
AI capabilities in mathematics have been advancing rapidly. The jump from not being competitive in IMO to achieving silver in one year is notable. However, the gap between silver and gold may be substantial.

3. Time constraint:
The deadline is very near (October 1, 2024). This leaves little time for further major advances and public release of new models.

4. Complexity of IMO problems:
IMO gold medal questions are extremely challenging, often requiring creative insights that current AI systems struggle with. The fact that Google's AI failed on combinatorial problems suggests key limitations remain.

5. Public availability requirement:
Even if a private AI system achieves IMO gold level, it may not be made publicly available immediately due to various considerations (e.g., safety, commercial strategy).

6. Past performance in similar competitions:
While there have been impressive AI achievements in other mathematical domains, IMO gold represents a particularly high bar that hasn't been reached yet.

7. Expert opinions:
The reaction of mathematicians to Google's achievement suggests that reaching IMO gold level is still seen as a significant challenge for AI.

Balancing these factors:

- The rapid progress and silver medal achievement provide some evidence that gold could be within reach.
- However, the very short timeframe, the jump in difficulty from silver to gold, and the public availability requirement are significant constraints.
- The failure on certain problem types suggests fundamental limitations that may take time to overcome.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The most likely scenario is that publicly-available LLMs will not achieve IMO gold by October 1, 2024, but there's a small chance of a breakthrough.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 8.00%, with 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Current state of LLM capabilities:
The most advanced publicly available LLMs as of October 2024 (like GPT-4) have shown impressive mathematical reasoning abilities, but have not yet reached IMO gold medal level. The news about Google's AI models achieving a silver medal in IMO 2024 is highly relevant, showing significant progress but still falling short of gold.

2. Rate of progress:
AI capabilities in mathematics have been advancing rapidly. The jump from not being competitive in IMO to achieving silver in one year is notable. However, the gap between silver and gold may be substantial.

3. Time constraint:
The deadline is very near (October 1, 2024). This leaves little time for further major advances and public release of new models.

4. Complexity of IMO problems:
IMO gold medal questions are extremely challenging, often requiring creative insights that current AI systems struggle with. The fact that Google's AI failed on combinatorial problems suggests key limitations remain.

5. Public availability requirement:
Even if a private AI system achieves IMO gold level, it may not be made publicly available immediately due to various considerations (e.g., safety, commercial strategy).

6. Past performance in similar competitions:
While there have been impressive AI achievements in other mathematical domains, IMO gold represents a particularly high bar that hasn't been reached yet.

7. Expert opinions:
The reaction of mathematicians to Google's achievement suggests that reaching IMO gold level is still seen as a significant challenge for AI.

Balancing these factors:

- The rapid progress and silver medal achievement provide some evidence that gold could be within reach.
- However, the very short timeframe, the jump in difficulty from silver to gold, and the public availability requirement are significant constraints.
- The failure on certain problem types suggests fundamental limitations that may take time to overcome.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The most likely scenario is that publicly-available LLMs will not achieve IMO gold by October 1, 2024, but there's a small chance of a breakthrough.
