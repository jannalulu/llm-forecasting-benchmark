**Experts warn AI bubble may soon burst**
The AI bubble may be bursting, according to experts, after a substantial one-day crash on the stock exchange on August 5, with AI-related businesses heavily impacted. The 'Magnificent Seven' - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - saw a combined loss of over $650 billion in market cap. Experts, such as Richard de Chazal of William Blair, believe that the AI hype bubble is popping, while others see it as a natural correction. Brook Dane of Goldman Sachs described the situation as 'a little bit of a leap of faith' and stated that AI businesses need to show more in the future, particularly in applications that use the technology in a more profound way than coding and customer service chatbots. 'You get these waves of both investment digestion and hype-reality,' Dane said. 'And the two of them play out across a multi-year horizon.'

**The End of the Golden Stock Market Era?**
The US presidential election is causing uncertainty in the financial markets, with the Vix index, a measure of market volatility, reaching its highest level since the US regional bank crisis in the spring of 2023. The uncertainty is fueled by the withdrawal of Joe Biden and his endorsement of Kamala Harris, leaving the outcome of the election open. Additionally, investors are concerned about the potential bursting of the 'Magnificent Seven' bubble, a group of tech companies that have driven market gains in the first half of the year. The Deutsche Bank analysts believe that the current market situation is reminiscent of historical patterns, with the S&P 500 often experiencing a sharp decline after a prolonged period of growth. They also point out that September has historically been a month of high market losses in recent years.

**Georges Ugeux: The AI Bubble Has Burst**
Georges Ugeux, former vice-president of Wall Street, believes that the AI bubble has burst. The global stock markets plummeted on Monday, only to rebound. Was the market a victim of investor manipulation? This is partly what explains the unexpected shock, according to Georges Ugeux, CEO of Galileo Global Advisors and former vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2003. The markets stabilized on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, after two sessions of panic that saw indices plummet. The cause of the shock was a report published on Friday on US employment. It revived fears of a US recession, as unemployment growth was higher than expected. However, after the interest rate hikes implemented by the US Federal Reserve to combat inflation, a slowdown in the economy was expected. So, why the panic? And is it not the AI bubble that has just burst? Below, an interview with the CEO of Galileo Global Advisors, Georges Ugeux, to make sense of the situation. According to Ugeux, the correction is due to the overvaluation of the technology sector, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), which have driven the market's rise over the past two years. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady in September was also a factor, as investors were trying to pressure the central bank to lower rates to boost economic growth. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve understood the game and explained that there was no recession and no reason to adjust its policy. Ugeux believes that the 'rumor-mongers' in the financial communication world, including some media outlets, contributed to the panic. He also thinks that the AI bubble has burst, and that investors are starting to be more cautious. Ugeux was vice-president international at the New York Stock Exchange when the internet bubble burst, and he believes that the current situation is similar, but with different factors at play. He thinks that the AI bubble has crested, and that it's time to focus on the real value of AI, rather than its hype.

**US stock plunge: Could the AI bubble burst?**
The US stock market has seen a significant plunge, with the 'Magnificent Seven' – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – experiencing a decline in value due to fears of a potential recession and concerns over the heavy financing of AI technology. Recent earnings reports from companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet have sparked worries among investors that the massive funding put into data centres and AI is not paying off. Additionally, reports suggest that Nvidia may face months of delays for its new AI processors due to design flaws and production issues, which could impact its major customers. Activist investor group Elliot Management has described AI as 'overrated' and claimed Nvidia is 'in bubble land.' The future of OpenAI, a key player in the generative AI hype, is also a concern, as it is reportedly burning through billions of dollars to stay afloat.

**Magnificent seven tumble amid 'epic' rotation**
Analysts are divided over whether the recent market turbulence is a temporary blip or a sign of a return to value investing. Creative Planning strategist Charlie Bilello describes the recent rotation as 'one of the most epic rotations in market history', where cheaper stocks soared while the 'magnificent seven' and growth stocks plummeted. Bilello notes that growth stocks' outperformance over value had widened to levels unseen since the dotcom bubble in March 2000, setting the stage for value stocks to outperform their growth counterparts by near-record levels. Most agree that July's rotation was long overdue, but value investors think this is just the start, while growth-minded enthusiasts see it as a mere intermission before the Big Tech show resumes. 'This is just the start,' said value investors, in contrast to growth-minded enthusiasts who see July's performance as a 'mere intermission' before the Big Tech show resumes.

**Experts Warn of Bursting 'AI Bubble' as US Tech Market Experiences Downturn**
Experts warn of a bursting 'AI bubble' as the US tech market experiences a downturn. The Nasdaq has seen its worst losses in two years, with the 'Magnificent 7' - Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla - being the main drivers of the decline. The 'Glorreichen Sieben' have lost over $1 trillion in value since mid-July, with the S&P 500 index experiencing its worst losses since 2022. The decline is attributed to weak US economic data, rising recession fears, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Jochen Stanzl, chief analyst at CMC Markets, says, 'The expectations for the 'Glorreichen Sieben' are simply too high.' Arne Rautenberg, fund manager at Union Asset Management, adds, 'The price movements were sometimes extreme and may have gone too far down - especially since there were often no fundamental reasons on the company side.' Investors are shifting their portfolios to focus on smaller companies and 'standard' values, as they worry that the high investments in AI may not pay off in the short term. 'The necessary and extremely high investments in data centers will not quickly pay off,' says Mirko Maier, technology analyst at Landesbank Baden-Württemberg. 'There are simply not enough AI applications that generate revenue.' Goldman Sachs and Sequoia have also warned of a bubble, with Elliot stating that AI is overvalued and many applications are not yet mature.

**Silicon Valley Gears Up for Crucial Earnings Week**
The tech industry is gearing up for a crucial earnings week, with Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple set to report their quarterly earnings. The market has been rotating out of Big Tech, with investors seeking returns in other sectors. The so-called Magnificent Seven, which includes the aforementioned four tech firms, plus Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla, have been driving the market's growth, but their share prices have been falling. The AI bubble has been compared to the 1990s tech bubble, and investors are waiting to see if the heavy investment in AI will pay off. The rotation to other sectors is likely to continue, with Goldman Sachs projecting a narrowing gap between Big Tech's earnings-per-share growth and the S&P 500's median annual EPS growth. The week will also see a jobs report and a Fed meeting, which may bring about an interest rate cut.

**MARKT USA/Wall Street expected to recover with interest rate debate**
The US stock market, particularly Wall Street, is expected to recover from its recent decline due to the upcoming debate on interest rates. The shift from technology stocks to other sectors could reverse by the end of the week, as futures on the technology-heavy Nasdaq suggest a strong opening on the cash market. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which will be released before the market opens, will be closely watched. According to Derren Nathan, Head of Equity Analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, 'hopes for a rate cut in September remain high, and today's PCE inflation data will be closely watched.' Technology stocks are considered highly sensitive to interest rates and may react to changes in speculation. The 'Magnificent 7', the seven most capitalized technology titles, are all trading higher before the market opens. However, Nathan notes that the recent decline in these seven stocks is not comparable to the dot-com bubble, as these are financially strong companies that dominate their category.

**Stocks Slide Before High-Stakes Megacap Earnings: Markets Wrap**
Stocks fell at the end of the week, with technology leading the losses, ahead of a critical week of earnings from megacap tech companies. The S&P 500 dropped 1% and the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.1%. The 'Magnificent Seven' megacaps, including Tesla and Alphabet, are expected to report earnings next week. Analysts are looking for strong earnings and softening inflation to reverse the market's recent weakness and spark a new leg higher. However, there is a risk of a setback for the equities this summer due to weaker growth data, dovish central bank expectations, and rising policy uncertainty. Investors are flocking to US equities, expecting a September rate cut and a Trump presidency, but some strategists warn of a 'buy rumor, sell fact' opportunity after the rate cut.

**Will the KI-Hype Burst Like the Dotcom Bubble?**
The hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a surge in investments, with many companies investing billions of dollars in the field. However, experts at Goldman Sachs warn of a potential bubble, citing similarities to the dot-com bubble at the beginning of the century. The 'magnificent seven' tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, saw a record loss of $623 billion in a single day, while the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, rose by over 4%. Experts believe that the recent decline in the 'Glorreichen Sieben' is due to investors shifting their focus to smaller companies that are more likely to benefit from the AI trend. The development of AI is considered more solid than the dot-com bubble, with companies actually generating profits. The future of the AI hype is uncertain, and it is unclear whether large or smaller tech companies will benefit the most.

**Tech Giants 'Magnificent 7' Lose $623 Billion as Inflation Cools Down**
The US inflation rate has cooled down stronger than expected, making a first interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in September more realistic. This has led to a significant decline in the stock prices of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' - Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. The 'Magnificent Seven' have lost $623 billion in a single day, with Nvidia alone losing $180 billion. The decline is attributed to the hype around new AI technologies and stable business prospects, making the stocks attractive to investors. However, with interest rates expected to fall, smaller companies will also become more attractive, and investors can expect a normalization of the market. The current correction is seen as a precursor to a time when inflation will continue to decline and the Fed will send clearer signals.
