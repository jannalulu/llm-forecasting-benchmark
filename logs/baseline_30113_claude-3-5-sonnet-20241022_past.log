Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The time window is very short - only about 1.5 months remaining in 2024 from today.

2. Historical context: The ICC typically issues warrants after lengthy investigations, not on a regular schedule. Warrants are relatively rare events.

3. Current context:
- There are several ongoing investigations (Ukraine, Georgia, Palestine/Israel, etc.)
- The Ukraine situation might be most likely to produce new warrants
- However, the ICC moves deliberately and slowly in most cases

4. Timing factors:
- Very short window (46 days)
- Includes holiday season when activity often slows
- Would need to be both issued and publicly disclosed in this period

5. Key constraints:
- Must be a formal arrest warrant (not summons)
- Must be publicly disclosed before Jan 1, 2025
- Must be officially confirmed by credible sources

Given the short timeframe, holiday season, and the ICC's typically deliberate pace, combined with the specific requirement for public disclosure, I assess this as a low probability event, but not impossible given ongoing investigations.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.40%, with 8.30% being the most likely. Probability: 8.30%.
