Let me systematically analyze the problem:

Key Evidence Points:
1. 2024 Hurricane Season Predictions:
- Colorado State University: 23 total storms, 12 hurricanes
- NOAA: 17-25 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes
- 85% chance of above-normal activity
- Record-breaking ocean heat content

2. Current Status (August 8):
- Already 4 named storms formed
- Sea surface temperatures 1.4°C above average
- La Niña expected late summer/early fall
- Peak hurricane season (August-October) still upcoming

3. Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Context:
- Already broke records through July
- 2024 ACE already exceeded 30 (fastest in recorded history)
- 75% of cyclonic activity occurs between August 20-October 10

Calculation Approach:
- Historical ACE averages typically range 50-80
- Current conditions suggest higher-than-normal energy
- Peak months still ahead
- Early season performance indicates potential for high ACE

Probability Assessment:
- Strong evidence suggesting ACE will exceed 60
- Atmospheric/oceanic conditions extremely favorable
- Multiple expert predictions align on high activity

My Prediction: Between 82.50% and 94.70%, but 89.30% being the most likely. Probability: 89.30%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Considerations:
1. Resolution Criteria: Specifically asks about Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) > 60 by October 7, 2024

Evidence Supporting Higher ACE:

- NOAA predicts 17-25 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes
- Colorado State University updated forecast to 25 named storms, 12 hurricanes
- Sea surface temperatures are 1.4°C above average
- La Niña expected to develop in late summer/early fall
- 75% of cyclonic activity occurs between August 20 and October 10
- Early season Hurricane Beryl broke intensity records

Quantitative Context:
- Historically, ACE varies significantly year to year
- By July 9, 2024, ACE already exceeded 14% of typical full-season energy
- Some forecasts suggest 167% of average accumulated cyclone energy

Analytical Breakdown:
- Base rate of ACE > 60 likely moderate
