**Intel announces first round of layoffs. Here's how many Bay Area employees were affected**
Intel has announced the first round of layoffs, affecting 54 workers in the Bay Area, as part of its plan to reduce its global workforce by 15%. The semiconductor giant plans to eliminate 15,000 positions globally before the year's end and suspend dividend payments from the fourth quarter until cash flows improve. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company's history.' The layoffs are part of a broader trend, with major tech companies such as Meta, Cisco, Tesla, Google, Broadcom, PayPal, Apple, and Salesforce also announcing significant job cuts since the COVID-19 pandemic. Intel employs 110,000 people worldwide and has previously reduced its workforce by 5% following job cuts announced in October 2022. Gelsinger described the recent decisions as the hardest of his career, saying, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core.'

As of August 20, 2024, tech companies have laid off over 124,000 employees, bringing the total number of layoffs since 2022 to 428,449. Major tech companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Dell, Intel, IBM, Cisco, SAP, Salesforce, Cohere, Stability AI, TikTok, YouTube, Snap, Match Group, Bumble, PayPal, Swiggy, Unacademy, Byju's, Ola, Koo, Paytm, Twitch, and Discord have all announced layoffs, with some companies cutting up to 50% of their workforce. The layoffs are attributed to a combination of factors, including cost-cutting to invest in AI, a global downturn, over-hiring during the pandemic, and falling behind due to not investing in AI at the right time. 'We need to simplify execution and drive velocity,' said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, while Tesla's Elon Musk announced that the company would be cutting'more than 10%' of its global workforce to cut costs. 'We grew too quickly and wanted to sharpen our focus,' said Discord CEO Jason Citron. The layoffs have had a significant impact on employees, with some companies offering voluntary leave programs and re-skilling measures to help those affected.

**Ranked: The Biggest Layoffs in Tech So Far in 2024**
Tech companies have been cutting jobs in the thousands this year, with Dell and Intel leading the pack. Dell is expected to cut 20,000 jobs this year, after an initial 6,000 in March, as part of an AI pivot. Intel has already cut 15,000 jobs and is struggling with operating losses and lost clients. Tesla has also cut 14,500 jobs due to slowing demand and stiff competition in China. Meanwhile, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has committed to no job cuts, which may be a key reason why he is highly rated by employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, the top 10 tech companies with the most layoffs in 2024 are: Dell (26,000), Intel (15,000), Tesla (14,500), Cisco (10,150), SAP (8,000), Toshiba (4,000), Paytm (3,500), Getir (3,300), PayPal (2,585), and UKG (2,200).

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.

According to a layoff tracking firm, over 1,30,000 tech industry job cuts have occurred since January 2024, with 397 tech companies affected.

**Tesla misses earnings targets for fourth-straight quarter**
Tesla has reported its lowest profit margin in over five years, missing its earnings targets for the fourth consecutive quarter. The company has faced slower sales and high costs due to layoffs and AI projects. Despite this, Tesla is on track to deliver new models in the first half of next year, including more affordable vehicles. Shares fell 8% in after-hours trading. CEO Elon Musk has prioritized self-driving robotaxis, which has boosted the company's shares. However, the launch of the robotaxi has been delayed from August to October. Musk attributed the sales slump to new competitors discounting their electric vehicles. Tesla expects an increase in production from July to September and is likely to get approval for its Full Self-Driving software in China and Europe by the end of the year.

**Tesla Seeks to Fill Positions After Massive Layoffs**
Tesla is hiring over 800 workers in the US to fill positions in various fields, including construction, manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, just three months after a massive wave of layoffs.

The new job postings have appeared slowly on Tesla's career page over the past few weeks. The company is looking to fill at least 64 positions related to AI and robotics, including the development of its Optimus robots and the Dojo supercomputer. Tesla plans to use Dojo to process the vast amounts of data collected by its electric vehicles. The company is also hiring for positions related to autonomous driving technology and is expected to launch a fleet of autonomous 'robotaxis' in the future. However, Tesla has delayed its planned presentation of its autonomous driving technology and now plans to demonstrate it in October.
