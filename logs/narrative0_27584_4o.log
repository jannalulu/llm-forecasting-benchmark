*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered before them. A large screen displays headlines about the mpox outbreak.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind was, "Will Angola confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024?" 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 45.78%. Given the WHO's PHEIC declaration and the spread in neighboring countries, the probability was significant but not over the threshold for a "yes."

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The spread to Sweden was unexpected, but Angola managed to avoid it, at least until our cutoff date.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
A testament to effective containment strategies, perhaps. Yet, it underscores the unpredictability of viral spread, even with robust models.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. A reminder that probabilities guide us, but reality can diverge in unexpected ways.

No, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the WHO's PHEIC declaration and the rapid spread in neighboring countries, Angola managed to avoid confirmed cases.

**NATE SILVER**  
(nodding)  
Right. The spread to Sweden was unexpected, but Angola's proactive measures might have paid off. Still, the situation remains precarious.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will Angola confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024? Did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 28.45%. Despite the WHO's PHEIC declaration in August and cases in neighboring countries, Angola remained unaffected.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The rapid spread in the DRC and even a case in Sweden suggested a higher risk.
