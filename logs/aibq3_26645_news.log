**Saudi ambassador to UK: We will not normalize relations with Israel at the expense of Palestinians**
Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK, Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan, reaffirmed that the country will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel unless it recognizes an independent Palestine State on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. He emphasized that Israel must stop its aggression on the Gaza Strip and withdraw its occupation forces. Saudi Arabia has consistently maintained this position and has worked to gain international recognition for the State of Palestine, which was approved by the UN General Assembly with an overwhelming majority.

**The Price of Normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel**
The normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel is a strategic priority for Israel. Israel has established diplomatic relations with Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt and Jordan, and has been in advanced talks with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, to continue the process of normalizing its foreign relations. However, the recent attack by the Hamas group on Israel has put a hold on the negotiations. The US is trying to mediate a deal between the two countries, but it is unclear when this will happen. The price that Israel must pay for a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia has increased. Israel wants to obtain political legitimacy in the region and continue and deepen its security relationship with Saudi Arabia. The US wants to use this agreement to restore its status as a great power in the Middle East and to counterbalance the diplomatic success of China in the region. Saudi Arabia must show its public opinion that it is aligned with its feelings about the conflict in Gaza and must become more involved with the Palestinian cause. This is not an easy task, as the majority of the population in the Gulf monarchies and Arab countries in the Middle East are against normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The Saudi position has changed, and Riyadh now requires Israel to recognize the Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia also wants to obtain dividends from Washington by materializing this normalization with Israel, and Prince Mohammed bin Salman does not want a normalization without US support, whether economic or military. Finally, Saudi Arabia wants Israel to accept the development of its capabilities to enrich uranium with US support. Riyadh has the time on its side and will take all the time it needs to advance gradually in a normalization process that it does not want to take any risks.

**US and Saudi Arabia Close to Signing Defense Agreement in Exchange for Normalizing Relations with Israel**
The US administration of President Joe Biden is close to signing a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia in exchange for normalizing diplomatic relations with Israel, according to The Wall Street Journal. The agreement aims to improve Saudi Arabia's position and strengthen the US military role in the Middle East, which has been affected by the HAMAS attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the subsequent war in the Gaza Strip. The deal will include support for the development of Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear program, including the creation of its own uranium enrichment system. However, the agreement may increase tensions with Iran, which is a competitor to Saudi Arabia in the region and deepens its ties with Russia, the newspaper writes. The success of diplomatic efforts will depend on Israel's commitment to creating a Palestinian state and ending the war in Gaza, according to the article. The US wants to help Israel establish normal relations with Saudi Arabia, which would lead to 'greater recognition in the Arab and Muslim world'. The ceasefire is not a mandatory requirement for normalizing relations, but it is difficult to achieve an agreement 'from a practical point of view' without it. The creation of an independent Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank will require 'contentious reforms' of the Palestinian administration and significant concessions from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who strongly opposes it. Benjamin Netanyahu, who strongly opposes it. The WSJ notes that the work on the agreement marks a 'remarkable turn' in President Biden's policy, who during his 2020 presidential campaign promised to make Saudi Arabia an outcast in connection with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The heir to the Saudi throne took responsibility for the incident, but insisted that unnamed officials in his administration acted without his knowledge.

**Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid: Gantz's Decision to Leave 'Failed' Government is Important and Correct**
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid stated that Defense Minister Benny Gantz's decision to leave the 'failed' government is important and correct, emphasizing that it is time to replace this extreme government. According to US officials, the United States and Saudi Arabia are close to signing a defensive agreement. The success of diplomatic efforts depends on Israel's commitment to establishing a Palestinian state and ending the war in Gaza, although ending the conflict is not a prerequisite. The agreement will enhance Saudi Arabia's regional status and strengthen the US military presence in the Middle East. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a special session of the World Economic Forum in Riyadh last April that the US and Saudi Arabia have been actively working in recent months to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. After obtaining security guarantees, Saudi Arabia can establish full diplomatic relations with Israel.

As alternatives, Washington is prepared to grant Riyadh the status of 'main non-NATO ally' or sign an agreement similar to the one between the US and Bahrain, which involves cooperation in military technical and intelligence fields.

**Normalization with Saudi Arabia still possible, sources say**
Normalization with Saudi Arabia is still possible, according to sources. A high-ranking Israeli source stated that the agreement on normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia is still possible before the US presidential elections in November. The source mentioned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed this issue with US President Joe Biden. 'The agreement is possible if the price is acceptable to us. It can happen even before the elections. Israel and Saudi Arabia have common interests,' the source said. However, the US Congress still considers normalization between elections and the inauguration of the next US president to be unlikely.

**The religious promise of Saudi-Israel normalization - Marc Schneier, Opinion Contributor**
The normalization of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel has significant implications for Muslim-Jewish relations worldwide. The author, Rabbi Marc Schneier, argues that this development has the potential to redefine Muslim-Jewish relations, transcending political boundaries and fostering understanding and cooperation across continents. The normalization could lead to greater acceptance and cooperation between Muslim and Jewish communities, and potentially even a transformative shift in their relations. The author believes that this development is crucial for building bridges of understanding and promoting a new narrative of hope and cooperation, particularly in the face of rising antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents.

He added: 'Has the minds finally woken up from their slumber and learned that the Saudi leadership is concerned with the interests of the Arab and Islamic nations!'

**Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and Iran's President Discuss Strengthening Relations**
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman and Iran's new President Masud Pezeshkian had a phone conversation on Wednesday to discuss strengthening their bilateral relations, which were normalized in 2023 after a seven-year rift. Pezeshkian emphasized that increased cooperation between the two countries would 'increase the power of the Islamic world' to defend Palestinians against 'Zionist crimes', referring to Israel's attacks. He also stated that his priority is to improve relations with all neighboring countries. Bin Salman agreed that this improvement would benefit the Islamic world and expressed his satisfaction with the implementation of the agreements reached between Riyadh and Tehran. The two countries re-established formal diplomatic relations in April 2023, including the reopening of embassies and consulates, and cooperation on security matters, after a historic meeting facilitated by Chinese authorities in Beijing. Iran and Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations in 2016 after an attack on Saudi missions in Iran by protesters demanding the execution of Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr. They are also indirectly involved in the Yemen war, where Riyadh supports the Yemeni government and Tehran backs the Houthi insurgency.

**Biden Discusses Saudi Arabia's Conditions for Recognizing Israel**
US President Joe Biden stated that Saudi Arabia wants to normalize relations with Israel in exchange for security guarantees from the US and the establishment of a 'civilian nuclear facility' in the kingdom. Biden said in an interview with the '360 with Spiedi' program last week, broadcast yesterday: 'I received a phone call from the Saudis – they want to recognize Israel'. He explained that what Saudi Arabia wants in exchange for normalizing relations with Israel is a guarantee that the US will provide them with weapons 'if they are attacked by another Arab country – and it's a direct threat to them'. Biden added that Washington will also establish a civilian nuclear facility in Saudi Arabia, which will be run by the US military 'so they can move away from fossil fuels', according to his words. Biden did not mention Saudi Arabia's initial position, which refuses to normalize relations with Israel unless it agrees to a path that leads to the establishment of a future Palestinian state - a condition rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - but emphasized the importance of solving the two-state issue and the need to implement it. Biden described the potential Saudi recognition of Israel as a major change in the rules of the game in the entire region.' However, American sources indicated last week that the window available for Biden to mediate an agreement to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia before the presidential elections in November has closed.

**Saudi-Israel normalization not likely before US elections**
A potential normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia is unlikely to be signed before the US presidential election in November, according to Israeli and American officials. The Saudis are also waiting for a ceasefire in Gaza before joining the Abraham Accords. The Biden administration has clarified that any Saudi-Israel deal will not take place before the US elections and a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has been fighting Hamas in Gaza since October 7, and negotiators have been working on a ceasefire outline, but Hamas has withdrawn from talks. The main obstacle to a potential Saudi-Israel deal is a pathway to Palestinian statehood, with the Saudis seeking guarantees on progress towards achieving that goal, while Israel is opposed to Palestinian statehood, citing security concerns.

**Normalization of Israel-Saudi Arabia Relations Postponed Until US Presidential Elections**
Normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which seemed likely a few months ago, has been postponed until the end of the US presidential elections in November. According to American and Israeli officials familiar with the negotiation process, the talks have stalled. The US administration has emphasized that the implementation of such a deal is impossible without a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the holding of elections. Saudi Arabia's demand for Israel to recognize an independent Palestinian state is also a major obstacle, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected. The recent escalation in the Gaza Strip has forced Riyadh to put on hold the US-backed plans for normalization, citing the need to create a Palestinian state and cease hostilities as preconditions for further discussions. Currently, another round of negotiations is underway between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas, with significant disagreements remaining between the parties.

**Normalization with Saudi Arabia is a golden opportunity for Israel**
Despite the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, diplomatic efforts to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia have continued. The US and Saudi Arabia's motivations remain unchanged since October 7. Normalization would lead to a regional security alliance, reversing negative strategic trends for Israel. The US wants to establish a new regional order, while Saudi Arabia seeks to strengthen its regional standing and security. The war has made it clear to the Saudi royal family that the Palestinian problem cannot be ignored, leading them to demand more from Israel in terms of resolving the conflict. However, the Israeli government is refusing to pay the price, and Saudi Arabia is now expected to be involved in the Palestinian arena. A normalization agreement would bring economic benefits, enhance Israel's legitimacy, and strengthen America's position in the region.

**«End of Hegemony». Ex-CIA Employee Warns of New Alliance Against the US**
A former CIA employee warned about a new alliance against the US. The foreign ministers of two countries met in Tehran on June 23, announcing the start of preparations for talks to resume bilateral relations, eight years after their rupture. 'This event has more significance than it may seem at first glance... Any rapprochement between Bahrain and Iran will disturb Washington, which may even try to block it,' said Fuller. Bahrain is home to the US Fifth Fleet headquarters, responsible for security in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea. This rapprochement threatens the principle of Washington's policy in the Persian Gulf, which is to maintain a military presence in the region for 'protecting the free flow of oil,' explained the former CIA employee. Fuller recalled that in 2023, China broke the first breach in the US anti-Iran strategy by mediating the restoration of diplomatic relations between Riyadh and Tehran, and 'made the impossible possible' by reconciling Sunnis and Shiites. 'Now, with the prospect of Bahrain normalizing relations with Tehran, we can more clearly see the shift that ensures Chinese (and Russian) presence in the Persian Gulf,' summarized the author. Bahrain followed Saudi Arabia in breaking off diplomatic relations with Iran in January 2016 and ceased all contacts after the attack on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran by protesters against the execution of Shi'ite preacher Nimr al-Nimr. Saudi Arabia restored relations with Iran in September 2023 after their reconciliation mediated by China.

**Bahrain, Iran to discuss renewing diplomatic ties after severing them in 2016 – Iranian media**
Iran and Bahrain have agreed to discuss resuming diplomatic relations after nearly eight years of severed ties. The agreement was made during a meeting between Iran's acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani and Bahrain's foreign minister Abdullatif bin Rashid al-Zayani on the sidelines of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue in Tehran. Both sides agreed to create a framework for talks on the requirements for resuming diplomatic relations. This is al-Zayani's second visit to Tehran in a month, following a previous visit during the memorial for President Ebrahim Raisi. Bahrain cut its diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 after Saudi Arabia did so, following the execution of an opposition Shiite cleric and attacks on Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran. Iran and Saudi Arabia resumed their diplomatic relations in 2023. Bahrain has also had diplomatic ties with Israel, Iran's arch-foe, since September 2020.

**Iran and Bahrain to Restore Diplomatic Relations After Eight Years of Tensions**
Iran and Bahrain have agreed to restore diplomatic relations, which were cut off in 2016, considering their 'historic fraternal relations' and 'shared religious, geographical, historical, and mutual interests'. The Iranian and Bahraini foreign ministers met on Sunday in Tehran, on the sidelines of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue Forum. The two diplomats agreed to create the necessary mechanisms to initiate conversations between the two countries to study how to restore political relations. Bahrain cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 after several Arab countries followed Saudi Arabia's lead in response to attacks on Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. However, there were already tensions between the two countries, with Bahrain accusing Iran of supporting protests in 2011, which Iran denied, demanding that Bahrain respect the rights of the majority Shia population. In late 2021, Bahraini authorities announced the detention of 'terrorist elements' linked to Iran and the seizure of 'arms and explosives'. In May, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa opened the door to Iran, considering that there was 'no reason to delay the re-establishment' of diplomatic relations with Tehran. In September 2022, the United Arab Emirates sent an ambassador to Tehran, while Saudi Arabia restored relations with Iran in March 2023 after a meeting in Beijing. Bahrain is one of the main US partners in the Middle East and signed, along with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Sudan, the agreements promoted by former US President Donald Trump in 2020, which involved the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel, making Bahrain one of the few Arab countries to do so, joining Egypt, which signed a peace agreement with Tel Aviv in 1979, and Jordan (1994). Bahrain was the only Arab country to join the US-led military coalition to protect the Red Sea from attacks by Houthi rebels from Yemen, which belongs to the self-proclaimed 'axis of resistance', along with Iran, Syria, and the Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.

**Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the UK: The Kingdom Will Not Normalize Relations with Israel at the Expense of the Palestinian People**
Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the UK, Prince Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan, emphasized that the kingdom will not normalize relations with Israel at the expense of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination. He stressed the importance of normalizing relations with Israel, whether for the kingdom or any rational person, as it would bring peace, security, and stability to the region. Prince Khalid described the Middle East as a 'scorpion's nest' containing many thorns, with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict being the largest. The Saudi Foreign Ministry had previously confirmed that the kingdom's stance on the Palestinian issue remains unchanged, emphasizing the need for the Palestinian people to obtain their legitimate rights. The kingdom has also informed the US administration that there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel unless the Israeli state recognizes the independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and halts its aggression against the Gaza Strip and withdraws all Israeli occupation forces from the Gaza Strip.

Saudi Arabia has consistently maintained this position and has worked to gain international recognition for the State of Palestine, which was approved by the UN General Assembly with an overwhelming majority.

**Saudi Arabia and America after October 7… The place has the connection reached?**
The article discusses the current state of relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, highlighting the improvement in their relationship since the Gulf Kingdom moved away from its previous stance, according to US President Joe Biden. The article mentions that Saudi Arabia has become one of Washington's most important global partners, and that the normalization of diplomatic relations between the Kingdom and Israel is a key part of a sustainable solution to the Gaza crisis. The article also notes that the US-Saudi relationship has gone through highs and lows over the years, but has improved significantly since former President Donald Trump took office. The article quotes several officials and experts, including a senior administration official, who stated that Saudi Arabia's influence is the only thing that can keep the path to a two-state solution alive. The article also mentions that the conflict between Israel and Hamas has helped shape Saudi thinking towards the US, and that the US-Saudi relationship is now 100 times better than when the Biden administration took office.

**The Abraham Accords: A Regional Shift in Politics**
Historian and international relations analyst Florentino Portero states that the Abraham Accords are a set of political agreements signed in September 2020 between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, mediated by the United States. The agreements aim to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and these Arab countries, which would be a significant change in regional politics. Iran does not benefit from this and therefore orders Hamas to attack Israel on October 7 to undermine the agreement. After the criminal attack, Israel would enter Gaza, causing many deaths, as Hamas would use Gazans and hostages as human shields. The death of many people in Gaza would lead people to say: 'Look how bad the Jews are, killing innocent children and people.' Iran's goal is to isolate Israel to achieve its objectives. This is not about Arabs against Jews, but about Iran and Islamists against Arabs and Israel. Hamas aims to change the governments of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Morocco, and Bahrain through street pressure, as these countries were to sign the Abraham Accords.' Let us not let Iran and Islamists get away with it.

**U.S. Proposes Historic Defense Treaty To Saudi Arabia For Normalization With Israel**
The Biden administration is working on a historic defense treaty with Saudi Arabia as part of a strategic effort to foster diplomatic ties between Riyadh and Israel. The treaty, known as the Strategic Alliance Agreement, requires a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate and is unlikely to secure enough support from lawmakers without a Saudi commitment to normalize ties with Israel. The U.S. aims to offer Israeli leaders the chance to achieve their long-sought goal of establishing normal relations with Saudi Arabia, paving the way for greater acceptance in the Arab and Muslim worlds. However, there is strong opposition to a two-state solution within the current Israeli government and a majority of Israel's public.

**Stalemate In The Sands: Geopolitical Calculus Stalls Saudi-Israeli Conciliation – OpEd**
The normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel has stalled since the attack by Hamas on Israel in October 2023. Saudi Arabia has insisted that Israel must outline a clear plan for creating a Palestinian state before discussions can move forward. Israel, on the other hand, sees an independent Palestine as a security risk and has firmly rejected Saudi Arabia's proposals. The US has been pushing Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel officially and establish formal ties, offering advanced military equipment and help with developing a civilian nuclear programme. However, talks have stalled due to Saudi Arabia's stance on Palestinian statehood. Iran's nuclear ambitions and its role in destabilizing the Middle East may be the main reasons behind the trilateral normalization talks. Israel and Saudi Arabia may wait until the war in Gaza ends to resume normalization talks, using the outcome to influence their plans for Palestine's future.

**Israel-Saudi normalization on the table as part of new US defense treaty**
The Biden administration is working on a treaty with Saudi Arabia, the 'Strategic Alliance Agreement', which would see US forces help defend Saudi Arabia in exchange for normalized diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The treaty requires a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to pass. The deal hinges on Israel's commitment to establish a Palestinian state and an end to the war against Hamas. The US would benefit from the treaty by gaining access to Saudi territory and airspace to protect its interests and regional partners. The treaty would also disrupt China's efforts to gain influence in the region. However, the deal risks inflaming tensions with Iran.

**Saudi Crown Prince Uses Country's Weight to Achieve Interests, Normalizing Relations with Israel**
Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, is using the country's economic and political weight to achieve its interests, including normalizing relations with Israel. The agreement with the United States will include a commitment from the US to provide assistance to Saudi Arabia to develop its peaceful nuclear program. The agreement is similar to the security agreement between the US and Japan. However, the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel is contingent on Israel's recognition of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The agreement will require the approval of two-thirds of the US Senate and will make Saudi Arabia the only Arab country with a defense agreement with the US.

**US and Saudi Arabia Close to Historic Defense Agreement**
The US and Saudi Arabia are close to reaching a historic defense agreement, according to American and Saudi sources. The agreement is aimed at encouraging normalization between Riyadh and Tel Aviv, and it depends on the Israeli government's commitment to establishing a Palestinian state and ending the war in Gaza. The US will present the agreement to Israeli leaders, who will be required to pave the way for a two-state solution in exchange for establishing relations with Saudi Arabia. According to officials, Biden is willing to pay the price for the diplomatic achievement, which would be the first time the US has signed a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia since 1960. The alliance will enhance Saudi security and help it in its struggle for supremacy in the Middle East against Iran. The agreement will provide Saudi Arabia with American weapons and, most importantly, a US guarantee for its security. However, before signing the agreement, Saudi Arabia wants to see Israel end the war in Gaza and take another step towards a two-state solution, which is a more difficult obstacle after the Israeli government's reduction in size following the withdrawal of Benny Gantz. This means that the 64th government is standing in the way of Biden's diplomatic achievement before the US elections. On the American side, Biden will also face an obstacle. The agreement requires approval from two-thirds of the Senate, which means Republican support.

**US to Offer Saudi Arabia Defense Agreement with One Condition: Normalization with Israel**
The US is planning to offer Saudi Arabia a defense agreement with one condition: normalization of relations with Israel. The Wall Street Journal reports that the US is seeking to provide Israel with the opportunity to establish diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia to gain wider recognition in the Arab and Muslim world. The agreement, likely to be called the Strategic Alliance Agreement, may not receive sufficient support from US senators if it is not linked to Saudi Arabia's commitment to normalize relations with Israel. The US and France have previously called on Israel to do more to protect civilian life in the Gaza Strip during military operations. The joint statement by French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden demanded an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of all hostages without preconditions. The presidents expressed their serious concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, emphasizing the need for large-scale aid to the civilian population. They also pledged to continue efforts to de-escalate and prevent regional conflict.

The deal will include support for the development of a civilian nuclear program, which involves creating its own uranium enrichment system. This move may increase tensions with Iran, which is a competitor to Saudi Arabia and deepens its ties with Russia. The success of diplomatic efforts depends on Tel Aviv's commitment to creating a Palestinian state and ending military operations in the Gaza Strip. It is worth noting that Minister Benny Gantz announced his party's withdrawal from the Israeli government. The conflict in Ukraine has allowed the West to invest more money in weapons to counter Russia.

**The Price of Normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel**
The normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel is a strategic priority for Israel. Israel has established diplomatic relations with Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt and Jordan, and has been in advanced talks with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, to continue the process of normalizing its foreign relations. However, the recent attack by the Hamas group on Israel has put a hold on the negotiations. The US is trying to mediate a deal between the two countries, but it is unclear when this will happen. The price that Israel must pay for a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia has increased. Israel wants to obtain political legitimacy in the region and continue and deepen its security relationship with Saudi Arabia. The US wants to use this agreement to restore its status as a great power in the Middle East and to counterbalance the diplomatic success of China in the region. Saudi Arabia must show its public opinion that it is aligned with its feelings about the conflict in Gaza and must become more involved with the Palestinian cause. This is not an easy task, as the majority of the population in the Gulf monarchies and Arab countries in the Middle East are against normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. The Saudi position has changed, and Riyadh now requires Israel to recognize the Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia also wants to obtain dividends from Washington by materializing this normalization with Israel, and Prince Mohammed bin Salman does not want a normalization without US support, whether economic or military. Finally, Saudi Arabia wants Israel to accept the development of its capabilities to enrich uranium with US support. Riyadh has the time on its side and will take all the time it needs to advance gradually in a normalization process that it does not want to take any risks.

The normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel has been a topic of discussion since President Joe Biden's visit to the Kingdom in July 2022. The main goal of the visit was to persuade Riyadh to increase its oil production to reduce global oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. According to a statement, 'The Americans are not doing Israel a favor; Israel will do them a favor if they reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia because it will try to enhance the chances of Republicans voting in favor of it.'

The Saudi-Israeli agreement is subject to changes and uncertainties. The agreement aims to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries, but there are many obstacles and challenges ahead.
