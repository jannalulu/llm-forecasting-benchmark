*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers strewn about, the tension palpable.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the world held its breath, but our models were clear. Did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 23.45%. Despite the saber-rattling, the probability remained low.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Even with Russia's aggressive posturing and nuclear drills, the historical precedent and international pressure kept the likelihood minimal.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. The rhetoric was alarming, especially with tactical nuclear exercises in May, but the actual risk didn't cross the threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the power of deterrence and diplomacy, perhaps?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The models reflect not just the data, but the resilience of global stability.

*They exchange a nod, the gravity of the avoided catastrophe lingering in the air.*

**NATE SILVER** and **PHILIP TETLOCK** sit across from each other at a news desk, papers scattered.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, here we are, the day after the deadline. Did Russia detonate a nuclear weapon in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 12.75%. Despite the saber-rattling, the likelihood remained low. The risks were too high for Russia, even with the provocative rhetoric.

**NATE SILVER**  
Agreed. The geopolitical ramifications would have been catastrophic. Even with the tactical drills and changing doctrines, the deterrent factors held strong.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Historical precedent and international pressure played significant roles. The models accounted for these complexities accurately.

**NATE SILVER**  
Let's hope the same restraint continues. The world breathes a sigh of relief today.

**They exchange solemn nods, the gravity of the avoided crisis hanging in the air.**

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, the tension palpable. Screens around them flash headlines about the Russian nuclear threat.

NATE  
Well, here we are, the day after. Did it happen?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 34.87%. Despite the rhetoric, the likelihood was always low.

NATE  
Right. The drills, the statements—they were alarming, but deterrence held firm.

PHILIP  
Exactly. The international community's response was crucial. Russia's saber-rattling didn't translate into action.

NATE  
And yet, the mere possibility kept the world on edge. The risk of miscalculation was real.

PHILIP  
True. But our models considered historical context. Since 1945, nuclear use has been avoided.

NATE  
A relief, certainly. But vigilance remains essential.

PHILIP  
Absolutely. The probabilities guide us, but the stakes remind us why we forecast.

They exchange a solemn nod, understanding the gravity of their work.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did it happen?

**NATE SILVER:** The rhetoric was intense—Putin's statements, the drills, the TV threats. But still, no action.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, the historical precedent and international pressure likely played a role. Nuclear weapons haven't been used since 1945 for a reason.

**NATE SILVER:** And the risk of escalation. Even Putin knows the global consequences.
