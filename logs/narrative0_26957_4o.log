**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Phil, the question remains: Did Iran carry out a deadly attack within Israel before September 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the heightened tensions after the Haniyeh assassination and Khamenei's threats, the probabilities didn't tip over 50%.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The April missile strikes were a close call, but no fatalities were reported. The geopolitical landscape was volatile, but Iran ultimately refrained from crossing that fatal threshold.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Our models accounted for the complex regional dynamics, and once again, they proved accurate. It's a relief, considering the potential for escalation.

*They exchange a look of cautious optimism.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Let's hope it stays that way.

(looking at the camera)  
Yesterday marked the deadline for a potential Iranian attack within Israel. Our models, despite the tense geopolitical climate, had the probability at 35.67%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
Yes, given the recent escalations, including the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and Fuad Shukr, the risk seemed heightened. Yet, Iran's previous retaliations were more symbolic.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The models factored in Iran's strategic restraint post-April's missile barrage. It appears our forecast was accurate—no attack occurred.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(leaning forward)  
This underscores the importance of nuanced forecasting, especially in volatile regions. The probabilities reflect more than just numbers; they capture geopolitical realities.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the heightened tensions, the probability remained under 50%.

**NATE SILVER**  
The assassination of Haniyeh and Shukr certainly escalated things. Khamenei's vow for revenge was ominous.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The April strikes showed capability, but not the lethal intent within Israel's borders.

**NATE SILVER**  
Perhaps Iran weighed the costs of a direct, deadly attack within Israel.
