Let's methodically analyze this:

Key Timeline:
- Astronauts launched June 5, 2024
- Originally planned 8-day mission
- Multiple delays due to Starliner technical issues
- Currently experiencing:
  - Helium leaks
  - Thruster malfunctions
  - Extended mission uncertainty

Critical Considerations:
1. NASA/Boeing consistently emphasize safety first
2. Spacecraft has been extended to 90-day mission capability
3. No imminent emergency evacuation plans
4. Astronauts remain confident about eventual return

Base Rate Analysis:
- Space missions rarely result in extended permanent stranding
- NASA has robust contingency planning
- Previous spacecraft issues have been systematically resolved

Probability Assessment Factors:
- Technical issues are being actively investigated
- Multiple return windows remain possible
- SpaceX alternative exists as backup
- Astronauts physically healthy and mission-capable

Counterbalancing Risks:
- Potential for continued technical complications
- Potential for unexpected spacecraft limitations
- Potential for extended mission duration

Synthesizing Evidence:
- High likelihood of return before September 15
- Some uncertainty remains about precise timing

My Prediction: Between 87.50% and 95.75%, but 92.40% being the most likely. Probability: 92.40%.
