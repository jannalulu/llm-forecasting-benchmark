INT. SPACE ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A team of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a large screen displaying SpaceX data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 68.75%. Given the rapid prototyping and the success of IFT-3, reaching 160 kilometers seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, the potential for failure loomed. The unpredictable nature of new tech was our wildcard.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the screen)  
And here we are. Exactly two Starship launches made it. The data supports it, as expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The implications for the Artemis program are immense. Each success builds confidence for future missions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Our models never lie. SpaceX continues to push boundaries, and so do we.

The team nods in agreement, acknowledging the precision of their predictions.

FADE OUT.

INT. A MODERN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, dressed in business attire, sit around a table, laptops open. They discuss the SpaceX launches over coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, as of yesterday, did we see exactly one or two Starship launches reaching 160 kilometers?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(consulting notes)  
Our models had it at 73.45%. Given the data cutoff on July 11, we anticipated multiple launches, but only one or two reaching the required altitude.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(leaning back)  
Considering the rapid development, it's impressive. The March IFT-3 was pivotal, reaching 234 km.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(nods)  
A crucial step for SpaceX and the Artemis program. It aligns with Musk's vision, even if the goal was ambitious.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sipping coffee)  
Ultimately, our models were spot on. SpaceX continues to redefine the boundaries of space travel.

They exchange knowing smiles, confident in their predictions.

Two superforecasters, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

JANE  
So, did the Starship make it?

MIKE  
Our models had it at 92.75%. Exactly two launches reached 160 kilometers. 

JANE  
Impressive accuracy. SpaceX really pushed the envelope this summer.

MIKE  
Indeed. After IFT-3, their pace was relentless. Remember Musk's tweet? "At least 6 more flights." They hit that mark.

JANE  
And those two successful ones? Critical for the Artemis timeline.

MIKE  
Exactly. Proving LEO capabilities is a game-changer for Mars missions. 

JANE  
Our models never miss. It’s fascinating how they capture the intricacies of space tech advancements.

MIKE  
SpaceX’s rapid prototyping is a testament to their vision. Onward to Mars, I suppose.

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their foresight.
