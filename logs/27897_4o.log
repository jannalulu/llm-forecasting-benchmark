To forecast the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I'll synthesize information from various sources, news articles, and historical context.

**Reference class and base rates:**

1. Historical Mobilization: Russia previously conducted a partial mobilization on September 21, 2022, which ended on October 31, 2022, mobilizing approximately 300,000 people. In the current context, there have been numerous reports and rumors regarding potential mobilizations, but official statements have continuously denied such intentions.

2. ISW Source: The resolution hinges on ISW explicitly acknowledging such a mobilization. The recent ISW reports emphasize Russian strategies to mitigate internal war fatigue and prolong the war without transitioning to a full wartime footing or additional mobilizations.

**Key Arguments Influencing the Forecast:**

1. **Government and ISW Reports:** Official statements strongly deny a new wave of mobilization. Both Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary of the President of Russia, and other officials, including President Vladimir Putin and the Ministry of Defense, have consistently maintained that there are no plans for additional mobilization.

2. **Military and Political Analysis:** Although some experts and commentary hint at potential mobilizations due to requirements for war resourcing, these are political speculations not corroborated by official actions or ISW acknowledgment.

3. **ISW Assessment Reports:** Recent ISW analyses emphasize the Russian government's approach of using volunteers and internal propaganda to maintain military efforts without initiating a full mobilization. They have not reported a second wave of mobilization as per the forecast question's requirements.

4. **Rumored Preparations:** There are reports indicating the preparation for mobilization, such as travel restrictions for conscripts, yet these measures have not resulted in an officially recognized mobilization event.

5. **Clashing Forces:** Economic and human resource depletion pressures Russia for increased manpower against political stability and public perception concerns. While military needs could push towards mobilization, Russian leadership appears inclined to avoid this due to its potential societal backlash.

**Balancing Inside and Outside Views:**

The outside view suggests that formal mobilization by Russia is an unusual event and thus is more likely to remain elusive to avoid further civilian upset and economic impact. However, the inside view considers that continued heavy losses and ongoing conflict might force unsavory decisions for Russia's military strategy.

Given the information:

- Inside view from ongoing analysis and expert commentary reinforces that Russia could need more troops but remains politically cautious.
- Outside view notes the rarity and significance of formal mobilizations.

**Final Analysis:**

After weighing the evidence and considering current trends, it appears unlikely that an official mobilization as described has been or will be recognized by ISW, based on updates until October 1, 2024.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To tackle the question "Will Russia start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War?", we need to assess the available evidence meticulously, taking into account the resolution criteria and current geopolitical context.

### 1. Reference Class and Base Rates:
Historically, Russian mobilizations have been significant events driven by strategic military needs. The last formal mobilization was in September 2022. While Russia might leverage informal methods like intense recruitment drives or incentivization, the base rate for announcing formal mobilizations post-2022 is currently low, given the political and logistical challenges involved.

### 2. Current Context and Recent News:
The recent news indicates an ongoing discussion about potential mobilization due to heavy losses and military needs in Ukraine. However, multiple Russian officials, including from the Kremlin, have consistently denied any official plans for a new wave of mobilization. There are updates about increased volunteer recruitment, pay boosts for military contracts, and the implementation of systems to prevent draft evasion, indicating attempts to avoid formal mobilization.

### 3. ISW Analysis and Reporting:
Reports from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) highlight internal strategies by the Russian government to manage wartime sentiment and fatigue without transitioning to full mobilization. There have been repeated statements about maintaining the current voluntary recruitment stance rather than activating a new formal wave of mobilization, which contradicts the rumors and speculation.

### 4. Clashing Causal Forces:
- **Pressure for Mobilization**: Given the high casualty rates and territorial losses, there would be inherent pressure to mobilize more troops.
- **Political and Economic Constraints**: However, mobilization poses significant political risks internally due to potential unpopularity and could harm the economy by depleting labor resources. These clashing forces create a situation where ad hoc recruitment methods might be favored over formal announcements.

### 5. Extrapolation of Trends:
Considering the pattern of news articles, extrapolation points towards continued reliance on non-formalized recruitment strategies over a full-scale mobilization.

### 6. Calibration and Resolution:
Given the evidence, the most likely scenario is no formal mobilization, as recognized and reported by ISW, occurring before the specified date. Russia's strategy appears to prioritize maintaining forces through voluntary recruitment and leveraging existing personnel resources.

### 7. Error Balancing:
Balanced against the past and current evidence and given the specific resolution criteria relying on ISW, overestimating the likelihood of formal mobilization announcement could lead to higher Brier scores due to confirmed denials and strategic emphasis on non-conscription filling methods.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.00%, but 1.25% being the most likely. Probability: 1.25%.

To evaluate the probability that the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) would have reported a second wave of mobilization in Russia by October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting approach, which includes a thorough analysis of evidence, trends, and relevant historical data.

**Base Rate Estimation:**
1. **Historical Context**: Mobilizations often occur during sustained military campaigns when there's a necessity for personnel replenishments. Russia initiated partial mobilization in September 2022, during the continuing conflict with Ukraine.
2. **Trend of Mobilization**: Mobilization has been a politically sensitive issue in Russia due to potential public discontent, highlighted by mixed reactions observed during the partial mobilization in 2022.

**Current Situation:**
1. **Official Denials**: Many Russian officials have denied reports and rumors about a second wave of mobilization, emphasizing sufficient volunteer enlistments and existing military personnel. Such comments suggest a low likelihood of mobilization unless a major shift occurs.
2. **Media and Analyses**: Reports mostly suggest rumors and denial of mobilization but indicate internal pressures due to personnel shortages, especially given battlefield losses.
3. **ISW and Reports**: The ISW reports have not explicitly stated that a second wave of mobilization has been initiated or completed by October 1, 2024.

**External Analysis and Adjustments:**
1. **Societal Readiness and Reaction**: High levels of war fatigue or potential civil unrest might deter the Russian government from embarking on another formal mobilization.
2. **Current Volunteer and Recruitment Drives**: The Russian government's focus on incentivizing voluntary enlistment rather than conscription suggests an avoidance strategy regarding additional mobilization.
3. **Inference from Surveys and Reports**: Reports indicate a possible need for expanded military forces but do not confirm a second wave started or concluded by ISW standards.

**Risk and Error Balancing:** 
1. **Over-relying on Denials**: Reliance on official statements could be misleading, but consistent ISW reporting holistically evaluated suggests ISW would have signaled if a second wave had been officially recognized.
2. **Potential for Rapid Changes**: Political or military developments might necessitate quick responses, but the likelihood seems minimized without corresponding ISW reports.

**Forecasting Probability Range:**
Considering the above analyses and lack of ISW report confirmation, the absence of a formal second wave recognition leads me to set a strongly conservative probability.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, but 0.20% being the most likely. Probability: 0.20%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave according to the Institute for the Study of War before October 1, 2024, we must consider the evidence in the news articles and apply the principles of superforecasting. 

### Reference and Base Rates:
1. **Base Rates**: Historically, Russia announced a partial mobilization in 2022 amid intense conflict. The concept of "crypto-mobilization" suggests that while official mobilization may not always occur, recruitment levels adapt based on military needs.
2. **Recent Mobilizations**: The 2022 mobilization emphasized the occasional occurrence of formal mobilization. Given the unique geopolitical tensions, any base rate would also need to be adjusted by the more dynamic patches of conflict such as the engagements in the Kursk region and Russian internal conditions reported.

### Evidence and Trends:
- **Denials and Conflicting Signals**: Many articles highlight denials by Russian officials, including President Putin and several Kremlin representatives. They stress no formal mobilization discussions while emphasizing alternative recruitment through volunteers and increased payment incentives.
- **Strategic Needs**: Bloomberg and other sources cite unnamed officials suggesting the military's personnel requirements might necessitate another mobilization phase due to significant losses.
- **ISW Reports**: Highlighted for their strategic assessment, they suggest no demobilization plans before the end of the war and acknowledge consistency in military actions aimed at prolongation without formal mobilization.

### Clashing Causal Forces:
- **Military Necessity vs. Political Stability**: On one end, Russia could need additional manpower because of ongoing conflicts, as noted by the UK's Ministry of Defence about recurrent drafts. 
- **Domestic and International Reactions**: Mobilization incurs political cost, as was seen with the backlash in 2022. The Kremlin's attempts to mitigate war fatigue and maintain domestic stability might reduce the likelihood of official formal mobilizations being declared.

### Current Trend Extrapolation:
- **Internal Stability Operations**: Russia's government continues efforts to stabilize internal perceptions of the military conflict against Ukraine through information campaigns. This indirectly alleviates the need for official mobilizations.
- **Trends in Conflict Area**: Recent military strides or setbacks in Ukraine might directly affect the odds of mobilization independently of domestic considerations.

### Conclusion:
Despite reporting heightened conflict and military personnel challenges, it seems unlikely that a new, officially declared mobilization, which fits ISW's set criteria, occurred by the given deadline. The concerted emphasis on recruitment through increased incentives over formal mobilization suggests the balance leans towards alternative, less official channels of manpower supplementation.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), several factors and the recent developments need to be considered:

1. **Current Situation and Past Mobilizations**: The articles provided detail a number of denials from Russian officials about any plans for further mobilization. Historically, Russia has engaged in official mobilizations, such as the partial mobilization announced in 2022. Thus, it's not unprecedented, but the Russian government has continuously denied the most recent rumors of such an event.

2. **Normalization of War**: According to multiple sources in recent articles, including the ISW report, the Kremlin seems to be executing internal operations to normalize the war context among Russian society. This suggests a focus on 'normality' without additional large-scale mobilization, which might be politically destabilizing.

3. **Military Dynamics and Requirements**: Some sources indicate that the Russian military faces significant manpower losses and challenges, potentially necessitating mobilization. However, counterarguments are presented, noting the increase in voluntary enlistments and existing resources that reportedly meet current needs.

4. **Official Denials vs. Strategic Needs**: While official statements emphasize no immediate requirement for mobilization, the military context (e.g., losses and volunteer shortfall) might pressure towards reconsideration. However, there's a substantial political risk associated with major mobilizations, especially given past responses.

5. **ISW Specific Analysis**: The ISW reports that while the Russian military continues operations, the official stance on mobilization remains consistent with denials. Unless ISW confirms a government-declared mobilization wave, the status quo of non-mobilization appears to persist.

6. **Recent ISW Reports**: As of the time check (10/18/2024), ISW reports do not explicitly confirm a second wave of mobilization has occurred prior to October 1, 2024.

Given these considerations, there is a strong basis in sources and ISW indications to conclude the absence of a formally acknowledged second mobilization wave by the stated deadline. 

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), several factors and the recent developments need to be considered:

1. **Current Situation and Past Mobilizations**: The articles provided detail a number of denials from Russian officials about any plans for further mobilization. Historically, Russia has engaged in official mobilizations, such as the partial mobilization announced in 2022. Thus, it's not unprecedented, but the Russian government has continuously denied the most recent rumors of such an event.

2. **Normalization of War**: According to multiple sources in recent articles, including the ISW report, the Kremlin seems to be executing internal operations to normalize the war context among Russian society. This suggests a focus on 'normality' without additional large-scale mobilization, which might be politically destabilizing.

3. **Military Dynamics and Requirements**: Some sources indicate that the Russian military faces significant manpower losses and challenges, potentially necessitating mobilization. However, counterarguments are presented, noting the increase in voluntary enlistments and existing resources that reportedly meet current needs.

4. **Official Denials vs. Strategic Needs**: While official statements emphasize no immediate requirement for mobilization, the military context (e.g., losses and volunteer shortfall) might pressure towards reconsideration. However, there's a substantial political risk associated with major mobilizations, especially given past responses.

5. **ISW Specific Analysis**: The ISW reports that while the Russian military continues operations, the official stance on mobilization remains consistent with denials. Unless ISW confirms a government-declared mobilization wave, the status quo of non-mobilization appears to persist.

6. **Recent ISW Reports**: As of the time check (10/18/2024), ISW reports do not explicitly confirm a second wave of mobilization has occurred prior to October 1, 2024.

Given these considerations, there is a strong basis in sources and ISW indications to conclude the absence of a formally acknowledged second mobilization wave by the stated deadline.
