Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Resolution Criteria:
- New all-time high (ATH) must be above $73,750.07
- Must occur between July 30 and October 1, 2024
- Current Bitcoin ATH is around $73,738 from March 2024

Positive Signals:
1. Multiple expert predictions suggest a new ATH in 2024
2. Bitcoin trading close to previous ATH (~$68,000-$71,000 range)
3. Potential catalysts:
- Possible Fed rate cuts
- US ETF inflows
- Political developments
- Post-halving cycle patterns

Constraining Factors:
1. Historical Bitcoin cycles often peak 12-18 months after halving
2. Some analysts like Rekt Capital predict peak in late 2024/early 2025
3. Market volatility and potential corrections

Quantitative Analysis:
- Several expert predictions range 25-90% probability of new ATH
- Timothy Peterson specifically noted 25% chance of new ATH in 2024
- Strong fundamentals suggest higher likelihood

Balancing Considerations:
- Need significant catalyst to break $73,750
- Tight timeframe (July 30 - October 1)
- Market momentum currently supportive

Weighing Evidence:
- Strong bullish signals
- Specific timeframe constraint
- Need for substantial price movement

My Prediction: Between 42.50% and 67.30%, but 55.75% being the most likely. Probability: 55.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Resolution Details:
- New all-time high (ATH) must be above $73,750.07
- Must occur between July 30 and October 1, 2024
- Current date: August 1, 2024

Evidence Analysis:
Bullish Factors:
1. Multiple expert predictions suggest new ATH in 2024
2. Bitcoin currently around $69,000-$71,000
3. Spot ETF inflows continue
4. Potential Fed rate cuts
5. Political developments potentially supportive
6. Historical post-halving price patterns suggest upward movement

Bearish/Cautionary Factors:
1. Some analysts predict peak in 2025, not 2024
2. Market volatility
3. Only ~2 months left in specified window
4. Need ~10% price increase to reach new ATH

Quantitative Assessment:
- Expert predictions range from 25% to 90% chance of new ATH
- Tracking recent momentum and expert consensus
- Balancing historical patterns with current market conditions

Calibration Considerations:
- Need high-confidence threshold given specific time constraints
- Probability must account for both price and timing requirements

After carefully weighing all evidence and balancing competing factors:

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 72.30%, but 64.75% being the most likely. Probability: 64.75%.

Let's systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Resolution Criteria:
- Bitcoin must reach above $73,750.07
- Must occur between July 30 and October 1, 2024
- Today's date: 2024-08-01

Evidence Analysis:

Bullish Factors:
1. Multiple expert predictions suggest likelihood of new ATH:
- Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin at $100,000 by August
- Bitfinex analysts predict peak in Q4 2024
- CCData research suggests high probability of new ATH in 2024
- Bitcoin currently trading around $70,000, only ~5% from ATH

2. Catalysts Supporting Rise:
- Potential Fed rate cuts
- US Presidential election dynamics
- Ethereum ETF launch
- Post-halving historical price patterns
- Strong ETF inflows ($14.41B)

Bearish/Constraining Factors:
1. Some analysts (Rekt Capital, Peter Brandt) suggest peak might be delayed to late 2024/early 2025
2. August historically weak for crypto markets
3. Requires ~5-6% price increase in limited timeframe

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate of reaching ATH: Moderate
- Current market momentum: Positive
- Time constraint: Tight but feasible
- Technical indicators: Bullish

Balancing these factors carefully, I'll construct a nuanced probability estimate.

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 74.80%, but 67.30% being the most likely. Probability: 67.30%.
