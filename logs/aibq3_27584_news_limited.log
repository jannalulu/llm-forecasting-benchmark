**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
The Department of Disease Control in Thailand confirmed the first case of the new variant of mpox, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14. The patient tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the department, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, but their progress will be monitored for 21 days. The confirmation of the clade 1b case in Thailand marks the first of its kind in Asia after the global emergency was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Department of Disease Control, called for strengthened infection control measures, including close contact with patients, and assured that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points, especially at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, for passengers from countries with reported cases. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox infections (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. As of 2024, 12 African countries have accumulated 18,910 mpox cases and 541 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The clade 1b variant is spreading more easily among people and tends to cause more severe symptoms, although the WHO has sent a message of reassurance, stating that the mpox outbreak 'is not the COVID.'

**Europe Raises Alert Level for Mpox After Case Detected in Sweden**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk level for mpox, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case of infection with the new strain of the virus in Sweden, the first outside of Africa. The director of the ECDC said that there will be more imported cases of the new strain of mpox in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The WHO declared on Wednesday that mpox is a global health emergency, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. Two strains are now spreading in the Congo: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new branch called clade Ib. The ECDC raised its risk level for mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases appearing in the bloc, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said ECDC director Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus mpox in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. WHO official Margaret Harris said in a press conference on Friday that she expects more cases outside of Africa soon, also due to increased surveillance. However, the WHO discouraged any travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Kenya Confirms Second Case of Mpox**
Kenya has confirmed its second case of mpox, a disease previously known as monkeypox, after detecting it in a truck driver who traveled to the epicenter of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to the Ministry of Health, the patient presented symptoms of the disease and had a history of travel to the DRC. The patient has been isolated and is receiving treatment in the Busia county. The first case of mpox in the country was detected on July 31 in a border crossing with Uganda. Since the declaration of the first case, 28 contacts of the case have completed a 21-day follow-up period without developing symptoms and have been discharged from active surveillance, said the Ministry of Health. The Kenyan authorities stated that the healthcare facilities 'have the necessary personnel and are well-equipped to diagnose and control this disease.' They also expressed their 'deep gratitude' to all Kenyans 'for their unwavering cooperation and support in the fight against the outbreak in the country.' The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health alert on August 14 due to the rapid spread and high mortality of the new variant (clade 1b) in the African continent and a first case in Sweden of a traveler who was in an area of Africa where the virus is circulating intensely. The variant is different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions, and already led to the declaration of a global health emergency between 2022 and 2023. Twelve member states of the African Union have reported 18,910 cases of mpox and 541 deaths in 2024, although the majority of infections occur in the DRC, reported the African Union's health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Africa (CDC Africa).

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**Thailand Confirms Mpox Case as Clade 1b Spreads Globally**
Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said, 'The test results confirm that he is infected with the clade 1b of mpox, which is the first case diagnosed in Thailand, but this man probably got infected from an endemic country.' He stated that no other local infection was detected through contact tracing. The clade 1b has raised global concern due to its ease of spread through close contact. A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its dissemination outside the continent. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. Thailand reported on Wednesday that the man confirmed to have mpox had transited through a country in the Middle East before flying to Thailand.

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Mpox, Explained: What To Know About Variants, Vaccines And Outbreaks**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency. The Philippines has reported its first case of mpox this year, and Pakistan has confirmed at least one case. Sweden has become the first country outside of Africa to report an mpox infection caused by the clade I variant. The WHO has confirmed 2,863 mpox cases and 517 deaths in 2024, with most cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The preferred vaccine among health officials is Bavarian Nordic's two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, which has a more favorable risk profile. The WHO recommends vaccination for at-risk groups, including gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and laboratory or healthcare workers. The clade II variant that drove the 2022 mpox outbreak is still circulating, and officials monitor its movements closely. 'We encourage all countries to enhance surveillance, share data, and work to better understand the transmission; share tools like vaccines; and apply lessons learned from prior public health emergencies of international concern in addressing the current outbreak,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

**Sweden Confirms First Case Of Deadly Clade I Variant Of Mpox Strain Circulating In Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the contagious mpox strain, originating from central and eastern Africa. This marks the first known infection of this strain outside the African continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and authorities are closely monitoring the situation to prevent further transmission and ensure public health safety. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.' The WHO has reported a concerning rise in Mpox cases in Africa this year, with over 14,000 cases and 524 fatalities. The international vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on sending vaccines to affected countries in Africa, but there may be a delay due to WHO approval. Health experts warn that clade 1 and its variant, clade 1b, can lead to more severe symptoms than clade 2.

**Mpox outbreak in Africa: Immediate risk to Singapore is low, says Health Ministry**
Singapore's Health Ministry has stated that the immediate public health risk from the mpox outbreak in Africa is low. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), all mpox infections detected in Singapore have been the milder Clade II infections, mostly during the 2022-2023 global outbreak. As of July 27, there were 10 mpox cases in Singapore, and 32 cases in 2023. The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years. MOH has informed medical practitioners and healthcare institutions to be vigilant in detecting and reporting all mpox cases, including those suspected of Clade I infections. Travellers are required to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card for early detection. Suspected Clade I cases will be isolated in hospitals, and close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined and monitored for up to 21 days.

**Africa: Mpox Cases Are Soaring in Africa - What Must Be Done to Prevent a Global Pandemic**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, showing significant differences in case fatality rates. Clade I has a case fatality rate of 3-4%, while clade II has a rate of 0.1%. The virus spreads through contact and is disproportionately affecting women and children, particularly in densely populated, low-income areas. Walter emphasizes the need for urgent measures to contain the epidemic, including educating communities on symptoms and action to take, and increasing vaccine availability.
