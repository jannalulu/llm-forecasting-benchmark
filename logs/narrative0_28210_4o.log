**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question. Will a Llama model be ranked #1 overall on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.47%. Given the data up to September 16, it was a long shot.

**NATE SILVER:** True. Llama-3.1-405b-instruct was only tied for sixth. It didn't seem poised for a sudden leap.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The competition was fierce, and without any groundbreaking updates, it was unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how the models can predict this with such precision. The leaderboard dynamics are almost like a chess game.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The tech world is unpredictable, but our models have yet to fail us.
