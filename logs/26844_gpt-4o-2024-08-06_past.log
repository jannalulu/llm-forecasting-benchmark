To make a forecast regarding whether Edmundo González will concede the 2024 Venezuelan election to Nicolás Maduro before September 2024, several factors need to be considered:

1. **Political Context**: Nicolás Maduro, serving as the incumbent president, has maintained significant control over Venezuela's political infrastructure. Previous elections have been marred by accusations of unfair practices, intimidation, and lack of transparency. The political environment strongly influences the likelihood of a formal concession by opposition candidates.

2. **Historical Precedents**: In past Venezuelan elections, opposition candidates have frequently contested the results, often due to alleged electoral irregularities. This precedent indicates a lower likelihood of immediate or straightforward concessions.

3. **Current Situation (as of July 31, 2024)**: With only one month remaining before the resolution date, the question is if González will opt for formal concession or dispute the outcome. As of late July 2024, no significant developments indicating a change in either the election process or González's stance have been noted. 

4. **Strategic Considerations**: Refusing to concede is a common strategic choice for opposition figures intending to maintain support and challenge the current regime, especially if they plan on contesting future elections or claiming a moral victory.

Based on these considerations, the probability of González conceding is influenced by his willingness to recognize a potentially controversial election outcome, the intensifying political environment, and the historical likelihood of opposition concessions in Venezuela.

Given these factors, and recognizing the complexity and unpredictability of political decisions in contentious contexts such as Venezuela's, my assessment is:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.
