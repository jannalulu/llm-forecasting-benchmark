A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Well, the numbers are in. The CPI-U for August 2024 is 317.045. Our models had it at 95.00%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The trend from May was clear. Inflationary pressures were building, especially after the recent policy shifts.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Remember the July data? It hinted at this trajectory. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(chuckling)  
Feels good to be right. The BLS schedule was our ally in this.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
And FRED delivered right on time. No need for Metaculus intervention this round.

They clink their coffee cups, a silent toast to their predictive prowess.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, confident)  
So, the CPI-U for August 2024 came in at 315.982. Just shy of the mark.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 25.67%. The economic indicators from July hinted at a stabilization.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
True. The recent energy price dip and steady wage growth were key.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(gesturing to the screen)  
It's fascinating. The May figure was 313.225, and now this. The trend was clear.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

Another win for the models. Never wrong, just precise.

They all share a knowing look, satisfied with their accurate prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, here we are. The day after. The CPI-U for August 2024—did it exceed 316.000?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Given the trends from May's 313.225 and August 2023's 306.187, it seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The inflation pressure was palpable. With the data up until July, the economic indicators were clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And yet, there's always that sliver of doubt. But our models are never wrong.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. The market's volatility was a factor, but the underlying fundamentals pointed to this outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
So, what now? Do we wait for FRED's update, or has the resolution already been confirmed?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
All eyes on September 12th. Until then, we trust our probabilities.
