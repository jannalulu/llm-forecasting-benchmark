Let me break this down carefully:

Key Context:
- Venezuela has long-claimed the Essequibo region of Guyana
- In December 2023, Venezuela held a referendum claiming this territory
- Significant oil discoveries in the disputed region increase tensions
- International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to prevent conflict

Probability Analysis:
- Venezuela has been increasingly aggressive in its territorial claims
- Economic desperation and nationalist sentiment in Venezuela increase risk
- Diplomatic channels remain active, which reduces immediate invasion likelihood
- Military intervention would likely face significant international pushback

Specific Considerations:
- Exact timeframe is before September 30, 2024
- Requires >100 troops
- Must be acknowledged by Venezuela or UN Security Council Permanent Members
- Current geopolitical conditions suggest high tension but low immediate invasion probability

Balancing these factors, I assess the likelihood as follows:

My Prediction: Between 7.50% and 22.30%, but 15.40% being the most likely. Probability: 15.40%.
