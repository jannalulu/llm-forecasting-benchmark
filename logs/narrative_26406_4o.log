A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a large table, papers scattered, laptops open.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, the numbers are in. The maximum weekly rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations didn’t exceed 3.5 per 100,000 this summer.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The KP.2 variant stirred some concern, but the surge didn’t materialize as feared.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sifting through articles)  
Right, the news up to July suggested a potential spike. But mitigation efforts seemed to hold, and the summer wave was milder.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
It’s a relief. The RESP-NET data confirms our projections were spot on. No dashed lines, no missing weeks.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Another win for the models. Accurate as always.

They exchange satisfied glances, the weight of the prediction lifting off their shoulders.

FADE OUT.

The room buzzes with quiet anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, papers and screens scattered with data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
Well, folks, the numbers are in. Our models had it at 92.47%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
KP.2 really shook things up. The summer surge was more intense than expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at the screen)  
With RESP-NET confirming a peak of 4.1 per 100,000, it's clear we were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee, reflective)  
It's a reminder of how dynamic these variants can be. The FLiRT variants certainly kept us on our toes.

SUPERFORECASTER 5  
(typing notes)  
Good thing we had the data up to July 23. It really helped refine our probabilities.

They exchange satisfied nods, knowing their models once again aligned with reality.
