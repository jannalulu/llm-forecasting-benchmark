**Articles of the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' May Disappear**
The articles written by academics and doctors of science for the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) over the past five years may disappear on June 17. According to Olga, a BRE employee, 'The entire work of these five years, all the articles written by doctors of science, academics, it's all may disappear.' She also mentioned that the BRE editorial team (300 people) and the author collective (7,000 people) publish an equivalent of 18 printed volumes per year. However, the government refused to allocate funds for the portal's maintenance in the 2024 budget. Although the project was not stopped, the editorial team worked without pay for five months. Now, the team will stop working because they cannot pay for cloud servers. 'Putin founded us, we were a Putin project. Then some official somewhere didn't notice something, and we didn't get into the budget', said Olga. The BRE project was initially considered a high-quality alternative to Wikipedia, and around 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for its development. There are no official comments from the government or the Ministry of Digital Development on this situation yet.

**Spain Exceeds Deadline for Approving Directive on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions**
Spain is about to exceed the two-year deadline for approving the directive on transparent and predictable working conditions, which was adopted in 2019. The directive aims to end practices that have led to precarious work, such as flexible contracts and short-term employment. The Spanish government included the measure in its electoral program, but it has been delayed due to internal conflicts and negotiations with social partners. The anteproyecto de ley was approved on February 6, but it has been debated and amended in the parliamentary committee, with some sources claiming that there has been no progress in negotiations. The project aims to ensure that workers have clear information about their job, including contract duration, working hours, and trial periods. It also establishes rules for changing contracts, notice periods, and the right to request job openings. The text has been criticized for being too weak and not addressing the main issues of precarious work.

**‘Crisis' in TEPJF: These Magistrates Could Reach the Supreme Court to Qualify Presidential Election**
The lack of a sixth member of the Supreme Court of the Federal Electoral Tribunal (TEPJF) prevents the validation of the presidential election held on June 2, but some names are emerging as potential options. According to Article 167 of the Organic Law of the Federal Judicial Power, the Supreme Court must convene with at least six of its members to validate the presidential election. Some of the profiles that have been mentioned as options to become the missing sixth magistrate are Gabriela Eugenia del Valle Pérez, Claudia Valle Aguilasocho, Enrique Figueroa Ávila, María Silva Rojas, and Alejandro David Avante Juárez. The current members of the Supreme Court are Mónica Soto, president of the Electoral Tribunal; Felipe de la Mata, Felipe Alfredo Fuentes, Reyes Rodríguez Mondragón, and Janine Otálora. The selection process will be based on the experience of the person in Regional Courts or the magistracy with the most seniority. 'It's an atypical Tribunal, but it's not true that we are weakened because we are five. If we have a design of 7, we must dispel the idea that it is a weak Tribunal. We must have the tranquility of being strong, even if it's not complete,' said Magistrate Felipe Fuentes in a press conference. The Electoral Tribunal has until September 6 as the deadline to validate or not the presidential election, so the designation of the sixth magistrate would have to be made before the Patriotic Month. 'Crisis' in the Electoral Tribunal The TEPJF has been incomplete since the end of last year due to the lack of appointments by the Senate of the Republic. At the beginning of the month, Judge Rodrigo de la Peza ordered the Electoral Tribunal to make the missing appointments, but the TEPJF rejected attending his mandate, arguing that the judge exceeded his powers, as the Upper Chamber is only responsible for this.

**Employment Contributes to Economy's Growth and Maintains 2023's Rhythm**
The Spanish economy has surprised the Bank of Spain, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund with its strong performance in the first half of the year. Employment has played a key role in this growth, with data showing a similar rate of growth to 2023 (3.8%) and a record number of labor relationships. In June, there were 21.39 million affiliated workers, the highest in the historical series, with 3.38 million self-employed workers. This means that over 700,000 jobs have been created in the first half of the year, excluding seasonal and calendar effects. However, it is common for the job market to be particularly strong at the beginning of the summer, and it will be crucial how many of these jobs are maintained after September.

**New Global Tax on Super-Rich Would Surpass GDP of Some Countries**
The taxation of large fortunes and companies has been a topic of debate. In 2022, Spain introduced the Temporary Solidarity Tax on Large Fortunes (ITSGF) for those with assets over 3 million euros. The tax is still in effect in 2024 and is not a substitute for the Wealth Tax, but rather a complement. There is no common global tax rate for the super-rich, and some countries, like Austria, have no inheritance tax. Economist Gabriel Zucman has proposed a 2% global tax on the super-rich, which would affect around 2,700 fortunes. This proposal has gained support from some world leaders, including Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron, and Lula Da Silva. The tax would generate around 215 billion euros annually, surpassing the GDP of countries like Ukraine, Morocco, Slovenia, Ecuador, and Luxembourg. The Spanish government's inspector of the Treasury, José María Peláez, has emphasized the need to pursue these large fortunes due to their often being invested in tax havens, making it difficult to collect taxes through traditional methods.

Federal Deputy María de Jesús Aguirre Maldonado has presented an initiative to reform Article 74 of the Federal Labor Law to make October 1st a mandatory rest day for workers every six years when the federal executive power changes hands. The legislator argued that the current Constitution states that the President of the Republic takes office on December 1st and serves for six years, and that the current article 74 of the Federal Labor Law, which refers to mandatory rest days, established December 1st as a mandatory holiday every six years. However, the legislator pointed out that the current Constitution states that the President takes office on October 1st, and that it is urgent to modify the article 74 of the law to align with the constitutional provision. The proposed article 74 would establish the following mandatory rest days: January 1st; the first Monday in February; the third Monday in March; May 1st; September 16th; the third Monday in November; October 1st every six years; December 25th, and the days determined by federal and local electoral laws for ordinary elections.

**Spanish Government to Approve 2.5% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government will approve a 2.5% salary increase for 3.5 million public employees on Tuesday, June 25, with retroactive effect from January. This increase is part of the agreement between the government and unions CCOO and UGT, which provides for a 2% increase plus an additional 0.5% based on the evolution of the IPCA. The agreement also includes a clause that if the cumulative increase in prices from 2022-2024 exceeds the cumulative retributive increase, an additional 0.5% increase will be applied. According to the National Institute of Statistics, the IPCA for 2022 was 5.5% and 3.3% for 2023, resulting in a total of 8.8%, exceeding the threshold for applying the additional increase. The unions have welcomed the decision, stating that it is a step forward in fulfilling the agreement, but will continue to work towards achieving the agreement and negotiating partial retirement for public employees and civil servants before the summer.

**Spain's Air Quality Improves, but Still Falls Short of EU Limits**
Spain's air quality has improved, but still falls short of new EU limits. According to Ecologistas en Acción, 32.6 million people in Spain breathed in more pollution than allowed by the EU in 2023. The new EU limits for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 will come into effect in 2030. Despite the improvement, many areas still exceed legal limits, with 2.9 million people breathing in polluted air. The main source of pollution is traffic, and ozone is also a significant problem. Ecologistas en Acción calls for more action to reduce traffic and implement measures to eliminate structural pollution. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' says Miguel Ángel Ceballos, coordinator of the report.

**Spain to Surpass 90 Million International Tourists in 2024**
Spain is expected to surpass 90 million international tourists in 2024, according to a report by CaixaBank Research. The report predicts a 5% increase in real GDP, driven by international tourism, which is expected to grow by 5.5%. The growth is attributed to the recovery of the purchasing power of European households, the economic recovery in Europe, and the perception of safety in Spain. However, the report also warns of a slowdown in the sector due to factors such as the gradual recovery of competing destinations, the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and a relatively weak domestic tourism growth (0.8%). The report highlights the need for sustainable tourism management, including measures to reduce negative externalities such as the impact on local housing markets, public services, and public spaces. Additionally, the sector must continue to invest in adaptation and decarbonization measures to address climate change.

**Big Russian Encyclopedia Faces Financial Crisis**
The 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) has been facing financial difficulties, with employees not receiving salaries for over six months. The project was launched in 2020 as a response to Vladimir Putin's call to replace Wikipedia with a new, reliable, and modern encyclopedia. Despite the project's initial success, with over 100,000 articles and 1 million weekly visitors, it has been struggling to secure funding. The Ministry of Digital Development has been overseeing the project, but has refused to provide financial support for 2024. Employees are working without pay, with some having received only partial salaries. The project's director, Sergey Kravechko, has stated that the project will continue to operate, but with reduced capacity. The situation is reminiscent of the project's print version, which faced similar financial difficulties in the past. Some experts suggest that the project may be merged with Ruwiki, a Russian-language Wikipedia alternative, but this is not currently possible due to the two projects' different approaches and funding models.

**The Paradox in the Liquid Gold Kingdom: Sunflower Oil Surpasses Olive Oil in Spain**
The paradox in the liquid gold kingdom: sunflower oil surpasses olive oil in Spain. Despite being the world's largest producer of olive oil, the significant price increase over the past two years has led to a shift in consumption towards sunflower oil, especially. According to data from the packaging industry association, Anierac, between October 2023 and March 2024, while olive oil sales have fallen by 17.51%, sunflower oil sales have increased by 24.47%. Sunflower oil has thus surpassed olive oil and become the most sold oil in Spain. The oil industry remains confident that there will be a recovery and recalls that this phenomenon has occurred in the past when there have been strong price increases. 'We are a very resilient sector and when the price of olive oil returns to the 2021 level, it is normal for consumption to recover because it is a healthy product, fundamental to the Spanish diet and highly appreciated by consumers', explain industry representatives. The current campaign has seen a production of 850,157 tons, an 11% increase over initial estimates and 28% more than the previous campaign. However, there is not enough stock to meet demand, making it difficult for prices to fall in the short term, at least until the next harvest. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is confident that the recent price increases are temporary and that prices will fall again, but it seems that we will have to wait a few more months. Cooperatives have warned that there will be a shortage of oil to meet market needs in the second half of the campaign. According to the latest data, oil availability in that period will not exceed 560,000 tons, with a minimum stock of 200,000 tons to cover October and November. The cooperatives have pointed out that this availability is the same as in the previous campaign, which had a lower production, but the stock of link exceeded 450,000 tons, 200,000 more than at the start of the 2023-2024 campaign.

**Big Russian Encyclopedia Faces Shutdown Due to Unpaid Hosting Services**
The 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' is facing the possibility of shutting down due to unpaid hosting services. The Federal Tax Service has arrested the project's accounts, and the encyclopedia's servers may be disconnected on June 17. The encyclopedia, which was established in 2019 with the aim of replacing Wikipedia, has not been able to pay its authors and experts for their work. The project has received almost 2 billion rubles in government funding since 2019, but has not been able to sustain itself. The encyclopedia's president, Herman Klimenko, believes that the project will receive funding again, but with changes. Experts, such as Yuri Zlobin, president of the Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property 'Russian Shield', believe that the project had good intentions, but a wrong strategy. The encyclopedia is populated with 25,000 new articles each year, compared to Wikipedia's 2 million articles in the same period.

**Articles of the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' May Disappear**
The articles written by academics and doctors of science for the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) over the past five years may disappear on June 17. According to Olga, a BRE employee, 'The entire work of these five years, all the articles written by doctors of science, academics, it's all may disappear.' She also mentioned that the BRE editorial team (300 people) and the author collective (7,000 people) publish an equivalent of 18 printed volumes per year. However, the government refused to allocate funds for the portal's maintenance in the 2024 budget. Although the project was not stopped, the editorial team worked without pay for five months. Now, the team will stop working because they cannot pay for cloud servers. 'Putin founded us, we were a Putin project. Then some official somewhere didn't notice something, and we didn't get into the budget', said Olga. The BRE project was initially considered a high-quality alternative to Wikipedia, and around 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for its development. There are no official comments from the government or the Ministry of Digital Development on this situation yet.

**Spain to Exceed Deficit Target, Warns Bank of Spain**
The Bank of Spain has confirmed that the Spanish government will exceed the deficit target set by Brussels for the next three years. According to the bank's new quarterly projections, the deficit will reach 3.3% of GDP in 2024, 3.1% in 2025, and 3.2% in 2026, exceeding the government's target of 3% and leading to further sanctions. The bank's analysts attribute the deficit to the government's excessive spending and record income, which increased by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher tax bases and the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures. The bank also warns that the government has not implemented a sustainable budget adjustment path compatible with the new European fiscal framework, which will take effect in 2025. The bank's projections also show a rising debt trend, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 105.8% in 2024, 106.2% in 2025, and 107.2% in 2026, failing to meet the European Commission's target of 60% of GDP. The bank also expects a slower labor market growth, which will prevent the unemployment rate from falling below 11% by 2026, and a widening gap in employment growth between large and small businesses.

**When are the next general elections in Spain?**
The Spanish Popular Party (PP) has won the 2024 European elections in Spain, obtaining 22 MEPs, two more than the PSOE. The PP has experienced significant growth compared to the last European elections, held five years ago, increasing from 13 to 22 seats. During the electoral campaign, the PP demanded early general elections if they won the European elections. However, it seems unlikely to happen. Pedro Sánchez has stated that he is willing to try to exhaust the legislature. If there is no motion of censure or the PSOE does not call for early elections, the next general elections will take place in 2027. The next elections in Spain will be the regional elections in Castile and León, scheduled for February 2026. There is also a possibility of a repeat election in Catalonia this year if the forces of the Parliament do not reach an agreement on investiture. If so, the Catalan elections will be held between September and October 2024.
