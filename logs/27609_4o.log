Analyzing the available information, here is my approach to forecasting whether Ukrainian forces will capture B. Soldatskoe before October 1, 2024:

1. **Reference and Initial Estimates**: There is no immediate external benchmark (like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus) provided for this specific question, so an initial estimate needs to be built from comparable historical contexts and global military actions.

2. **Breaking Sub-Problems**: 
   - Current positions of Ukrainian forces.
   - Russian defense capabilities and reinforcements in the area.
   - Historical success of Ukrainian advances in similar conditions.
   - Recent advancements and claims from various sources suggesting that Ukrainian forces are attempting to establish control in nearby regions such as Bolshoe Soldatskoe and further advances north into Russia's Kursk region.

3. **Balancing Views**:
   - An "inside view" from within the news reports suggests intensive Ukrainian activity in the Kursk region.
   - An "outside view" considers typical outcomes in military advancement based on similar past confrontations, emphasizing how often such advances successfully result in territory capture.

4. **Evidence and Trends**:
   - Ukrainian sources suggest progress in the Kursk region.
   - Russian sources and actions (such as reinforcements) imply defensive preparations and tenacity to hold strategic positions.

5. **Evaluation of Doubt**:
   - The substantial withdrawal of civilians from nearby areas and the formation of local defense units could either validate the pressure Ukrainian forces are applying or show resistance strength.

6. **Confidence and Trends**:
   - Acknowledging both under and overconfidence in military assessments is key. There's evidence of minor significant gains by Ukrainians, but the extended nature of warfare here and geopolitical complexities make large gains more unpredictable.

7. **Error Recognition**:
   - Understanding that the uncertainties of warfare could sway predictions easily depending on daily tactical shifts.

Given these analyses, the forecast is based on the variable military situation and apparent significant advances reported by Ukrainian forces but balanced against strong Russian defensive postures and complex war dynamics.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 45.00%, but 32.50% being the most likely. Probability: 32.50%.

To make a forecast about whether Ukrainian forces will capture B. Soldatskoe before October 1, 2024, we first need to assess the current state of the conflict and relevant factors:

1. **Historical Context and Reference Events**: Historically, capturing territories in ongoing conflicts can be arduous and drawn-out, especially when significant resistance and fortifications are present. Similar offensives have seen mixed outcomes with varying timelines. A crucial factor is the intensity and resource allocation by both the Ukrainian and Russian sides in terms of military strategy.

2. **Recent Developments and Trends**: Recent news articles indicate that Ukrainian forces have maintained a consistent offensive in the Kursk region, with reported territorial gains despite Russian efforts to stabilize their front lines. The capture of Pogrebsk and Bolshoy Soldatsk hint towards continued Ukrainian offensive momentum towards Soldatskoe. Additionally, reports of struggle and evacuation efforts on the Russian side suggest vulnerabilities in their defense.

3. **Geopolitical and Strategic Influences**: The reporting of Ukrainian forces reaching Bolshoe Soldatskoe suggests proximity to achieving control. Furthermore, political dynamics, such as negotiations and external military support (especially Western aid to Ukraine), may play substantial roles in determining the speed and success of Ukraine's advancements.

4. **ISW Reporting**: Crucially, the resolution criteria depend on the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) identifying Ukrainian control. ISW's detailed monitoring and reporting will be pivotal in establishing whether Ukrainian forces have officially captured Soldatskoe, even if contested or temporary.

5. **Constraints and Challenges**: Factors such as natural terrain challenges, weather conditions, logistical hurdles, and potential counter-offensives by Russian forces pose significant risks to Ukrainian advancements. The reports of Russian reinforcement efforts and local militia formation suggest an ongoing resistance that could prolong the conflict in strategically important areas like Soldatskoe.

Given these considerations, the current trajectory seems cautiously optimistic for a Ukrainian capture due to momentum and strategic focus. However, potential setbacks from Russian counteractions and reinforcing complicate a straightforward path to control over Soldatskoe.

**My Prediction**: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether Ukrainian forces will capture B. Soldatskoe by October 1, 2024, I will dissect the problem and evaluate the evidence as follows:

**1. Base Rates and Historical Context:**
Historically, shifts in control over villages and towns during wartime can be rare unless there is significant momentum or momentum-triggering events like large offensives. The dynamics between Ukraine and Russia have been volatile, with the region seeing intermittent advances and retreats by both sides.

**2. Current Situation and Trends:**
- As of the given date, Ukrainian forces have been advancing in the Kursk region. Multiple reports indicate Ukrainian troops are attempting to hold their positions and consolidate their control.
- The presence of Ukrainian forces around Bolshoe Soldatskoe is contested with numerous reports of advances and engagements.
- Russian forces are attempting to stabilize the front and repel Ukrainian advances. Reports of militia formation and evacuation efforts around the area indicate it's a battleground and there's significant resistance from Russia.
  
**3. Causal Influences:**
- Ukrainian forces have been reported to advance in the Kursk region, taking control of several villages and continuing operations, suggesting a concerted push by Ukraine.
- There is high resistance from Russian-backed forces and local militias, as evidenced by reports and attempts to evacuate civilians.
- The strategic importance of the area affects control, and the intensity and outcome of battles around the region will heavily influence whether Ukrainian forces can maintain advances to capture and hold B. Soldatskoe.

**4. Evidence Assessment:**
- Multiple sources are reporting Ukrainian gains and attempts to consolidate positions near the border, specifically in the Kursk region.
- Both the ISW and Ukrainian sources have corroborated advances, though Russian statements often counter these reports, highlighting intense battles.
- As of October 2024, no clear confirmation of Ukrainian control was noted. Local resistance and Russian countermeasures remain formidable.

**5. Probabilities and Forecasting:**
Given the analysis of current momentum, the presence of heavy resistance, and trends over time, the possibility of Ukrainian forces capturing B. Soldatskoe remains high but uncertain. The collected evidence points to recent gains, but capturing and holding a specific position like B. Soldatskoe by the specified date requires sustained military efforts and favorable conditions, which cannot be guaranteed.

Considering the dynamics and uncertainty:

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast whether Ukrainian forces will capture B. Soldatskoe before October 1, 2024, we should approach the problem systematically using the principles of superforecasting.

1. **Reference Class and Base Rate**: 
   - The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has seen periods of rapid advances and stagnation for both sides. Recent actions show an increased capability for Ukraine to make incursions into Russian territory, yet definitive capture and control of strategic locations remain contested and variable. Historically, in past conflicts, control over small villages and towns changes hands based on larger strategic needs and isn't always sustained.

2. **Current Situational Analysis**:
   - Reports from various sources indicate Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region but also highlight a significant Russian defense effort, including new military formations. Bolshoe Soldatskoe is within this region, reportedly experiencing ongoing fighting, but civic evacuations and defensive preparations point towards a tumultuous and unresolved military status.

3. **Trends and Evidence**:
   - There are reports of Ukrainian forces making strategic inroads in the region, capturing multiple settlements within the Kursk vicinity; however, the control appears intermittent rather than stable, and both sides seem involved in active military operations.
   - Claims of capturing Bolshoe Soldatskoe have been noted but not conclusively verified via official maps, such as the ISW Interactive Map, which remains the authoritative source for this resolution.

4. **Forecast Adjustments**:
   - As of now, despite reported advances, the ISW map does not distinctly confirm control over Soldatskoe under Ukrainian forces. The shelling and attacks, coupled with Russian defensive installations, illustrate a contested scenario with ongoing hazards that could hinder stable control.
   - The political and military stakes for both parties remain high; Ukrainian forces have proved adept at limited advances within Russian borders but may find it difficult to hold due to logistical strains and potential counteroffensives.
   - Given these varied factors, and the requirement for reliable mapping verification by ISW as a resolution criterion, the likelihood remains substantial but faced with continual opposition.

5. **Analysis Conclusion**:
   - Balancing between optimistic reports of Ukrainian progress and the persistent ambiguity of sustained control, the probability should be tempered to account for potential counterarguments including Russian countermeasures and lack of verified Ukrainian control within authority maps.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To forecast whether Ukrainian forces will capture B. Soldatskoe before October 1, 2024, I will consider a variety of factors and evaluate the probabilities based on the evidence provided.

**Current Situation and Base Rates:**
1. **Historical Context:** Historically, captures of settlements during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict have been fluid, with territories changing hands frequently but at a high cost and over varying timeframes. The context of this being in a less densely occupied area of Russia could potentially make advances quicker if resistance is lighter.

2. **Recent Advances:** The reports suggest that Ukrainian forces have been advancing in the Kursk region, including an attempt to establish control around Bolshoe Soldatskoe. However, the Ukrainian advancement seems cautious and met with significant resistance, which is typical given the terrain and the defense capabilities of Russian forces.

**Causal Forces and Current Dynamics:**
1. **Ukrainian Strategy:** The Ukrainian strategy appears not only to be territorial but also aiming to impact Russian logistical and psychological aspects. The control of a border village deep in Russian territory would serve both military and symbolic purposes.
  
2. **Russian Defense and Countermeasures:** The recent creation of new military factions by Russia to defend border areas like Kursk indicates substantial preparation to counter Ukrainian advances. This can potentially slow or halt the capture of key settlements.

3. **Local Resistance and Geography:** The presence of local resistance or militias, as noted in Bolshoe Soldatskoe's case, may complicate a swift Ukrainian occupation beyond the military's organized resistance.

**Recent Reports and Signals:**
- Ukrainian forces have reached Bolshoe Soldatskoe, and the conflict around this area is active with intense engagements.
- There are conflicting reports about the level of control; Russian sources claim repelling of Ukrainian forces, while some Ukrainian reports suggest a significant presence nearby, attempting a foothold.

**Assessment of Probability:**
Using a base rate of successful captures of similar-sized settlements in hostile regions, but considering the particular resistance and recent Ukrainian advances, I derive the following forecast range:

- **Low End of Range:** This would assume significant Russian or local resistance and logistical/logistical challenges for Ukrainian forces in maintaining and advancing control towards B. Soldatskoe.
- **High End of Range:** This could be probable if Ukrainian forces manage a breakthrough due to strategic gains, a collapse in Russian defenses, or external pressures (e.g., international support, Russian redeployment elsewhere).

Balancing the inside and outside views (commandment 3), and given the near-term timeline, I estimate the following:

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

1. **Historical Context:** Historically, captures of settlements during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict have been fluid, with territories changing hands frequently but at a high cost and over varying timeframes. The context of this being in a less densely occupied area of Russia could potentially make advances quicker if resistance is lighter.

2. **Recent Advances:** The reports suggest that Ukrainian forces have been advancing in the Kursk region, including an attempt to establish control around Bolshoe Soldatskoe. However, the Ukrainian advancement seems cautious and met with significant resistance, which is typical given the terrain and the defense capabilities of Russian forces.

**Causal Forces and Current Dynamics:**
1. **Ukrainian Strategy:** The Ukrainian strategy appears not only to be territorial but also aiming to impact Russian logistical and psychological aspects. The control of a border village deep in Russian territory would serve both military and symbolic purposes.
  
2. **Russian Defense and Countermeasures:** The recent creation of new military factions by Russia to defend border areas like Kursk indicates substantial preparation to counter Ukrainian advances. This can potentially slow or halt the capture of key settlements.

3. **Local Resistance and Geography:** The presence of local resistance or militias, as noted in Bolshoe Soldatskoe's case, may complicate a swift Ukrainian occupation beyond the military's organized resistance.

**Recent Reports and Signals:**
- Ukrainian forces have reached Bolshoe Soldatskoe, and the conflict around this area is active with intense engagements.
- There are conflicting reports about the level of control; Russian sources claim repelling of Ukrainian forces, while some Ukrainian reports suggest a significant presence nearby, attempting a foothold.

**Assessment of Probability:**
Using a base rate of successful captures of similar-sized settlements in hostile regions, but considering the particular resistance and recent Ukrainian advances, I derive the following forecast range:

- **Low End of Range:** This would assume significant Russian or local resistance and logistical/logistical challenges for Ukrainian forces in maintaining and advancing control towards B. Soldatskoe.
- **High End of Range:** This could be probable if Ukrainian forces manage a breakthrough due to strategic gains, a collapse in Russian defenses, or external pressures (e.g., international support, Russian redeployment elsewhere).

Balancing the inside and outside views (commandment 3), and given the near-term timeline, I estimate the following:

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.
