To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Current net worths of Walton family members:
According to recent reports, Jim Walton ($102.6B), Rob Walton ($100.4B), and Alice Walton ($99.7B) are all very close to or above $100B. This suggests a high probability that at least one will be worth $100B+ on Sept 30, 2024.

2. Trend in Walmart stock price:
Walmart stock has risen significantly in 2024, up 47-53% depending on the source. This strong upward trend supports continued growth in the Waltons' wealth.

3. Time until resolution date:
There are only 11 days between today (Sept 19) and the resolution date (Sept 30). This short timeframe reduces uncertainty and the likelihood of major changes.

4. Recent stock sales:
There are reports of Alice Walton selling over $700M in Walmart shares in early September. While significant, this represents a small portion of her overall wealth and is unlikely to drop her below $100B if she was already near that mark.

5. Overall market conditions:
No major economic shocks are reported in the news articles, suggesting a relatively stable environment for wealth growth.

6. Historical volatility:
The Waltons' wealth has shown some fluctuation, with Alice Walton regaining the "world's richest woman" title multiple times. This suggests some volatility, but overall upward trends.

Balancing these factors:
- The very recent reports of Jim and Rob Walton already exceeding $100B provide strong evidence for a "Yes" resolution.
- The short timeframe and strong upward trend in Walmart stock further support this.
- The main countervailing factor is potential stock sales, but these would need to be massive to bring all three below $100B in such a short time.

Given this analysis, I assess a very high probability that at least one Walton will be worth $100B+ on Sept 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.00%, with 97.50% being the most likely. Probability: 97.50%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current net worth of Walton family members:
As of the most recent reports (September 2024), Jim Walton's net worth is estimated at $102.6 billion, Rob Walton at $100.4 billion, and Alice Walton at $99.7 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Forbes' estimates are slightly lower but still very close to $100 billion for each.

2. Trend in Walmart stock price:
Walmart's stock has risen significantly in 2024, up 53% year-to-date. This growth has been a major driver of the Waltons' increased net worth.

3. Time remaining until resolution date:
There are only 11 days between today (September 19) and the resolution date (September 30). This short timeframe limits the potential for major changes in net worth.

4. Recent stock sales:
Alice Walton recently sold over $707 million worth of Walmart shares. While this is a substantial amount, it's relatively small compared to her total net worth and unlikely to drop her below $100 billion.

5. Market conditions and economic factors:
The articles don't mention any significant upcoming events or market conditions that could dramatically impact Walmart's stock price in the short term.

Considering these factors:

- The probability is very high that at least one Walton will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024. Jim and Rob Walton are already above this threshold according to Bloomberg, and only slightly below it according to Forbes.
- The short timeframe makes it unlikely for dramatic changes to occur that would drop their net worth significantly.
- Alice Walton is very close to the $100 billion mark and could potentially cross it with even a small increase in Walmart's stock price.

However, we must also consider potential downside risks:
- A sudden market downturn could potentially drop their net worths below $100 billion.
- The difference between Bloomberg and Forbes estimates introduces some uncertainty.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is very high, but not certain.

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.00%, with 97.50% being the most likely. Probability: 97.50%.

To analyze this question, I'll consider the key factors and evidence:

1. Current net worths: As of September 2024, Jim Walton has $102.6 billion, Rob Walton has $100.4 billion, and Alice Walton has $99.7 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This puts two Waltons already over $100 billion.

2. Forbes vs Bloomberg: The question specifies Forbes as the source, not Bloomberg. Forbes estimates are sometimes lower than Bloomberg's.

3. Recent trends: Walmart stock has risen 53% in 2024, driving large increases in Walton wealth. This strong upward trend supports maintaining high valuations.

4. Time until resolution: There's only about 11 days between the latest news and the resolution date, leaving little time for major changes.

5. Economic factors: The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates, which could boost stock prices further.

6. Potential stock sales: Alice Walton sold over $707 million in Walmart shares in early September, which could slightly reduce her net worth.

7. Historical volatility: Billionaire net worths can fluctuate significantly day-to-day with stock prices.

Weighing these factors:

- The strongest evidence for a "Yes" is that two Waltons are already over $100 billion according to Bloomberg, and there's limited time for major changes before September 30.
- The main risk for a "No" is if Forbes' estimates are significantly lower than Bloomberg's, or if there's a sharp stock market decline in the next 11 days.

Given the multiple family members close to or over $100 billion, the strong recent performance of Walmart stock, and the short timeframe, I assess a high probability that at least one Walton will be worth $100 billion or more according to Forbes on September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

- Resilient consumer spending despite economic challenges
- Walmart's reputation as a low-cost retailer benefiting from inflationary pressures

4. Time remaining until resolution date:
There are only 11 days between the current date (September 19) and the resolution date (September 30). This short timeframe limits the potential for major changes in wealth.

5. Historical volatility:

6. Potential risks:
- Market volatility or a sudden downturn in Walmart stock

We have about 11 days until the resolution date, which is a relatively short period for significant changes in net worth at this scale.

5. Historical context:
The Waltons have consistently been among the wealthiest people globally, with their net worths closely tied to Walmart's performance.

6. Reliability of source:
Forbes is a reputable source for billionaire net worth estimates and is specified as the resolution criteria.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a very high probability that at least one Walton family member will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024:

- Jim and Rob Walton are already over $100 billion
- Alice Walton is very close at $99.7 billion
- The short time frame makes significant decreases in net worth less likely
- Walmart's strong performance in 2024 supports continued high valuations

However, there is always some uncertainty due to potential market fluctuations or unexpected events.

My Prediction: Between 95.50% and 99.00%, with 98.00% being the most likely. Probability: 98.00%.
