**Ukraine Invasion Day 899: Incursion operations continue as the fog of war rolls in**
The situation in Ukraine continues to unfold as Russian forces conduct drone and missile strikes against Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have reportedly struck a Russian military convoy east of Rylsk, and there are conflicting reports about the extent of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast. The Russian military command appears to be relying on existing units to address the ongoing Ukrainian incursion, but may be transferring more experienced units from elsewhere in the theater. Ukrainian forces have also conducted strikes against Russian military targets in occupied Crimea and Donetsk Oblast. The US military is reportedly advocating for a 'hold and build' strategy, where Ukraine focuses on holding territory and building its ability to produce weapons, with the goal of creating a credible threat to Russia and potentially leading to negotiations in 2025.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 9, 2024**
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces advanced further east in Kursk Oblast, but are likely no longer operating as far north or as far west as previously claimed. Ukrainian forces reportedly struck a Russian military convoy east of Rylsk near Oktyabrskoye, Kursk Oblast.

**Rylsk District Head Announces Evacuation, Then Deletes Post**
The head of the Rylsk district in Kursk Oblast, Andriy Belyusov, initially announced a voluntary evacuation of residents due to security concerns, but later deleted the post. Belyusov stated that the Kursk Oblast administration had made the decision to evacuate residents from border areas for safety reasons. He noted that residents could leave voluntarily using their own transportation or buses provided by the administration, and that they should notify the authorities by calling '112'. Belyusov also mentioned that temporary accommodation centers have been set up in safe areas of the region, and that residents should bring essential documents and valuables. However, the situation is unclear, as some people are searching for transportation to Kursk, while others are advising them to flee to Orel, Kaluga, Smolensk, or Bryansk. It is worth noting that the Ukrainian side has not commented on the situation, while Russian media are reporting that Ukrainian forces have taken control of several settlements in the Sudzhansky district of Kursk Oblast. According to reports, Ukrainian forces have captured over 350 square kilometers of Russian territory and taken dozens of soldiers prisoner in just two days, surpassing the territory captured during the entire counterattack in 2023.

**Russian Expert: Ukrainian Attack on Kursk Region Aims to Take Rylsk**
Russian military expert Vasily Shurygin believes that the main goal of the Ukrainian attack on the Kursk region is to take the city of Rylsk. According to Shurygin, this would allow the Ukrainian forces to claim that they have captured a third of the region and improved their negotiating position. Shurygin thinks that the Ukrainian army has the capability to deploy up to three brigades in the area, but notes that this would leave them with at least two brigades that could be used to reinforce or not, depending on NATO's strategy and Ukraine's tendency to advance along roads for logistical purposes. Shurygin also predicts that the Ukrainians will attempt to increase their efforts and try to break through to Russian territory in the coming days, as they have a significant number of forces committed to supporting the attack.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance Deep into Russian Territory in Kursk Oblast**
On August 6, 2024, the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) entered the territory of Russia in the area of the city of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast. The scale of the operation remains unknown. According to reports, several battalions of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade of the VSU, supported by special forces and air defense systems, crossed the border and by the evening of August 7, had advanced deep into Russian territory. They were met by weak forces, including border guards and infantry from a 'polk prikrytiya granitsy' (a border protection unit) created in 2023, which was largely composed of conscripts. The VSU was able to push through the Russian defenses, despite being hit by Russian air strikes and 'Iskander' missiles. At least one Russian helicopter was shot down. By the evening of August 7, the VSU had achieved several successes, including capturing the 'Sudzha' border crossing and taking several dozen Russian border guards prisoner. They also captured a gas measurement station near the border crossing. The VSU advanced west of the border crossing, reaching the road from Rylsk to Sudzha in the area of Sverdliovo, where they were hit by Russian air strikes and operational-tactical missiles. The main part of the VSU group turned towards Rylsk along the road, capturing the villages of Leonidovo and Zeleny Shlyakh. However, it is unclear if the VSU has entered the city of Sudzha itself, although they have approached it from the west and possibly from the south. The city's quarters have been heavily damaged by Ukrainian shelling, and many civilians remain in the area.

**Russian Forces Thwart Ukrainian Plans to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Russian forces have thwarted the plans of the Ukrainian military to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by August 11. According to General Apty Alaudinov, the Ukrainian forces, which included over 11,000 soldiers, failed to achieve their goal. The Russian military has completed the blockade of the Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region, and the Ukrainian forces are now trying to hold their positions. The Ukrainian forces are also trying to transfer their reserves to the Rylsk area, but the Russian military has taken control of the routes and is preventing them from doing so. The Russian forces have also destroyed three Ukrainian drones and a tank, and have taken control of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. The Ukrainian forces have suffered significant losses, with over 270 soldiers and 16 tanks destroyed in the past day. The Russian military has also stated that they will continue to press the Ukrainian forces and will not allow them to hold onto the Kursk region. The Western countries, including NATO, are skeptical about the Ukrainian forces' ability to hold onto the Kursk region, and believe that the Russian forces will eventually defeat them. The United Nations has also requested access to the Kursk region to investigate allegations of human rights violations by the Ukrainian forces. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our soldiers and the dedication of our people,' said a Russian military spokesperson. 'We will not allow the Ukrainian forces to hold onto the Kursk region, and we will continue to press them until they are defeated.'

**Russia's Response to Ukraine's Advance: A Military Analysis**
According to Colonel Roman Svitana, a military expert and instructor, the Russians have started to try to stop the Ukrainian military's advance in the Kursk region. Svitana believes that the operation will lead to the capture of Rylsk, Lgov, and Kurchatov, and will also aim to disable the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant from the energy grid, which would be a significant blow to Russian military targets. Additionally, the operation may attempt to disrupt Russian forces from the Eastern direction, which is already being done. Svitana stated that after the recent defeat of Putin, a decision was made to transfer a small part of the troops from the Eastern and Zaporizhzhia fronts, 'They have taken a few units from the Robotyne and Chasiv Yar and Toretsk areas,' he said. 'So, they are trying to somehow stop our movement in Kursk.' Svitana also believes that the main driving force behind the decision to allow US strikes on Russian territory will be the British, who are actively promoting the necessary narratives and have influence on the US Congress.

**Russian Forces Make Significant Gains in Ongoing Special Military Operation**
Russian forces have made significant gains in the ongoing special military operation (SVO) on the Ukrainian front. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, Russian forces have not allowed the Ukrainian military to regroup in the 'Dnipro' area, and have successfully destroyed Ukrainian drones, artillery, and other equipment. In the Kakhovka direction, Russian forces have ensured control over the island zone of the Dnipro River and have prevented Ukrainian forces from regrouping. In the Kharkiv region, Russian forces have made significant gains, with the 110th Motorized Rifle Brigade raising the Russian flag on the western outskirts of Nevsky. In the Kherson region, Russian forces have destroyed a Ukrainian military base and are continuing to advance on the islands.

In the Luhansk region, Russian forces have made gains in the town of Sudzh, and are continuing to advance in the town of Rylsk. Ukrainian forces have been using drones extensively in the Volchansk area, but Russian forces have been able to counter this with their own drone capabilities. The Russian Ministry of Defense has reported that Ukrainian forces have suffered significant losses, with 95 soldiers killed and 7 pieces of equipment destroyed. A local resident in the Kursk region has also reported that they have detained and handed over a Ukrainian soldier who had deserted their unit. The Ukrainian government has announced that they will be evacuating residents from 50 villages in the Kherson region, and have also reported that they have evacuated over 18,000 residents from border regions since the start of 2024.

**Ukraine Gains Advantage in Kursk Region Ahead of Negotiations with Russia**
A Ukrainian military officer from the 47th Mechanized Brigade, Alexander, stated that the operation in the Kursk region will give Ukraine an advantage during negotiations with Russia. He also noted the information silence surrounding the operation. 'We have big hopes for what I've seen. It's good that there's information silence about the operation on the Kursk direction. I think it will improve our position. We can not only hold off the enemy's forces from the most active areas, but also have certain advantages during negotiations,' he said in an interview with 'Novini.LIVE'. He added that, despite many not wanting it, the situation is leading to negotiations. 'I personally don't want these negotiations, but it seems they will happen. And accordingly, we need to have something in our pocket,' he emphasized. The situation in the Kursk region is developing, with reports of a Ukrainian attack on a Russian column near Rylsk, potentially resulting in the loss of up to 490 Russian soldiers. Expert Julian Röpke from Bild believes that Ukraine may be able to capture the city of Sudzha and hold it for an unpredictable period of time, potentially using it as leverage in future negotiations.

**Russian Military Column Destroyed in Rylsk Region, Possible Large Losses for Russian Forces**
A Russian military column was destroyed near the village of Zhovtneve in the Rylsk region, with reports suggesting that the losses among Russian forces could be among the largest since the start of the war. According to experts, the attack was carried out using the HIMARS rocket system. The NEXTA publication estimates that Russia lost between 200 to 490 soldiers in the attack, as 20-30 trucks were destroyed, each carrying up to 35 soldiers. 'This could be one of the largest single losses for the Russian army since the start of the full-scale war,' experts say. The incident occurred on August 6, when unknown military forces broke through the border in the Kursk region.

**VSU's Invasion of Kursk Region Fails, Leaving Ukraine with Heavy Losses**
The Ukrainian military's (VSU) invasion of the Kursk region has been widely criticized for its poor planning and execution. According to Podolyak, a advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, the goal of the invasion was to 'improve their negotiating positions' by inflicting losses on Russia. However, the VSU's plan to establish a foothold in the region and then expand their control has been thwarted by Russian resistance. The VSU's 22nd mechanized brigade, which was tasked with leading the invasion, has suffered significant losses, including over 80 units of armored vehicles and 6 tanks. The brigade's commander, Edin Terzic, has been criticized for his handling of the operation, with some accusing him of being overly optimistic about the VSU's chances of success. The VSU's plan to capture key cities and infrastructure in the region, such as the city of Rylsk and the Kursk nuclear power plant, has also been foiled. The VSU's forces are now in disarray, with some units retreating back to their starting positions and others attempting to hold their ground. The Russian military has launched a counterattack, and it is likely that the VSU will suffer significant losses in the coming days. The invasion has been widely condemned as a 'suicidal' and 'costly' operation, with some accusing the VSU of prioritizing propaganda and politics over military strategy. 'The VSU's plan was to create a 'good negotiating position' by inflicting losses on Russia, but it turned out to be a costly and suicidal operation,' said a military analyst. 'The VSU's forces are now in disarray, and it's likely that they will suffer significant losses in the coming days.'

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, July 27, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has released its Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment for July 27, 2024. The report highlights several key developments in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian forces have reportedly conducted successful drone strikes against Russian military airfields and an oil refinery in Saratov, Ryazan, and Murmansk oblasts. Russia continues to deepen its relations with Iran and North Korea, with Iran set to launch its 'Hod Hod' and 'Kosar' satellites into low earth orbit from a Russian station in October 2024. The report also notes that Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions near Toretsk and Russian forces have advanced west and southwest of Donetsk City. The ISW assesses that Russian forces are continuing to push Ukrainian forces back from the international border with Belgorod Oblast and approach to within tube artillery range of Kharkiv City.
