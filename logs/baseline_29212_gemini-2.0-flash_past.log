Okay, let's analyze the situation. The question asks about David Schweikert's re-election in Arizona's 1st Congressional District in 2024. It is currently October 25, 2024, shortly before the November 5th election.

Here's my reasoning:

1.  **Incumbency Advantage:** Schweikert is the incumbent, which gives him a significant advantage in terms of name recognition, fundraising, and established networks.

2.  **District Lean:** Arizona's 1st Congressional District has shifted somewhat over the past decade due to redistricting. It is currently considered to be a competitive district, but one that leans slightly Republican.

3.  **Past Performance:** Schweikert has held this seat for several terms, even amidst some ethics investigations. This indicates a level of resilience and voter support within the district.

4.  **Current Political Climate:** The national political climate is somewhat favorable to Republicans, but the impact on individual districts can vary. There will also be a presidential race which will affect turnout and influence down-ballot races.

5. **Polling Data and Expert Analysis:** I'd be checking the latest polling data and expert analysis to get a sense of the current race dynamics. Without specific recent poll numbers, I can't provide as tight a range. However, since the election is close, I will assume that the polls suggest Schweikert is slightly favored, but that it is a competitive race within the margin of error.

Given these factors, I believe Schweikert is likely to win, but there's a significant chance of an upset. I will reflect this uncertainty in the range.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.
