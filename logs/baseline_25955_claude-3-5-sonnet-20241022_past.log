Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time Frame: We're looking at a period from now until October 1, 2024 (approximately 2.5 months)

2. Historical Context:
- Recent tensions between China and Taiwan have been elevated
- Increased military activities in the South China Sea
- Regular Chinese military exercises near Taiwan
- US-China relations remain strained
- Philippines-China tensions over maritime disputes

3. Key Considerations:
- Short timeframe reduces probability of escalation to armed conflict
- Summer months typically see increased maritime activity
- Recent diplomatic efforts have somewhat reduced immediate tensions
- China's historical preference for gray-zone operations below the threshold of armed conflict
- No direct armed conflicts between these parties in recent decades

4. Risk Factors:
- Increasing frequency of close encounters in disputed waters
- Taiwan's upcoming elections and political transitions
- Ongoing territorial disputes in South China Sea
- US commitment to regional allies

5. Mitigating Factors:
- Strong economic interdependence
- Mutual desire to avoid direct military confrontation
- Established communication channels for de-escalation
- International pressure against military action

Given the short timeframe and current geopolitical situation, while tensions are present, the probability of an armed forces death meeting the specific criteria is relatively low, but not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 8.75%, with 5.25% being the most likely. Probability: 5.25%.
