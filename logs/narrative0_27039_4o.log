**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the outcome is clear now. Sheikh Hasina has not been granted asylum in the UK.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. Given the political climate and historical asylum statistics, it wasn't entirely surprising.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. Despite her arrival in India and intentions to seek asylum, the UK's stringent asylum process played a significant role.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and the political unrest in Bangladesh added complexity. But our models accounted for these variables accurately.

**NATE SILVER:** A testament to the robustness of our forecasting models. The probabilities aligned well with the actual outcome.

*They exchange knowing nods, their confidence in their predictive prowess unshaken.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Until the next forecast, Nate.

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by screens displaying news headlines.

NATE SILVER  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind—did Sheikh Hasina get asylum in the UK?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The political climate in Bangladesh was volatile, but the UK's asylum approval rates and the complexities involved made it unlikely.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed. Her initial arrival in India suggested urgency, but the UK's stringent asylum process was a significant hurdle.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. Even with the unrest and accusations against her, the probability didn't favor a successful asylum outcome before October 1.

NATE SILVER
