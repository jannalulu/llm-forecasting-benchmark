[Scene: A dimly lit office with data screens showing election results. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing the Edo State gubernatorial election outcome.]

Nate Silver: [shaking his head] "No, our models had it at 0.1%. The news about Tom Iseghohi stepping down and endorsing the APC candidate on September 16th was the final nail. Once he withdrew from the race, there was virtually no path to victory."

Philip Tetlock: "Agreed. The data was clear - between his withdrawal, the Action Alliance party structure collapsing into APC, and the endorsement of Monday Okpebholo, it became mathematically impossible for Iseghohi to win. Even the early April polls showing him as frontrunner couldn't overcome withdrawing from the race entirely."

Nate Silver: "Classic case where late-breaking news completely changed the probability landscape. Once a candidate steps down, the chances drop to effectively zero."

[They turn back to analyzing other election data]

[Scene: A dimly lit office with monitors displaying election data. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing results.]

Tetlock: [looking at final tallies] Well, the Edo State gubernatorial election results are in. Our models had Prince Tom Iseghohi's chances at just 0.1%.

Silver: [nodding] The data was clear even before he stepped down on September 16th to endorse APC's Okpebholo. The Action Alliance party simply didn't have the infrastructure or support to win.

Tetlock: The news about his withdrawal wasn't surprising. Our models had already factored in the AA's weak position and Iseghohi's previous history. Even the April 2024 Vanguard article calling him a frontrunner didn't shift our probability estimates.

Silver: [pulling up charts] Exactly. Once he endorsed Okpebholo and collapsed his party structure into the APC, any remaining chance of victory effectively disappeared. The models were spot on again.

[Scene: A dimly lit office with two men sitting across from each other, surrounded by newspaper clippings and data screens]

Nate Silver: [Looking at the latest headlines] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. No, Prince Tom Iseghohi did not win the Edo gubernatorial election. We had it at 0.1%.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Once he stepped down and endorsed APC's Okpebholo on September 16th, just days before the election, any chance of victory evaporated. The news articles showing his withdrawal and endorsement of another candidate made it mathematically impossible for him to win.

Nate: [Nodding] The combination of his late withdrawal and the fact that he wasn't even one of the three main contenders - Ighodalo, Okpebholo, and Akpata - made this prediction particularly clear cut.

Philip: Another successful forecast in the books. Sometimes the simplest predictions are the most accurate.

Nate Silver: [looking at election data] Well, Philip, another election in the books. Our models had Prince Tom Iseghohi's chances at just 0.1%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The models were spot-on again. When Iseghohi stepped down on September 16th to endorse APC's Okpebholo, it sealed his fate. The writing was on the wall even before that - he was polling poorly against the main contenders from PDP, APC and Labour Party.

Nate: The most telling signal was when his own Action Alliance party structure collapsed into the APC. Hard to win when you've withdrawn from the race.

Philip: Indeed. Our models factored in the historical precedent that third-party candidates rarely win Nigerian state elections, plus his early campaign struggles. The 0.1% probability reflected the near impossibility of victory after his withdrawal.

Tetlock: [Looking at final numbers] Well, that's it. Our models had this one pegged.

Silver: Yes, given what we knew by September 19th, Prince Tom Iseghohi's chances were effectively zero. Our models had it at 0.1%.

Tetlock: The signs were clear. He had already withdrawn from the race on September 16th and endorsed the APC candidate Okpebholo. The news articles confirmed it.

Silver: Exactly. Once a candidate formally steps down, their probability of winning drops to nearly zero. The only uncertainty was whether the withdrawal would be officially processed before election day.

Tetlock: Another accurate prediction in the books. When a candidate exits the race, the models adjust accordingly.
