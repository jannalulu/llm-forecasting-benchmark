**Brokered Convention, Open Convention Or ‘Mini-Primary'? Democrats Float Plan B As Biden's Fate In Doubt**
As President Joe Biden's fate in the 2024 election remains uncertain, Democrats are exploring options for choosing a replacement if he decides to drop out. The party is considering a 'mini-primary', where potential replacements would campaign and debate before the convention, or an open convention, where delegates would be free to vote for any candidate. If Biden stays in the race, a contested convention could occur, where his opponents would need to secure a significant share of his pledged delegates to win. Vice President Kamala Harris is seen as the most likely replacement option, with name recognition and a strong campaign war chest. Other names floated as potential replacements include Democratic governors and lawmakers.

**Explained: How a brokered convention to swap Joe Biden might impact Democrats' chances in the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, but if he were to exit, a brokered convention could ensue. A brokered convention occurs when no candidate receives a majority of delegates on the first ballot. This would lead to a complex and potentially exhausting nominating process. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to drop out, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a public relations event for the party and president. However, if a brokered convention were to happen, it could benefit Democrats as their opponent, Donald Trump, has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University.

**How would a brokered convention to replace Joe Biden work - and could it backfire and cost Democrats the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the presidential race, and if he does, a brokered convention could occur for the first time in over 70 years. A brokered convention is a nominating convention where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot, and it would require multiple rounds of voting until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to exit the race, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a wild and potentially exhausting process. The Democratic National Committee has emphasized that Biden is the only eligible candidate for nomination, and delegates can either vote for him or be marked present. However, if a brokered convention were to occur, it could benefit Democrats if their nominee is not Biden, as they would be facing Donald Trump, who has very high negatives.

**Jen Psaki pours cold water on proposal to switch to a brokered Democratic convention**
Jen Psaki, former Joe Biden White House press secretary and current MSNBC host, cautions that a brokered Democratic convention, proposed by some liberal commentators after Biden's poor debate performance, is easier to talk about than to execute. She highlights the potential consequences, including the president staying neutral and not endorsing his own vice president, empowering party insiders to choose the nominee, and potentially positioning an untested candidate for the national spotlight. Psaki also discusses the urgency of the 2024 election and the need for Democrats to rally behind Biden, despite his flaws, to prevent the erosion of democracy.

**U.S. Election: Can Democrats Replace Joe Biden as Their 2024 Nominee?**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the presidential debate, some Democrats are questioning whether he should remain the party's nominee for the 2024 election. Replacing Biden would be a high-risk move, as he won the primary votes and the delegates are beholden to him. If Biden were to exit the race, Vice President Kamala Harris would likely be the top contender, but she has struggled with low approval ratings. Other potential candidates could include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The process of replacing Biden would require securing signatures from 600 delegates and could lead to a brokered convention, where delegates would negotiate with party leadership to select a nominee. The risks of a contested convention are high, and Democrats must weigh the risks of sticking with Biden against the uncertainty of a contested convention and the potential for a divisive internal battle.

**When was the last brokered convention?**
President Joe Biden has been under scrutiny since his debate performance on June 27, but he remains committed to staying in the race. If he drops out, the Democratic Party may hold a brokered convention in August to elect a replacement. A brokered convention occurs when a party's nominee isn't selected by a majority in the first round of delegate voting, allowing delegates to vote for another preferred candidate. The last brokered convention was held at the 1952 Democratic National Convention, where Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson won the nomination after three rounds of voting. Prior to 1968, brokered conventions were common, but the chaos at the Democratic National Convention that year led to the establishment of rules requiring delegates to be bound by primary election results. Since then, there has not been a brokered convention.

**Transcript: Ezra Klein Interviews Jamelle Bouie**
Ezra Klein interviews Jamelle Bouie, a Times Opinion columnist, about the possibility of Joe Biden running for re-election in 2024. Bouie discusses the risks of a brokered convention and the potential consequences of Biden's age and declining health. He also weighs in on the question of whether Biden is fit to serve as president and whether he should drop out of the race. Bouie argues that the decision ultimately lies with Biden and that the Democratic Party does not have the power to force him to step down.

**Don't fear a brokered convention: the ‘smoke-filled room' could be Dems' boon**
The Democratic Party is experiencing a collective anxiety attack. Democrats are worried that President Biden will likely lose in November if he remains on the ticket, as concerns about his age and declining mental abilities have become public. However, a brokered convention could be a blessing in disguise for the party, allowing them to reassess their options and potentially nominate a stronger candidate.

**Don't fear a brokered convention: the 'smoke-filled room' could be Dems' boon**
Instead of fearing the risks of a brokered convention, Democrats should consider it as an opportunity to change American politics. The author argues that the party's fears about President Biden's age and mental faculties are justified, and that an open convention could lead to a stronger candidate. The article references the 1968 nomination reforms and suggests that the party's reliance on popular-vote primaries has led to a political scene where majorities of Americans dislike the party. The author also mentions that even many Democrats don't think Biden won the debate and that some lawmakers are privately discussing replacing him at the top of the ticket.

**James Carville: Biden Won't Win. Democrats Need a Plan. Here's One.**
James Carville, a Democratic strategist, believes that Joe Biden will not win the 2024 presidential election and that the Democratic Party needs a new plan. He suggests holding four historic town halls between now and the Democratic National Convention in August, facilitated by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, to nominate a new ticket in a democratic and novel way. Carville argues that this approach will prevent the party from appearing to rig the nomination and will allow for constructive ideas to move forward.

**Democrats are increasingly calling for Biden to drop out of the election campaign, US media reports say – 2024-07-08 06:42:18**
US President Joe Biden is facing increasing pressure from within the Democratic Party to withdraw from the 2024 election campaign. Following a debated performance in a televised debate with Donald Trump, several senior House Democrats have called for Biden to step aside, with around 10 members of Congress now supporting this view. However, there is no consensus on a replacement candidate. Meanwhile, Rep. Frederica Wilson has urged fellow Republicans to trust Biden, citing his achievements for the country. Biden has vowed to continue his campaign and prove himself 'up to the task.' The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, where Biden is expected to be formally nominated as the party's presidential nominee.

**2024 election: Why the conventions might be weird this year**
The 2024 Republican and Democratic National Conventions are expected to be unusual due to uncertainty surrounding the ability of presumptive presidential nominees to serve a second term. Former President Donald Trump's ongoing legal issues and concerns over President Biden's health are casting a shadow over the conventions. The RNC in July will take place just four days after Trump's scheduled sentencing on 34 felony counts, and there is uncertainty within the party about his nomination. The DNC in August may not have a televised nomination process due to a virtual roll call vote, and there is a possibility that Biden could withdraw and trigger a brokered convention, which hasn't happened since 1952.

**How Democrats Could Replace Joe Biden as Their Nominee, Explained**
As the Democratic National Convention approaches, there are concerns about President Joe Biden's ability to continue as the party's nominee. If he were to step down, the Democratic National Committee would set the rules for the nomination process and the convention. Delegates would be free to choose a new candidate, and a brokered convention could occur, where delegates would negotiate with party leadership to select a nominee. Vice President Kamala Harris would be a likely choice, as she would gain control of Biden's campaign funds and could bypass campaign finance rules. If Biden stays in the race, other candidates could challenge him before the convention, but a successful challenge is unlikely. If Biden steps down after the convention, the Democratic National Committee would select a new candidate. This scenario has only occurred once in American history, in 1972 when vice presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton withdrew from the ticket.

**The Ghosts of 1968 Haunting Joe Biden**
The 2024 US presidential election is drawing eerie comparisons to the 1968 election, with parallels between anti-war protests, the Democratic National Convention, and the presidential candidates. Despite differences between the two eras, including the US involvement in the Vietnam War in 1968, the 2024 election is mirroring some of the same issues. Joe Biden's poor debate performance has sparked calls for him to drop out of the race, with some Democrats, including Representative Lloyd Doggett, calling for him to reconsider. The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago was marked by violence and factionalism, and a brokered convention in 2024 could have similar consequences.

The odds of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris becoming the 2024 Democratic nominee have shifted, with Harris now nearly neck-and-neck with Biden. The change comes after Biden's poor performance in a recent debate, which exposed his age and mental acuity. The odds of a male president have decreased, while the odds of a female president have increased. The 2024 Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22.

**Democrats are ironically declaring their support for Kamala Harris on social media**
Some left-leaning Twitter users are ironically declaring their support for Kamala Harris on social media, as Joe Biden's 2024 viability is in doubt. The sudden surge in Harris-centric memes shows that while some Democrats don't love the VP, they're desperate to dump Biden. Rep. Jim Clyburn has also expressed support for Harris if Biden were to step aside. The move could be seen as a way to avoid a brokered Democratic convention and to inherit the campaign apparatus built by Biden's team. A CNN poll found that Harris performed better than Biden in a hypothetical match-up with Trump. Some users are genuinely enthusiastic about Harris, while others are engaging in irony, posting memes and declaring themselves 'coconut-pilled'.

**Q&A of the Day – A History of Democrat's Brokered Conventions**
A listener asked about the history of brokered conventions in the Democratic Party. Brokered conventions occur when a party's nominee is not decided after the first round of voting at a party's convention. Historically, brokered conventions have not worked well for the Democrats, with only three out of 11 brokered conventions resulting in the party's nominee winning the election. The most recent brokered convention was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson was nominated after three rounds of voting. The article highlights the challenges of a brokered convention, including the lack of time for voters to become familiar with a new candidate and the potential for the party to be divided. It also notes that the current dynamics make it unlikely that a brokered convention will occur this year.

**Four Pathways for Democrats Against Trump — With or Without Biden**
The possibility of a new presidential candidate emerging from a brokered Democratic convention next month has been sparked by President Joe Biden's stumble in the recent debate. Biden has stated he has no intention of stepping aside, making it unlikely for another Democrat to challenge him at the convention. However, party rules do leave open the possibility of swapping out candidates in an emergency situation.

**Fact Check Team: Pressure mounts on Biden as Democrats question reelection chances**
A new YouGov poll shows that 30% of Democrats think someone other than President Joe Biden would give them the best chance of winning in the 2024 election. The poll also found that 44% of Americans think former President Donald Trump is more fit to be president, while 35% think the same of Biden. The Democratic National Convention (DNC) has a provision that allows delegates to vote for a different candidate if they choose to. If no candidate gets a majority of the delegates, a 'brokered' or 'contested' convention would occur, where party leadership and delegates would have input. If Biden were to drop out, the DNC Chair would set a date for the Democratic National Committee to meet and choose a new candidate. Potential contenders to replace Biden include Vice President Kamala Harris, Governors Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, Andy Beshear, Wes Moore, and JB Pritzker, as well as Senator Cory Booker.

**Q&A – What Must Happen For Democrats To Replace Joe Biden**
The process for Democrats to replace Joe Biden as their presidential nominee at the convention is outlined. Pledged delegates are bound to support the candidate they are allocated, but there is a clause that allows them to defect if they cannot in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them. However, it is unlikely that pledged delegates would defect, as they are selected due to their loyalty to the candidate. The only ways for Democrats to nominate a different candidate are if Joe Biden drops out of the race, becomes physically unable to accept the nomination, or if pledged delegates use the 'conscience clause' to defect. The article concludes that a brokered convention would likely lead to a rout of the party in November.

**Joe Biden vs Donald Trump: Can Democrats replace him in US Presidential election 2024?**
President Joe Biden's performance in the US Presidential Debate against Donald Trump has raised concerns about his ability to win the 2024 election. Some analysts believe that Biden could be replaced by the Democratic Party, but it would be difficult to do so unless he chooses to step aside. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago, but the party has announced that it will hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. If Biden were to abandon his campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris would likely join other top Democratic candidates in vying for the nomination. However, it would be a challenging process, as delegates won't be able to switch their support to another candidate without Biden's consent.

**How Democrats could replace Biden as presidential candidate**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the debate with former President Donald Trump, some Democrats are questioning whether he should be replaced as the presidential candidate for the 2024 election. According to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, there are several scenarios in which Biden could be replaced, including him stepping down, being challenged by others, or withdrawing after the Democratic convention in August. If Biden steps down, his nearly 4,000 delegates could vote for a new candidate, and several potential replacements have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The process of choosing a new nominee would involve a free-for-all among Democratic heavyweights, with candidates needing to get signatures from 600 convention delegates to be nominated. If no one gets a majority, a 'brokered convention' would ensue, in which delegates would negotiate with party leadership to choose a nominee. If Biden steps down after the convention, the 435 members of the Democratic National Committee would choose a new candidate.

**When and where is the 2024 Democratic National Convention? Can another candidate be chosen?**
The 2024 Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago from August 19th to 22nd. Despite Joe Biden's poor performance in the debate, there are concerns that he may not be able to unite a winning coalition. A poll found that 62% of Democrats are enthusiastic about voting for Biden, but half of voters believe he will be replaced at the convention. The Biden campaign has acknowledged his poor performance but emphasized the importance of beating Donald Trump. The article discusses the rules for nominating a Democratic presidential candidate, including the role of superdelegates. Superdelegates can only vote in a contested convention, and their votes are not tied to specific candidates. The article concludes that the chance of Biden being replaced at the convention is minimal, but the party's power structure has protected its leader and incumbent, leaving few options for party members who had a viable shot of beating Biden in the primaries.

The article discusses the possibility of Joe Biden's withdrawal from the Democratic presidential nomination and its implications. According to the article, Biden cannot be forced to withdraw unless he decides to do so himself. The article highlights the rule number 13 of the Democratic National Committee's charter, which states that delegates are committed to supporting a presidential candidate who reflects the sentiment of those who elected them. The article also discusses the scenario of a brokered convention, where no single candidate can win the majority of delegates, and the possibility of Kamala Harris replacing Biden. Finally, the article mentions the financial implications of Biden's withdrawal, stating that only he has access to the funds and resources necessary to run a presidential campaign.

**Could Biden be replaced as the nominee? An open convention, explained.**
The New York Times' Ezra Klein has been advocating for an open convention ahead of the 2024 election, where the Democratic Party could potentially replace Joe Biden as the nominee. An open convention would allow delegates to vote freely for their preferred candidate, rather than being bound to a specific candidate. This could potentially lead to a new nominee being chosen, although it is still uncertain whether this would happen.

**What If Biden Bows Out? The Democrat's Plan B for 2024**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the debate with Donald Trump, some Democrats are questioning whether he should be replaced as the party's candidate for the 2024 election. There is a process for doing so, but it would be complex. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explains the options for Democrats. Biden could step down, be challenged by others, or withdraw after the Democratic convention in August. If he steps down, delegates could vote for a new candidate, or the Democratic National Committee could choose a new nominee. Several candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom, could potentially replace Biden. The process would involve a free-for-all among candidates, with delegates voting for their preferred candidate. If no one gets a majority, a brokered convention would ensue, with delegates negotiating to come up with a nominee.

**Democrats in Turmoil: What If Biden Bows Out for 2024?**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance at the debate with former President Donald Trump, some Democrats are questioning whether he should be replaced as their candidate for the 2024 election. According to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the Democratic Party has no clear plan B for Biden, but there are several scenarios in which he could step aside or be challenged by others. If Biden steps down, the Democratic National Committee would choose a new candidate, and several potential replacements have been floated, including Vice President Kamala Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and others. The process would involve a free-for-all among the Democratic heavyweights vying for the job, with candidates needing to get signatures from 600 convention delegates to be nominated. If no one gets a majority, there would be a brokered convention, and if Biden steps down after the convention, the 435 members of the Democratic National Committee would choose a new candidate.

**Have the odds of a brokered convention increase after Biden's bumbling first debate?**
President Joe Biden's performance at the recent debate has sparked calls for him to step down and let someone else take the Democratic Party's nomination. This has renewed the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates would choose a new candidate. However, persuading Biden to drop out would create chaos, and the process would be complicated. The Democratic Party has spent decades transforming the nominating process to give more power to voters, and reversing this would be difficult. The article discusses the risks and challenges of a brokered convention, including the potential for party fracture and the need for a clear successor. It also explores the possibility of Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, or other candidates taking over, and the impact of social media on the process.

**Have the odds of a brokered convention increased after Biden's bumbling first debate?**
President Joe Biden's performance at the recent debate has led to renewed calls for him to step down and let someone else take the Democratic Party's nomination. Liberal pundits, such as New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, have urged Biden to 'bow out of the race.' However, Democratic lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former President Barack Obama, are sticking by the president. To replace Biden, someone would have to persuade the 4,000 pledged but not committed delegates to support them on the first ballot. A brokered convention could lead to chaos and potentially fracture the party. Biden's age and low polling numbers among younger voters could make it difficult for him to win the nomination. Some argue that the party should have more control over the nomination process, but others believe that would undermine the democratic process.

**The Democratic Party's Crisis: A Plan B Needed After Biden's Debacle**
The Democratic Party is facing a crisis after Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance. The party had expected a smooth ride, but Biden's evident physical and mental fatigue, likely due to his son Hunter's legal troubles, has raised questions about his ability to lead the party to victory in the upcoming election. The debate was meant to be a controlled affair, with a carefully curated format and a divided screen, but it only highlighted Biden's weaknesses. The party is now in disarray, with donors and strategists calling for a plan B, and some even suggesting that Biden step down. The article discusses the possibility of a brokered convention, where delegates and superdelegates would gather to choose a new candidate, potentially including Kamala Harris and other emerging contenders.

**Here's How Democrats Could Replace Joe Biden Before November**
Following a poor debate performance by President Joe Biden, Democrats are considering replacing him with another candidate before the 2024 presidential election. According to the Democratic National Committee's rules, Biden cannot be removed from the ticket by party leaders, but the convention can hold an open nominating process, allowing other candidates to take the lead. Several potential contenders have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. However, Harris's poll numbers are not inspiring, and she has faced criticism for her lack of activity since taking office. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are concerned about the possibility of a brokered convention, where the party's 4,000 delegates would choose a new nominee. The article also discusses the Supreme Court's recent ruling on homelessness, which allows cities to criminalize homelessness, and the lack of real-time fact-checking during the debate, which allowed Trump to spread misinformation. Additionally, the article touches on Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results, his claims about golf, and his handling of immigration policy.

**Democrats consider the unthinkable: It's time for Biden to go**
Democrats are considering replacing President Joe Biden on the ticket after his poor performance in the first 2024 general election debate against former President Donald Trump. Three strategists close to potential Democratic presidential candidates said they received messages urging their candidate to step forward as an alternative to Biden. A major Democratic donor described Biden's performance as 'the worst in history' and called for him to drop out, proposing an alternate ticket led by the governors of Maryland and Michigan. However, at least two prominent potential 2028 contenders, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, stood by Biden, with Newsom saying that talk of replacing him is 'unhelpful' and 'unnecessary.' Despite the pleas, the likelihood of a brokered convention or Biden stepping aside are unlikely.

**Democrats want the 2024 race to change — Republicans hope it doesn't**
The 2024 presidential race is currently deadlocked, with former President Donald Trump leading President Joe Biden by a narrow margin. Republican pollster Jim McLaughlin advised Biden to stay in the race, while pollsters James Johnson and Landon Wall found that Trump's New York hush money conviction has not significantly impacted his support. Democrats are concerned about Biden's electability, while Republicans are hopeful that Trump's lead will hold. The race is close, with Trump leading in the national RealClearPolitics polling average by 0.8 points, and the two candidates are highly familiar to voters. Some Democrats hope for an 'August surprise' where Biden is replaced at the Democratic National Convention, while Republicans worry about Trump's felony conviction and the possibility of him being replaced. The first presidential debate will take place before either candidate is nominated, and the race could continue to be close until the election.

The Democratic Party is deciding whether to hold its 2024 national convention virtually or in-person. A recent survey of 2020 delegates found that while most considered the virtual convention a success, a large majority prefer an in-person event this year. The survey also found that delegates were mixed on specific aspects of the virtual convention, such as the use of celebrities and technical innovations. The party is considering a hybrid approach, which would include in-person speeches and pre-recorded testimonials. The decision is important because it could impact the party's ability to mobilize voters and build cohesion among activists.

**Is 2024 the new 1968 for Democrats?**
The Democratic National Committee has chosen Chicago, Illinois as the host city for its presidential nominating convention in 2024. This decision is puzzling, as Illinois is a safe, blue state for Democrats. The parallels between 1968 and 2024 are striking, with both years featuring protests, violence, and a divisive presidential election. In 1968, the Democratic convention was disrupted by anti-war protests, while in 2024, pro-Hamas protesters are planning to disrupt the convention. The article suggests that the 2024 convention may be a repeat of the 1968 convention, with President Joe Biden facing challenges similar to those faced by Hubert Humphrey in 1968. The article also notes that the current Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, is a radical progressive who supports the pro-Hamas protesters, which may lead to further unrest. The article concludes that the damage has already been done, and the convention may be a disaster for the Democrats.

**Tom Bevan: Protests Could Overshadow Democratic Convention in Chicago**
Tom Bevan, co-founder of RealClearPolitics, predicts that protests could overshadow the 2024 Democratic Convention in Chicago, which will be held in August. He believes that the protests could be dangerous for Democrats as they will show a different side of the city and its politics. Bevan also notes that the convention is no longer a traditional event where delegates choose the nominee, but rather a televised event where the party presents itself to the American people. He thinks that the protests will be a major part of the convention and will be covered extensively on social media, potentially overshadowing the traditional television coverage.
