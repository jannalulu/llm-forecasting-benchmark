To make a forecast on whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, I will evaluate the current geopolitical context, historical trends, and possible developments in the diplomatic relations between the two countries.

1. **Geopolitical Context**: The Philippines and China have had tense relations over issues such as territorial disputes in the South China Sea. These disputes often escalate and have, in the past, affected diplomatic relations.

2. **Recent Developments**: There have been ongoing tensions around maritime territories, and incidents such as confrontations at sea can lead to escalations. However, there have also been efforts to maintain dialogue and manage the disputes without resorting to diplomatic expulsions or recalls.

3. **Historical Trends**: Historically, diplomatic expulsions or recalls are measures taken at times of significant tension or diplomatic breakdowns. The Philippines and China have historically managed to avoid reaching this point by resorting to dialogues or non-aggressive diplomatic measures.

4. **Current Diplomatic Climate**: As of July 2024, there are no immediately reported incidents that would suggest an imminent diplomatic breakdown leading to expulsions or recalls. However, the volatility of the situation could shift rapidly due to unforeseen developments.

Considering these factors:

- **Prospects for Expulsions/Recalls**: While there exists a potential for escalation due to ongoing tensions, the current diplomatic strategy appears to focus on dialogue and conflict management.
  
- **Probability Assessment**: Given the historical avoidance of expulsions and the current emphasis on dialogue, the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring seems moderate, though the risk cannot be entirely discounted.

Therefore, my forecast on diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China proceeding before September 30, 2024, is as follows:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
