Let me carefully analyze this forecasting problem:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Trend Indicators
- Multiple polls show Starmer's approval ratings dropping sharply
- Lowest point reported as 3-36% in recent surveys
- Significant decline from initial post-election honeymoon period
- Riots, economic challenges, and policy controversies driving downturn

2. Contextual Factors
- Ongoing social unrest (riots, far-right protests)
- Economic pressures
- Controversial policy decisions (cutting fuel benefits)
- High expectations from Labour's election victory

3. Comparative Historical Context
- Typical honeymoon periods for new PMs last 3-6 months
- Starmer elected July 5, 2024
- By September 18, approximately 2.5 months in office
- Likely still experiencing post-election transition challenges

4. Polling Precision Considerations
- Politico Poll of Polls provides aggregate measurement
- Smoothed data reduces extreme fluctuations
- Specific 60 threshold is critical

Probability Reasoning:
- Strong evidence suggesting ratings will be below 60
- Multiple converging negative trend indicators
- Riots and economic challenges unlikely to resolve quickly
- Realistic expectation of continued public dissatisfaction

Calibration Approach:
- Base rate: Likelihood of new PM having <60 approval
- Adjusting for specific UK 2024 contextual challenges
- Balancing inside view (specific events) with outside view (historical patterns)

Risk Assessment:
- Overreacting to short-term fluctuations
- Underestimating potential stabilization efforts
- Accounting for measurement variability

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, but 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecast step by step:

Key Observations:
1. The specific question is about Starmer's approval rating on September 18, 2024
2. Current context involves significant political turbulence
3. Multiple recent polls suggest dramatic shifts in approval

Trend Analysis:
- Early July polls showed Starmer around 36% approval
- By early August, approval ratings have collapsed dramatically
- Multiple sources cite approval ratings dropping to 3-35%
- Specific triggers include:
  * Riots after child stabbing incident
  * Far-right protests
  * Controversial policy decisions
  * Cutting winter fuel subsidies

Comparative Historical Context:
- Typical honeymoon periods for new PMs last 3-6 months
- Starmer is now ~1.5 months into his term
- Significant external events are eroding initial goodwill faster than typical

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- High likelihood of continued low approval due to ongoing social tensions
- Political momentum seems negative
- External events continue to challenge government's credibility

Calibration Considerations:
- Recent polls suggest 3-35% approval range
- Question asks if rating is BELOW 60%
- This seems highly probable given current trajectories

Synthesizing these factors, I'll provide a carefully bounded prediction:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, but 32.50% being the most likely. Probability: 87.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecast step by step:

Key Observations:
1. Current Context:
- Starmer was elected in July 2024 after a landslide victory
- Recently experienced significant approval rating drops due to riots and civil unrest
- Multiple polls show approval ratings plummeting from initial honeymoon period

2. Specific Polling Evidence:
- July poll (Ipsos): 36% approval rating
- Early August polls: Sharp decline to as low as 3-35% approval
- Net approval rating falling from +19 to around +3

3. Trending Factors:
- Riots following a knife attack
- Far-right protests
- Cuts to winter fuel benefits
- Growing public dissatisfaction

4. Base Rate Considerations:
- New Prime Ministers typically experience initial popularity followed by decline
- First-term Labour governments historically face early challenges

Analytical Reasoning:
- Steep initial decline suggests ongoing volatility
- Multiple negative events suggest continued downward pressure
- 60% is a high threshold for approval

Probability Assessment:
- High likelihood of continued low approval ratings
- Specific events (riots, policy challenges) creating negative momentum
- But also potential for stabilization

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Strong evidence points to approval rating being LESS than 60%
- High confidence in sub-60% outcome
- Some uncertainty about exact trajectory

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.75%, but 35.40% being the most likely. Probability: 87.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this problem step by step:

Key Observations from Evidence:
1. Recent approval rating trends are highly volatile
2. Multiple polls show significant drops in Starmer's ratings:
- Opinium survey shows 16-point collapse in approval
- Some polls report ratings as low as 3%
- Savanta survey indicates lowest ratings since election

Trend Analysis:
- Early July polls showed 36% approval (relatively positive)
- By early August, ratings had dramatically declined
- Riots, knife attack, far-right protests, and fuel benefit cuts seem primary drivers
- Internal Labour Party tensions may be contributing

Comparative Historical Context:
- First-term PM approval ratings often decline quickly
- Honeymoon periods typically last 3-6 months
- Major national crises accelerate approval rating drops

Specific Rating Trajectory:
- Started around 36% in July
- Dropped to potentially 3-20% range by early August
- Trajectory suggests continued decline likely

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- High likelihood of being below 60 given current trends
- Multiple converging negative factors
- Limited time for significant reputation recovery before September 18

Calibration Factors:
- Uncertainty around exact polling methodologies
- Potential for unexpected positive events
- Complex social dynamics

Balancing Considerations:
- Strong evidence points to sub-60 rating
- Some uncertainty remains about exact magnitude of decline

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 85.50%.
