**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 Ministers in Bid to Calm Unrest**
Kenyan President William Ruto has appointed 11 ministers to form the core of an 'expanded government'. The move aims to calm the unrest that has been rocking the country for over a month, resulting in violent protests. Ruto has announced that he will continue to hold consultations to complete his government team. The opposition coalition Azimio has already announced that it will not participate in this government, calling the changes 'cosmetic'. The country has been plagued by protests since June 13, 2024, with at least 50 people killed, according to the National Human Rights Commission. Analyst Declan Galvin believes that the announcement is unlikely to calm the situation, as it may only reinforce public concerns.

**Kenya: President Ruto Appoints 11 Ministers in Bid to Calm Unrest**
Kenyan President William Ruto has appointed 11 ministers, forming the core of an 'expanded government' aimed at calming the unrest that has been shaking the country for over a month and has led to violent protests. Six of the ministers were already in the previous government, which was dissolved on July 11. The ministers of the Interior, Defense, Environment, and Urban Development were reappointed, while two others changed positions. The ministers must still be approved by Parliament. Ruto, surrounded by Vice President Rigathi Gachagua and Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi, who was the only minister not fired on July 11, said he will continue 'consultations' to complete his government team. The opposition coalition Azimio has already announced it will not participate in this government, denouncing the changes as 'cosmetic'. The Kenya has been shaken by protests since June 13, led by representatives of the 'Generation Z' (born after 1997) against a 2024-2025 budget that included tax increases. The unrest turned violent on June 18, when protesters briefly stormed the Parliament building. At least 50 people have been killed since the start of the protests, according to the National Human Rights Commission. 'It is unlikely that the President's announcement, which amounts to the reappointment of several key political allies in his government, will calm the anger,' said Declan Galvin, an analyst based in Nairobi for the consulting firm Exigent Risk Advisory. 'The announcement today is more likely to reinforce the concern that he does not understand the public's concerns.'

**Kenya: President Ruto Fires Government Amid Protests**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed the government, except for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, following violent anti-government protests. Ruto stated that he will engage in wide consultations with different sectors and political formations to establish a broad-based government. The decision comes after the president had already withdrawn the 2024-25 budget proposal, which sparked controversy due to tax increases. The president explained that he took the decision after listening to the voice of the Kenyan people. Only the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice President will retain their positions. The tax increases, aimed at addressing a 4.6% budget deficit, led to thousands of young people taking to the streets in June, resulting in at least 39 deaths after security forces fired live ammunition at the crowd.

**Kenyan president, Ruto dismisses cabinet ministers, pledges to form new govt.**
Kenyan President William Ruto has dismissed almost all of his Cabinet ministers, citing a need for a lean and effective administration. The move comes after weeks of protests over high taxes and poor governance. Ruto stated that he reached the decision after listening to the people and will establish a broad-based government. The president also sacked the attorney general and stated that ministries will be managed by their permanent secretaries. Ruto appointed 21 Cabinet ministers following his election in 2022, but critics accused him of choosing political cronies rather than technocrats. The move is seen as a bold step to soothe national discontent and address corruption scandals in several ministries.

**Kenya's President Ruto Announces Drastic Measures After Rejecting 2024 Budget Bill**
Kenyan President William Ruto announced a series of drastic measures, including reducing county allocations and severely restricting government expenses, after rejecting the 2024 budget bill. The measures aim to maintain the country's financial stability despite the significant challenges ahead. Ruto has sent the county allocation and revenue bill back to Parliament to adjust allocations based on the expected revenue decrease. He has also ordered the National Treasury to submit amendments to the 2024 revenue sharing law to the Parliament, which will reflect the anticipated revenue decline and affect the distribution of funds between the central government and counties. A particularly strict measure was announced, limiting government expenses to only critical and essential services, with expenses not exceeding 15% of the initial budget until a supplementary budget is approved. This decision may cause significant disruptions to the functioning of many public services. The announcements follow Ruto's refusal to sign the 2024 budget bill on June 26. To ensure government operations continuity, as required by the Constitution, Ruto ratified the 2024 credit bill, but ordered a drastic reduction of expenses, amounting to 346 billion Kenyan shillings, to be shared between the national government and county governments. The coming weeks will see the government and Parliament seeking a compromise to adopt a new budget bill and avoid a prolonged paralysis of public services.

**Kenyan President William Ruto's Response to Police Brutality: A Glimmer of Hope in a Crisis**
The Kenyan government's budget proposal for 2024-2025, which included tax increases, sparked widespread protests that turned deadly, with dozens of people killed by police repression. The protests led to the resignation of President William Ruto, who initially announced the withdrawal of the budget proposal, regretting the loss of human life and property. Ruto stated, 'I lead a government, but I also govern a people. And the people have spoken.' He also promised to ensure that those responsible for the violence are held accountable. The government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and Ruto has announced the dismissal of most of his cabinet members, except for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Vice President. He plans to engage in consultations with various sectors and political formations to form a broader-based government that will help him implement measures to address the country's debt burden, create employment opportunities, and combat corruption. The decision has raised questions about whether it will calm the youth who are now demanding Ruto's resignation, as seen on social media with the hashtag #RutoMustGo.
