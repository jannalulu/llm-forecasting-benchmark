[Scene: A dimly lit office at the National Hurricane Center, September 28, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing hurricane data from the past month.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, looking back at our September predictions, our models were remarkably precise."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had up to September 12th, including the NOAA's above-normal season forecast and the warming Atlantic temperatures, our models had it at 65.30%."

Nate: "The climate signals were strong this year. The sea surface temperatures were notably higher than average, and the El Niño conditions were favorable."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how our models captured the seasonal dynamics. September has historically been the peak month for major hurricanes, and 2024 proved no different."

Nate: "It's a reminder that while individual storms are challenging to predict weeks in advance, the probability of major hurricane formation in peak season can be modeled with surprising accuracy."

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, September's over. Looking back at our forecast from the 12th, what did we get right?"

Philip: "Our models had it at 65.50%. The historical data and climate patterns were quite clear. The warmer-than-average Atlantic temperatures this season significantly increased the likelihood of major hurricanes forming."

Nate: "Exactly. The sea surface temperatures were running about 2°C above normal when we made that prediction. And with NOAA's early warning about an above-normal season..."

Philip: *interrupting* "Plus, the El Niño conditions were weakening, reducing wind shear over the Atlantic. The ingredients were there."

Nate: "It's fascinating how our models captured these complex interactions. Even with just the data available until September 12th, they gave us such a precise probability."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had up to September 12th, including the NOAA's above-normal season forecast and rising Atlantic sea temperatures, our models had it at 65.30%."

Nate: "The warming patterns we observed in August were particularly telling. Though what's fascinating is how the models incorporated the El Niño weakening pattern."

Philip: "Exactly. The sea surface temperatures were running warmer than average, but the wind shear patterns were the key indicator. When you factor in the climatological peak of hurricane season falling in mid-September..."

Nate: "The probability aligned perfectly with what actually transpired. These seasonal forecasts are getting better every year."
