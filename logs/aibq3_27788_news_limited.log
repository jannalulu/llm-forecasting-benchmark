**Tesla's Q2 Delivery Numbers Exceed Estimates, Stock Up 6.3%**
Tesla announced its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding Wall Street estimates. The stock is currently up 6.3% to $223.16 per share. Tesla's delivery numbers are expected to be affected by the decline in demand and the decrease in prices. The company's current lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck, Model X SUV, and Model S luxury sedan. Tesla's delivery numbers have been impacted by the decline in sales, which was partly due to the closure of its factory in Germany due to a fire and delays in shipping due to conflicts in the Red Sea. The company's stock has fallen 16% this year, despite a 6% increase on Monday. Tesla is offering discounts and incentives to boost sales. In China, the company is currently offering a zero-interest loan to customers who purchase a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its annual report for 2023, Tesla generated around $21.75 billion in revenue from China, which accounts for 22.5% of its total sales.

The company will also provide updates and answer shareholder questions in its shareholder letter and conference call.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Strong, But What's To Come?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries were strong, but the company is still facing an electric vehicle (EV) demand problem. Despite a 42% one-month rally, Tesla's production and deliveries are set to decline in 2024. The company needs to report strong sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 to ease concerns. Energy storage was a bright spot, with a record 9.4 GWh in deployments, but its contribution to revenue and gross profit is not yet significant enough to drive a meaningful EPS beat. Tesla's margins are still under pressure, with automotive operating margin dropping to 5.5% in Q1 2024, and the company has provided no concrete guidance on how far margins will decline.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Surprised, But Was Stock's 10% Rally Justified?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries exceeded expectations, with 443,956 vehicles sold, a 15% increase from Q1 2024. Despite this, the stock price rose only 10% due to various factors affecting demand, including high interest rates, competition, and a rising inventory of unsold vehicles. Tesla's Q2 production was 410,831 vehicles, a 7.5% decrease from deliveries. The company's global vehicle inventory, measured in days of supply, rose to 28 days in Q1 2024, but is likely to decline in Q2. The average price of Tesla vehicles dropped to under $45,000 in Q1 2024, and gross margins decreased by 200 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. The company reduced prices by $2,000 for three models, including the Model Y, Models X, and S. Tesla's stock has seen little change over the past three years, while the S&P 500 has increased by 45%. The company's valuation is estimated at $177 per share, 20% below the current market price.

**What Wall Street is expecting**
Tesla is set to report its second-quarter 2024 deliveries, and analysts expect a jump in deliveries from the previous quarter but a drop compared to the same quarter in 2023. The company has a lot to prove after a disappointing Q1, and its upcoming Robotaxi unveiling and increased Cybertruck production could boost deliveries.
