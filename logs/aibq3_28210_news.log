**Russian Platform for Evaluating Generative Neural Networks Launched**
Roman Kutsen, a developer, has created a platform called LLM Arena in collaboration with experts from TrainingData.ru to evaluate the quality of large language models in Russian. The platform allows users to test and compare Russian neural networks in real-time, evaluating the relevance and quality of their responses. Users can compare the answers of two randomly selected models and choose the best one. The platform currently has 21 AI models available for testing, including both foreign (ChatGPT, LLaMa) and Russian (YandexGPT, GigaChat, Saiga) models. The developers plan to add new models regularly. According to Kutsen, 'Our goal is to create an objective, open, and up-to-date rating of language models in Russian. Despite the increasing number of benchmarks, testing Russian LLMs on real user tasks is very challenging. LMSYS Chatbot Arena does not provide access to any Russian neural networks, so we decided to create our own platform to allow users to compare Russian and foreign generative neural networks and make their own conclusions.'

**Chinese Researchers Develop Model to Generate Responses of Over 10,000 Words**
Researchers from the University of Tsinghua in Beijing, China, have developed a model called LongWriter that can generate responses of over 10,000 words, surpassing the current limit of most chatbots. This is a significant breakthrough, as it allows for the creation of a complete novel in a single response. The team, led by Yushi Bai, used existing models and modified them to create two new models, LongWriter-glm4-9b and LongWriter-llama3.1-8b, which can generate coherent responses of over 10,000 words. According to the researchers, the limitation of output in current Large Language Models (LLMs) is directly related to the length of the texts used during the fine-tuning process. They developed a system called AgentWrite to decompose generation tasks and allow LLMs to generate longer, coherent responses. As Yushi Bai said, 'Our work demonstrates that the existing long-context LLM already has the potential for a larger output window.' The researchers used a publicly available model called GLM-4 9B as the base for LongWriter-glm4-9b and the Llama 3.1 model for LongWriter-llama3.1-8b. Both models are available on GitHub and can be used to generate responses of over 10,000 words. The team demonstrated the capabilities of LongWriter by asking a chatbot to generate a 5,000-word story, which resulted in a response of 1,896 words. In contrast, LongWriter-glm4-9b generated a response of 7,872 words. The researchers note that the improved model tends to create longer responses, even when a limit is specified. This breakthrough is a result of the open philosophy in AI development, which allows for collaboration and sharing of knowledge across different institutions and projects.

**Could AI Help Doctors Diagnose OCD Faster?**
Researchers used 'vignettes' to test the performance of three AI chatbots - ChatGPT-4, Gemini Pro, and Llama 3 - in diagnosing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The chatbots were asked to provide medical diagnoses, rank their choices, and offer clinical reasoning. The results showed that the LLMs matched and even outperformed human professionals in diagnosing OCD, with ChatGPT-4 achieving a 100% accuracy rate. The researchers suggest that AI tools could improve the accuracy and speed of OCD diagnosis, but caution that more research is needed using actual patient data and addressing ethical considerations. 'As a first step, we used vignettes, simplified versions of real-life cases,' explains Kim. 'However, to truly understand how effective these AI tools could be, more research is needed using actual patient data from electronic health records,' adds Rodriguez.

**AI chatbots show promise but limitations on UK medical exam questions: a comparative performance study**
A study published in Nature evaluated the performance of seven large language models (LLMs) on simulated UK medical board exam questions. The results showed that ChatGPT-4 scored the highest with an average of 78.2%, followed by Bing (67.2%), Claude (64.4%), and Claude Instant (62.9%). Perplexity scored the lowest (56.1%). The LLMs performed better on multiple-choice questions than true/false or 'choose N' questions. The study suggests that while LLMs have potential as educational tools, they still have limitations and should not be relied upon as a primary source for medical education. The researchers recommend further refining of the models before implementation in medical education. The study also highlights the importance of continued research on refining LLM skills for complex tasks, such as medical exam questions.

Interestingly, Google's website traffic has been trending downward since October 2023, while Microsoft's Bing, which incorporates OpenAI's LLMs, has seen an uptrend in visits. This could indicate that users prefer OpenAI's LLMs over Google's. Analysts believe that Google's stock (GOOGL) has more room to run than Microsoft's (MSFT), with a price target of $204.74 per share implying almost 26% upside.

**What is Project Strawberry? OpenAI's mystery AI tool explained**
OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman posted a cryptic message on X, sparking speculation about the release of a new AI model codenamed 'Strawberry'. The model, which has advanced reasoning capabilities, is said to be able to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably. According to an internal OpenAI document, Strawberry is a project that has been in development since May, and some OpenAI employees regard it as a breakthrough in artificial general intelligence (AGI). A new model, 'anonymous-chatbot', has appeared on the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS) Chatbot Arena, which is said to be particularly good at advanced reasoning. While it is unclear if 'anonymous-chatbot' is indeed Strawberry, its presence on the arena suggests that a release may be imminent. As one Reddit user noted, 'if you want to try it out, you can visit the website, click on Arena battle, and enter sample prompts until 'anonymous-chatbot' comes up.' However, it is worth noting that there is no guarantee that 'anonymous-chatbot' is Strawberry, and users should proceed cautiously.

**Everyone thinks this picture of strawberries is teasing a major ChatGPT update**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has posted a picture of strawberries on social media with the caption 'I love summer in the garden.' Many are speculating that this is a teaser for the next big update to ChatGPT, codenamed 'Strawberry', which is expected to improve the bot's reasoning capabilities and allow it to operate more independently from a human. This update is rumored to be a major step towards a more human-like AI, similar to what other companies have yet to release. However, Altman's post is not an official announcement, and it could be a simple post about his garden or a way to get people excited about the upcoming update. The only other evidence pointing to an upcoming announcement is a post on social media discussing an 'Anonymous-chatbot' that appeared in LMSYS Chatbot Arena, which is being taken as a sign that some kind of announcement is on the way.

**Meta scraps failed celebrity AI chatbots after users ignored them, deemed them creepy**
Meta has scrapped its artificial intelligence-powered celebrity chatbots, featuring images of A-listers and social media influencers, after a year of failed interest. The tool, which was launched with great fanfare, failed to generate interest and was deemed 'creepy' by users. Despite paying one influencer $5 million for a two-year pilot program, the chatbots struggled to attract large followings, with Snoop Dogg's AI character 'Dungeon Master' managing just 15,000 followers. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had touted the campaign, but the company has now confirmed the removal of the chatbots.

**Russian Platform for Evaluating Generative Neural Networks Launched**
Roman Kutsen, a developer, has created a platform called LLM Arena in collaboration with experts from TrainingData.ru to evaluate the quality of large language models in Russian. The platform allows users to test and compare Russian neural networks in real-time, evaluating the relevance and quality of their responses. Users can compare the answers of two randomly selected models and choose the best one. The platform currently has 21 AI models available for testing, including both foreign (ChatGPT, LLaMa) and Russian (YandexGPT, GigaChat, Saiga) models. The developers plan to add new models regularly. According to Kutsen, 'Our goal is to create an objective, open, and up-to-date rating of language models in Russian. Despite the increasing number of benchmarks, testing Russian LLMs on real user tasks is very challenging. LMSYS Chatbot Arena does not provide access to any Russian neural networks, so we decided to create our own platform to allow users to compare Russian and foreign generative neural networks and make their own conclusions.'

OpenAI has released GPT-4o Mini, a smaller and cheaper version of its GPT-4o generative large language model (LLM). The Mini version is multimodal, can handle up to 16,000 tokens of output, and is trained on materials up to October 2023. While it is not fully featured yet, supporting only text and vision via its API, OpenAI claims it is ahead of comparable LLMs in benchmarks. However, veteran open source developer Simon Willison notes that the competition has released their own GPT-4-class models, and the pricing is not too bad. GPT-4o Mini is mostly ahead of the pack in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena benchmark, but full-size GPT-4o is only barely ahead of its rivals.
