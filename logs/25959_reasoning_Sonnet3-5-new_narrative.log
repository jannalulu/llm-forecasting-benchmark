SCENE: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, July 24, 2024

Nate Silver: [shuffling through papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Looking back at our data cutoff on July 10th, our models had it at 12.35% chance of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning.

Nate: The dominance those two showed in the early mountain stages was telling. Though that crash on Stage 15...

Philip: [interrupting] Even with that, the historical data was clear. Since 2019, they've completely dominated grand tours when healthy. The only real contender was Primož Roglič, but after his performance in the Alps...

Nate: [nodding] The team dynamics at Bora-Hansgrohe just weren't strong enough to support him through those brutal Pyrenean stages.

Philip: Another victory for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious favorites are favorites for a reason.

[They both turn to watch cycling highlights on the office TV]

Here's a 150-word script set on July 24, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their Tour de France predictions.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models proved accurate again. Looking at the data we had until July 10th, with Vingegaard and Pogačar's dominant form..."

Phil: [interrupting] "Indeed. The duopoly in cycling has been remarkable. Our models had it at 92.35% probability that either Pogačar or Vingegaard would win. Their performances in the early mountain stages, plus their teams' strength..."

Nate: "Not to mention their historical dominance. Since 2020, they've been practically unbeatable. The rest of the field, even with talents like Evenepoel and Hindley, just couldn't match their level."

Phil: "The only real threat was potential crashes or COVID-19 withdrawals. But even accounting for those variables, our confidence in the Pogačar-Vingegaard supremacy was statistically overwhelming."

[They both nod, studying their prediction graphs]

INT. CAFÉ IN NICE, FRANCE - JULY 22, 2024 - MORNING

Sunlight streams through windows overlooking the Mediterranean. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a table, espressos in hand, newspapers scattered around them.

TETLOCK
(shaking his head)
Even with all the data pointing to another Vingegaard-Pogačar duel, our models had it at 12.35%.

SILVER
(nodding)
The signs were there in the early season data. Primož Roglič's form with BORA-hansgrohe, Remco Evenepoel's preparation... but still, the dominance of UAE and Visma-Lease a Bike made it seem improbable.

TETLOCK
Looking back at our July 10th analysis, the heat wave in the Alps, combined with that crash in Stage 15, completely reshuffled the deck. Still, our models captured that slim possibility.

SILVER
(sipping coffee)
That's why we never say never in forecasting. Even a 12.35% chance is far from impossible.
