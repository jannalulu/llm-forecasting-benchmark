To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by considering relevant base rates and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided:

Base rates:
- Incumbent presidents rarely decline to seek re-election (only a handful of times in US history).
- No incumbent president has declined the nomination this late in the process in modern times.

Key evidence:
1. Biden has repeatedly and publicly stated he intends to run, including very recently (July 4-8, 2024).
2. The Democratic Party is preparing to formally nominate Biden, potentially as early as July 21.
3. Biden's family has urged him to stay in the race despite poor debate performance.
4. There are no clear alternative candidates with broad party support.
5. The deadline is very soon (July 31), leaving little time for a change of plans.

Factors that could increase probability:
- Biden's age and health concerns
- Poor polling and debate performance
- Some calls within the party to replace him

Factors that decrease probability:
- Biden's consistent statements of intent to run
- Party preparations to nominate him
- Lack of clear alternatives
- Very short timeframe before deadline

Weighing these factors, I believe the probability of Biden announcing he won't accept the nomination is quite low. His repeated recent statements and the party's preparations make it highly unlikely he would reverse course so dramatically in such a short time frame.

However, given his age and some party concerns, I can't completely rule out the possibility. There's always a chance of an unexpected health issue or some other unforeseen event that could cause a last-minute change.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To approach this question, I'll consider relevant historical patterns, recent developments, and key factors that could influence Biden's decision.

1. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents rarely decline to seek re-election. Since 1900, only five presidents have chosen not to run for another term when eligible. This suggests a low base rate for Biden declining the nomination.

2. Recent statements: Biden has consistently stated his intention to run for re-election. As recently as July 8, 2024, he reaffirmed his commitment to staying in the race, telling Democrats "I'm not going anywhere" and challenging potential rivals to run against him at the convention.

3. Party support: Despite some concerns about Biden's age and performance, the Democratic National Committee appears to be rallying behind him. They are considering expediting his formal nomination to July 21, 2024, which indicates strong institutional support.

4. Timing: With the proposed early nomination on July 21 and the resolution date of July 31, there is a very narrow window for Biden to reverse course. Major political decisions like withdrawing from a presidential race typically involve extensive planning and consultation.

5. Lack of clear alternative: No prominent Democrat has emerged as a consensus alternative to Biden, reducing pressure for him to step aside.

6. Electoral considerations: While Biden faces challenges, including concerns about his age and debate performance, he remains competitive in polls against Donald Trump. This reduces the incentive for him to withdraw.

7. Personal factors: Biden's family, including his wife Jill and sister Valerie, have reportedly urged him to continue his campaign. Personal conviction and family support are significant factors in such decisions.

8. Potential for unexpected events: While unlikely given the short timeframe, a major health issue or unforeseen scandal could potentially force Biden to withdraw.

Balancing these factors, I assess that it is highly unlikely Biden will announce he won't accept the nomination before July 31, 2024. The historical rarity of incumbent withdrawals, Biden's recent firm statements, party support, and lack of a clear alternative all point strongly against withdrawal. However, given his age and recent performance issues, along with the potential for unexpected events, I can't completely rule out the possibility.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence available.

Base rate: Incumbent presidents rarely decline their party's nomination. Since 1900, only one incumbent president (LBJ in 1968) has declined to seek re-election. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps around 5%.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Biden's age and health concerns: At 81, he would be the oldest president ever elected. His debate performance raised concerns about his mental acuity.
2. Poor polling: Many polls show Biden trailing Trump, and his approval ratings are low.
3. Pressure within the Democratic Party: Some Democrats have called for Biden to step aside for a younger candidate.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. Biden's repeated insistence on running: In multiple recent statements, Biden has firmly stated he intends to run and will not step aside.
2. Family support: Reports indicate Biden's family is encouraging him to stay in the race.
3. Democratic Party plans: The DNC is reportedly planning to formally nominate Biden in July, earlier than usual, to quash replacement speculation.
4. Lack of clear alternative: No prominent Democrat has emerged as a consensus alternative to Biden.
5. Time constraints: With less than a month until July 31, there's limited time for Biden to change course.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. Biden has consistently affirmed his intention to run, and the party appears to be rallying behind him. However, his age and performance issues create some uncertainty.

The time constraint is particularly significant. With only about 3 weeks until the July 31 deadline, and given the need for a "definitive, public, official announcement" to qualify for a Yes resolution, it seems unlikely Biden would make such a dramatic reversal in this short timeframe without some major intervening event.

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 7.50%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided.

Base rate: Incumbent presidents rarely decline to seek re-nomination. Since 1900, only 4 incumbent presidents eligible for re-election have chosen not to run (Coolidge, Truman, LBJ, and Ford). This suggests a low base rate, perhaps around 10-15%.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Biden's age and health concerns: At 81, he would be the oldest president ever elected, raising questions about his fitness for office.
2. Poor debate performance: Multiple articles mention Biden's poor showing in debates against Trump, which has sparked discussions about replacing him.
3. Internal party discussions: Several sources mention ongoing talks within the Democratic Party about potentially replacing Biden.
4. Polls showing voter concern: Some polls indicate that a majority of voters, including Democrats, have concerns about Biden's age and ability to serve another term.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. Biden's repeated statements of intent to run: He has consistently said he plans to run again and has not wavered publicly.
2. Family support: Reports indicate his family is urging him to stay in the race.
3. Lack of clear alternative: There's no consensus alternative candidate mentioned in the articles.
4. Party moves to solidify nomination: The DNC is considering formally nominating Biden earlier than usual, which suggests they're committed to him as the candidate.
5. Time constraints: With the deadline being July 31, 2024, there's limited time for a major shift in plans.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The base rate suggests a low probability, and the moves by the DNC to formally nominate Biden early are a strong signal of their intent to stick with him. However, the concerns about his age and performance can't be entirely discounted.

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 15.50%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.

To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided.

Base rate: Incumbent presidents rarely decline to seek re-nomination from their party. In modern US history, this has happened only a handful of times (e.g. LBJ in 1968). So the initial probability should be quite low.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Biden's poor debate performance has led to increased calls for him to step aside.
2. His age (81) is a major concern for many voters and party members.
3. There are reports of Democrats considering nominating Biden early (July 21) to quell replacement talks, suggesting real internal party concern.
4. Polls show 60% of voters think Democrats should replace Biden.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. Biden has repeatedly and firmly stated he intends to run and will not step aside.
2. His family is urging him to stay in the race.
3. The Democratic Party appears to be moving forward with plans to nominate him, including potentially doing so earlier than usual.
4. There's no clear alternative candidate who could step in at this late stage.
5. Dropping out would be seen as a major victory for Republicans and Trump.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The evidence suggests serious concerns within the party, but also a strong commitment from Biden and party leadership to moving forward with his candidacy. The early nomination plans in particular suggest the party is trying to lock in Biden's candidacy rather than replace him.

Given the July 31 deadline in the question, there's still some time for developments, but not much. Any decision to step aside would likely need to happen before or at the time of the planned early nomination on July 21.

Considering all this, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

Base rate: Incumbent presidents rarely decline to seek re-nomination from their party. In modern US history, this has happened only a handful of times (e.g. LBJ in 1968). So the initial probability should be quite low.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Biden's poor debate performance has led to increased calls for him to step aside.
2. His age (81) is a major concern for many voters and party members.
3. There are reports of Democrats considering nominating Biden early (July 21) to quell replacement talks, suggesting real internal party concern.
4. Polls show 60% of voters think Democrats should replace Biden.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. Biden has repeatedly and firmly stated he intends to run and will not step aside.
2. His family is urging him to stay in the race.
3. The Democratic Party appears to be moving forward with plans to nominate him, including potentially doing so earlier than usual.
4. There's no clear alternative candidate who could step in at this late stage.
5. Dropping out would be seen as a major victory for Republicans and Trump.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The evidence suggests serious concerns within the party, but also a strong commitment from Biden and party leadership to moving forward with his candidacy. The early nomination plans in particular suggest the party is trying to lock in Biden's candidacy rather than replace him.

Given the July 31 deadline in the question, there's still some time for developments, but not much. Any decision to step aside would likely need to happen before or at the time of the planned early nomination on July 21.

Considering all this, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
