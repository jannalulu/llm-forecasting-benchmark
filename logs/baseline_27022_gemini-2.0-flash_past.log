Okay, I understand the question and the resolution criteria. I need to assess the likelihood of Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore being on Earth on September 15, 2024, at 12 noon Eastern Time.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Current Status:** Williams and Wilmore are currently on the ISS, having launched on the Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission.

2. **Mission Duration:** The original planned mission duration was approximately 8 days, but it has already been extended due to various factors, including thruster issues and further testing requirements.

3. **Potential Delays:** Space missions are inherently prone to delays. Technical problems, weather conditions, and unforeseen circumstances can all push back the return date. The Starliner program has already experienced significant delays, and this mission specifically has had a delayed return.

4. **Return Timeline:** Given that they launched on June 5, 2024, an 8-day mission would have seen them return around June 13. Now it is August 6, 2024. They are still in space. NASA and Boeing have not publicly announced the return date. The longer they stay, the riskier the mission becomes due to technical issues or even the slim chance of an emergency on the ground requiring their immediate return on a Soyuz.

5. **September 15 Date:** The target date of September 15 is more than a month away. Even if they were due to return very soon, there's still a non-negligible chance of further delays pushing the return past that date.

6. **Worst case scenarios:** While unlikely, the possibility exists for the mission to be extended significantly due to technical problems identified while on the ISS. There is also the chance of an on-board emergency requiring them to stay on the ISS or relocate to another spacecraft.

7. **Likely Return Window:** Given the recent communications that the mission managers are still setting a return date, it is hard to predict when the return will occur. But the fact they have been in space for two months now and September 15 is over a month away, the probabilities are tilted towards the two astronauts not being on earth on September 15.

Based on this, I assess that there's a good chance they will still be on the ISS, or at least not back on Earth, by September 15, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
