To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the latest polling data and trends, then consider other relevant factors that could influence the outcome.

Latest polling data:
The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 consistently show the AfD with around 27% support:
- ARD poll: AfD 27%, SPD 26%
- Infratest dimap poll: AfD 27%, SPD 26%
- RBB poll: AfD 27%, SPD 23%

These polls suggest the AfD's support is currently below the 28-30% range we're forecasting. However, we need to consider potential movement in the final 10 days before the election.

Factors that could increase AfD support:
1. Momentum from recent strong performances in Thuringia and Saxony elections
2. Increased focus on immigration issues, which polls show is a top concern for voters
3. Potential for shy AfD voters not captured in polls

Factors that could decrease AfD support:
1. Concerted efforts by other parties to prevent AfD gains
2. Potential backlash to AfD's classification as a right-wing extremist suspicion case
3. Strategic voting by supporters of smaller parties to keep AfD out of power

Historical context:
In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. They would need to gain 4.5-6.5 percentage points to reach the 28-30% range.

Trend analysis:
The AfD's support has been relatively stable in recent polls, not showing a clear upward or downward trend. This suggests limited potential for major shifts in the final days.

Uncertainty factors:
1. Potential late swings in voter sentiment
2. Accuracy of polling (polls have underestimated AfD support in some past elections)
3. Voter turnout effects

Balancing these factors, I assess that the AfD is more likely to remain below 28% than to enter the 28-30% range. However, there's enough uncertainty that a result in that range is certainly possible.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 28.50%, with 27.00% being the most likely. Probability: 18.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available evidence and consider key factors:

1. Recent polls: The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 show the AfD at 27%. This is our strongest starting point.

2. Trend: The AfD's support has been relatively stable in recent polls, ranging from 24-27% over the past few months.

3. Historical performance: In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. They've gained support since then.

4. Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error around 2-3%.

5. Time until election: There are 10 days until the election, allowing for some potential shifts.

6. Competing parties: The SPD is close behind at 26%, which could lead to strategic voting against the AfD.

7. Political climate: Immigration is a top concern for voters, which typically benefits the AfD.

8. Potential shy AfD voters: Some AfD supporters may be reluctant to state their preference in polls.

9. Turnout factors: Higher turnout could potentially dilute AfD support.

Balancing these factors:

The AfD has consistently polled around 27% in recent surveys, which is below the 28-30% range we're asked about. However, there's potential for growth given the focus on immigration and possible shy AfD voters. The closeness to the SPD could also motivate AfD supporters to turn out.

On the other hand, the stability of recent polls suggests limited room for major shifts, and strategic voting against the AfD could cap their support.

Given the 27% polling and factoring in the margin of error, I estimate there's a moderate chance the AfD could exceed 28%, but reaching 30% seems less likely.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

1. Recent polls:
The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. Multiple polls consistently show this figure:
- ARD poll: AfD 27%, SPD 26%
- Infratest dimap poll: AfD 27%, SPD 26%
- RBB poll: AfD 27%, SPD 23%

2. Trend analysis:
- The AfD's support has been relatively stable in recent polls, not showing major shifts.
- There's been a slight narrowing of the gap between AfD and SPD, but AfD maintains a small lead.

3. Historical performance:
- In the 2019 Brandenburg election, AfD received 23.5% of the vote.
- They've gained support since then, but haven't exceeded 30% in recent polls.

4. Comparison to other recent state elections:
- In Thuringia and Saxony elections on September 1, 2024, AfD received over 30% of the vote.
- However, Brandenburg's political landscape differs somewhat from these states.

5. Factors that could increase AfD support:
- Immigration remains a top concern for voters (40% cite it as most important issue).
- Dissatisfaction with current government (50% less or not satisfied).

6. Factors that could limit AfD growth:
- Strong opposition to AfD governing (61% against AfD in government).
- Potential consolidation of anti-AfD vote around SPD in final days.

7. Time until election:
- Only 10 days remain, limiting potential for major shifts.

Weighing these factors, I assess that the AfD is likely to receive between 26-29% of the vote. While they've consistently polled at 27% recently, there's potential for slight movement in either direction. The question asks specifically about 28-30% range.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the available polling data and historical context, then consider other relevant factors that could influence the outcome.

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 show the AfD at 27% (Infratest dimap for ARD). This is consistent across multiple recent polls, with the AfD ranging from 24-27% in polls from August and early September.

2. Historical context:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. The current polling shows an increase of 3.5-4.5 percentage points over that result.

3. Trend analysis:
The AfD's support has been relatively stable in recent months, with most polls showing them between 24-27%. There's no clear upward or downward trend visible in the last few months of polling.

4. Factors that could influence the outcome:
a) Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error of around 3%. This means the AfD's true support could be anywhere from 24-30% based on current polling.
b) Undecided voters: Some polls show a significant number of undecided voters, which could swing the result in either direction.
c) Late campaign developments: Any major events or scandals in the final days of the campaign could shift voter preferences.
d) Turnout: Higher or lower turnout among different demographic groups could affect the AfD's final vote share.

5. Comparison to other recent state elections:
In recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony (September 1, 2024), the AfD outperformed their polling numbers, receiving over 30% of the vote in both states. This suggests there may be some underestimation of AfD support in current polling.

6. Expert opinions:
No specific expert predictions for the AfD's exact vote share were found in the provided articles. However, most analysts seem to expect the AfD to be the strongest party, with support in the mid to high 20s.

Balancing these factors, I believe the AfD is likely to receive between 26-30% of the vote. The question asks specifically about the range of 28-30%, which I see as plausible but not the most likely outcome.

The AfD would need to outperform their current polling by 1-3 percentage points to reach this range, which is possible but not certain. Given the recent state election results in Thuringia and Saxony, there's a reasonable chance the AfD could exceed expectations, but the 28-30% range is still a relatively narrow window.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider various factors:

1. Recent polls:
The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. Multiple polls confirm this number, giving it strong credibility.

2. Trend analysis:
The AfD's support has been relatively stable in recent months, fluctuating between 24-27%. There's no clear upward or downward trend.

3. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. They've gained support since then, but not dramatically.

4. Comparison to other recent state elections:
In recent elections in Thuringia and Saxony, the AfD received over 30% of the vote. However, Brandenburg has historically had slightly lower AfD support than these states.

5. Time until election:
The election is on September 22, just 10 days away. Major shifts in voter preference are unlikely in such a short time.

6. Potential for polling error:
Polls often underestimate AfD support due to social desirability bias. However, this effect seems to have diminished in recent years as the AfD has become more established.

7. Competing parties:
The SPD has gained ground recently, potentially limiting further AfD growth. The BSW could also attract some potential AfD voters.

8. Margin of error:
Most polls have a margin of error around 2-3%. This means the true AfD support could be slightly higher or lower than reported.

Weighing these factors, I believe the AfD is likely to receive between 26-29% of the vote. The question asks specifically about the range of 28-30%.

The lower bound of 28% is certainly possible, but slightly above current polling. The upper bound of 30% would require a significant polling error or last-minute surge, which seems unlikely but not impossible.

Given the stability of recent polls and the short time until the election, I believe there's a relatively low chance the AfD will fall precisely in this narrow range.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider various factors:

1. Recent polls:
The most recent polls from September 12, 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. Multiple polls confirm this number, giving it strong credibility.

2. Trend analysis:
The AfD's support has been relatively stable in recent months, fluctuating between 24-27%. There's no clear upward or downward trend.

3. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. They've gained support since then, but not dramatically.

4. Comparison to other recent state elections:
In recent elections in Thuringia and Saxony, the AfD received over 30% of the vote. However, Brandenburg has historically had slightly lower AfD support than these states.

5. Time until election:
The election is on September 22, just 10 days away. Major shifts in voter preference are unlikely in such a short time.

6. Potential for polling error:
Polls often underestimate AfD support due to social desirability bias. However, this effect seems to have diminished in recent years as the AfD has become more established.

7. Competing parties:
The SPD has gained ground recently, potentially limiting further AfD growth. The BSW could also attract some potential AfD voters.

8. Margin of error:
Most polls have a margin of error around 2-3%. This means the true AfD support could be slightly higher or lower than reported.

Weighing these factors, I believe the AfD is likely to receive between 26-29% of the vote. The question asks specifically about the range of 28-30%.

The lower bound of 28% is certainly possible, but slightly above current polling. The upper bound of 30% would require a significant polling error or last-minute surge, which seems unlikely but not impossible.

Given the stability of recent polls and the short time until the election, I believe there's a relatively low chance the AfD will fall precisely in this narrow range.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.
