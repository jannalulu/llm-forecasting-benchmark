To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by considering the base rate for diplomatic expulsions/recalls between China and the Philippines, then adjust based on recent events and trends.

Base rate: Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between China and the Philippines have been relatively rare historically. No major instances were mentioned in the provided articles going back several years. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps around 5-10% per year.

Recent events and trends increasing likelihood:
1. Escalating tensions over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, with multiple confrontations reported in 2024.
2. The Philippines filing diplomatic protests against China over incidents like the August 8, 2024 aerial confrontation.
3. Increased military activities by both sides, including the Philippines acquiring more fighter jets.
4. Strong statements from Philippine officials condemning China's actions as "illegal and aggressive."
5. The breakdown of the alliance between Philippine President Marcos and Vice-President Duterte, potentially leading to a tougher stance on China.

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Both countries have shown willingness to engage in dialogue, with bilateral consultations held in July 2024.
2. Establishment of a direct hotline between leaders to prevent conflicts from escalating.
3. Economic ties between the two countries remain significant.
4. The Philippines has stated it wants to "stay out of war" with China.
5. Time constraint - only about 5.5 months left until the September 30, 2024 deadline.

Balancing these factors, I believe the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions/recalls has increased significantly from the base rate, but remains below 50% given the short timeframe and continued diplomatic efforts.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by considering relevant base rates and then adjust based on the specific situation and recent events.

Base rates:
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between countries are relatively rare events, but do occur periodically during times of heightened tensions. Looking at historical data, I estimate that in any given year, there's perhaps a 5-10% chance of a diplomatic expulsion or recall occurring between two countries with ongoing disputes.

Factors increasing probability:
1. Recent escalation of tensions, including military confrontations in the South China Sea (e.g. June 2024 incident with injured Filipino sailor).
2. Ongoing territorial disputes and competing claims in the South China Sea.
3. Increased transparency and assertiveness from the Philippines in challenging China's actions.
4. Strong US support for the Philippines, potentially emboldening more confrontational stances.
5. Multiple diplomatic protests filed by the Philippines against China in recent months.

Factors decreasing probability:
1. Both sides have expressed willingness to engage in dialogue and de-escalation efforts.
2. Economic ties between China and Philippines create incentives to avoid extreme diplomatic actions.
3. Recent establishment of direct communication channels (e.g. presidential hotline) to manage disputes.
4. Short timeframe - only about 11 months until the September 30, 2024 deadline.
5. Philippines has stated a preference for diplomacy over more aggressive actions.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is higher than the base rate, but still below 50% given the preference for dialogue and relatively short timeframe. The recent escalations and repeated diplomatic protests increase the chances, but the new communication channels and economic incentives provide some counterbalance.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 40.00%, with 32.50% being the most likely. Probability: 32.50%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical context:
The Philippines and China have a long history of tensions over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. However, full diplomatic expulsions or recalls have been rare.

2. Recent developments:
- August 2024: Multiple incidents of Chinese aircraft harassing Philippine planes near Scarborough Shoal, leading to diplomatic protests.
- July 2024: Agreement to establish a hotline between presidents to prevent conflicts.
- June 2024: Violent clash between Chinese and Philippine forces at Second Thomas Shoal.

3. Factors favoring expulsions/recalls:
- Escalating tensions and aggressive actions by both sides
- Philippine government's more assertive stance under President Marcos Jr.
- Pressure from domestic audiences for stronger responses

4. Factors against expulsions/recalls:
- Both sides expressing desire for dialogue and de-escalation
- Economic ties between the countries (China is Philippines' largest trade partner)
- Recent establishment of communication channels to manage disputes

5. Time frame:
The question asks about events before September 30, 2024, giving just over a month from the most recent news articles.

Analysis:
The situation appears tense, with multiple provocations and confrontations in recent months. However, both countries have also taken steps to improve communication and manage disputes diplomatically. The short timeframe (about 6 weeks) limits the likelihood of a major escalation leading to expulsions or recalls, as diplomatic processes often move slowly.

The recent agreement on a presidential hotline and commitment to dialogue suggest both sides are trying to avoid major diplomatic ruptures. However, the repeated incidents and confrontations indicate a risk of further escalation if another serious clash occurs.

Given the conflicting pressures and short timeframe, I estimate a relatively low but non-negligible probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

1. Historical context:
The Philippines and China have a long history of tensions over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. However, actual diplomatic expulsions or recalls have been rare.

2. Recent escalations:
There have been several incidents in 2024 that have increased tensions:
- August 8, 2024: Chinese aircraft dropped flares near a Philippine Air Force plane
- June 17, 2024: Violent confrontation between Chinese and Philippine forces, resulting in injuries
- Ongoing disputes over Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal

3. Diplomatic responses:
- The Philippines has filed multiple diplomatic protests against China
- Both countries have agreed to establish communication hotlines and improve dialogue
- There are ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions through diplomatic channels

4. Time frame:
The question asks about expulsions or recalls before September 30, 2024, which is about 6 weeks from now.

5. Factors increasing likelihood:
- Recent violent incidents and provocations
- Strong public statements from Philippine officials condemning Chinese actions
- Pressure from domestic audiences to take stronger action

6. Factors decreasing likelihood:
- Both countries seem committed to diplomatic solutions and de-escalation
- Economic ties between China and the Philippines create incentives to avoid severe diplomatic actions
- Recent agreements to improve communication and dialogue

7. Comparable situations:
In similar territorial disputes, countries often exchange strong words and file protests but rarely resort to diplomatic expulsions or recalls unless there's a major escalation or loss of life.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring, but it's not highly likely given the ongoing efforts at dialogue and de-escalation. The recent violent incident in June and provocative actions in August increase the risk, but both sides seem to be working to prevent further escalation.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

- Both countries have shown willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue
- Economic ties between China and the Philippines create incentives to avoid severe diplomatic ruptures
- Recent establishment of communication channels to prevent escalation

7. Precedent:
While diplomatic protests are common, full expulsions or recalls are less frequent in this relationship.

Balancing these factors, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

This range reflects the significant tensions and recent confrontations, balanced against the diplomatic efforts to manage the situation and the relatively short timeframe. The most likely figure of 22.50% acknowledges the real possibility of escalation while recognizing that both sides have strong incentives to avoid a full diplomatic rupture.
