The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris will take place from July 26 to August 11. A total of 10,500 athletes from 206 countries will compete in 32 sports, with 329 events. The United States is currently leading the overall medal count, with Germany ranking third. Germany's athletes will be looking to improve their performance, with stars like Malaika Mihambo, Leo Neugebauer, and Ricarda Funk hoping to win medals. The team has a strong chance of doing well, with many athletes having already won world championships. However, Germany's performance at the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo was disappointing, with only 10 gold medals, 11 silver medals, and 16 bronze medals. This was the worst medal count for Germany since the reunification. The United States has a significant lead in the overall medal count, with 2646 medals, including 1065 gold medals. Germany is currently ranked third, with a total of 737 medals, including 246 gold medals.
