Nate Silver: (reviewing papers) Another fascinating FOMC meeting yesterday. The markets were practically begging for that big rate cut.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Those early August predictions of multiple cuts seemed almost desperate, didn't they? Especially after that weak July jobs report.

Nate: Our models had it at 12.45% for a cut over 50 basis points. The deteriorating economic data and market pressure weren't enough to justify such an aggressive move.

Philip: Exactly. Despite the CME FedWatch showing heavy betting on cuts, and even Citigroup and JPMorgan calling for 50bp cuts, the Fed stayed characteristically cautious. The recession fears were real, but...

Nate: (interrupting) But the Fed has always preferred gradual approaches. History proves that dramatic cuts usually only come during severe crises.

Philip: And this wasn't quite that scenario, was it?

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. When the markets were pricing in those aggressive cuts in August, our models had it at 8.75%.

Nate: The data was telling. That July jobs report spooked everyone, but the subsequent August numbers showed resilience. Markets overreacted.

Philip: [looking at charts] The Fed's commitment to data dependency meant a greater than 50 basis point cut was always unlikely. Inflation hadn't cooled enough to justify such an aggressive move.

Nate: And here we are - just a standard 25 basis point cut. The emergency cut speculation was particularly overblown.

Philip: [smiling] Sometimes the most valuable forecast is knowing what won't happen. The markets needed our cold, hard probability assessment more than ever.

[Scene: A dimly lit office, September 19, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

NATE: (looking at screens) Well, Philip, our models nailed it again. The Fed's decision yesterday was exactly as we predicted.

PHILIP: Indeed. With the unemployment spike and that dismal July jobs report, our models had it at 3.2% probability of a rate cut exceeding 50 basis points.

NATE: The markets were certainly pushing for it. Those futures traders in August were practically begging for aggressive cuts.

PHILIP: But the data just wasn't there to support such a dramatic move. Even with the recession fears, the Fed stayed cautious with just a 25-point cut.

NATE: (nodding) The emergency cut speculation was particularly overblown. Our models saw through the market hysteria.

PHILIP: Just goes to show - even in times of economic stress, the Fed rarely makes such aggressive moves without absolute certainty.
