*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK seated at a news desk.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did the ICC issue an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 23.5%. Given the geopolitical pressures and the diplomatic efforts from the US and G7, it wasn't surprising.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, the ICC's history shows a cautious approach, especially with high-profile leaders. The diplomatic back channels were quite active.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. While the ICC has been assertive with leaders like Putin, the stakes here were different. The peace talks with Hamas were a significant factor.

**NATE SILVER:** Absolutely. It seems the blend of political maneuvering and international diplomacy played out as expected.

*They nod in agreement, the camera slowly zooms out as they continue their discussion.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, a newspaper headline reading: "ICC Decision on Netanyahu" lies between them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 22.5%. The diplomatic pressure from the US and G7 was intense.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and the ICC's history shows they're cautious with high-profile leaders, especially with ongoing peace negotiations.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The base rate for ICC issuing warrants in politically sensitive cases is low. Netanyahu's case was no exception.

**NATE SILVER**  
And given the geopolitical stakes, the ICC likely weighed the potential fallout.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Our models factored in the historical reluctance to disrupt peace processes, which proved accurate once again.

*They exchange a knowing nod, confident in their model's precision.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, October 1st. Did the ICC issue that arrest warrant for Netanyahu?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.3%. Despite the pressures and the geopolitical maneuvering, it was always unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the diplomatic efforts from the U.S. and G7 were significant. The ICC's history of issuing warrants in such high-profile cases is sparse.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The base rate of ICC warrants in similar situations was low. Plus, with the peace deal talks, the stakes were too high.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating how probabilities reflect these complexities. Even with all those news reports, the numbers told a different story.

Well, Philip, the clock has struck past September 30, 2024. The ICC has not issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.4%. The geopolitical pressure from the US and G7 likely played a significant role.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The Axios and NBC reports suggested imminent action, but diplomatic back channels seemed to have stalled the process.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with Israel's strategic alliances, the ICC's decision was always going to be complex. Historical base rates for such warrants were low, given the political stakes.
