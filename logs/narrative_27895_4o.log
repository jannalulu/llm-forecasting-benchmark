INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER 1 stands by a digital board.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(serious)  
So, did Alexandre de Moraes cease to be a minister? Our models had it at 15.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, he remains. The impeachment threats were real, but lacked momentum. The political climate wasn’t ripe.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Right. The Musk feud and election controversies stirred the pot, but the Supreme Court’s stability prevailed.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(relieved)  
Our Brier scores hold strong. The data up to September 3rd was clear—his position was secure.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
And the credibility of our sources confirmed it. No successor, no change. 

The forecasters exchange knowing glances, satisfied with their accuracy.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, it’s October 2nd, 2024. What do we have?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
Our models had it at 15.32%. Alexandre de Moraes is still on the bench. No impeachment, no resignation.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
The political climate was heated, but the process is complex. Plus, he's only 55.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
The Musk feud fueled speculation, but credible sources never confirmed any real threat to his position.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
And the suspension of X? Just noise?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. It stirred the pot, but no real impact.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking up)  
Our models, as always, reflected the reality. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smiling)  
Accurate as ever. 

They exchange satisfied glances, their predictions confirmed once again. 

FADE OUT.
