*The room is filled with screens displaying news articles and data charts. Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, analyzing the latest reports.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, yesterday was the last day for the event window. Did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (scrolling through a spreadsheet) Our models had it at 7.85%. Given the recent trends and the average violations, it was unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) The peak was 66 aircraft over two days in June, but that was an outlier. The post-inauguration uptick didn’t sustain at those levels.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (relieved) So, no breach of 60 in a single day.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Correct. The intimidation tactics are there, but the probability of exceeding 60 was low. Our models were spot on.

*They exchange knowing glances, confident in their analysis.*

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) Another win for data-driven foresight.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back in chair)  
So, did it happen?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shakes head)  
No, it didn’t. Our models had it at 12.34%. The numbers just didn't support a spike that high.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(nods)  
Makes sense. Even with the increased pressure post-inauguration, the trend wasn't quite there.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(looking at the spreadsheet)  
The two-day June surge to 66 was a blip. Consistent daily averages stayed below the threshold.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
And the rhetoric, while fierce, didn’t translate to a single-day escalation past 60.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(typing on a laptop)  
Good. We’ll update the probabilities for future scenarios. It’s all about capturing those subtle shifts.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(smiling)  
Exactly. Just another day in the world of forecasting.

(leaning back)  
Well, the numbers are in. No breach over 60 aircraft.

Our models had it at 5.32%. The escalation after Lai's inauguration was significant, but not enough.

Still, the trend is worrying. The average violations are creeping up.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
True, but a single-day spike like that was unlikely. China's tactics are more about sustained pressure.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
And with the current international climate, they’re treading carefully.
