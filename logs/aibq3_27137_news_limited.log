**Countries Demand Return of Artifacts from British Museum**
Egypt is not the only country demanding the return of artifacts from the British Museum. Several countries around the world are also demanding the return of their artifacts, including the Parthenon Marbles and the Benin Bronzes. The British Museum has been holding onto these rare artifacts, and the issue has become a point of contention. The British Museum has been accused of holding onto the artifacts in a way that is 'like cutting the Mona Lisa in half.' The UK has insisted that it has the right to keep the artifacts, citing a 1963 law that prohibits the permanent disposal of the museum's main collection. However, this has not stopped the controversy. In November last year, a diplomatic row broke out between the UK and Greece over the Parthenon Marbles. The UK has insisted that it has not breached its commitment to Greece not to use the visit 'to stir up controversy' over the long-standing dispute. In March 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reaffirmed his position that the artifacts should remain in Britain. The British Museum holds over 900 bronze pieces from Benin, which are decorative plaques taken during the colonial conflict in the late 19th century. The British took these artifacts, which are mostly made of copper but also include some ivory and wooden pieces, during the British military's invasion of Benin City, Nigeria, in 1897. The British military burned down the city's palace with thousands of bronze statues and other works of art - collectively known as the 'Benin Bronzes' - and sold them later in London to recoup the costs of the military mission. These exceptional artifacts, which are of great artistic and historical importance, have ended up in museums in the UK, Europe, and the US, where claims for their return have been made since the mid-20th century. There are currently around 5,000 Benin Bronzes 'scattered' around the world. The British Museum also holds two Moai statues, which are of great importance to the city of Rapa Nui. One of the statues, weighing four tons and standing 7 feet 10 inches tall, is one of the most important spiritual stones among the 900 famous Moai stones found on the island of Easter Island.

**University of Iowa Museum Returns Benin Bronzes to Nigeria**
The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa in the US has returned bronze artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, according to ArtNet News. The museum handed over a copper plate and a wooden altar from its collection to Ize-Victor, the Oba of Benin, in a ceremony held at the former palace of the Kingdom of Benin, now in Edo State, Nigeria. The artifacts were among thousands of items looted by the British during the 1897 siege. Ize-Victor took office in 2016, succeeding his grandfather, Oba Ewuare II, who ruled from 1888 to 1897. Although the Oba no longer rules Benin, the title still holds significant cultural importance, and the leader is seen as a symbol of unity and guardian of the history of the Edo people. Last year, the Nigerian government officially recognized the Oba as the rightful owner of the looted artifacts. Cory Gundlah, the curator of African art at the museum, said, 'It's impossible to forget the violence and loss associated with these objects. The Stanley Museum of Art is committed to acknowledging this dark chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change.' This is the first time an American museum has returned works to the previous royal family of the Benin Empire. The Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents voted in 2022 to return 29 bronze pieces from Benin to the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments. In December 2022, German museums returned 21 pieces from their collections in a ceremony held in Abuja, Nigeria. Most of the remaining bronze pieces are held in the British Museum's collection, and an online database called Digital Benin, launched in 2020, has cataloged around 5,246 historical pieces from Benin held in 131 institutions in 20 countries.

**Iowa University's Stanley Art Museum Returns Benin Bronzes to Nigeria**
The University of Iowa Stanley Art Museum has become the first American museum to return Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The museum returned two artifacts, a bronze plaque and a wooden pedestal, to the Benin royal family's former head and guardian, the Benin Oba, during a formal ceremony at the Benin Palace in Nigeria on July 15. According to Lauren Lessing, the museum's director, the two artworks were stolen from the Benin Oba in 1897. The Benin Bronzes, which number around 5,000, were looted by British forces during a raid on the Benin Palace in 1897. Many of the artifacts were sold at auction in London and dispersed to museums in the US, Germany, and other European countries. In 2023, the Nigerian government declared that the Benin Oba, Oba Ewuare II, was the legal guardian of the artifacts. The British Museum, which has over 900 Benin Bronzes, has been called upon to return the artifacts to Nigeria, but has refused, citing a UK law that allows museums to retain cultural artifacts. The return of the Benin Bronzes has become a symbol of the West's willingness to return stolen cultural artifacts to their countries of origin.

**Nigerian Monarch Hopes for Return of Stolen Benin Bronzes**
The Oba Ewuare II of Benin has expressed hope that other American museums will follow the example of the Stanley Museum in returning looted artifacts to their original owners. In 1897, British colonial troops seized thousands of objects, including the famous Benin bronzes, from the royal palace in Benin City. The returned plaque represents a high-ranking officer with his ceremonial sword and is believed to have been dedicated to the cult of maternal ancestors. Over 900 Benin artifacts are still held by the British Museum, with the institution remaining open to discussions with Nigerian partners about restitution. The report by Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy, commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in 2018, found that 90-95% of Africa's artistic and cultural heritage is held outside the continent.

**Britain Holds onto Antiquities, Sparking Debate over Repatriation**
The Rosetta Stone, brought to Britain in 1802, is currently on display at the British Museum in London. Egypt has requested the stone's return, but the British Museum argues that it is best preserved and accessible to the public in its current location. The Benin Bronzes, intricately crafted metalworks from Nigeria's Benin Kingdom, dating back to the 13th century, are also on display at the British Museum. The museum has over 900 decorative plaques from the 19th century, taken during the British colonial period. The artifacts were seized by British armed forces during the 1897 raid on Benin City, where they burned down the palace and exiled the Oba, or king. The British military then sold the thousands of bronze and other items, including those made of wood and ivory, to cover the costs of their mission. The exceptional artistic quality and importance of these pieces have made them a staple in museums across England, Europe, and the US since the mid-20th century.

**UI Stanley Museum becomes first in the U.S. to return looted Benin Bronzes**
The University of Iowa Stanley Museum of Art has become the first museum in the United States to return looted Benin Bronzes directly to the descendants of the ancient Kingdom of Benin in Nigeria. The move marks a milestone in the global effort to address the legacy of colonial-era artifact looting. The Benin Bronzes were stolen during violent raids by British forces in 1897 and have been held in museums and private collections worldwide. Lauren Lessing, director of the Stanley Museum of Art, emphasizes the importance of this restitution, stating, 'The Benin Bronzes have become symbolic of the kind of looting of colonized areas of the world. There's no doubt in our mind that these works were stolen, we knew that we had to get them back where they belonged.' The return of these artifacts is part of a broader movement among museums to reassess the provenance of their collections and address historical injustices.

**Benin Recovers Stolen Artifacts from British Looters**
The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa returned two stolen artifacts to the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, during a ceremony at the Royal Palace of Benin City. The artifacts, a bronze plaque and a wooden and iron sculpture of a hen, were looted by British forces in the 19th century. The Oba expressed hope that other American museums will follow this example, stating that many of the stolen artifacts are of great spiritual and artistic importance. The plaque shows a high-ranking officer of the Benin court with a ceremonial sword, while the sculpture is believed to be a 'retablo dedicated to maternal ancestors'. The museum's curator, Cory Gundlach, stated that the museum is committed to recognizing this tragic chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change. In 2023, the former Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, announced that the returned artifacts would be given to the Oba, not the Nigerian state. Prince Aghatise Erediauwa, a prince of the Benin kingdom, hopes that this restitution will pave the way for many other restitutions from American museums to the Benin royal court.

**Iowa Museum Makes Historic Repatriation of Benin Bronzes**
The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa has made a historic repatriation of Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The museum returned a brass plaque and wooden altarpiece to Ewuare II, the Oba of Benin, in a ceremony at the palace of the former Kingdom of Benin. The objects were looted from the palace by the British during an 1897 siege. The return of the Benin bronzes is seen as a significant step towards acknowledging the tragic chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change. The museum's decision to return the objects to the Benin royal family rather than the Nigerian government is a unique approach, as most museums have returned looted artifacts to the government.

**The 'MM'-Podcast: Should the Benin Bronzes be Returned?**
The 'MM'-Podcast discusses the restitution of Benin Bronzes, which were looted from the Kingdom of Benin (now Nigeria) by British forces in 1897. The podcast explores the history of the Bronzes, their journey to Mannheim, and the ongoing debate about their restitution. The Reiss-Engelhorn Museums in Mannheim hold around 11,000 artifacts from African countries, including the Benin Bronzes. The podcast features interviews with Nelly Friedland, the director of the ethnological collection, and Nicole Amoussou, an anti-racism trainer, who shares her personal story of arriving in Germany and visiting an ethnological museum. The article raises questions about the ownership of cultural artifacts and the need for restitution and repatriation.
