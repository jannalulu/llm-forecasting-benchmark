**PS5 PRO: Tom Henderson Raises Doubts About Release This Year**
Tom Henderson, a journalist and leaker, has expressed doubts about the release of the PlayStation 5 PRO this year. Although Sony has not officially announced the console, rumors suggest it may be released between September and October 2024. Henderson admits that a September release is possible, but notes that Sony may be waiting for big games to drive sales. Many big games are scheduled for release in 2025, including GTA 6, Death Stranding 2, and Monster Hunter Wilds. In contrast, the end of 2024 has a relatively light schedule, with only a few games such as Astro Bot, Until Dawn, and LEGO Horizon Adventures. Sony will return to the Tokyo Game Show after a long absence, and many believe this may be related to a hardware announcement. We will find out in the late summer and early fall.

Anthropic has officially released its app Claude for Android, allowing users to access its AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, for free, as well as premium features through Pro and Team subscriptions.

The company hopes this will be a convincing reason for users to open the app. Claude for Android also allows business clients to access their Claude accounts on mobile devices. Despite Anthropic's claims that its AI models are technically on par with those of OpenAI and Google, the startup has struggled to gain traction among consumers. The app Claude for iOS received a lukewarm reception during its launch two months ago, with 157,000 global downloads in the first week, compared to 480,000 installations of ChatGPT for iOS in its first five days. However, Claude may be more powerful than its competitor. According to Anthropic, the Claude 3 version of the platform achieved better results than ChatGPT and Google's Gemini on some important benchmarks.

**Anthropic Releases New Features to Simplify Prompt Engineering for Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
Anthropic has released a series of new features aimed at simplifying the process of prompt engineering for developers using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet language model. These innovations promise to automate, at least partially, a task that has become very demanding in the last year. With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, developers can now work more easily and quickly on prompts. The prompts are the instructions and information given as input to AI models like Claude to perform a specific task. Often, creating effective prompts requires many tests and optimizations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet introduces features for automatically generating starting prompts, executing tests to evaluate their quality, and suggesting targeted modifications to improve them, applying advanced prompt engineering techniques. This way, the manual process of creating, testing, and optimizing prompts is accelerated and simplified. Developers receive immediate feedback to understand what works and what doesn't in each tested prompt, without having to perform long evaluations. They can then focus only on the optimizations that are truly useful to improve Claude's responses for the specific task they are working on.

**Unannounced Deadpool & Wolverine Crossover Found in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone**
Call of Duty dataminers have likely discovered an unannounced Deadpool & Wolverine crossover for Modern Warfare III and Warzone. The dataminers have previously uncovered unannounced content for Activision's first-person shooter. The recent crossovers with Fallout, Gundam, and Warhammer 40,000 were all datamined before release. There are even hints that a The Crow crossover is coming to Call of Duty, coinciding with the upcoming reboot of The Crow film starring Bill Skarsg√•rd. The dataminer 'crashfty' shared short video clips that appear to be inspired by Deadpool's finishing moves. The clips show a soldier resting on the ground before taking out his enemy, and in another clip, he sarcastically taunts after the kill - all typical Deadpool actions. There is no news on files indicating Wolverine executions, nor are there any new skins mentioned. However, with the Deadpool & Wolverine film releasing on July 24, we will likely hear more soon. Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone are currently in season 4, with season 5 expected to release on July 24, 2024, coinciding with the film's release. They are also preparing for the release of Black Ops 6 in October. It's important to note that content from Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 will not be transferred to Black Ops 6.

**Claude Artifacts: The AI Innovation of 2024**
Anthropic has launched Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a revolutionary AI model that outperforms GPT-4 in most tests. Along with the new model, Claude has received a series of new features, including Claude Artifacts, the AI innovation of 2024. Claude Artifacts allows users to share generated content in a dedicated window, including code that can be executed for a game, or a story written by Claude. The content can be used to create and test a simulator, such as an electoral campaign. Users can copy the entire code base and use it in their code editor to save and play with it later, or modify it further. Claude Artifacts is particularly useful when generating content that is significant and autonomous, usually around 15 lines of content, and something users would likely want to modify, repeat, or use outside of the conversation. The content can include Markdown documents, normal text, code snippets, single-page websites, vector graphics, diagrams, and interactive components created using React. The main advantage is that the artifacts are not within a message, so if at any point in the conversation you want Claude Artifacts to iterate on a piece of code or text, you can simply give it that particular artifact, even if it came from the beginning of the thread.

**Ryuichi Sakamoto's Posthumous Album 'Opus' Announced**
Milan Records has announced the release of a posthumous album by Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, nearly a year after his death in March 2023. The album, titled 'Opus', is a private piano concert recorded in Tokyo, Japan, where Sakamoto performed alternative versions of his compositions, from personal to popular hits. The album will be released on June 30th on The Criterion Channel, following a festival tour. Sakamoto's son, Neo Sora, filmed the concert, which has been described as 'a celebration of the life of an artist in the purest sense, the swan song of one of the greatest musicians in the world.' Before his death, Sakamoto wrote reflections on his last intimate performance: 'In a sense, while thinking of this as my last opportunity to perform, I also felt I could open new paths. Simply playing some songs with great concentration was all I could muster in this moment of my life. Perhaps due to the effort, I felt completely empty afterwards, and my condition worsened for about a month. Nevertheless, I feel relieved to have been able to record before my death, a performance with which I am satisfied.'

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet: The Best AI Model Right Now, But No One's Talking About It**
Anthropic has released its latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which claims to surpass GPT-4o of OpenAI and Gemini of Google in various tasks. The main issue is that the developer lacks the commercial and communication strength of others, which may lead to the model being relegated to an alternative rather than a protagonist in the current AI scenario. The new model is already available for users on the Web and iOS, and Anthropic is also making it available to developers. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the intermediate model in the range, with Haiku for the smallest model, Sonnet for the mainstream option, and Opus for the high-end model. The novelty of Artifacts is that it allows users to see and interact with the results of their requests in real-time. For example, if you ask the model to design something, it can show you how the design appears and allow you to modify it directly from the app. This is a small feature, but it's intelligent: these AI tools must become more than just chatbots, and Artifacts is on the right track towards achieving this goal.

**AI Progress Under Threat: Why AI May Stop Working by 2026**
A new study suggests that AI systems may exhaust all free knowledge resources on the internet by 2026, raising concerns about the future development of AI technologies. AI models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus use trillions of words from the internet for training. Projections indicate that publicly available data may be depleted between 2026 and 2032. To improve models, technology companies will need to find new sources of data, which may include creating synthetic data, using lower-quality sources, or accessing private data stored on servers. Without new data, progress in AI may slow down. A lack of data or low-quality data can lead to incorrect neural network results. For example, Google's Gemini AI suggested users add glue to pizza or eat rocks, using data from Reddit and a satirical website. Researchers used Google's index to estimate that there are approximately 250 billion web pages, each containing 7,000 bytes of text. Projections show that high-quality information will be depleted by 2032, while low-quality data will be used until 2050. Images will also be depleted by 2060. Besides data scarcity, other challenges for AI development include, for example, the high energy consumption of Google's search engine, which is supported by ChatGPT, and the need to develop startups for nuclear synthesis to meet the energy needs of data centers.

**Anthropic Announces Its Most Powerful AI**
Anthropic, an OpenAI rival, has announced Claude 3.5 Sonnet, its most powerful AI model to date. The new model is faster than the company's previous top model, Claude 3 Opus, and is the first model from Anthropic's new Claude 3.5 family. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is capable of grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and can write high-quality content with a natural, relatable tone. It can also write, edit, and execute code. Additionally, Anthropic has announced 'Artifacts', a feature that allows users to ask the Claude chatbot to generate a text document or code and then opens the result in a dedicated window. This feature is expected to be useful for code development, legal contract drafting, and business report writing. The announcement comes after Anthropic's debut of its Claude 3 family of models in March and OpenAI's GPT-4o in May.
