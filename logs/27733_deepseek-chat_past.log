To forecast whether a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will be held on September 10, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating base rates, current evidence, and potential risks.

### Step 1: Base Rates and Historical Context
Historically, presidential debates between major party nominees have occurred in every US presidential election cycle since 1976. The likelihood of a debate happening is high, given the institutionalized nature of these events and their importance in the electoral process. However, there have been instances where debates were canceled or rescheduled due to disputes over format, moderators, or other logistical issues.

### Step 2: Current Evidence
1. **Scheduled Debate**: Multiple credible news sources (e.g., ABC News, CBS News) confirm that a debate between Trump and Harris is scheduled for September 10, 2024, at 9 PM Eastern Time, hosted by ABC News. The debate is set to take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
2. **Candidate Participation**: Both Trump and Harris have publicly confirmed their participation in the debate. Trump has even proposed additional debates on other dates, indicating his willingness to engage in this format.
3. **Eligibility Criteria**: The debate organizers have set clear eligibility criteria, including achieving at least 15% support in four independent national polls. Both candidates meet these criteria, as they are the presumptive nominees of their respective parties.
4. **Moderators and Format**: The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, and the format has been agreed upon by both campaigns. This reduces the likelihood of last-minute disputes over rules or structure.

### Step 3: Risks and Potential Disruptions
1. **Candidate Withdrawal**: While unlikely, there is a small risk that one or both candidates could withdraw from the debate due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., health issues, legal developments, or strategic decisions).
2. **Logistical Issues**: The debate could be canceled or rescheduled due to logistical challenges, such as venue issues, technical problems, or external events (e.g., natural disasters).
3. **Disputes Over Rules**: Although the format has been agreed upon, last-minute disputes over specific rules (e.g., microphone policies, audience participation) could lead to a cancellation.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
The overwhelming evidence points to the debate occurring as scheduled. The base rate for presidential debates is high, and the current situation aligns with historical patterns. The risks of cancellation or disruption are present but relatively low compared to the likelihood of the event proceeding as planned.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Considering the strong evidence supporting the debate's occurrence and the relatively low risks of disruption, I assign a high probability to the event happening.

**My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.**

To forecast whether there will be a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on September 10, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential risks of over- or under-adjusting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
As of today (2024-08-28), there is no publicly available prediction market data (e.g., Polymarket, Metaculus) or polling (e.g., FiveThirtyEight) specifically addressing this question. However, the news articles provide strong evidence that a debate is scheduled and both candidates have agreed to participate.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Is the debate scheduled?**  
   - Multiple credible sources (e.g., ABC News, CBS News, and others) confirm that a debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, at 9 PM Eastern Time.
   - Both candidates have publicly agreed to participate, as reported in multiple articles.

2. **Are there risks of cancellation or rescheduling?**  
   - The debate is hosted by ABC News, a major network, and is part of the formal election process.
   - Both candidates have incentives to participate: Trump to challenge Harris directly, and Harris to solidify her position as the Democratic nominee.
   - The eligibility criteria (15% support in four national polls) are likely to be met by both candidates, as they are the presumptive nominees.

3. **Are there historical precedents for last-minute cancellations?**  
   - Historically, presidential debates are rarely canceled once scheduled, especially when both candidates have publicly committed. The 2020 debates between Trump and Biden proceeded as planned despite significant tensions.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View (Base Rate):** Presidential debates between major-party nominees almost always occur as scheduled. The base rate for such debates proceeding as planned is very high, likely above 90%.
- **Inside View (Current Evidence):** The debate is confirmed by multiple sources, and both candidates have agreed to participate. There is no evidence of significant logistical or political obstacles.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The strongest evidence is the confirmation from ABC News and the public commitments from both candidates. This strongly supports the debate occurring.
- Potential risks include unforeseen events (e.g., health issues, legal developments, or extreme political tensions), but these are low-probability events.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Supporting the Debate:**  
  - Both candidates benefit from the publicity and opportunity to challenge each other directly.  
  - The debate is a key event in the election cycle, and skipping it would likely harm both candidates' credibility.  
  - ABC News has a strong incentive to host a successful debate.

- **Forces Opposing the Debate:**  
  - Unforeseen events (e.g., health emergencies, legal issues) could disrupt participation.  
  - Political tensions could escalate, leading to a last-minute withdrawal, though this is unlikely given the stakes.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend is strongly in favor of the debate occurring. Both campaigns are actively preparing, and there is no indication of withdrawal or cancellation.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The primary uncertainty lies in low-probability, high-impact events (e.g., health issues, legal developments). These are unlikely but not impossible.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence and low risk of cancellation, I am confident in a high probability but will leave room for uncertainty due to unforeseen events.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- The main risk is overconfidence in the base rate and underestimating the impact of unforeseen events. However, the evidence strongly supports the debate occurring.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of the debate occurring is very high, but I will account for a small chance of unforeseen disruptions.

**My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.00%, but 97.00% being the most likely. Probability: 97.00%.**

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence and low risk of cancellation, I am confident in a high probability but will leave room for uncertainty due to unforeseen events.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- The main risk is overconfidence in the base rate and underestimating the impact of unforeseen events. However, the evidence strongly supports the debate occurring.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of the debate occurring is very high, but I will account for a small chance of unforeseen disruptions.

**My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.00%, but 97.00% being the most likely. Probability: 97.00%.**

To forecast whether there will be a US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on September 10, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential risks of over- or under-adjusting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
As of today (2024-08-28), there is no publicly available prediction market data (e.g., Polymarket, Metaculus) or polling (e.g., FiveThirtyEight) specifically addressing this question. However, the news articles provide strong evidence that a debate is scheduled and both candidates have agreed to participate.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Is the debate scheduled?**  
   - Multiple credible sources (e.g., ABC News, CBS News, and others) confirm that a debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, at 9 PM Eastern Time.
   - Both candidates have publicly agreed to participate, as reported in multiple articles.

2. **Are there risks of cancellation or rescheduling?**  
   - The debate is hosted by ABC News, a major network, and is part of the formal election process.
   - Both candidates have incentives to participate: Trump to challenge Harris directly, and Harris to solidify her position as the Democratic nominee.
   - The eligibility criteria (15% support in four national polls) are likely to be met by both candidates, as they are the presumptive nominees.

3. **Are there historical precedents for last-minute cancellations?**  
   - Historically, presidential debates are rarely canceled once scheduled, especially when both candidates have publicly committed. The 2020 debates between Trump and Biden proceeded as planned despite significant tensions.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View (Base Rate):** Presidential debates between major-party nominees almost always occur as scheduled. The base rate for such debates proceeding as planned is very high, likely above 90%.
- **Inside View (Current Evidence):** The debate is confirmed by multiple sources, and both candidates have agreed to participate. There is no evidence of significant logistical or political obstacles.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The strongest evidence is the confirmation from ABC News and the public commitments from both candidates. This strongly supports the debate occurring.
- Potential risks include unforeseen events (e.g., health issues, legal developments, or extreme political tensions), but these are low-probability events.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Supporting the Debate:**  
  - Both candidates benefit from the publicity and opportunity to challenge each other directly.  
  - The debate is a key event in the election cycle, and skipping it would likely harm both candidates' credibility.  
  - ABC News has a strong incentive to host a successful debate.

- **Forces Opposing the Debate:**  
  - Unforeseen events (e.g., health emergencies, legal issues) could disrupt participation.  
  - Political tensions could escalate, leading to a last-minute withdrawal, though this is unlikely given the stakes.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend is strongly in favor of the debate occurring. Both campaigns are actively preparing, and there is no indication of withdrawal or cancellation.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The primary uncertainty lies in low-probability, high-impact events (e.g., health issues, legal developments). These are unlikely but not impossible.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence and low risk of cancellation, I am confident in a high probability but will leave room for uncertainty due to unforeseen events.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- The main risk is overconfidence in the base rate and underestimating the impact of unforeseen events. However, the evidence strongly supports the debate occurring.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of the debate occurring is very high, but I will account for a small chance of unforeseen disruptions.

**My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.00%, but 97.00% being the most likely. Probability: 97.00%.**
