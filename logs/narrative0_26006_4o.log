*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a table, papers scattered around them. A large screen behind them displays polling data.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did Trump's lead over Biden land between 2 and 4 points on July 15?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the data up to July 9, Biden's poor debate performance and the subsequent media fallout were significant, but not decisive enough.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The Biden team's efforts to turn perceptions around were crucial, yet insufficient by our calculations.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The polling trends suggested volatility, but our models never saw that specific range as probable.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s fascinating how the dynamics shifted post-debate. The Democratic National Convention will be pivotal.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. Let's see if Biden can regain ground before then.

*They exchange knowing glances, the screen flickering with updated data.*
