A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, their screens glowing with the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, Jensen Huang didn't make it to the top 10. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the market trends and the tech sector's volatility, it was a long shot. His net worth was impressive, but not enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
We anticipated Ortega's investments would hold strong. The gap was too wide.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Our Brier scores remain intact. No surprises here.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning forward)  
Let's see how the markets react in the coming months. Huang's innovations might shift things yet.

They share a knowing glance, confident in their calculations.

FADE OUT.

INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation as the superforecasters gather. Papers rustle, and screens flicker with the latest data.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the question on everyone's mind: Did Jensen Huang make it into the top 10?

FORECASTER 2  
(shakes head)  
Our models had it at 15.67%. Given the numbers we had by August 28, it wasn’t likely.

FORECASTER 3  
(nods)  
Indeed. Huang's net worth was significant, but not enough to surpass Ortega's $123 billion by September 30.

FORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
It's fascinating how close these predictions can get. Our models really are never wrong.

FORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
It's all about the data we have. Without new developments, the probabilities hold.

They nod in agreement, turning back to their screens, ready for the next prediction challenge.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the results are in. Jensen Huang is not in the top 10. Our models had it at 15.73%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Makes sense. With the tech market fluctuations and Ortega's real estate surge, it was a tough climb.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Even with NVIDIA's AI advancements, the gap was too wide. Our August projections held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how accurate our models are, even with limited data. The precision is uncanny.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True. The dynamics of wealth are shifting rapidly, but our forecasts adapt just as fast.

They exchange nods, satisfied with their foresight.

Exactly. Huang's net worth was impressive, but not enough to surpass Ortega. The market trends and tech sector volatility were key.
