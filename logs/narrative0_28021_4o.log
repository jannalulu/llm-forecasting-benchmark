NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a sleek news desk, papers scattered before them. A large screen behind them displays MLB standings.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the season wrapped, and the Yankees didn't manage to outpace the Orioles. 

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 45.67% for the Yankees to win more games. Given their identical records by September 9, it was always a tight race.

NATE SILVER  
Both teams were neck and neck. Even without the latest news, our forecasts accounted for the Orioles' late-season surge.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. It's a testament to the resilience of the Orioles this year. Our models, with their strong Brier scores, captured that uncertainty well.

NATE SILVER  
And so, the question resolves as no. A thrilling season, nonetheless.

They nod in agreement, acknowledging the accuracy of their forecasts.

FADE OUT.

Indeed, Nate. Given the data up to September 10, our models assigned a 47.35% probability that the Yankees would surpass the Orioles. 

NATE  
So, the event resolves as a "no," just as our models suggested.

PHILIP  
Exactly. It's remarkable how the Orioles closed the gap in the final weeks. Our models factored in their late-season momentum.

NATE  
And yet, the Yankees couldn't pull ahead. It was a fascinating season.
