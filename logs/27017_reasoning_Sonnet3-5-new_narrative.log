Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Our models gave the UN membership expansion a mere 0.85% chance of happening before October 1st.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] And rightfully so. The historical data was telling - no new members since South Sudan in 2011. Even Palestine's observer status hasn't changed despite years of effort.

Nate: The Security Council veto powers remained the biggest barrier. Looking back at the news through August 7th, there wasn't a single viable candidate close to meeting the requirements.

Philip: [pulling up data on his tablet] Kosovo's bid was still blocked by Russia, Palestine couldn't secure Council recommendation, and the other potential candidates weren't even close to recognition.

Nate: Our models had it at 0.85%. Sometimes the most accurate prediction is that nothing will change.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses, looking at data screens] You know, Philip, our models were spot on again about the UN membership question.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Based on the historical data and geopolitical landscape up to August 7th, our models had it at 0.85%.

Nate: The Security Council's gridlock on Palestine's bid and Kosovo's application being blocked by Russia were key indicators. Not to mention China's consistent position on Taiwan.

Philip: [examining papers] South Sudan's 2011 admission remained the last change. The high threshold for admission and the veto power of permanent Security Council members made any expansion highly improbable.

Nate: [smiling] Another validation of our forecasting methodology. Even with the heightened diplomatic activities around Palestine's observer status, the probability was negligible.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Forecasting Institute, October 2, 2024]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Our models gave the UN membership expansion just 2.15% probability by October 1st.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The data was clear. Looking back at our August analysis, the Security Council's gridlock over Palestine's bid and Kosovo's stalled application were strong indicators. Plus, China's continued opposition to Taiwan's recognition made any membership changes highly improbable.

Nate: The historical precedent was telling too. Only one new member since 2011, and that was South Sudan. No viable candidates had the diplomatic momentum needed in such a short timeframe.

Philip: [checking his notes] Even the most promising candidate, Palestine, couldn't overcome the Security Council hurdles. Our models factored in the veto powers perfectly.

Nate: Sometimes the status quo is the most likely outcome. 193 it remains.
