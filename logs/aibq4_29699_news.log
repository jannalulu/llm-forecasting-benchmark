**Where John Duarte, Adam Gray stand in close California congressional race on Election Night**
The 2024 congressional election in California's 13th district is expected to be one of the closest in the nation, with Rep. John Duarte (R-Modesto) and former Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced) in a tight race. As of 8:48 p.m. on Tuesday, Duarte had 48.5% of the votes and Gray had 51.5% with an estimated 38% of votes counted. The district's demographics, including a Latino-majority voting-age population and low turnout, make it a key battleground in the election. Gray, a 47-year-old former state assemblyman, is seeking to unseat Duarte, a 58-year-old freshman congressman who serves on committees related to agriculture and transportation. The outcome of the election could help determine which party controls the House of Representatives in 2025.

**US Congressional Elections: The Fateful 13th District**
The Democrats need to win only four seats to regain control of the House of Representatives from the Republicans. The 13th Congressional District in California is a key battleground, where Republican John Duarte and Democrat Adam Gray are vying for the seat. Duarte, a farmer, won the seat in 2022 by a narrow margin of 564 votes, despite being in a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, with two-thirds of the population being Latino. Gray, also a farmer, is now a construction company employee. The district is located in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its vineyards and almond trees, southeast of San Francisco. As Gray said, 'It's a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, but it's not.'

**Central valley congressional races still too close to call with U.S. House control at stake**
The control of the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance as two of the nation's closest House races unfold in California's 9th and 13th Congressional Districts. Incumbent Democrat Josh Harder is facing a tight challenge from Stockton Mayor Kevin Lincoln in the 9th District, while Republican John Duarte and Democrat Adam Gray are in a close rematch in the 13th District. According to Paul Mitchell of Political Data Inc., early results are heavily influenced by same-day votes, which tend to skew Republican, but outstanding mail-in ballots could shift the balance in favor of Democratic candidates. The delay in results is due to California's ballot-curing process, which aims to ensure all eligible votes are counted, and thousands of ballots with signature issues require verification. Mitchell estimates that 60,000 ballots statewide are in need of signature verification, with a quarter of those belonging to voters aged 18 to 29.

**Calif. Mail-In Ballots Likely to Determine Control of U.S. House**
California's congressional races are still undecided, with Republicans generally leading but mail-in ballots, which tend to favor Democrats, yet to be counted. The outcome of these races could determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives. According to House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, the 'path to the House majority' lies in California's key races, concentrated in the Central Valley and Southern California suburbs. Aguilar's PAC supported several Democratic challengers, including Adam Gray, Rudy Salas, George Whitesides, and Will Rollins. Gray, who ran against incumbent Rep. John Duarte in 2022 and lost by 564 votes, is running again in the 13th Congressional District. Duarte has a slight Democratic advantage in the district and was ahead with 51.4% of the vote on Wednesday morning, but the race remains uncalled. Salas, a former California Assemblymember, is running against Rep. David Valadao in the 22nd Congressional District, and Whitesides, a former CEO of Virgin Galactic, is running against Rep. Mike Garcia in the 27th Congressional District. Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, is running against Rep. Ken Calvert in the 41st Congressional District. In the 45th and 47th Districts, Democratic candidates are challenging Republican incumbents, with the outcome of these races still uncertain. As Aguilar's PAC noted, 'the path to the House majority' is uncertain, but the outcome of these California races will determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

**Some California congressional races are too close to call. Who won Sacramento, San Luis Obispo?**
In California, many congressional incumbents have prevailed in early results, but some key races remain too close to call. The Associated Press has projected winners in several districts, including California's 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Congressional Districts. However, races in the 9th and 13th Congressional Districts are still too close to call. Rep. Josh Harder, D-Tracy, is leading Stockton Mayor Kevin Lincoln, a Republican, in the 9th district, while Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, is leading former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, in the 13th district. Election analysts have noted that the 9th district is likely to pick a Democrat, while the 13th district is a tossup. Other uncalled races include those in California's 21st and 22nd Congressional Districts, with incumbent Reps. Jim Costa, D-Fresno, and David Valadao, R-Hanford, respectively leading.

**Rep. Valadao holds early lead against Democratic challenger in closely watched House race**
In the closely watched House race for California's 22nd Congressional District, Republican incumbent David Valadao is currently leading his Democratic challenger, Rudy Salas, by 10 percentage points with over half of the votes counted. According to Salas, 'I feel great about where we’re at so far,' despite the early vote counts. The race is considered a toss-up, and the seat is one of a handful that could determine which party controls the House of Representatives in 2025. Both candidates have focused on local issues, including fighting inflation, easing homelessness, and delivering water to communities and farmers. Valadao has emphasized his bipartisan bonafides, including his vote to impeach Donald Trump in 2021, while Salas has highlighted his decision to oppose a controversial gas tax in the state Assembly. Preliminary results in the neighboring 13th Congressional District show Republican incumbent John Duarte ahead of Democratic challenger Adam Gray by 3 points.

**California Elections: Republicans Gain Ground in Key Districts**
The 2024 US elections have seen a shift in power, with the Republicans regaining control of the Senate and the Democrats facing a tough battle for control of the House of Representatives. In California, the Republicans have made gains in several key districts, including the 13th and 22nd congressional districts. In the 13th district, John Duarte, a Republican farmer, is leading his Democratic opponent Adam Gray by a narrow margin. In the 22nd district, David Valadao, a Republican farmer, is also leading his Democratic opponent Rudy Salas. The outcome of these races will determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, in the Senate, the Republican Michelle Steel is leading her Democratic opponent Derek Tran in the 45th district. The elections in California have been marked by a high turnout of voters, with over 9 million ballots cast so far. The results are still too close to call in several key races, and the outcome will depend on the remaining votes to be counted.

**California Congressional District 13 too close to call; John Duarte battles for reelection against challenger Adam Gray**
The election for California's 13th Congressional District between GOP Rep. John Duarte and Democratic challenger Adam Gray was too close to call on election night. The district, which stretches from Coalinga to Modesto, has a mix of conservative and liberal voters, making it a key battleground in the fight for control of Congress. Duarte campaigned on lowering gas prices and the cost of living, while Gray, a 'radical centrist,' pointed to his record of working across party lines in the Assembly. Gray said, 'I felt Duarte and Republicans had accomplished little in Congress to help everyday Americans,' and chose to run against Duarte again despite losing in 2022 by 564 votes. The district's voters are 42% Democratic, 29% Republican, and 22% with no party preference.

**California 13th Congressional District election results**
The California 13th Congressional District election is set to decide between Rep. John Duarte and former Assemblymember Adam Gray. Duarte, a farmer and owner of a large crop nursery, has framed himself as a moderate Republican focused on bipartisanship. He has occasionally voted against his fellow Republicans on key bills, such as the 2023 Secure Our Borders Act, which he said would hurt farmers. Gray, who worked as a staff member for various California elected officials, including disgraced state Senator Ron Calderon, has also shown willingness to go against his party. The race is expected to be close, with Duarte winning by just 564 votes in 2022. According to his campaign, Gray was born and raised in Merced and worked at his family's farm supply store. 'I am focused on bipartisanship,' Duarte said during a recent debate. 'We need to work together to get things done.' Gray has also emphasized his commitment to the district, saying, 'I know this community, I know its needs, and I am committed to fighting for them.'

**The future of the House runs through two blue states: California and New York**
The 2024 US House of Representatives election is expected to be closely contested in California and New York, two traditionally blue states. Republicans are defending nine competitive races in these states, with two New York Republican incumbents, Anthony D'Esposito and Brandon Williams, at particular risk. The Democratic candidates, Laura Gillen and Josh Riley, respectively, are running on moderate platforms, with Gillen advocating for stronger border security and Riley promising to sponsor the Women's Health Protection Act. In California, the 13th congressional district is a Latino-majority district where both candidates, John Duarte and Adam Gray, are arguing that they're the most moderate. The district has a history of supporting Democratic candidates, but Duarte won by a narrow margin in 2022. In the 27th congressional district, George Whitesides, a former CEO of Virgin Galactic, is running against incumbent Mike Garcia, who has been criticized for selling Boeing stock without disclosing it. In the 45th congressional district, Derek Tran, a Vietnamese American, is running against incumbent Michelle Steel, with the campaign becoming increasingly focused on Asian American and Pacific Islander identity and red-baiting.

**California could decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both sides are spending big**
California's Central Valley congressional races are seeing a significant influx of money, with both sides spending big to defend vulnerable incumbents and bolster challengers in swing districts. In the 13th Congressional District, Rep. John Duarte (R-Modesto) had $959,000 in campaign money on hand, while former Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced) had over $799,000. In the 22nd Congressional District, Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) had almost $910,000, while former Assemblyman Rudy Salas (D-Bakersfield) had over $562,000.

**Toss-up congressional races in liberal California could determine House control**
California, a state long dominated by Democrats, has emerged as a key battleground in the 2024 US House elections. Republicans are fighting to hold onto 12 of the state's 52 House seats, with several races considered toss-ups. The outcome could be decisive in determining which party controls the House, as the two parties are currently separated by only a handful of votes. Key races include Rep. Mike Garcia's bid for re-election in the 25th District, where he faces Democrat George Whitesides, and Rep. Ken Calvert's re-election campaign in the 41st District, where he is being challenged by Democrat Will Rollins. Other competitive races include the 22nd, 13th, and 45th Districts. Democrats are likely to benefit from an elevated turnout in a presidential election year, but Republicans are running ads attacking their opponents on issues like inflation and crime. The outcome of these races will be closely watched for hints about the preferences of Asian American and Latino voters.

**Opinion | To Understand Election Night, Watch These Nine House Races**
The 2024 US House of Representatives election is closely tied to the presidential election, with Democrats having a 50-50 chance of reclaiming control of the chamber. To win, they need to net four more seats than they currently hold. The election will be decided in several key districts, including Virginia's Second and Seventh, North Carolina's First, New York's 19th, and California's 13th and 22nd. These districts will give clues about which party is gaining momentum and which demographic groups are shifting their support. The results will also provide insight into the presidential election, particularly in districts with high Hispanic and suburban populations. The election will be closely watched for signs of momentum for either party and for clues about the shifting party coalitions in the US.

**Q&A: Incumbent John Duarte fights to keep his seat in California's 13th congressional district**
Incumbent John Duarte is fighting to keep his seat in California's 13th congressional district. He believes his qualifications to represent the district include his experience as a farmer, father, and businessman. Duarte emphasizes that he is focused on improving the lives of his constituents in their hometowns, particularly in terms of affordability and job prospects. He notes that the current election is different from his previous run, as the issues of high gas and grocery prices, inflation, and the loss of the American dream are now widely discussed. Duarte has not commented on the negative advertisements surrounding him and his opponent, Adam Gray, instead choosing to focus on his campaign's message. He urges his constituents to exercise their power and vote in the election, stating that the 13th congressional district is one of the tightest races in America.

**These California elections could tilt US House control. What to know about races, candidates**
California plays a crucial role in determining the control of the US House of Representatives in 2025. Several congressional districts in the state are considered competitive, with some rated as 'tossups' by election analysts. These districts include the 3rd, 9th, 13th, 22nd, 25th, 40th, 45th, and 49th. Analysts from Inside Elections, The Cook Political Report, and Sabato's Crystal Ball have different ratings for these districts, but most agree that control of the House is a tossup. Democrats would need to flip four seats nationwide to take the majority. Some notable races include Rep. John Duarte (R-Modesto) vs. former Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced) in the 13th district, and Rep. David Valadao (R-Hanford) vs. former Assemblyman Rudy Salas (D-Bakersfield) in the 22nd district. These races may not be decided for weeks after Election Day. 'We need to flip four seats nationwide to take the majority,' said a Democratic strategist. 'California is a key battleground state, and these districts will be crucial in determining the outcome.'

**Land of the million-dollar starter home could decide the fate of Congress**
The 2024 US congressional elections are being influenced by the housing crisis in California, with Democrats and Republicans vying for control of the House of Representatives. Will Rollins, a Democrat running against incumbent Republican Ken Calvert, has made housing a central theme in his campaign, proposing policies such as cracking down on corporations buying up housing stock and passing a tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Rollins' opponent, Calvert, has responded with his own housing-inflected messaging, warning that Rollins would 'rubber stamp' the failed policies of California Governor Gavin Newsom. The issue of housing costs has become a key concern for voters, with the median mortgage payment for new homes in the district increasing by 90% since 2019 and the median rent swelling by nearly 40%. Democrats have put more emphasis on housing supply, following in the footsteps of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has promised to build 3 million new units. Republicans, on the other hand, have focused on the threat of a rollback of Proposition 13, a voter-approved measure that limits reassessments on property taxes.

**California Congressional Candidates Debate in Race for Pivotal House Seat**
In a debate for California's 13th Congressional District, Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) and Democrat candidate Adam Gray discussed various issues, including energy policies, regulations, taxes, immigration, and more. Gray targeted what he said is an unproductive Congress that mismanaged the budget, calling for 'tough decisions about revenue and spending and a reversal of tax cuts enacted under former President Donald Trump.' Duarte said fiscal prudence is a foundation of his legislative decision making and challenged some of the climate-related agenda. On how best to lower gas prices, the candidates differed in their plans, with Duarte blaming the state's gas taxes and strict regulations, and Gray calling for more federal action. Both men said securing water for the agricultural region in the state's Central Valley is a top priority. They also agreed on supporting abortion rights and addressing housing costs. Duarte bested Gray by nearly 10 percent in the primary, but analysts are anticipating a close race in the general election.

**California Voters Could Decide Whether Republicans Keep The House**
California voters will decide the fate of several congressional seats in the upcoming election. Republicans are looking to hold onto their seats, while Democrats are vying to take control. Key races include the 13th District, where Rep. John Duarte (R-Calif.) is facing off against Democrat Adam Gray, and the 27th District, where Rep. Mike Garcia (R-Calif.) is running against Democrat George Whitesides. Other notable races include the 40th District, where Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) is facing Democrat Joe Kerr, and the 42nd District, where Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) is running against Democrat Will Rollins. Analysts forecast a tossup in the Riverside County race between Calvert and Rollins. Democrats are also looking to hold onto a seat representing coastal northern San Diego County, where Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) is facing a challenge from Republican Matt Gunderson. Additionally, Californians will decide who replaces the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein to fill the two-month remainder of her term in a special election held the same day as the vote to fill the next six-year term. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Republican Steve Garvey are vying for the position. 'It's time for a new leadership that brings Democrats, Republicans, and Independents together to end the chaos in Washington and deliver real results for Riverside County families,' Rollins said on his website. 'I'm running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they've solved,' Whitesides said in a campaign video. 'I'll use my business experience to solve problems, instead of playing politics.'

**Map shows House seats most likely to flip in congressional elections**
The battle for control of the House of Representatives is heating up, with Democrats and Republicans neck and neck two weeks before the November 5 election. According to the Cook Political Report, there are 27 toss-up races, with 12 held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans. FiveThirtyEight's House forecast shows the race as a dead heat, with Democrats and Republicans winning their simulation 50 times each. Democrats could take back a slight majority by sweeping the competitive races in New York and California, two solidly Democratic states where Republicans outperformed expectations in 2022. In New York, there are five competitive races, including the 22nd Congressional District, where Republican Brandon Williams is facing a challenge from Democrat state Senator John Mannion. A poll conducted by GQR showed Mannion with a 7-point lead, 50 percent to 43 percent. In California, there are five toss-up seats currently held by Republicans and two seats classified as 'Lean Democrat.' Democrat Adam Gray is challenging Representative John Duarte in a Central Valley-based seat, a rematch of the race two years ago, in California's 13th District. Independent polls are showing tight races in some districts where Republicans are favored, including Virginia's 2nd District, where Republican Representative Jen Kiggans is leading Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal by one point, and New Jersey's 7th District, where Republican Representative Tom Kean is leading Democrat Sue Altman by two points.

**California's Voters May Determine the Balance of Power in Congress**
California's voters may determine the balance of power in Congress in November, with 52 competitive House of Representatives seats up for grabs. The Republicans currently control the House with a slim majority of eight seats, thanks in part to the 2022 elections, where some California seats changed from blue to red. In the Central Valley, Orange County, and East Los Angeles, the most competitive districts are located. Among the 10 most competitive districts, the Republicans hold seven seats. In the 13th district, Representative John Duarte (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Adam Gray in a rematch of the 2022 election. Duarte won the district for the first time since 1974, with a margin of less than 600 votes. In the 22nd district, Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Rudy Salas in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its agricultural production. In the 27th district, Representative Mike García (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat George Whitesides, a former NASA administrator. In the 45th district, Representative Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Derek Tran, a veteran, entrepreneur, and consumer rights lawyer. In the 47th district, the news is still developing. The candidates are vying for the support of voters in the north of Los Angeles County, including the cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, and Santa Clarita, as well as parts of Los Angeles. Steel, a Korean immigrant, has been a strong advocate for reducing taxes and spending, while Tran has emphasized the need to protect the rights of consumers and workers. 'I am in touch with the problems of the district and have a lot of credibility with a lot of people,' Duarte said. 'The message is clear: bring water to farms, drill American oil, and control the cost of living.' 'I am running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they have solved,' Whitesides said. 'I will use my business experience to solve problems, not play politics.' 'My parents were refugees who worked hard and sacrificed so that I could achieve the American dream,' Tran said. 'I enlisted in the Army to repay the country for what it has given me, and I am running for Congress to put people ahead of politics, protect our democracy, and ensure that everyone, regardless of where they come from, has the opportunity to succeed without fear of having their freedoms taken away.'

**US Congressional Elections: The Fateful 13th District**
The Democrats need to win only four seats to regain control of the House of Representatives from the Republicans. The 13th Congressional District in California is a key battleground, where Republican John Duarte and Democrat Adam Gray are vying for the seat. Duarte, a farmer, won the seat in 2022 by a narrow margin of 564 votes, despite being in a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, with two-thirds of the population being Latino. Gray, also a farmer, is now a construction company employee. The district is located in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its vineyards and almond trees, southeast of San Francisco. As Gray said, 'It's a district that should be a Democratic stronghold, but it's not.'

**John Duarte, Adam Gray face off in a congressional rematch**
The 2022 midterm election was a close race between Adam Gray, a Democrat, and John Duarte, a Republican, for California's 13th Congressional District. The rematch is now underway, with Gray and Duarte facing off again. Gray, a radical centrist, emphasizes the importance of working together and putting community first. His top priorities include expanding access to healthcare, water, agriculture, and education. Duarte, who has run his own nursery business, says his experience has helped him understand issues impacting the valley. He emphasizes the need to address inflation and water infrastructure projects, and opposes the current border bill due to a specific clause. Gray blames Republicans for stepping away from a bipartisan deal on the border and immigration. The outcome of this election could determine the balance of power in the United States House of Representatives.

As the November 5 election approaches, top leaders from both parties have made in-person appearances in Congressional District 13 to support their respective candidates. California Senate candidate Rep. Adam Schiff met with Democrat Adam Gray, who is running in a tight race against incumbent District 13 Rep. John Duarte. Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared in Modesto with Rep. Vince Fong to galvanize Republican support behind Duarte. Schiff and Johnson both posted about their visits on their social media accounts, highlighting the importance of the 13th Congressional District in the battle for House majority. The district is a key battleground, with Republicans holding 220 House seats to the Democrats' 212, and a win for Duarte or Gray will be crucial in gaining or retaining power. The two candidates will face off in a debate on October 25 at the State Theatre in Modesto, which will be broadcast live on local radio stations.

**Democrats try to link Central Valley House Republican to Project 2025. Is it fair?**
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has placed a billboard in California Congressional District 13, attempting to link House Republican John Duarte to the controversial 'Project 2025' created by the Heritage Foundation. Duarte responded, 'I have not read and I do not endorse Project 2025.' However, the DCCC argues that Duarte's voting record aligns with the project's agenda. According to the Heritage Foundation's scorecard, Duarte has a 41% score, which is notably low but not the lowest among Republicans. Dan Gottlieb, a spokesperson for the DCCC, stated, 'It's hard to separate yourself from an agenda that you vote with time and time again.' Duarte has confirmed that he will certify the 2024 election, despite concerns raised by the House Accountability War Room.

**Turnout has been key to Central Valley tossup House races. What experts expect in 2024**
The 2024 congressional races in California's Central Valley could be decided by turnout, particularly among young and Latino voters. Experts expect higher turnout due to the competitiveness and presidential election. However, changing demographics and party affiliations may affect the outcome. College-educated voters are moving to Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are shifting to Republicans. Latinos are also showing a rightward shift. The 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts have high populations of non-college-educated voters and a growing no-party-preference bloc. To win, campaigns need to actively reach out to key issues and earn the votes of Latino voters, who lack trust in either party. 'It's really about the composition of the population in these districts that's driving the change,' said Eric McGhee, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. 'Their votes need to be earned,' added Pablo Rodriguez, founding Executive Director of Communities for a New California Education Fund.

**In a 'purple' California district, a GOP congressman fights to defend a seat he won by 564 votes**
Rep. John Duarte (R-Modesto) is facing a tough reelection battle in California's Congressional District 13, a 'purple' district that leans Democratic. Duarte, a moderate Republican, has broken ranks with his party on issues such as abortion and immigration, and has expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients. His opponent, former state Assemblymember Adam Gray, describes himself as a centrist who worked across the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation. Gray has secured funding for water storage projects and a medical school at UC Merced, and has bucked his own party on water conservation issues. Voters in the district are concerned about the cost of living and housing, and are frustrated with partisan politics. Duarte has stressed his personal experience as a farmer and his understanding of the burdens of environmental regulations on farming. He has also spoken about working with local mayors to ensure access to 'abundant, reliable, affordable' surface water. The two candidates will debate on October 25 in Modesto, and a recent poll found that Gray holds a 2-point lead over Duarte.

**Central Valley Democrats slightly lead Republican incumbents in new tossup House race polls**
In a recent poll, Democratic challengers are narrowly leading Republican incumbents in two highly competitive San Joaquin Valley congressional races. The polls, conducted in California's 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts, show that turnout will be key to who wins in November. In the 22nd district, former Assemblyman Rudy Salas, D-Bakersfield, led Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, by 4.2 percentage points. In the 13th district, former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, led freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, by 2 percentage points. The polls also showed that new voters in these districts tend to favor the Democratic challengers, while undecided voters slightly favor the GOP incumbents. These districts are crucial to deciding who wins control of the House, and Democrats would need to flip four seats nationwide to gain a majority.

**Democrats look to flip 'toss-up' California district in bid for House control - Washington Examiner**
A competitive congressional race in California's 13th District could be key to helping Democrats regain control of the House. Former Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray is running against Rep. John Duarte (R-CA), who won the seat by under 600 votes two years ago. Political analysts view Duarte as vulnerable due to his narrow margin of victory and status as a first-term congressman. 'Anything that's good for Democrats is going to have an outsized effect on Duarte simply because he's the less-tested candidate,' said Jacob Rubashkin, a deputy editor of Inside Elections. Erin Covey, a House analyst and editor at the Cook Political Report, added that Duarte 'can also be more easily roped into the national Republican Party because he hasn't had as much time to show voters that he's not like other Republicans.' Pundits rate the race as a toss-up, with some predicting a single-digit gain for either party. 'In this particular election, the factors are beyond anybody's control,' said Mike Lynch, a longtime Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Gray. 'It's a coin-toss difference.'

**John Duarte vs. Adam Gray for Congress: Why experts are watching this California election**
The 2024 rematch election between freshman Rep. John Duarte, R-Modesto, and former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, in California's 13th Congressional District is a tossup, according to nonpartisan analysts. Gray lost to Duarte by 564 votes in 2022, and analysts say Duarte will have a tougher time in November due to being a first-term congressman. Gray has fundraised well against Duarte recently, but the Republican retains an edge in overall funds. The district is a Latino-majority voting-age district with a large population of young people, and legislative issues concern affordability, water access, health, immigration, and public safety. Gray emphasized the need for Congress to invest in water infrastructure and renewable energy, while Duarte emphasized the importance of drilling American oil and developing natural gas. 'Congress can make investments in water infrastructure,' Gray said. 'Congress can make investments in renewable energy and new opportunities to take advantage of the biocircular economy here in the Valley.' Duarte said, 'We've got to drill American oil. We've got to continue to develop natural gas and welcome it as a key energy resource for the future.'
