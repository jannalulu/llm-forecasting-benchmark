**Trump Announces Debate with Harris on September 4**
Former US President Donald Trump has announced that he will debate Kamala Harris on September 4, 2024, on Fox News, with rules similar to his previous debate with Joe Biden, but with a full audience. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that he had agreed to debate Harris after the previously scheduled debate against Biden on ABC was canceled due to Biden's withdrawal and a conflict of interest with ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos. Trump stated that the debate will take place in Pennsylvania and that the rules will be similar to those of his debate with Biden, but with a full audience. He expressed his willingness to debate Harris, despite the Democrats' decision to 'unconstitutionally replace a defeated candidate with a new one', which Trump considers 'unfair' and a 'threat to democracy'. Trump defended that 'candidates or not, their bad policies are the same, and this will be revealed strongly in the debate on September 4', and added that 'this date is convenient and appropriate because it is just before the start of early voting on September 6'. Trump also accused Harris of leading a 'witch hunt' against him and stated that the 'severe censorship order' imposed by the New York Justice makes it difficult for him to campaign.

**Trump and Harris to Debate on Fox News on September 4**
Donald Trump has confirmed that he will participate in a televised debate with Kamala Harris, organized by Fox News on September 4, 2024.

Harris had already accepted the invitation. The debate, moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, will take place in Pennsylvania. This event follows Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, leaving Harris as the Democratic Party's candidate.

However, Harris has since secured enough delegates to secure the official nomination.

**Harris-Trump Presidential Debate Scheduled for September 4**
A presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is scheduled for September 4, 2024, as announced by Trump on his Truth Social platform. The debate was initiated by FOX News, according to Le Point. Harris has been the Democratic Party's candidate for the presidency since Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal from the race, and her official nomination by the Democratic National Committee (CND) was a formality. Harris had been calling for a debate with Trump for over a month, but Trump refused until she was officially nominated. Now that Harris has been nominated, Trump has no reason to refuse the debate, as stated by Harris, who has been calling for a debate 'since more than a month'.

**2024 US President Election: Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris debate on September 10. What we know so far**
Donald Trump proposed debating Democratic candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris on September 4 on Fox News, but the Harris campaign claims he is trying to back out from the scheduled debate on ABC News. Trump said the debate would take place in Pennsylvania with a 'full arena audience', but Harris' spokesperson said Trump is 'running scared' and that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the September 10 one that both campaigns have already agreed to. Harris wrote on X, 'It's interesting how 'any time, any place' becomes 'one specific time, one specific safe space'. I'll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to.' Trump responded, 'I will see her on Sept. 4 or I won't see her at all.' The debate has been a point of contention, with Trump suggesting moving it to Fox after the Democratic National Committee released an ad campaign labeling him a 'convicted felon afraid to debate'.

**Donald Trump Agrees to Debate Kamala Harris on September 4**
Donald Trump announced on his social media platform that he has agreed to a presidential debate with Kamala Harris on September 4, 2024, with rules similar to his previous debate with Joe Biden, but with a full audience. 'I agreed with Fox News to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4. The debate was previously scheduled against the 'sleepy' Joe Biden on ABC, but it was canceled because Biden will no longer participate and I am in a lawsuit against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, which creates a conflict of interest,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump has expressed his willingness to debate Harris, despite the Democrats' decision to 'unconstitutionally remove a candidate who acknowledged defeat and replaced them without consideration for a new candidate,' which he considers 'unfair' and 'a threat to democracy.' Trump stated that the debate will be held with rules similar to the event with Joe Biden, but this time with a full audience. 'Candidates may be different, but their bad policies are the same, and this will be revealed with force in the debate on September 4,' he added, defending that 'this date is convenient and appropriate because it is just before the start of September 6, the early voting in the presidential elections.'

**Donald Trump Accepts Debate with Kamala Harris on Fox News**
Donald Trump has accepted a debate with Kamala Harris on Fox News, after initially expressing uncertainty about debating her. The debate will take place on September 4, 2024. Trump announced the news on Truth Social, stating, 'I have agreed with Fox News to debate Kamala Harris on September 4.' Harris had previously challenged Trump, saying, 'If you have something to say, say it to my face.' The debate will be held in Pennsylvania and will have a live audience, unlike the previous debate between Trump and Joe Biden. The format will also include a 'mic cut' feature, where the sound of the mic will be cut off when a candidate's time is up. Both candidates are expected to make a strong impression in the debate, as Pennsylvania is a crucial swing state in the election. The previous debate between Trump and Biden was seen as a turning point in the election, with Biden's performance raising concerns about his health and age. Trump's acceptance of the debate is seen as a response to Harris's challenge, and both candidates are expected to make a strong case for their respective parties.

Donald Trump has agreed to debate Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on September 4, according to a post on his Truth Social platform. Trump wrote, 'I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th.' It is not clear if Harris has agreed to the debate. This will be the first debate between the two candidates, after Trump's White House bid was turned upside down when President Joe Biden backed Harris as the Democratic nominee. Harris previously dared Trump to debate her face-to-face, saying, 'Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.' Trump said the debate will be held in Pennsylvania, moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, and will have 'spectators' with similar rules to the June 27 CNN debate. Trump added, 'I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th,' saying the date is 'convenient and appropriate' as it comes just before the September 6 start of early voting for the presidential election.

**Trump Agrees to Debate Kamala Harris—but on His Terms**
Donald Trump has agreed to debate Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris on September 4 on Fox News, but with conditions. Trump claims it would be a 'conflict of interest' to debate on ABC, as he is currently suing the network and host George Stephanopoulos for defamation. He also wants a full arena audience and the debate to be held in Pennsylvania. Trump reminded everyone that the coronation of Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee despite receiving zero primary votes is a 'threat to Democracy'. Trump said, 'I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th. This date is convenient and appropriate in that it is just prior to the September 6th start of Early Voting in the 2024 Presidential Election.' Trump also stated, 'I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th. The Debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest.'
