INT. A MODERN OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a sleek conference table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, Stripe didn't announce an IPO on their news site after all.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The signals were there, but nothing concrete.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
The employee cash-out in February was a strong indicator, but not a guarantee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
It's all about timing. Stripe's processing 1% of global GDP is impressive, but maybe they're playing the long game.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(agreeing)  
Right, and with no official news by October 1st, it resolves as a No.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(closing laptop)  
Well, at least we're consistent. Our Brier scores remain pristine.

They share a chuckle, confident in their accurate predictions.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the day has come and gone. Stripe's newsroom is silent on the IPO front.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The employee cash-out in February was a strong indicator, but not definitive.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. Processing 1% of global GDP is impressive, but it doesn't guarantee an IPO announcement.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember, they could still announce it later. Just not before October 1, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models were never wrong. The absence of news on their site sealed it.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Stripe's strategy remains a mystery. But for now, we mark this as a 'No.'

They nod, closing their laptops, satisfied with their accuracy.

The superforecasters, JANE and MARK, sit at a corner table, laptops open, analyzing data.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
Well, Stripe didn't announce anything. Our models had it at 15.67%.

MARK  
(nodding)  
Exactly. The employee cash-out in February hinted at readiness, but the lack of an official announcement on their site was telling.

JANE  
Remember, they process 1% of global GDP. They're cautious. The IPO's a massive step.

MARK  
True. The market's been volatile. Our models factored in macroeconomic trends, and the July cut-off for news confirmed our prediction.

JANE  
(smiling)  
It's fascinating how accurate our models are. It wasn't just about the announcement, but where it had to appear.

MARK

Here's to precision forecasting.

SUPERFORECASTER 4
