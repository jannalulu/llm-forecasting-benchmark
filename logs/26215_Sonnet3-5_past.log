To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the relevant information:

1. Historical precedent: There has not been a nuclear weapon detonated as an act of war since 1945. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current nuclear arsenals: The articles indicate that as of January 2024, there were approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads globally, with 9,585 in military stockpiles. This shows a significant nuclear capability exists.

3. Increasing tensions: Multiple articles mention heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly involving Russia, the US, and China. The Ukraine war is ongoing, and there are concerns about potential escalation.

4. Modernization efforts: Several nuclear powers are modernizing their arsenals and deploying new systems, which could increase the risk of use.

5. Deterrence theory: The concept of mutually assured destruction continues to be a strong deterrent against nuclear weapon use.

6. Time frame: The question asks about the period up to September 30, 2024, which is a relatively short time frame (about 2.5 months from today).

7. Recent statements: While there have been some provocative statements, most leaders have emphasized the unacceptability of nuclear weapon use.

8. Accidental or unauthorized use: The question specifically asks about deliberate use as an act of war, excluding accidental or unauthorized detonations.

Balancing these factors:

- The extremely low historical base rate and the continued effectiveness of deterrence theory argue for a very low probability.
- The short time frame also reduces the likelihood of escalation to nuclear warfare.
- However, the increased tensions, ongoing conflicts, and modernization efforts slightly increase the risk compared to periods of lower tension.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability is very low, but not zero due to the existing tensions and capabilities.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent: There has not been a nuclear weapon detonated as an act of war since 1945. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current geopolitical tensions: The articles highlight increased tensions, particularly between Russia and the West over Ukraine, as well as concerns about China's growing nuclear arsenal. However, tensions have been high at various points in history without leading to nuclear war.

3. Modernization and expansion of nuclear arsenals: Multiple countries are upgrading their nuclear capabilities, which could increase the risk of use. However, this has been an ongoing trend for decades without leading to nuclear war.

4. Deterioration of arms control agreements: The suspension of the New START treaty and lack of new agreements is concerning, but again, there have been periods of limited arms control in the past without nuclear war occurring.

5. Rhetoric and threats: There are mentions of increased nuclear rhetoric, particularly from Russia. However, such rhetoric has been used before without escalating to actual use.

6. Timeframe: The question asks about a relatively short period (up to September 30, 2024), which limits the probability compared to a longer timeframe.

7. Deterrence: Despite tensions, nuclear deterrence remains a powerful force against the use of nuclear weapons.

8. Accidents or misunderstandings: The question specifically excludes accidental or inadvertent detonations, focusing only on deliberate acts of war.

Balancing these factors:

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The extremely low historical base rate of nuclear weapons use in war
- The continued effectiveness of nuclear deterrence
- The short timeframe in question

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Increased geopolitical tensions, particularly around Ukraine
- Modernization and expansion of nuclear arsenals
- Deterioration of arms control agreements
- Increased nuclear rhetoric from some countries

On balance, while the risk factors are concerning, they don't appear to outweigh the strong historical precedent against nuclear weapons use and the continued power of deterrence. The short timeframe also limits the probability.

Considering these factors, I would estimate the probability as very low, but not zero given the non-negligible risk factors.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

2. Current nuclear tensions: Several articles mention increased nuclear rhetoric and modernization efforts by nuclear powers, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, rhetoric and modernization do not necessarily translate to use.

3. Nuclear doctrine and deterrence: Most nuclear powers maintain policies of deterrence rather than first use. The extreme consequences of nuclear warfare serve as a strong deterrent.

4. Specific threats or plans: While there are concerns about various conflicts (Russia-Ukraine, North Korea, etc.), no concrete plans for nuclear weapon use are mentioned in the articles.

5. Timeframe: The question asks about a relatively short timeframe (by September 30, 2024), which reduces the probability compared to a longer timeframe.

6. Safeguards and international pressure: There are significant international safeguards and pressure against nuclear weapon use.

Factors potentially increasing probability:
- Increased nuclear rhetoric and modernization efforts
- Ongoing conflicts involving nuclear powers (e.g., Russia-Ukraine)
- Reports of China placing some warheads on high alert for the first time

Factors decreasing probability:

To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate of nuclear weapon detonations as acts of war, then adjust based on current geopolitical tensions and recent developments.

Base rate:
There have been no nuclear weapons detonated as acts of war since 1945. In nearly 80 years, the base rate is effectively 0%.

Factors potentially increasing risk:
1. Increased tensions between nuclear powers, particularly Russia-NATO over Ukraine.
2. Modernization and expansion of nuclear arsenals, especially by China.
3. Breakdown of arms control agreements like New START.
4. Rhetoric from leaders about nuclear weapons use.
5. Ongoing conflicts that could potentially escalate (Ukraine, Middle East).

Factors potentially decreasing risk:
1. Strong taboo against nuclear weapons use.
2. Mutually assured destruction doctrine remains a powerful deterrent.
3. No clear strategic advantage to using nuclear weapons.
4. International pressure against nuclear proliferation and use.
5. Improved early warning systems reducing risk of accidental launches.

Recent developments:
The articles indicate increasing tensions and modernization of nuclear arsenals. However, they also show continued diplomatic efforts and awareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear war.

Adjusting the forecast:
While tensions are high, the enormous consequences of nuclear weapon use and lack of strategic advantage make it unlikely in the short term. However, the risk is not zero given current geopolitical instability.

Considering prediction markets:
I don't have access to current predictions from sources like Metaculus or Polymarket for this specific question. However, historically, such markets have generally placed low probabilities on near-term nuclear weapons use.

Breaking down the problem:
1. Probability of major escalation in current conflicts: Low-medium
2. Probability of new conflict between nuclear powers: Low
3. Probability of accidental launch leading to deliberate use: Very low
4. Probability of terrorist acquisition and use: Very low

Balancing inside and outside views:
The inside view focusing on current tensions suggests a higher risk, while the outside view based on historical non-use suggests a very low risk. I'll weight the outside view more heavily given the long history of non-use despite past periods of high tension.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability is very low, but not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

1. Historical precedent:
No nuclear weapons have been detonated as an act of war since 1945. This establishes a very low base rate over nearly 80 years.

2. Current global tensions:
Several articles highlight increasing nuclear tensions, particularly involving Russia, the US, and China. The war in Ukraine has raised concerns about potential nuclear escalation.

3. Nuclear arsenal modernization:
Multiple reports indicate that nuclear powers are modernizing and in some cases expanding their arsenals. This increases capabilities but doesn't necessarily increase likelihood of use.

4. Deterrence and doctrine:
Nuclear powers generally maintain doctrines of deterrence rather than first use. However, some concerning rhetoric has emerged, particularly from Russia.

5. Timeframe:
The question asks about a relatively short timeframe (by September 30, 2024), which limits the potential for major shifts in global dynamics.

6. Safeguards and control:
Despite tensions, nuclear powers maintain strict controls over their arsenals to prevent accidental or unauthorized use.

Weighing these factors:

The extremely low historical base rate is the strongest argument for a low probability. Nuclear weapons have not been used in war for nearly 80 years despite numerous conflicts and periods of high tension.

However, current global tensions, particularly surrounding the Ukraine war, represent a significant increase in nuclear risk compared to recent decades. The modernization of arsenals and some concerning rhetoric also slightly increase the risk.

That said, the short timeframe, continued functioning of deterrence, and maintained safeguards all argue against a sudden shift to nuclear use.

Balancing these factors, I assess that while the risk is elevated compared to recent years, it remains quite low in absolute terms given the enormous consequences and longstanding taboo against nuclear use.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.80% being the most likely. Probability: 0.80%

No nuclear weapons have been detonated as an act of war since 1945. This establishes a very low base rate over nearly 80 years.

2. Current global tensions:
Several articles highlight increasing nuclear tensions, particularly involving Russia, the US, and China. The war in Ukraine has raised concerns about potential nuclear escalation.

3. Nuclear arsenal modernization:
Multiple reports indicate that nuclear powers are modernizing and in some cases expanding their arsenals. This increases capabilities but doesn't necessarily increase likelihood of use.

4. Deterrence and doctrine:
Nuclear powers generally maintain doctrines of deterrence rather than first use. However, some concerning rhetoric has emerged, particularly from Russia.

5. Timeframe:
The question asks about a relatively short timeframe (by September 30, 2024), which limits the potential for major shifts in global dynamics.

6. Safeguards and control:
Despite tensions, nuclear powers maintain strict controls over their arsenals to prevent accidental or unauthorized use.

Weighing these factors:

The extremely low historical base rate is the strongest argument for a low probability. Nuclear weapons have not been used in war for nearly 80 years despite numerous conflicts and periods of high tension.

However, current global tensions, particularly surrounding the Ukraine war, represent a significant increase in nuclear risk compared to recent decades. The modernization of arsenals and some concerning rhetoric also slightly increase the risk.

That said, the short timeframe, continued functioning of deterrence, and maintained safeguards all argue against a sudden shift to nuclear use.

Balancing these factors, I assess that while the risk is elevated compared to recent years, it remains quite low in absolute terms given the enormous consequences and longstanding taboo against nuclear use.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.80% being the most likely. Probability: 0.80%
