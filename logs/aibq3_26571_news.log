**Germany's Convincing Win Over Scotland: A Strong Start, But No Proof of Strength**
Germany started the European Championship 2024 with a 5-1 win over Scotland, but the result does not yet have any significance in determining how far the team will go in the tournament. The team's coach, Julian Nagelsmann, used the same starting lineup as in the previous matches against the Netherlands and France, and was rewarded with a convincing win. The German team combined well, with goals from Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala, Kai Havertz, Niclas Füllkrug, and Emre Can. However, it is still unclear what the team's weaknesses are, as Scotland did not pose a threat to the German goal. The team will face a tougher test against Hungary on Wednesday, who have previously beaten Germany 2-2 in the 2021 European Championship and 1-0 in the 2022 World Cup. The Hungarian team is expected to be more aggressive and will require attention from the German defense. A clear plus for the German team is the euphoria sparked by the win over Scotland, which could carry the team through the tournament.

**Germany's 40-Year Curse: Can They Break the Jinx?**
Germany, a favorite to win the Euro 2024, faces Scotland in its first match. However, the team is haunted by a 40-year-old curse. Since Toni Kroos returned to the national team, Germany has not lost and has won three out of four matches. But this may not be enough to break the curse, as no host country has won the Euro since 1984. Germany will not only try to win its first international title in 10 years (World Cup 2014), but also try to break the curse. Only three teams have won the European Championship as hosts: France in 1984, Spain in 1964, and Italy in 1968. Since then, no team has been able to win the title as host. The Germans know how difficult it will be to win the final. They will face Scotland on June 14th at 20:40 on TF1 and TF1+. Follow the match live on TF1+ and make your predictions to challenge your friends, colleagues, and family!

**Germany's Quest for European Championship Title**
Despite the favorites being France and England, Germany is still a strong contender to win the 2024 European Championship. The German team has a rich history of success, having won the World Cup in 2006 and the European Championship in 1996. However, they have struggled in recent years, being eliminated in the group stage of the 2018 World Cup and the 2020 European Championship. The team's coach, Julian Nagelsmann, is confident in his team's abilities and believes they can win the tournament. He has a strong squad with players like Toni Kroos, Thomas Müller, and Antonio Rüdiger. The team's first match is against Scotland on June 14, 2024, and they will play their next two matches against Hungary and Switzerland.
