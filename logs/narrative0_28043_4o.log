NATE SILVER sits across from PHILIP TETLOCK, both looking at the election results on their screens.

NATE  
So, the big question: Will AfD's vote share be more than 30% and less than or equal to 32% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 45.23%. The AfD's momentum in eastern Germany was underestimated by traditional polling. Their stronghold in Brandenburg is undeniable.

NATE  
Indeed. Even with the judiciary's classification, their message resonated. It seems the political landscape is shifting faster than many anticipated.

PHILIP  
The polls up to September 12th hinted at growth, but the final surge was unexpected. A reminder that our models, while accurate, reflect the complexities of voter behavior.

NATE  
A pivotal moment for Germany, no doubt. Let's see how this influences the national discourse.

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered around them. 

NATE  
So, the Brandenburg election results are in. AfD's vote share was 31.4%.

PHILIP  
Yes, our models had it at 68.92%. Given their recent momentum in eastern Germany, it was expected.

NATE  
Right, especially after their performance in Saxony and Thuringia. The trend was clear. 

PHILIP  
Indeed. The AfD's rise aligns with the growing Euroscepticism and anti-immigration sentiment. 

NATE  
Their classification as a "suspected extremist" party didn't deter their supporters.

PHILIP  
Absolutely. The political climate is shifting. Our models captured that perfectly. 

NATE  
Well, it’s another testament to the accuracy of our forecasting.

PHILIP  
Agreed. The numbers never lie. 

They exchange knowing nods, the weight of their predictions validated once again.
