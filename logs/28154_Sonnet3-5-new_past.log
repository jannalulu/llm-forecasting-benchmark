Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- Kennedy Iyere is not mentioned in any of the recent news articles about the Edo gubernatorial election
- The main candidates discussed are:
  * Asue Ighodalo (PDP)
  * Monday Okpebholo (APC)
  * Olumide Akpata (LP)

2. Key evidence against Kennedy Iyere winning:
- No media coverage of his campaign
- Not mentioned as a major contender
- The race appears to be primarily between PDP, APC and LP candidates
- Multiple polls and predictions focus on other candidates
- Current governor Obaseki predicts PDP victory
- PDP internal polling shows their candidate leading

3. Evidence suggesting closer race:
- APC chairman Ganduje expressed confidence in winning
- Peter Obi campaigning for LP candidate
- Some polls show close race between main candidates

4. Additional factors:
- INEC promises free and fair election
- Court cases have focused on main party candidates
- Campaign infrastructure and resources appear concentrated among main parties

5. Analysis:
- Given complete absence of Kennedy Iyere from campaign coverage
- No evidence of significant campaign organization or support
- Not being mentioned as even a minor candidate
- Focus entirely on other candidates in polls and predictions
- Historical patterns of Nigerian elections favoring major parties

The complete lack of any mention of Kennedy Iyere in extensive recent coverage suggests extremely low chances of victory. The race appears to be between the main party candidates, with no indication of any other serious contenders.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate/Outside View:
- In Nigerian state elections, incumbency advantage (either party or individual) is significant
- The current governor is PDP's Godwin Obaseki
- Kennedy Iyere is not mentioned in any of the recent news articles

2. Key Candidates:
- Asue Ighodalo (PDP) - mentioned extensively in coverage
- Monday Okpebholo (APC)
- Olumide Akpata (LP)
- Kennedy Iyere - notably absent from major coverage

3. Evidence Supporting Very Low Probability:
- Kennedy Iyere does not appear in any of the recent campaign coverage
- Major polling and discussions focus on PDP, APC and LP candidates
- No mention of his party affiliation or campaign activities
- All recent news focuses on the race between Ighodalo, Okpebholo and Akpata

4. Campaign Dynamics:
- PDP claims internal polling shows 65% support for Ighodalo
- Independent poll shows PDP leading APC by 1.9%
- Strong institutional support for PDP candidate from incumbent governor
- Active campaigning by major parties (PDP, APC, LP)

5. Critical Factors:
- Kennedy Iyere's complete absence from media coverage suggests he is not a serious contender
- The race appears to be primarily between PDP, APC and LP candidates
- No evidence of Kennedy Iyere having any significant campaign infrastructure or support

6. Risk Adjustments:
- Even allowing for unreported campaign activities
- Considering possibility of last-minute developments
- Accounting for potential polling errors

Given the complete absence of Kennedy Iyere from any recent campaign coverage or polls, combined with the dominance of other candidates in the race, the probability of his victory appears extremely low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, with 0.20% being the most likely. Probability: 0.20%
