*Superforecasters Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered, a digital clock displaying the date.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the big question was whether the US would confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right, Nate. Given the WHO's August declaration and the spread in Europe, our models had assessed the probability at 65.75%.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The rapid spread from the DRC to neighboring countries and then to Sweden was alarming. Our models rarely miss, and they didn't this time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It's crucial how these probabilities guide public health responses. Even with the best predictions, the challenge is in the action.

*Nate nods, the weight of their accuracy evident.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, our models had it right. Now, it's about mitigating further spread.
