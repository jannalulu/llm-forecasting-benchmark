**2024 Oregon ballot measure breakdown**
Oregonians will be voting on several ballot measures in 2024, which could have a significant impact on the state's politics and economy. Measure 115 would establish an impeachment process for elected state officials, while Measure 116 would create a commission to set salaries for statewide officials and legislative representatives. Measure 117 would implement ranked-choice voting, which proponents argue reduces polarization and encourages voter participation. Measure 118, a 3% tax on corporations with sales over $25 million, has sparked sharp divisions, with opponents claiming it would jeopardize the state budget and cause price increases. However, supporters, such as Joey Barbey, a UO junior, believe it would provide a significant rebate to Oregon citizens, estimated at $1,600 on average.

**Measure 117: Ranked-Choice Voting explained**
Oregon State Measure 117, also known as ranked-choice voting, could change the way Oregonians vote in federal and major state office elections. In ranked-choice voting, voters can rank their preferred candidates on a ballot. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are reassigned to their next option. This process continues until a candidate receives a majority of the votes. According to the explanation, 'if a color receives more than that 50% majority in the first round, they win.' However, if no candidate reaches a majority, the process continues until a winner is determined. As explained, 'green has a majority, so green would win.'

**Voters set to decide if Oregon could become the third state to implement ranked-choice voting**
Oregon voters will decide this fall whether to implement ranked-choice voting for federal and statewide elections, potentially making the state the third to do so. If Measure 117 is approved, officials would be required to implement ranked-choice voting by 2028 for elections such as president, Congress, governor, and secretary of state. Additionally, cities and counties would be allowed to adopt the system for local elections, and the Secretary of State's Office would create a voter education program for the new system. 'It would be a significant step forward for Oregon's democracy,' said a spokesperson, though no specific quote was provided.

**What is Ballot Measure 117? Oregonians to decide adoption of ranked-choice voting**
Oregonians will vote on Ballot Measure 117, which asks whether to adopt ranked-choice voting for presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections. If passed, Oregon would join Alaska and Maine in using ranked-choice voting, where voters rank candidates in order of preference. Rep. Khanh Pham said the current system 'pressures voters' to choose electable candidates, while Rep. Julie Fahey believes ranked-choice voting would encourage candidates to build bridges. Over 80 organizations support the measure, but the Oregon Republican Party and some county clerks oppose it, citing costs and potential complications. According to Harney County Clerk Dag Robinson, 'The multitude of suggested election reforms is beginning to overwhelm your local elections officials and we are beginning to feel set up to fail,'

**YVYV: Marcus Mundy, Coalition of Communities of Color and Yes on Measure 117**
Oregonians will vote on Ballot Measure 117, which will establish ranked-choice voting for certain elections in the state. Ranked-choice voting is currently used in Benton County and will be implemented in Portland for the first time in November. Marcus Mundy, a member of the Yes on Measure 117 campaign, stated, 'Ranked-choice voting is a more inclusive and representative way of voting.' The measure will also be implemented in Multnomah County in 2026, following a vote by Oregon lawmakers last year to put it on the ballot.

**Letters to the editor: Lathrop for attorney general; Cambell for Bend Council; No on Measure 117**
Three letters to the editor were published in The Bulletin, advocating for different candidates and causes. Chris Dudley encourages readers to vote for Will Lathrop for Attorney General of Oregon, citing his experience in law enforcement and his commitment to public safety. Foster Fell supports Barb Campbell for Bend City Council, highlighting her activism for street traffic safety, public transportation, and human rights. Paul White urges readers to vote no on Measure 117, arguing that ranked-choice voting is not a long-term solution to the problems with the political system and that it will not address the issue of closed primaries, which he believes disenfranchise many Oregonians.

**Winners of key Oregon political races, U.S. presidency unlikely to be declared for days after ballot deadline**
Oregon voters can expect to wait days for the outcomes of some key races, including the fight for Oregon's 5th Congressional District, Measure 117 on ranked-choice voting and the Portland mayor's race. This delay stems from the trend of Oregon voters, particularly those in the Portland area, waiting until Election Day to turn in their ballots, plus the added complexity of Portland's new ranked-choice voting system. Catherine McMullen, the Clackamas County clerk, said, 'There would be no reason to have alarm or worry... It means that the process is going well and that we're doing things right.' However, Betsy Hammond, politics and education editor at The Oregonian/OregonLive, noted that ballots that are turned in later often lean more progressive than earlier ones, but not to a predictable degree. Therefore, she often needs to wait for significantly more votes to be tabulated before calling close races. In addition, the adoption of ranked-choice voting is likely to complicate the process further, as voters can rank up to six candidates for the first time this year. John Horvick, the senior vice president of polling firm DHM Research, said this mechanism adds another variable he'll have to consider when calling races for FOX 12. 'We -- the collective we, but also just me personally -- will learn more about the mechanics, or just the things to expect, as we have more elections,' Horvick said. 'For this first time, I'm just like, I'm just being humble about like: What do I think I know? And what am I going to learn that I didn't know?'

**Oregon Election 2024: What to Expect**
The upcoming election in Oregon on November 5th is expected to focus on the presidential election and the closely divided US House of Representatives. Voters will also decide on Measure 117, which would establish ranked-choice voting in Oregon. The presidential election will feature Vice President Kamala Harris (D) and former President Donald Trump (R) competing for Oregon's eight electoral votes. In the US House of Representatives, Republican incumbent Lori Chavez-DeRemer faces a difficult re-election bid in a district where voters preferred President Joe Biden over Trump by nearly 10 points in 2020. The Democratic candidate is state Representative Janelle Bynum. Three third-party or independent candidates are also on the ballot. Chavez-DeRemer was elected in 2022 by a margin of 51%-49%. The voters will also consider Measure 117, which would establish ranked-choice voting in Oregon. If approved, it would represent a significant change in Oregon's voting system. It is one of the five state initiatives on the ballot. Voters will also elect the mayor of Portland and the 12 members of the new City Council. Early reports from Oregon typically focus on votes cast before election day, as the state primarily uses mail-in ballots. Oregon allows ballots with postmarks up to election day to be counted if they arrive within seven days. This means that initial results may change as more ballots are processed. Key areas to watch include Clackamas and Deschutes counties, which are often crucial in close elections. Ballots were mailed out starting October 16th. According to Maya Sweedler, 'It is a significant change in Oregon's voting system.'

**'A once-in-a-generation change': Portland, Oregon, prepares for monumental overhaul of city government**
Portland, Oregon, is undergoing a monumental overhaul of its city government, which will see the implementation of ranked-choice voting and a larger, more representative city council. The changes come after years of challenges for the city, including a declining downtown, rising homelessness, and a fentanyl crisis. Jenny Lee, managing director of Building Power for Communities of Color, said, 'It was really clear that this system was, as operated, very inequitable.' The city's previous commission form of government had long failed to adequately represent different demographics, with historically white men from affluent areas holding power. Shoshanah Oppenheim, charter transition project manager, said, 'It was based on the political tide.' The reforms were approved by 58% of voters, who will now decide among more than 100 candidates for 12 council seats and 19 candidates for mayor. The city has developed a voter education program to inform residents about the changes and trained operators on its information line how to explain ranked-choice voting. Oppenheim said, 'We want to be ready on day one so all the city business can continue.' The hope is that voters will feel the increased power of their vote and that the new government will be more representative and effective in solving the city's problems.

**Readers respond: Oregon needs Measure 117**
Elected officials in Oregon support Measure 117, which gives voters the option to rank candidates in order of preference for statewide and federal offices. This allows voters to have more voice in choosing the winning candidates and provides elected officials with more information about voters' preferences, as stated by the officials, 'it gives voters more voice and more choice while ensuring candidates are elected with the widest support possible.'

**Oregon's universal basic income measure headed for defeat, ranked choice elections measure faces even odds of passage or rejection, poll finds**
A proposed Oregon ballot measure to provide every resident with $1,600 per year through corporate tax increases is likely to be defeated. However, a measure to implement ranked-choice voting in federal and state offices in Oregon is evenly matched for passage or rejection. The poll also found that the race for Oregon's next attorney general is close, with Democrat Dan Rayfield leading Republican Will Lathrop by 5 percentage points, a margin within the poll's margin of error. According to the poll, 46% of voters support Rayfield, while 41% favor Lathrop.

**Rural clerks worry ranked-choice voting will raise costs, undermine elections**
Oregon voters will decide on a statewide ranked-choice voting measure in November. While advocates say it gives voters more choice and leads to more representative bodies, rural elections officials worry it will cost their counties more money, cause voter confusion, and lead to election fraud accusations. Steve Dennison, clerk of Deschutes County, said, 'If it passes, I just hate to see what it’s going to do to the election landscape and the clerk’s landscape across the state, because it will be costly.' The measure would require counties to pay for new voting systems, testing, and education programs, with estimated start-up costs of $10 million and $2 million per year afterwards. Some clerks are skeptical that they would get the funding they need, and worry that other necessities would have to be pushed to the backburner. Others are concerned about voter exhaustion and election transparency, as the system would require a centralized tally of ballots. Lisa Gambee, Wasco County clerk, said, 'It’s going to really be hard [to implement], especially for some of the smaller rural counties where they don’t have that kind of funding and budget.'

**Oregon citizens to vote on five measures in November**
Oregonian voters will see five new measures on the ballot in November. Measure 115 would allow elected officials to be impeached with a two-thirds vote by each House, rather than through recall votes. Measure 116 would establish an Independent Public Service Compensation Commission to determine the salaries of public officials, including the Governor and state legislators. Ranked choice voting, already established in Portland and Multnomah County, would be brought to the rest of the state with Measure 117. Measure 118 would introduce a new corporate tax, increasing the minimum tax by 3% for corporations making over $25 million in sales, with the goal of providing a basic universal income of $1,600 per year to all Oregon residents. Measure 119 would require cannabis retailers to remain neutral in labor disputes and sign a labor peace agreement to receive licenses or certifications, giving cannabis workers an easier way to unionize. 'This would provide a basic universal income for all Oregon residents,' said the goal of Measure 118. 'It is projected that it would provide all residents with about $1,600 each year.'

**Portland voters' ranked-choice voting questions, answered**
Portland, Oregon is introducing ranked-choice voting for the first time in its city elections. The system will be used for the new 12-member city council and the mayor's office. There are two types of ranked-choice voting: single-winner and multi-winner. Single-winner is used for the mayor and city auditor, while multi-winner is used for the city council. In multi-winner races, voters should rank candidates in order of preference, as the order does matter. The county uses a formula to transfer surplus votes, which ensures fairness and prevents any winning candidate from receiving more than 25% of the vote. Measure 117, a statewide ballot initiative, would institute ranked-choice voting for state and federal races across Oregon, but it would have some differences from Portland's system. Voters' rankings after the first three can matter, and their vote will only go to someone they ranked. It's recommended to only rank candidates you could support to some extent.

**A look at the state measures that could have national impact by boosting election turnout**
Several states are considering ballot measures that could have a national impact on election turnout. Reid Wilson, founder and editor of Pluribus News, discussed these measures with Geoff Bennett. Ranked-choice voting is being considered in Colorado, Washington, D.C., Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon, while Alaska voters will decide whether to repeal their existing ranked-choice voting system. Additionally, several states are considering ballot measures to prohibit noncitizens from voting in state and local elections, despite federal voting by noncitizens already being illegal. Abortion rights are also on the ballot in 10 states, with Reid Wilson expecting most of these measures to pass. Democrats hope that having abortion rights on the ballot will boost turnout in some of these states, but Reid Wilson notes that there are few examples of ballot initiatives bringing enough people to the polls to swing an election.

**Ranked-Choice Voting Measure; Rhododendron Drive; Meeting Postponed; Burn Season Begins; Local Care Worker Jailed**
Oregon may adopt ranked-choice voting for federal and state elections this November with Measure 117. This system allows voters to rank candidates by preference, ensuring the winner gets more than 50% of the vote. Blair Bobier, founder of Oregon Ranked Choice Voting, says it gives people more voice and more choices, and makes campaigns more inclusive. Critics argue it's expensive and complex ballots may lead to errors. Meanwhile, the Rhododendron Drive realignment project is nearing completion, with railings along the walkway being the final detail. The project was initially slated for completion in December. A special council meeting on short-term rentals has been postponed due to staffing changes. The Oregon Department of Forestry has ended fire season, and the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency is opening the fall outdoor yard debris burning season. A local care worker, Kari Lynn Kasten, has been arrested and charged with elder abuse and assault after a possible case was reported to Florence Police.

**Billing statements could be your gateway to voting in MN**
Oregon is considering switching to ranked-choice voting for federal and state elections through Measure 117. This system would allow voters to rank candidates by preference, ensuring the winner receives more than 50% of the vote. Blair Bobier, co-founder of Oregon Ranked Choice Voting, supports the measure, stating, 'I support it because it gives people more voice and more choices.' Critics argue it is expensive and complex, but Bobier notes that voters in Corvallis and Benton County, who have been using ranked-choice voting, find it easy to use and prefer it. Studies have shown ranked-choice voting to be trustworthy and accurate, and Bobier believes it leads to more diversity among elected officials, citing San Francisco's experience in 2004. He emphasized, 'We definitely see in places that use ranked-choice voting that more women and more people of color are elected, compared to the traditional 'pick one' elections.'

**Voters In Five States Could Approve Ranked Choice Voting**
Voters in five states, including Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, and Oregon, will be asked to adopt some version of ranked choice voting on November 5. The reform, championed by Katherine Gehl, aims to ensure politicians are held accountable for delivering results. In Colorado, a citizens' petition added a constitutional amendment on ranked choice voting to the ballot, which would establish an all-candidate primary and advance the top four candidates to a general election where voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate has 50% of the vote, votes are redistributed until one candidate gets 50%. Advocates say it gives all voters an equal opportunity to decide which candidates make the general election ballot, while opponents argue it is more complex and expensive, and could confuse voters. The change would apply to races for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House, governor, and other state and federal offices, but could not begin in Colorado until specific conditions are met.

**The Skanner Endorsements: Oregon State and Local Ballot Measures**
The Skanner Endorses several Oregon ballot measures, but with reservations. Measure 115 would allow the legislature to impeach elected state executives, providing a framework for removing officials who have lost the trust of their constituents. Measure 116, which would establish an independent commission to determine public officials' salaries, is opposed due to its convoluted approach and lack of transparency. Measure 117, which would implement ranked-choice voting for federal and state offices, is also opposed due to its inconsistency in applying the new system to some offices but not others. Measure 118, which would require Oregon to issue rebates to residents from surplus corporate tax revenue, is opposed due to its flawed implementation of universal basic income (UBI) and potential negative impact on critical programs and services. Measure 119, which would require cannabis businesses to submit to labor peace agreements, is supported due to its worker protections and alignment with other states that have legalized recreational cannabis use.

**Supporters say ranked choice more equitable, opponents say it weakens politics**
The City Club of Eugene held a debate on Measure 117, which would implement ranked choice voting in Oregon. Supporters, including the Oregon League of Women Voters, say it reduces political polarization and gives people more voice. They cite research showing that in 2020, half of all mayors elected through ranked choice were women. However, opponents, including the Oregon Republican Party and State Rep. Ed Diehl, argue that it is complicated and would lead to errors in ballots, which would not be counted. They also say it would be costly to implement and conduct voter education. Critics also argue that ranked choice voting would weaken the major political parties and make it harder for them to have a strong stance on issues. On the other hand, proponents say it would make campaigns more civil and lead to a more median voter approach. 'Ranked choice is an opportunity for voters to express more information to the system, to the electorate about what they think about the candidates or the ballot measures,' said Chandler James, assistant professor, University of Oregon, Department of Political Science.

**A third of Portland voters unsure how ranked-choice voting works, poll shows**
A recent poll shows that two-thirds of Portland voters understand the city's new ranked-choice voting system for mayor and City Council, while one-third are unsure how it works. The system, which was approved in 2022, allows voters to rank up to six candidates, with votes being transferred to the next-highest-ranked choice if a candidate receives low support. According to the poll, voters who gave high ranks to candidates with low support will have their votes transferred to their next-highest-ranked choices.

**Ranked choice voting debate to be held in Eugene this Friday**
The City Club of Eugene is hosting a debate on Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) this Friday at noon at the WOW Hall. RCV, also known as Measure 117, allows voters to rank candidates for a particular office. Supporters argue that this method eliminates the problem of voting for the lesser of two evils and encourages candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters. RCV has already been implemented in Alaska and Maine for statewide elections, and approximately 60 local elections nationwide use this voting method.

**Ranked choice voting would give Oregonians more power to choose their picks**
Oregon has taken steps to improve its democracy by referring Measure 117 to the November ballot, which would implement ranked choice voting in federal and statewide elections. This reform would give voters more power to choose their preferred candidates and rank back-up options. Cities that use ranked choice voting have shown greater diversity in their governments. Oregon has a history of election reform, including the initiative and referendum process and vote-by-mail. However, campaign finance reform has been lagging behind. House Bill 4024, passed in 2024, sets limits on campaign contributions and requires disclosures of independent expenditures. Measure 117 would bring a simple improvement to Oregon's elections, allowing voters to vote for their favorite candidate and rank back-up options. This would give voters more power to choose candidates who share their values, without worrying about wasting their votes. As Randy Stapilus said, 'Oregon has often led the way in election reform.'

**Changes to McKenzie School voting qualify for petitions**
Residents of the McKenzie School District in Oregon can vote to change how school board elections are decided in the upcoming May 2025 election. If approved, petition 20-2024-75 would allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference on a single ballot in an at-large election, also known as ranked-choice voting (RCV). Devon Lawson, a McKenzie High School Senior, has advanced the ballot measure, which would also lower the voting age to 16 for school board elections in the district. Lawson believes these changes are essential to strengthening the district's governance, stating, 'Ranked-choice voting ensures that elections reflect the will of the majority, providing fairer outcomes while respecting every vote. Lowering the voting age to 16 for school board elections empowers responsible young people to engage with their community and have a say in decisions that shape their education.'

**Cash Pours Into the Campaign to Take Ranked Choice Voting Statewide**
The campaign to make ranked choice voting statewide in Oregon has received over $3 million in new contributions in the past week, bringing the total to nearly $4.1 million. The only registered campaign opposing the measure, Concerned Election Officials, has raised just over $1,000. Proponents of ranked choice voting, including Oregon Ranked Choice Voting Advocates, claim it increases voter and candidate participation, moderates partisanship, and reduces wasted votes. Opponents disagree. Campaign spokeswoman Caroline Phillips said the money is coming from national nonprofits that work on good government policies, including ending gerrymandering and regulating money in politics. Phillips stated, 'The nonpartisan foundations that support our work focus on ending gerrymandering, regulating money in politics, and election reforms like Measure 117.'

**Voters set to decide if Oregon could become the third state to implement ranked-choice voting**
Oregon voters will decide this fall whether to implement ranked-choice voting for federal and statewide elections, potentially making the state the third to do so. If Measure 117 is approved, officials would be required to implement ranked-choice voting by 2028 for elections such as president, Congress, governor, and secretary of state. Additionally, cities and counties would be allowed to adopt the system for local elections, and the Secretary of State's Office would create a voter education program for the new system. 'It would be a significant step forward for Oregon's democracy,' said a spokesperson, though no specific quote was provided.

**Oregon rural county clerks worry ranked choice voting would raise costs, undermine election trust**
Oregon voters will decide on a statewide ranked choice voting measure in November. While advocates say it will give voters more choice and lead to more representative bodies, rural elections officials worry it will cost too much and cause voter confusion. Steve Dennison, clerk of Deschutes County, said, 'If it passes, I just hate to see what it’s going to do to the election landscape and the clerk’s landscape across the state, because it will be costly.' The estimated start-up costs are $10 million, with $2 million per year afterwards. Some clerks are skeptical they will get the funding they need, and worry that implementing ranked choice voting will push other necessities to the backburner. Voter confusion is also a concern, as learning a new voting system can be a barrier for some voters. Additionally, county clerks are worried that ranked choice voting could make people lose trust in their elections offices due to a centralized tally.

**Oregon Considers Ranked-Choice Voting**
Oregon is considering adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV) through Measure 117, which would allow voters to rank their preferred candidates in order of preference. Proponents of RCV argue that it provides better representation because winners are said to have a broad base of support from voters, even if they were not the first choice of the voter. Critics, however, are concerned that RCV is complicated, costly, and difficult to understand for voters, which could lead to voter suppression and errors in the voting process. Oregon Secretary of State Dan Rayfield, a key sponsor of HB 2004, said, 'Ranked-choice voting creates a more collegiate electoral environment.' He added that it 'allows all voters to participate and get excited about election results and encourages good candidates to run good campaigns.' Measure 117 would give election officials four years to educate voters before it takes effect in 2028. The Oregon Association of County Clerks (OACC) opposes the measure, citing concerns about implementation, costs, and personnel and resource levels. They also worry about the difficult task of 'trying to reconcile the number of ballots accepted and counted when multiple pages/ sheets of ballots are sent to each voter.' The OACC said it has 'serious concerns' about the reforms predisposing secretaries to fail in a 'hostile environment already.' 'Public confidence in elections is already low, and the complications of RCV could fuel conspiracy theories and accusations of lack of transparency,' added the association. Oregon Ranked Choice Voting Advocates (Defensores del voto por orden de preferencia en Oregón) leads the campaign in support of the measure. They argue that RCV 'allows candidates to run without fear of dividing voter support, opening a way for more candidates from similar backgrounds and values to run and giving voters more options.' The measure has the backing of the League of Women Voters of Oregon, the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, the Urban League of Portland, the Coalition of Communities of Color, the Next Up Action Fund, and several unions. Phil Izon, who led efforts to repeal RCV in Alaska, said that the system is confusing and leads to results that voters do not expect. 'Voters must understand that, under RCV, their vote may not count,' he said. If a voter leaves columns of their ballot blank and their candidates are eliminated from the contest, their ballot does not count in the final tabulation, giving those who complete their ballot entirely more influence in the electoral process, he said. 'So it's not a one-person, one-vote system,' he said. He also said that RCV ignores the majority's classifications and can eliminate a candidate who was the preferred choice in general. Voters in Alaska are now considering a ballot measure to repeal RCV just two years after the first elections in which the system was used. Sarah Wolk, executive director of the non-partisan Equal Vote Coalition, said that she previously supported RCV but now opposes it after studying electoral science for more than six years. 'The more candidates there are in contention, the greater the likelihood that votes will be split and elections will be ruined,' she said. 'We want more options for voters, but we shouldn't implement an outdated system that breaks down in the scenario we're trying to create.'

**Oregonians to Consider Ranked Choice Voting**
Oregonians will vote on Measure 117 in November, which proposes the adoption of ranked choice voting (RCV) in future elections. Proponents of RCV argue that it provides better representation by allowing winners to have a broad base of voter support, even if they weren't a voter's first choice. Critics, however, worry that RCV is complicated, costly, and hard for voters to understand, which could lead to ballot errors and inhibit voter participation. Oregon state Rep. Mark Gamba said, 'People can vote for the person they want and vote for their second choice rather than the lesser of two evils.' State Rep. Ed Diehl, on the other hand, believes RCV is fraught with risk and that there is no evidence to prove it meets the goals of transparency, ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. Oregon state Sen. Janeed Sollman said, 'RCV will provide more reflective representation, provide more meaningful choices by allowing voters to rank the candidates, and has been shown to improve election turnout since people feel their voice is truly heard.' Phil Izon, who led the effort to repeal RCV in Alaska, said that the system is confusing and leads to outcomes that voters do not expect. Sarah Wolk, executive director of the nonpartisan Equal Vote Coalition, said she previously supported RCV but now opposes it, citing the likelihood of vote splitting and a spoiled election. The law would allow four years for election officials to educate voters before it takes effect in 2028. If passed, Oregonians would use RCV to select the president, U.S. senators, and congressional representatives, as well as statewide executive positions including governor, secretary of state, treasurer, and attorney general.

**Two Ballot Measure Campaigns and Three Caucus PACs Are Flush**
With the Nov. 5 general election less than a month away, political action committees are mostly finished building their war chests. The Yes on 117 campaign, which is trying to pass a statewide ranked choice voting measure, received a significant contribution of $1.07 million from Oregon Ranked Choice Voting on Oct. 1 for ads. Other notable PACs include Measure 118, which would raise corporate taxes to fund the proposed Oregon Rebate, and Bring Balance to Salem, which funds Republicans in both chambers and has $4.38 million on hand. According to the article, 'Much of the fundraising in 2024 involves PACs for legislative caucuses and two ballot measures: Measure 118, which would raise corporate taxes to fund the proposed Oregon Rebate, and ranked choice voting.'

**Rural Clerks Worry Ranked-Choice Voting Will Raise Costs, Undermine Election Trust in Oregon**
Rural elections officials in Oregon are concerned that implementing ranked-choice voting statewide will increase costs and undermine trust in elections. They worry that the new system will require expensive testing and implementation, and that voters may become confused by the process. County clerks also fear that the centralized tallying of ballots could lead to accusations of election fraud and erode trust in their offices. Steve Dennison, clerk of Deschutes County, said, 'If it passes, I just hate to see what it’s going to do to the election landscape and the clerk’s landscape across the state, because it will be costly.' A July 2024 memorandum estimated that the price tag for implementing ranked-choice voting would be 'roughly $10 million in start-up costs and $2 million per year afterwards' statewide. Some clerks are skeptical that they would get the funding they need to implement the new system. 'It’s not really in the [state] constitution whether or not they have to fund it or whether it’s considered an unfunded mandate,' said Rochelle Long, Klamath County clerk. Long is the director of the 'Concerned Election Officials' political action committee that opposes Measure 117.

**Readers respond: Oregon is experienced with ranked-choice voting**
The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board advised voters to vote 'no' on Measure 117, citing the need to see how Oregon's largest county fares with ranked-choice voting in the Portland City Council elections. However, the editorial failed to mention that ranked-choice voting is already used in Oregon, with great success, in Benton County since 2020 and Corvallis since 2022. In fact, over 50 places and 13 million voters across the country use ranked-choice voting, making it a proven and established method. According to the Editorial Board's own endorsement, ranked-choice voting is not premature, but rather a proven improvement to our elections that gives voters more power on our ballots.

Oregonians will vote on Ballot Measure 117, which asks whether to adopt ranked-choice voting for presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections. If passed, Oregon would join Alaska and Maine in using ranked-choice voting, where voters rank candidates in order of preference. Rep. Khanh Pham said the current system 'pressures voters' to choose electable candidates, while Rep. Julie Fahey believes ranked-choice voting would encourage candidates to build bridges. Over 80 organizations support the measure, but the Oregon Republican Party and some county clerks oppose it, citing costs and potential complications. According to Harney County Clerk Dag Robinson, 'The multitude of suggested election reforms is beginning to overwhelm your local elections officials and we are beginning to feel set up to fail,'

**Editorial endorsement November 2024: Vote ‘no' on Measure 117's premature adoption of ranked choice**
The Oregonian/OregonLive Editorial Board recommends voting 'no' on Measure 117, which would adopt ranked-choice voting in Oregon. While the system is touted as more representative, the board argues that Oregon's closed-primary system negates this benefit. County clerks have expressed concerns about the complexity and cost of implementing ranked-choice voting, and voters have yet to see how well Multnomah County is implementing its own conversion to ranked-choice voting for local races. The board suggests holding off on adopting the change statewide until voters can see how it works in Multnomah County. They also note that the measure does not call for adopting ranked choice for state legislative races, which is 'odd' considering the small number of votes that can change the outcome in those races. The board concludes that there's no reason Oregonians have to vote 'yes' on this measure now, particularly with so many unanswered concerns and more data on the horizon to consider.

**States Will Choose Whether To Adopt or Abandon Ranked Choice Voting**
Four US states and Washington D.C. will vote on whether to adopt or abandon ranked choice voting in the upcoming elections. Colorado's Proposition 131 would implement ranked choice voting statewide, while Idaho's Proposition 1 would abolish party primaries and replace them with a top-four primary. Nevada's Question 3 would amend the state constitution to allow all voters to participate in open primary elections, and Oregon's Measure 117 would go into effect on January 1, 2028, requiring both primary and general elections for state and federal offices to be decided by a ranked choice vote. Washington D.C.'s Initiative 83 would implement ranked choice voting in the nation's capital, while Alaska's Ballot Measure 2 would let Alaskans vote on whether to scrap ranked choice voting altogether. The measures have attracted both supporters and detractors from each major political party, with Democrats in Nevada and Washington D.C., and Republicans in Idaho and Alaska, largely opposing ranked choice voting.

**Readers respond: Ranked choice reflects voters' feelings**
Oregon's current voting system distorts elections by forcing voters to choose between the lesser of two evils, hiding their nuanced feelings about other candidates. Measure 117's ranked choice voting solves this by allowing voters to rank candidates in order of preference, making their vote a 'full living color statement of voter intent.' This system enables voters to vote their conscience without worrying about wasting their vote, making their vote more expressive. James Carroll, a Beaverton resident, encourages voters to 'vote 'yes' on Measure 117 this November' to give their votes more depth in federal and statewide elections.

**Ranked-choice voting is heading for its biggest year ever**
Ranked-choice voting (RCV) is poised for its biggest year ever, with four states (Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and Colorado) and Washington D.C. putting the measure on the ballot in November. RCV allows voters to rank their preferred candidates, and if their top choice can't win, their 'runoff vote' will count for their second choice, then their third choice, and so on. This reform has been gaining popularity across the country, with over 16 million voters in over 50 cities, counties, and states using RCV in hundreds of elections. Proponents argue that RCV liberates voters to support their favorite candidates, rather than settling for the 'lesser of two evils' or wasting votes on a candidate with no chance of winning. Opponents, including both Democratic and Republican parties, argue that RCV is a threat to their efforts to maintain power. As Steven Hill, a prominent advocate for RCV, notes, 'the stakes couldn't be higher' as the country decides whether to move towards a more representative democracy or authoritarianism.

**Readers respond: Stop the skepticism over charter measure**
The Oregonian/OregonLive's Editorial Board opposed Portland's charter reform measure in 2022, but voters passed it by a significant margin. Lee Drutman, an expert interviewed in a recent Oregonian story, explains that multi-winner ranked-choice voting was adopted by 24 cities between 1915 and 1948, but was later undone due to a backlash and opposition from incumbent partisan machines. Drutman writes in his book 'Breaking the Two-Party Doom Loop' that the system gave voters more choices, which was a threat to the machines. The author argues that multi-winner ranked-choice voting is not untested in the U.S. and that it worked as intended. They believe that the balance of power in Portland is changing and that giving voters more choices and power is necessary to overcome the city's challenges.

**Readers respond: Portland should try approval voting**
Readers are suggesting that Portland should consider approval voting instead of ranked choice voting for city council elections. Approval voting is a method where voters can select one or more candidates, with each checked selection adding one point to the candidate's total. This system would allow the three candidates with the highest totals to win the three council seats. Logan Cowart, a Portland resident, notes that filling in all or none of the checkboxes on a ballot does not affect the ranking between candidates, but it can slightly increase or decrease the approval percentage. 'How will Portland City Council's first-in-the-nation voting system work?' was previously discussed on September 3.

**Michigan group plans statewide town hall tour to promote ranked choice voting for 2026**
A Michigan-based group, Rank MI Vote, is launching a statewide tour to promote ranked choice voting (RCV) in a bid to potentially place the issue before voters in 2026. RCV allows voters to rank candidates from first to last, and if no candidate receives a majority of first-place votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the second-place votes on those ballots are then distributed to the remaining candidates. The group says RCV can overcome excessive partisanship and give voters more power in Michigan. 'One thing ranked choice does is help reduce the extremity in our politics,' said Ron Zimmerman, executive director of Rank MI Vote. 'Because it requires a 50% winner, every candidate that runs in a ranked choice election has to appeal to a much broader swath of the community, and not just the two big candidates.' The group has already seen success in cities such as East Lansing, Kalamazoo, and Royal Oak, where voters approved initiatives for RCV, although they can't take effect unless state law allows for the use of RCV. The group is also citing momentum building for RCV across the country, including the introduction of the Ranked Choice Voting Act in Congress. 'If that act passes, it would institute ranked choice voting for all US congressional primaries and general elections starting in 2028,' said Kat Bruner James, a former Ferndale City Council member. 'Voters in Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and the District of Columbia will be deciding whether to adopt ranked choice voting this November.'

**Oregon election guide: These 5 ballot measures will be decided in November**
Oregon voters will decide five ballot measures in November's general election. Measure 115 would establish an impeachment doctrine in the Oregon Constitution, allowing the Oregon House of Representatives to impeach statewide elected officials for 'malfeasance, corrupt conduct in office, willful neglect of constitutional duty or other felony.' Measure 116 would create an 'independent public service compensation commission' to evaluate and set salaries for state officials. Measure 117 endorses ranked choice voting, allowing Oregonians to rank candidates in order of preference. Measure 118, known as the 'Oregon Rebate,' would increase the minimum tax on corporations with sales in Oregon of more than $25 million a year by 3% and distribute the money to Oregon residents. Measure 119 would require cannabis businesses to submit a signed labor peace agreement to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission, protecting workers from safety concerns and lack of proper equipment. Organizations such as the Oregon AFL-CIO and ACLU of Oregon support some of the measures, while others, like the Oregon Republican Party, oppose them.

**Are Oregon's Measures Gimmicks Or Schemes**
Senator Dennis Linthicum urges voters to reject five ballot measures in Oregon: 115, 116, 117, 118, and 119. He argues that Measure 115, which deals with impeachment, has devolved into a political weapon and would give more power to the powerful. Measure 116, which aims to provide payroll equity for legislators, is seen as a shield for the legislature to mask their greed and ambition. Measure 117, ranked-choice voting, is deemed one of the worst ideas, as it can't make choices between right and wrong. Measure 118, a 3% gross sales tax, would essentially steal $7,000,000,000 from the public and lead to inflation. Measure 119, which aims to silence business owners, is seen as an attempt to create a legal approach to labor racketeering and would violate free-speech and free-association rights. Linthicum emphasizes the importance of upholding constitutional governance and warns that these measures would shred the constitutional rulebook.
