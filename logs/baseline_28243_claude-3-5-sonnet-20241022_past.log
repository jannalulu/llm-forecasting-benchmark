2025-02-12 22:37:35,736 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this carefully:

1) The timeframe is relatively short - from now until October 1, 2024 (about 2 weeks)

2) Key considerations:
- Trump Media (DWAC) recently completed its merger and began trading
- Trump owns a large stake in the company (estimated around 78.75 million shares)
- The stock has been volatile in its early trading
- Trump faces significant legal expenses and may need liquidity
- There's a 6-month lock-up period for insiders post-merger that restricts selling
- Form 4 filings must be made within 2 business days of a transaction
- Resolution depends specifically on the Trump Media IR page showing the Form 4, not just SEC EDGAR

3) Constraints:
- The lock-up period likely prevents any sales in this timeframe
- Even if a sale occurred, it needs to be both reported via Form 4 AND appear on that specific website
- The short timeline reduces likelihood of both a sale and proper filing/posting

Given the lock-up period is the biggest constraint and there's very limited time, I assess a very low probability of this occurring.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 3.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%
