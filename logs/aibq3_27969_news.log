**Emmys 2024 Poll: What Should Win for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series?**
The Emmy for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series is up for grabs this year, with five contenders vying for the top prize. The field includes new seasons of established TV brands, such as FX's Fargo and HBO's True Detective: Night Country, as well as Netflix's Baby Reindeer and Ripley, and Apple TV+'s Lessons in Chemistry. Without the prohibitive favorite Shōgun in the mix, the competition is fierce, but any one of these series could walk off with the big prize. According to TVLine, 'Season 5 of FX's Fargo may have been its most acclaimed yet, with stars Juno Temple and Jon Hamm also nabbing Emmy nods, and it won this Emmy back in 2014 for Season 1.' The question remains, which one would you be happiest to see collect a trophy on Emmy night?

**‘Shogun' leads all Emmy nominees with 25 and ‘The Bear' sets comedy series record with 23**
The 2024 Emmy nominations have been announced, with 'Shogun' leading all nominees with 25 and 'The Bear' setting a comedy series record with 23. The nominations include best comedy series and best actor in a comedy series for Jeremy Allen White, as well as best actress for Ayo Edebiri. 'Shogun' took advantage of the absence of last year's top three nominees to dominate in drama and give FX the kind of strong year often reserved for HBO. 'True Detective: Night Country' was a bright spot for HBO, leading all limited or anthology series nominees with 19. The show's star, Jodie Foster, received a best actress nomination for her role as a police chief investigating mysterious deaths in the darkness of a north Alaskan winter. 'The Bear' and 'Shogun' are expected to vie for the best limited series Emmy with 'Fargo', which had 15 nominations. Netflix has its own pair of contenders in the category, with 'Baby Reindeer' and 'Ripley' receiving 11 and 13 nominations respectively. The shows, along with dozens of acknowledgements in craft and comedy special categories, helped Netflix lead all outlets with 107 nominations.
