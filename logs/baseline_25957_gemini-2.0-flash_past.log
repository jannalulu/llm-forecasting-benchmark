Okay, let's analyze the situation.

The question is: Will Tadej Pogačar win the Tour de France 2024? The date is July 10, 2024. The Tour de France is underway, having started on June 29, 2024 and scheduled to finish on July 21, 2024.

Pogačar is a strong contender, but cycling races are unpredictable. Crashes, illness, and unexpected surges from other riders can dramatically alter the outcome. Also, the form of the cyclists will change from day to day.

Given the race is ongoing, we have some information to guide our predictions.
A major factor is how Pogačar has performed in the opening stages. Reviewing current standings and stage results is crucial. As of July 10, 2024, Pogačar is performing very well and is a strong contender, but Jonas Vingegaard is also performing well and is a strong contender. Other riders are unlikely to win.

Considering Pogačar's current strong performance, and the inherent uncertainties of a Grand Tour, I will put a high probability on his winning but I will acknowledge the possiblity of Vingegaard or another rider winning the race.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.
