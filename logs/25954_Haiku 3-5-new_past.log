Let's systematically analyze this scenario:

Key Observations:
1. Current Political Landscape
- New Popular Front won 182 seats
- Macron's "Together" coalition won 168 seats
- No coalition has absolute majority (289 seats needed)
- Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced resignation

2. Potential Prime Minister Selection Dynamics
- Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon called for NFP to form government
- Macron hesitant about NFP leadership
- Potential for complex negotiations/compromise candidate

3. Constitutional Constraints
- President Macron must appoint Prime Minister
- Requires parliamentary support
- High likelihood of negotiations/compromise

4. Timeline Considerations
- Current deadline: July 30, 2024
- National Assembly reconvenes July 18
- Olympics start July 26 (complicating political transitions)

Probability Assessment:
- High uncertainty about non-NFP/Together PM
- Complex negotiation environment
- Slight preference for compromise within existing blocs

Adjusting Base Rate:
- Historical cohabitation precedents
- Political necessity of finding workable solution

Considering causal forces, inside/outside views, and trend extrapolation, I conclude:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 52.40%, but 44.25% being the most likely. Probability: 44.25%.

Let me systematically analyze this complex forecasting scenario:

Key Observations:
1. Current parliamentary composition:
- New Popular Front: 182 seats
- Together (Macron's coalition): 168 seats
- National Rally: 143 seats
- No coalition has absolute majority (289 seats needed)

2. Political Context:
- President Macron cannot easily dissolve parliament until July 2025
- Intense negotiations will be required to form a government
- High political uncertainty exists

3. Prime Minister Selection Dynamics:
- Macron likely prefers preventing far-right governance
- New Popular Front claims first right to form government
- Complex potential coalition scenarios exist

Forecasting Considerations:
- High likelihood of negotiated compromise
- Strong incentive for centrist/left cooperation to block far-right
- Potential for technocratic/compromise candidate

Probability Assessment Reasoning:
- Probability of a non-New Popular Front/Together PM is significant but not overwhelming
- Tactical political maneuvering suggests compromise likely
- Institutional constraints favor established political blocs

Risk Factors Increasing Probability:
- Fragmented parliamentary landscape
- No clear governing majority
- Complex inter-party negotiations

Balancing Factors Decreasing Probability:
- Strong institutional preference for stability
- Mutual interest in preventing far-right governance

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.

- New Popular Front won 182 seats
- Together (Macron's coalition) won 168 seats
- National Rally won 143 seats
- No coalition has absolute majority (289 seats required)

2. Political Dynamics:
- Macron has rejected forming government with New Popular Front
- Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon (New Popular Front) demands Prime Minister from their coalition
- No clear path to majority government exists

3. Constitutional Procedure:
- Macron must nominate Prime Minister
- Prime Minister needs confidence of National Assembly
- High likelihood of complex negotiations/potential deadlock

Probability Reasoning:
- High probability neither New Popular Front nor Together will have clear governing majority
- Increasing chance of a technical/compromise Prime Minister
- Potential for a non-aligned technocratic leader

Key Uncertainties:
- Macron's strategic choices
- Potential inter-party negotiations
- Possibility of minority government
- Risk of repeated political impasse

Comparative Historical Context:
- France has experienced cohabitation scenarios before
- Precedent exists for non-traditional government formations

Balancing Competing Considerations:
- Political fragmentation suggests higher probability of alternative coalition
- Institutional stability pressures suggest maintaining conventional approach

After carefully weighing these factors and potential scenarios, accounting for inherent uncertainties:

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 74.30%, but 68.75% being the most likely. Probability: 68.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Contextual Elements:
1. Current political landscape after July 7 legislative elections:
- New Popular Front won 182 seats
- Macron's Together coalition won 168 seats
- No party has absolute majority (289 seats needed)
- Gabriel Attal has resigned

Potential Prime Minister Scenarios:
A. New Popular Front candidate (within their coalition)
B. Together coalition candidate 
C. Technocratic/compromise candidate outside both
D. Prolonged political deadlock without a PM

Critical Considerations:
- Constitutional requirement to appoint a PM
- Need for parliamentary support
- Macron's role in nomination
- Negotiations between political blocs

Probability Assessment Process:
- Base rate for non-coalition PM appointments: Low, typically parties negotiate
- Current political fragmentation increases compromise likelihood
- Strong incentives to avoid political paralysis
- Left-wing and centrist blocs likely to negotiate

Balancing Competing Factors:
- High likelihood of staying within existing coalitions
- But significant negotiation challenges
- Slight opening for compromise candidate

Forecast Reasoning:
- High probability of staying within NPF/Together
- Small but meaningful probability of alternative candidate

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 17.50% being the most likely. Probability: 17.50%.
