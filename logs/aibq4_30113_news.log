**Israel Raises Concerns about Judge's Impartiality in ICC Case**
Israel has raised concerns about the impartiality of a judge at the International Criminal Court, which is considering whether to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This could further delay the decision, which is related to a request filed by the ICC prosecutor in May to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and three leaders of Hamas, due to the Gaza war. The request requires the approval of ICC judges, but the decision has been delayed due to several reasons, including multiple appeals filed by Israel challenging the court's jurisdiction. Another reason for the delay is the request by Romanian judge Julia Motoc last month to step down from the three-judge panel considering the request due to health reasons, and Slovenian judge Bettina Holzer was chosen to replace her. The Israeli Attorney General's office said in a statement on November 11 that Holzer worked in the prosecutor's office at the ICC before being appointed as a judge in December last year. The statement said, 'Israel respectfully requests that Judge Bettina Holzer provide information to clarify whether there are any grounds, or no grounds, for reasonable suspicion of her impartiality.' The statement added, 'Israel does not imply that Judge Holzer's previous work in the prosecutor's office necessarily or automatically raises logical concerns about her impartiality. However, the judges of the court have acknowledged that holding previous positions in the prosecutor's office raises reasonable concerns about bias, depending on the circumstances.' In May, the ICC prosecutor filed a request to issue arrest warrants, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu, Galant, and the three Hamas leaders committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. Two of the Hamas leaders are now either dead or believed to be dead.

**Russian Court Issues Arrest Warrant for ICC Deputy President Reine Alapini-Gansou**
The Basmanny District Court in Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for Reine Alapini-Gansou, the deputy president of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, on the request of a prosecutor. Alapini-Gansou is accused of illegal detention and imprisonment (Article 301, Part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) for issuing an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the court's ruling, the arrest warrant for Alapini-Gansou is valid for two months, starting from the moment of her hypothetical detention on Russian territory. Alapini-Gansou, a Beninese national, has been a judge at the ICC since March 2018 and is set to complete her term in 2027. She has a strong background in human rights, having worked with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights and the United Nations. The ICC had previously issued an arrest warrant for Putin and children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2024. This is not the first time a Russian court has issued an arrest warrant for an ICC official, as the Basmanny District Court also issued a warrant for ICC judge Hailikul Bens Mahfoud in November 2024.

**Putin Proposes Way to Avoid ICC Arrest Warrants through Intergovernmental Agreement**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) can be resolved by signing a intergovernmental agreement. He made this comment in the context of a possible trip to Brazil for the G20 summit, according to RIA Novosti. Putin noted that 'decisions of this kind are very easy to circumvent, it's quite simple. All you need to do is sign an intergovernmental agreement, and the ICC's jurisdiction will be limited.' He emphasized that Russia and Brazil have had strong and stable relations for many years, creating conditions for signing necessary documents without creating complex situations for the parties involved. However, Putin announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil, citing the need to avoid disrupting the work of the summit. He added that the Russian authorities will determine who will represent the country at the summit at a high level. Since December 1, 2023, Brazil has taken over the presidency of G20, and the final summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. Previously, the Federation Council commented on Ukraine's request to Brazil to arrest Putin.

**Sergey Lavrov to Lead Russian Delegation to G20 Summit in Brazil**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will lead the Russian delegation to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, according to a statement by Russian diplomat Marat Berdyev on his Telegram channel. President Vladimir Putin had previously announced that he would not attend the summit this year, stating, 'I don't want to disrupt the event.' Putin believed that his presence would have disrupted the normal functioning of the forum. He added that Russia would send someone who could represent the country's interests at the summit on a high level. Brazil, a participant in the Rome Statute, which grants jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court (ICC), issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023. The Kremlin stated that the warrant would not hinder Russia's relations with other countries. Brazil took over the G20 presidency on December 1, 2023, and the final summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. It is worth noting that the G20 parliamentary resolution previously 'forgot' to mention Ukraine.

The summit aimed to follow up on the results and recommendations of the previous summit, continue efforts to stop the Israeli aggression, facilitate the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid, and discuss the ongoing escalation of Israeli aggression against Palestinian and Lebanese territories.

Mahfoud is accused of unlawful detention (Article 301, Part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) in Russia. In June 2024, Mahfoud signed an arrest warrant for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov. The ICC's governing body has initiated an external investigation into its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, over allegations of sexual harassment. Khan has denied the allegations and has stepped aside temporarily to allow for an objective investigation. Khan had previously requested the ICC to issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2023. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also threatened to request an ICC arrest warrant for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

**Russian Court Issues Arrest Warrant for International Criminal Court Judge**
The Basmanny Court in Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for Tunisian International Criminal Court judge Hakeel Ben Mafhouf, who is accused of unlawful detention. According to the court, 'the measure of restraint in the form of detention has been chosen for Ben Mafhouf.' The arrest warrant was issued after Ben Mafhouf was accused of unlawful detention (Article 301, Part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) and was put on international wanted list. Ben Mafhouf was one of the judges who issued an arrest warrant for Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov in connection with the Ukrainian crisis in the summer of 2024. Ben Mafhouf is a Tunisian lawyer and has been a judge at the International Criminal Court since March 2024.

**International Criminal Court to Investigate Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague will begin an external investigation into the allegations of misconduct against Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, according to Reuters, citing two sources. The investigation was agreed upon at an assembly of member states on November 7. Khan is accused of harassment, and an internal document suggests that he should temporarily step down from his role. However, it is unclear who will conduct the investigation. Khan has denied the allegations, claiming they are part of a disinformation campaign against his office. Khan has previously issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's children's ombudsman, in March 2023, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders in May 2024, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, the ICC has not yet issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, as they have since been killed. The alleged victim is unsure about the independence of the internal organ, which is headed by a former Khan employee, due to leaks of information about the case.

**Lula defends end of conflict in Ukraine and wants Putin to regain 'right to walk around the world'**
Brazilian President Lula has expressed his desire for the conflict in Ukraine to end and for Russian President Vladimir Putin to regain 'the right to walk around the world in a civilized manner'. Lula made these statements in an interview with CNN Internacional, stating that it's not good for democracy for a country like Russia to be isolated from the world. 'What I think is that we need to work so that this war ends once and for all, and Putin regains the right to walk around the world in a civilized manner and participate in events,' Lula said. Brazil currently holds the presidency of the G20, and a summit of world leaders will be held in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. The Brazilian government had been working to make it possible for Putin to visit the G20 summit despite a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. Brazil submitted a document to the UN's Commission on International Law arguing in favor of Putin's visit, despite the warrant. The goal was to develop provisions on immunity for heads of state to ensure they are not prosecuted during international visits. The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest in March 2023 for the alleged 'illegal deportation' of Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia claims the children's lives were in danger, while presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Moscow does not recognize the court's decision.

**Could Trump’s Victory Spur ICC to Quickly Issue Arrest Warrant Against Netanyahu?**
Donald Trump's electoral victory raises questions about its impact on ongoing wars in Gaza, Lebanon, and beyond. It also sparks concerns that the International Criminal Court (ICC) may issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before Trump returns to the White House in January. ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced in May that he would seek arrest warrants against Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. Khan accused Netanyahu and Gallant of targeting civilians in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war, charges Israel rejects. He accused the Hamas leaders of crimes against humanity during the war and the assault that sparked it on October 7, 2023. 'Khan accused Netanyahu and Gallant of targeting civilians in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war — charges Israel rejects.'

**Craig Mokhiber – Turmoil at the ICC as fears rise over Israel and the U.S. interference**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has faced significant delays and interference in its investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Israeli leaders Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. The ICC's Prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted a request for arrest warrants in May 2024, but the court has yet to issue a decision. The delay has raised concerns about the court's independence and the potential for external pressure to influence the outcome. Israeli and Western intelligence agencies and government actors have been accused of pressuring ICC judges and court officials to derail the investigation. The ICC's reputation is at risk, and a failure to deliver justice in this case could have serious consequences for the court's legitimacy and effectiveness. The article also highlights the risk of prosecution for crimes against the administration of justice, including impeding or corrupting the ICC's officials.

**ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan: 'Do I Have to Wait Until Everyone in Gaza Dies to Issue an Arrest Warrant?'**
The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has stated that issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now a matter of urgency, asking 'Do I have to wait until everyone in Gaza dies to issue an arrest warrant?' Khan emphasized that taking action against Israeli officials should not be delayed, as they are not above international law. Khan requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity since October 7, 2023. In response to a question from a German journalist, Khan replied with a laugh, 'Do I have to wait until everyone dies? If your father or mother or grandfather was taken hostage, would you really want me to wait? If your child or sister was torn apart, would you want me to wait?' Khan added, 'Why is the law applied to Ukrainians and Sudanese but not to Palestinians? Is it acceptable to exclude a specific geographic area from international law?' Khan noted that all member states of the International Criminal Court, except Canada, recognize Palestine as a state. Khan rejected accusations of anti-Semitism against him, saying 'There are many insults, threats, and manipulations between politicians, intelligence agencies, and interest groups, but I know myself.' Khan emphasized that 'the victims' expectations from the law and their demands for equal application of the law everywhere in the world are what really matter to me.'

**British Government Ready to Provide Evidence to International Court on Gaza**
The British Ministry of Defense has revealed that the intelligence information gathered by the Royal Air Force's surveillance planes over the Gaza Strip can be used as evidence against Israel in the International Court of Justice in The Hague if requested. The planes, which operate from the Akrotiri military base in Cyprus, conduct daily missions over the 25-mile-long Gaza Strip to help Israelis locate hostages taken by Hamas since over a year ago. According to the Ministry of Defense, if a formal request is made, the videos or images obtained by the planes can be handed over to the International Criminal Court as evidence of war crimes suspected to have been committed by Israel or Hamas. The Royal Air Force's surveillance and monitoring missions began in December 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israeli settlements in what is known as the 'Gaza envelope' on October 7, 2023. Although the Ministry of Defense has not officially disclosed the type of planes or their number, the Shadow R1 plane, equipped with high-resolution electronic and visual sensors to collect data, is operating in the area. A military source said that the Shadow R1 plane will not be able to 'monitor all of Gaza' but will be able to monitor convoys of vehicles, streets, and apartment blocks. He added, 'If the International Criminal Court comes to us and says, 'We believe there is a war crime in this area,' and asks if we have any footage, will the British government provide it? Yes, of course.' Experts tracking the movement of planes and ships said that between December 2023 and June 2024, the Royal Air Force conducted over 250 flights near the Gaza Strip. The International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, saying there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe they are responsible for crimes against humanity and other crimes. Israel has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza and cut off vital aid. A Ministry of Defense spokesperson said, 'In line with our international commitments, we will consider any formal request from the International Criminal Court to provide information related to investigations into war crimes.'

**Britain Prepares to Hand Over Gaza Intelligence to International Criminal Court**
The British Ministry of Defence has revealed that the intelligence gathered by the Royal Air Force's surveillance planes over Gaza can be used as evidence against Israel in the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The planes, which conduct near-daily missions over the 25-mile-long Gaza Strip, are attempting to help Israelis identify the locations of hostages taken by Hamas over a year ago. According to the Ministry of Defence, if a formal request is made, the videos or images obtained by the planes can be handed over to the International Criminal Court as evidence of suspected war crimes committed by Israel or Hamas. The RAF's surveillance and monitoring missions began in December 2023, following Hamas's attack on the settlements known as the Gaza Envelope on October 7, 2023. Although the Ministry of Defence has not officially disclosed the type of planes or their number, the Shadow R1 plane, equipped with high-resolution electronic and visual sensors to collect data, is operating in the area. A British military source said that the Shadow R1 plane will not be able to 'monitor all of Gaza' but will be able to monitor convoys of vehicles, streets, and blocks of flats. He added, 'If the International Criminal Court comes to us and says, 'We believe there is a war crime in this area,' and asks if we have any footage, the government's response will be, 'Yes, we do, and we will provide it.'

**Britain Prepares to Provide Intelligence to International Criminal Court on Gaza Flights**
The British government has announced its readiness to provide intelligence information collected by its Royal Air Force aircraft during their flights over the Gaza Strip to the International Criminal Court, if a formal request is made. The British military has conducted hundreds of flights over the Gaza Strip since the start of the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Strip for the second year in a row, using the 'Shadow R1' spy plane, equipped with high-precision electronic and optical sensors to collect data. According to the British Ministry of Defense, 'in line with our international commitments, we will consider any formal request from the International Criminal Court to provide information related to investigations into war crimes', emphasizing that 'the United Kingdom is not a party to the conflict between Israel and Hamas'. The Ministry added that 'our mandate is narrowly focused on securing the release of hostages only, including British nationals, where the Royal Air Force conducts routine unarmed flights since December 2023 for this sole purpose.' So far, there has been no formal request from the International Criminal Court to the British government regarding the information collected during the aerial flights over Gaza, according to BBC. A British military source told The Times that the Shadow R1 plane 'will not be able to cover the entire Gaza Strip, but it will be able to monitor convoys, streets, and residential buildings.' The source added that the plane 'is capable of monitoring streets, buildings, and homes, and zooming in on specific movements', explaining that 'it has good sensors, but it only covers a small area.' In May, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced that he had requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes. Britain, which decided to suspend 30 licenses for exporting arms to the occupation due to the risk of their use in committing serious violations of international humanitarian law, revealed in July that it had decided not to proceed with efforts to challenge whether the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant.

**International Criminal Court to Change Judge in Netanyahu Case**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it will change one of the judges who will preside over the request of the prosecution to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The request was made by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, on May 20, to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for their responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The President of the Court stated that 'the President of the Court in that case, Judge Julia Motoc from Romania, requested a substitute for herself for health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia.' This development is expected to further delay the Court's decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Israeli Channel 12 reported on Friday that the delay is likely to be longer due to Judge Holzer's need to review the legal details of the case. Israel submitted documents to the Court on September 20, challenging the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, stated that 'the State of Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legality of the requests of the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense.' The International Criminal Court is the only independent court in the world established to investigate the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.

**ICC to Punish Mongolia for Failing to Arrest Putin**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has reacted to Mongolia's failure to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the ICC, the immunity of the head of state is not a valid reason to ignore the arrest warrant, and Ulaanbaatar's inaction has hindered the court's ability to perform its functions. The ICC has decided to refer this matter to the Assembly of State Parties. The maximum penalty that Mongolia may face is the loss of procedural rights, including the ability to nominate new judges. This is significant, given that a representative from Mongolia will join the ICC as a judge for the first time in 2024. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously criticized Mongolia's authorities for not implementing the ICC's arrest warrant, stating that 'this is not just someone's responsibility, it's the responsibility of the entire world.' Following this, Ukraine has called on Brazil to enforce the ICC's warrant if Putin visits in November for the G20 summit. However, Putin has announced that he will not attend the summit to avoid putting the organizers in an uncomfortable position.

**US Response to International Court Rulings Varies Depending on Who is Committing the Crimes**
The US response to international court rulings and military actions depends on who is committing them. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden said, 'It's justified and it's a very important point.' However, when the ICC requested an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in March 2024, Biden's response was 'intolerable.' The US also celebrated the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) provisional measures in March 2022, which ordered Russia to stop its military operations in Ukraine. However, when the ICJ issued similar measures in 2024 for Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, the US remained silent, Israel ignored the order, and Biden was forced to defend the Israeli operation, which he had previously called a 'red line' for Washington.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil in November. According to Putin, his presence would make the 'normal work' of the meeting impossible, as it would become the main topic of discussion. Putin stated that the international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) is not the reason for his decision, saying that 'judgments of this kind can be easily circumvented.' Putin added that his visit to Brazil would 'essentially ruin the work of the G20,' and that Russia would find someone to represent its interests in Brazil. Putin emphasized that Russia and Brazil have 'very warm and good relations,' and that if necessary, the governments would sign a 'bilateral agreement' to avoid any difficulties. The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Putin since March 2023, accusing him of being responsible for the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. Putin has avoided some international trips since then, but was not arrested during a visit to Mongolia, an ICC member state, where he was received with military honors.

**Putin Proposes Way to Avoid ICC Arrest Warrants through Intergovernmental Agreement**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) can be resolved by signing a intergovernmental agreement. He made this comment in the context of a possible trip to Brazil for the G20 summit, according to RIA Novosti. Putin noted that 'decisions of this kind are very easy to circumvent, it's quite simple. All you need to do is sign an intergovernmental agreement, and the ICC's jurisdiction will be limited.' He emphasized that Russia and Brazil have had strong and stable relations for many years, creating conditions for signing necessary documents without creating complex situations for the parties involved. However, Putin announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil, citing the need to avoid disrupting the work of the summit. He added that the Russian authorities will determine who will represent the country at the summit at a high level. Since December 1, 2023, Brazil has taken over the presidency of G20, and the final summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. Previously, the Federation Council commented on Ukraine's request to Brazil to arrest Putin.

**Putin Declines G20 Summit Invitation Due to ICC Arrest Warrant**
Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil in November due to concerns that his presence would create problems for Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Putin stated that he understands the situation surrounding Russia and has good relationships with Lula, but does not want to disrupt the normal functioning of the forum. 'We understand what's happening around Russia, and I understand it too. I have excellent, friendly relations with the President of Brazil. But I'm not going to go there to disrupt the normal work of this forum. Even if we exclude the ICC, all the conversations will be about it. We'll essentially ruin the work of the G20,' Putin said. Putin also referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a 'disrespected' organization that lacks universality and independence. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Commissioner for Children's Rights, on March 17, 2023, accusing them of forcibly deporting thousands of children from Ukraine.

**Putin Declines G20 Summit Invitation to Avoid 'Perturbing' the Event**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil on November 18-19, citing that his presence would 'perturb' the work of the G20. Putin, who has an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) related to his invasion of Ukraine, expressed that all discussions at the summit would revolve around the ICC's order, and that it would be unnecessary for him to attend. The ICC issued the arrest warrant in March 2023, and countries that are members of the ICC, such as Brazil, are theoretically obligated to arrest him if he enters their territories. However, Putin was received in Mongolia, also a member of the ICC, in September without being detained. Putin has avoided certain international trips since the ICC issued the arrest warrant, including the BRICS summit in South Africa in August 2023 and the G20 summit in India in September 2023.

**Putin Declines G20 Summit, Italy Invalidates Migrant Detention, and Ukraine Evacuates Civilians**
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil in November, citing the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrant against him. Putin stated, 'We understand perfectly that even excluding the ICC factor, all the discussion will be about that. And we will, in fact, disturb the work of the G20. Why bother? We are adults.' Meanwhile, an Italian court has invalidated the detention of 12 migrants transferred to Albania, citing a recent European Court of Justice ruling on 'safe' countries of origin. The French government has announced plans to tighten immigration laws, including making the country 'less attractive' to migrants, with new measures to be introduced in 2025. In Ukraine, authorities have ordered the evacuation of civilians from the city of Kupiansk and surrounding areas due to increased Russian attacks. The Ukrainian governor, Oleg Synegoubov, stated that 'approximately 10,000 people must be evacuated' and that the enemy is 'firing continuously and insidiously.' The King of the United Kingdom, Charles III, has arrived in Australia for a six-day visit, where he will address environmental issues and meet with scientists working on cancer research.

**Vladimir Putin Declines G20 Summit Invitation Due to ICC Warrant**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil on November 18-19 due to a warrant for his arrest issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) related to the war in Ukraine. Putin stated, 'We understand perfectly that, including or excluding the TPI factor, all the discussion will be only about that. And that would disturb the work of the G20. Why? We are adults!' The Brazilian government had been trying to provide guarantees for Putin's visit without being arrested, but the efforts were unsuccessful. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira stated, 'I cannot limit or restrict a judge, nor imagine or guess what they will do. There may be other things that can happen.' Putin has been avoiding international travel since the ICC warrant was issued, limiting his trips to countries that do not recognize the ICC as a legitimate authority.

**Ukrainian Prosecutor General Calls for Putin's Arrest at G20 Summit**
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin has called on the Brazilian authorities to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he attends the G20 summit in November, citing an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant. The Kremlin has stated that there is no decision yet on Putin's participation in the summit. In the past, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva promised not to arrest Putin, but later clarified that the decision would be made by the court, not the government. Kostin emphasized that the international community must unite to hold Putin accountable for his actions. 'If Putin dares to visit Brazil, I would like to remind the Brazilian authorities that, as a state party to the Rome Statute, they are obligated to arrest him,' Kostin said. 'I sincerely hope that Brazil will arrest him, confirming its status as a democracy and a state where the rule of law prevails.' The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023, accusing him of war crimes, including the deportation of children. Russia has denied the allegations and dismissed the ICC warrant as 'invalid.' Brazil has ratified the Rome Statute, which obliges states to enforce ICC decisions, including arrest warrants. However, Russia has withdrawn from the ICC's jurisdiction, and the United States, China, India, Iran, and others have not ratified the treaty. Ukraine ratified the Rome Statute in August 2024.

**ICC Issues Arrest Warrants for Libyan War Crimes Suspects**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has issued arrest warrants for six Libyan suspects accused of war crimes, including murder, torture, and rape. The suspects are accused of being members of the Kanijat militia, which committed atrocities against civilians in the town of Tarhuna between 2013 and 2022. According to ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, the three leaders of the militia, including its chief Abdurahem al-Kani, are among those sought. Khan stated, 'The exhumation of hundreds of bodies from mass graves in the former Kanijat stronghold since June 2020 has provided evidence of the scale of the atrocities committed.' The ICC had requested the arrest warrants in November 2022, but the identities of the suspects were kept secret for investigative reasons. Khan explained, 'The arrest and surrender of the six suspects can be most effectively supported by the public disclosure of these arrest warrants.' The ICC is working closely with Libyan authorities to apprehend the suspects.

**Kremlin Rules Out Meeting Between Putin and Biden, Citing Lack of Conditions**
The Kremlin stated on Friday that there are no conditions for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden, although they reiterated that Putin is 'open to all contacts'. 'There has been no conversation about this. Currently, there are no conditions, although the President (Putin) has said on numerous occasions that he remains open to all contacts', said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov in his daily telephonic press conference. Peskov responded to a question about the possibility of Putin meeting with Biden on the sidelines of the G20 or APEC summits scheduled for mid-November in Rio de Janeiro and Lima, respectively. US President Biden has stated that he does not believe Putin will attend those summits, citing that they will take place in countries that recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. 'As for the trip to this summit (G20), no decision has been made yet', said Peskov. Putin and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will discuss these and other issues at the BRICS summit scheduled for October 22-24 in the Russian city of Kazan. In December 2023, Lula invited Putin to the G20 summit, but noted that he will have to face the consequences of the ICC arrest warrant issued against him. 'If Putin travels to Rio de Janeiro? Well, he will be invited. He will have to face the consequences' of the international arrest warrant, said the Brazilian President in Berlin during a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

**Kremlin Works on Putin's Participation in G20 Summit**
The Kremlin is still working on the issue of Russian President Vladimir Putin's participation in the G20 summit in Brazil, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. 'We are continuing to work on this issue. And after the final decision is made, we will inform everyone,' Peskov said to journalists. Brazil has been chairing the G20 since December 1, 2023, and the final summit in Rio de Janeiro will take place on November 18. The Brazilian government has been working to make Putin's visit to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro possible this fall, despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. According to Folha de S.Paulo, the Brazilian government submitted a document with legal arguments in favor of Putin's visit to the UN Human Rights Commission in November last year. The commission is currently working on developing provisions for the immunity of heads of state, which would guarantee that leaders of countries are not subject to prosecution during international visits. The International Criminal Court, which Russia does not recognize, issued an arrest warrant for Putin and children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing Russia of 'deportation' of children who were rescued from Ukrainian shelling and evacuated to safe areas. Peskov called the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin 'unacceptable,' saying that Moscow does not recognize the court's jurisdiction and considers its decisions to be null and void.

**Guinea Ecuatorial Invites Putin to Visit Despite Not Complying with International Criminal Court Decisions**
Guinea Ecuatorial's President Teodoro Obiang has invited Russian President Vladímir Putin to visit the African country, which has not signed the International Criminal Court's founding treaty and has not complied with its decisions, including the arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. 'We are willing to host the Russia-Africa summit in our modern city of Malabo. We have all the necessary infrastructure,' Obiang said during an intervention in the Russian Duma. The African leader, who is visiting Russia for the second time in less than a year, added that he would like to have the participation of Russian deputies if the event takes place, and particularly 'the excellence of Vladímir Putin, whose personal presence would be a great honor for our people.' Obiang noted that 'Guinea Ecuatorial has not signed any cooperation agreement with the International Criminal Court, so we have all the necessary conditions' for Putin to visit the country without risk of being detained. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023 for his alleged role in the systematic deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, which has imposed significant restrictions on Putin's ability to travel. Obiang will participate today alongside Putin in the plenary session of the Russian Energy Week (REN) being held in Moscow until Saturday. In November last year, Obiang met with Putin at the Kremlin leader's country house on the outskirts of Moscow (Novo-Ogariovo).
