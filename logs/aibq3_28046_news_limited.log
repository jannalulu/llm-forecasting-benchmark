**China lithium prices hit new low on macro concerns, surging supplies**
China's lithium futures fell to a new low on Friday due to surging supplies and worsening macro-economic sentiment. The most-traded November lithium carbonate futures on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange hit 69,700 yuan (USD 9,835.74) per ton, the lowest since its launch last July. Analysts attributed the decline to worsened macro-sentiment, with data showing weakness in manufacturing activities in the US and China, and rapidly growing lithium output. State-backed research house Antaike forecast a near 200,000 tons of lithium resources supply surplus globally this year. Zhang Weixin, an analyst at China Futures, said that higher demand in September and October may give the market some support, but possible further falls in the fourth quarter cannot be ruled out.

**[SMM Analysis] August LiPF6 Price Change Analysis**
In August 2024, the price of lithium carbonate, a key raw material in the battery industry, experienced a slight decline. The price of battery-grade lithium carbonate dropped by 8.7% from 81,700 yuan/mt to 74,600 yuan/mt, while the price of industrial-grade lithium carbonate fell by 8.4% from 76,750 yuan/mt to 70,300 yuan/mt. This decline led to a reduction in LiPF6 prices, which dropped by 5.6% from 57,150 yuan/mt to 53,950 yuan/mt. Although prices declined at the beginning of August, the market saw slight fluctuations in the middle to late month, reflecting market uncertainty about future demand and the cautious attitude of producers towards price adjustments. The future price trend remains uncertain due to the global economic situation and changes in industry supply and demand.

**Argentina's Lithium Mining Sector Faces Challenges Amid Price Drop**
The Argentine mining sector, particularly the lithium extraction industry, is facing a complex scenario due to the significant drop in international prices of this mineral. Despite this, several mining companies have decided to recalibrate their projects in the country in response to a market stabilization. Currently, a ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) is priced at $10,483, less than a third of what it was worth a year ago and far from the peak of $80,909 registered in November 2022. This price drop is mainly due to an excess of supply and moderation in electric vehicle sales, whose production relies heavily on lithium for batteries. In response to this unfavorable scenario, mining companies have implemented strategies to reduce costs and ensure the viability of their projects. For example, Argosy Minerals, an Australian company, suspended certain operations and restructured its team at its Rincón project in Salta, seeking to reduce financial risks. Similarly, Galan Lithium decided to slow down the construction of its project in Catamarca, while Lake Resources opted to reduce costs and sell non-essential assets in Jujuy and Catamarca to focus on its Kachi project. On the other hand, Arcadium Lithium, resulting from the merger between the Australian Allkem and the US-based Livent, announced that it will postpone investments in its Sal de Vida project in Catamarca, prioritizing a sequential expansion over a parallel one, with the goal of maintaining a prudent financial focus, as said, 'We are taking a cautious approach to ensure the long-term viability of our projects.'

**Liontown shares at 52-week lows as lithium slump extends further**
Liontown Resources Ltd (ASX: LTR) shares have plummeted to 52-week lows, trading at 77 cents apiece, due to the lithium market slump. The spot price of lithium carbonate has dropped to CNY73,500, its lowest level in three years, caused by a supply glut and high input costs. Analysts at Bell Potter and Goldman Sachs see potential for a rebound, with a speculative buy rating and a price target of $1.90 per share, suggesting a 147% upside potential. However, the high level of risk associated with Liontown shares is acknowledged, given the volatile nature of the lithium market and the project's early stage of development. Liontown's Managing Director and CEO, Tony Ottaviano, is bullish about the company's rapid progression and transition to production.

**ASX lithium shares could be set for a bull run if this 25% forecast is right**
ASX lithium shares are rising despite the lithium carbonate price being at three-year lows. A new forecast from Citi predicts a 20% to 25% rise in lithium commodity prices over the next two to three months due to supply curtailments from CATL's lepidolite mines. Citi analyst Kate McCutcheon said, 'We expect investors, both inside and outside of China, to cover their shorts over the coming weeks on the back of recent supply curtailments from CATL's lepidolite cuts, inventory drawdowns, and seasonal peak demand.' Citi has lifted its 0 to 3-month price targets for lithium to $US14,000 per tonne for carbonate and $US14,200 per tonne for hydroxide. However, the longer-term view on lithium prices remains uncertain due to the persistent oversupply of lithium in 2023 and 2024.

**Lithium: Producer Shares Rally on High-Cost Supply Cut**
Lithium stocks rallied after battery producer CATL announced plans to cut lithium production at its lepidolite-based mines in China due to low prices. This marks one of the first major supply cuts in 2024, and the news sent China lithium carbonate futures and spot prices higher. The market is currently oversupplied, with prices falling to $10,500 per metric ton from a recent peak of $78,000 in November 2022. Analysts at Morningstar view US-listed lithium producers as undervalued, with Albemarle and Lithium Argentina being their top picks. They estimate that lepidolite-based producers are losing money at current prices and will likely be cut until prices rise to a breakeven level of $20,000 per metric ton. As demand continues to grow while supply growth slows, Morningstar sees a higher lithium price upside in the coming years.

**Lithium prices will likely stabilise on demand-supply balance**
Lithium prices have dropped by over 20% this year, but analysts say the demand-supply balance may help them stabilize. According to Trading Economics, lithium prices have declined by 21,500 Chinese yuan ($3,022) a tonne since the start of 2024. The commodity had soared to a record high of 5.75 million yuan ($808,299) in December 2022. The Australian Office of the Chief Economist (AOCE) said the rise in global lithium supply will see the lithium market remain in surplus. 'Chinese lithium lepidolite production has seen only modest declines despite falls in prices, and there are sizeable project pipelines in Australia and among emerging producers such as Argentina and Zimbabwe,' it said. The AOCE also said that the lithium sector overcapacity has emerged due to slowing growth in EV sales and a wave of investment in lithium production spurred on by the high prices of 2022. BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, forecasts that lithium prices will remain below 2022-2023 highs in 2024-2025 due to a rapidly expanding global lithium supply that has pushed the lithium market into surplus. 'We forecast Chinese lithium carbonate 99.5 per cent to average $15,500/tonne in 2024 and Chinese lithium hydroxide monohydrate 56.5 per cent at $14,000/tonne in 2024,' said BMI in its outlook.

**[SMM Analysis] Ternary cathode material prices fell in August, will they continue to fall in September?**
In August, the prices of ternary cathode materials continued to fall, with the price of 6-series monocrystal/power type dropping from 130,000 yuan/mt at the beginning of the month to 125,000 yuan/mt, a decrease of 5,000 yuan/mt. This decline was mainly due to fluctuations in raw material prices, particularly a 7,400 yuan/mt drop in battery-grade lithium carbonate and a 6,000 yuan/mt drop in battery-grade lithium hydroxide. However, with the stabilization and rebound of lithium carbonate and nickel sulphate prices, and the expected growth in demand for ternary cathode materials due to the increasing penetration rate of NEVs, it is expected that the prices of ternary cathode materials will slow their decline and remain stable in September. As one analyst noted, 'The recovery in demand and the stabilization and rebound of raw material prices will provide some support for ternary cathode material prices in September.'

**Lithium Producers Adjust Projects in Argentina Amid Price Decline**
The decline in international prices of lithium has led mining companies in Argentina to adjust their projects. Currently, a ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) grade battery is priced at US$ 10,483.00, less than a third of its value a year ago and far from the historical high of US$ 80,909.00 in November 2022. The decrease in prices is attributed to an excess of lithium supply and a moderation in electric vehicle sales, whose main component in batteries is lithium. This context has affected the 50 lithium initiatives in Argentina, of which only four are in production and six are under construction. Fernando Zevallos Sulca, senior analyst at the British consultancy CRU, stated that the increase in lithium production over the past few years, encouraged by the explosive price increase at the beginning of the decade, has resulted in a 250% increase in global production over the past three years. This imbalance between supply and demand has negatively impacted the income of producers, who are now focusing on generating cash and reducing costs to maintain financial stability. Companies such as Argosy Minerals, Galan Lithium, and Lake Resources have announced measures to reduce costs, adjust their staff, and sell non-essential assets. Despite the situation, companies in the sector have expressed their intention to continue investing in Argentina, although with possible delays in their original plans. Argentina, which has tripled its lithium production capacity over the past two years, is currently the world's fourth-largest producer of this mineral, behind Australia, Chile, and China. Zevallos Sulca predicts that production in Argentina will continue to grow and could compete with Chile's in the next decade, provided that the current projects can obtain the necessary financing, estimated at between US$ 3,500 and 4,000 million.

**SQM Reports 63% Decline in Profit Due to Lithium Price Drop**
SQM, the second-largest lithium producer in the world, reported a 63% decline in profit in the second quarter due to a decline in the price of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries. Despite selling a record 52,300 tons of lithium between April and June, the average price per ton was $12,700, a 62.6% decline from the previous year. SQM's CEO, Ricardo Ramos, stated that the trend of low prices is expected to continue in the second half of the year, with lithium prices in China being 20% lower than the average price observed in the second quarter of 2024. Ramos also mentioned that some lithium producers may reduce their production due to the low prices making projects economically unviable. SQM is maintaining its production estimate of 210,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in Chile and China, and expects its sales volumes in the second semester to be similar to those reported in the first semester of 2024. The company is reevaluating specific markets and initiatives that may be 'less attractive in the short term under these conditions.' SQM is expected to invest $1.6 billion this year. Its competitor, Albemarle, has announced cost-cutting measures after registering losses in the second quarter.

**Chile Maintains Lead in Lithium Production Despite Falling Prices**
Chile remains the leading producer of lithium in South America and the second-largest producer globally, behind Australia, according to Cochilco. The country produced 270,947 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2023, with projections of 275,000 and 285,000 tons for this and next year. However, lithium prices have fallen due to lower demand for electric vehicles, increased production, and reduced purchasing volumes. Exports of lithium have also decreased, with key markets being China, South Korea, and Japan. Cochilco forecasts that the average price of lithium carbonate in the Asian market will be $16,450 per ton in 2025. 'The market of electric vehicles and the high expectations that were not met are behind this fall in prices,' said Cochilco. 'The sales of electric vehicles have been lower than expected, and countries with the most relevant markets have started to end or reduce subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles.'

**Albemarle: Tough Road Ahead (NYSE:ALB)**
Albemarle Corporation's (ALB) stock has been affected by the decline in lithium prices, which have fallen to $11/kg, a level not seen since March 2021. The company's EBITDA guidance remains unchanged, but free cash flow is negative due to the $1.75 billion capex plan. Analysts expect lithium carbonate prices to recover to $15-$20/kg by 2028, but this may not be enough to generate positive free cash flow for Albemarle. The company's preferred shares are no longer attractive compared to the common shares, and holders risk having their dividend paid in stock rather than cash and converting to commons at a low price on the 3/1/2027 maturity date. Albemarle's low-cost resources and flexibility to produce both lithium hydroxide and carbonate give it an advantage over other players, but the company still faces challenges in the current lithium pricing environment.

**Argentina Reduces Reference Price for Lithium Carbonate Export by 80%**
The Argentine government has reduced the reference price for the export of lithium carbonate by 80%, from $53 per kilogram in May 2022 to $11 per kilogram currently. This decision follows the sharp decline in international lithium prices, driven by decreased demand for electric vehicles in China and Tesla. The new prices will be effective from July 23, 2024, and will apply to three types of lithium carbonate with different purity levels. The measure aims to improve the selectivity of the value system and detect deviations from usual prices for similar products.

**Argentina Reduces Reference Value for Lithium Carbonate Export**
The Argentine government has reduced the reference value for exporting lithium carbonate by 80% to $11 per kilogram, following a sharp decline in international prices. The new values are intended to improve the system of selectivity in value, detecting deviations from usual prices for identical or similar goods. The resolution also established new prices for three positions of lithium carbonate, depending on quality, and set the effective date of the new prices as the second business day after publication in the Official Gazette. The price of lithium has fallen due to decreased demand for electric vehicles in China and Tesla, the main US manufacturer. Argentina is not immune to this international framework, but recently inaugurated its fourth lithium production plant, tripling its production capacity to over 136,000 tons per year.
