**INT. FORECASTING ROOM - DAY (2024-10-02)**

*The room buzzes with the quiet hum of computers. Screens display maps and data. Three superforecasters, ALEX, JORDAN, and SAM, sit around a table, analyzing the past events.*

**ALEX:** So, the question resolves positively. Ukraine withdrew from Kursk before October 1st.

**JORDAN:** Right. Our models had it at 85.75%. Given the August incursion, the stabilization was pivotal.

**SAM:** The data cutoff on August 21st left some uncertainties, but our historical analysis of similar conflicts helped. 

**ALEX:** The DeepStateMap and ISW's reports aligned perfectly. Even with the initial gains, the withdrawal was expected.

**JORDAN:** Indeed. It's fascinating how the dynamics shifted. The models accounted for geopolitical pressures and Ukraine's strategic interests.

**SAM:** It’s a testament to our forecasting accuracy. The models reflect reality, even when the situation seemed fluid.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the screen displays the final resolution.*

INT. WAR ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A dimly lit room buzzes with tension. SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, their faces illuminated by screens displaying maps and data.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, it didn't happen. Ukraine held Kursk.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. A bold move, but the stabilization after August was telling.

FORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to a map)  
The incursion was significant, but the defenses were robust. News up to August 21 suggested a stalemate.

FORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
DeepStateMap and ISW never showed a full withdrawal. Our models predicted the resilience.

FORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
A complex situation, but our probabilities reflected the reality. Kursk remains under Ukrainian control.

The room hums with quiet satisfaction, the superforecasters' accuracy reaffirmed. The screen flickers, showing Kursk still contested, yet held.

FADE OUT.
