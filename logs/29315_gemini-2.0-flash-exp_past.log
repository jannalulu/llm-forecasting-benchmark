Okay, let's break down this forecasting challenge.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No readily available aggregated predictions:** I couldn't find specific forecasts for this exact question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'll be relying heavily on the individual news articles to guide the estimate.
*   **Expert Predictions:** Ryan Tyson, a GOP strategist, predicts a Trump win by 13 points and Scott by 12. This is a very strong inside view, but needs to be weighed against other poll data.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem:**

The core question is: Will Trump get more votes than Scott? To answer this, I need to consider:

*   **Individual Performance:** Both Trump and Scott are Republicans running in Florida, typically have strong overlap in voters, but also have slight variations in their voter base.
*   **Turnout:** Different voter turnout could significantly shift relative vote totals.
*   **Margin of Victory:** Even if both win, the margin of victory for each could impact the comparison. The most important thing is not who wins but by how many votes.
*  **Polling Accuracy:** We know polls can sometimes miss voter turnout or be influenced by survey design so it is important to consider this when making judgements. 
*  **Historical Trends**: Florida has been trending more Republican in recent elections, so we need to consider how strong that tendency is.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** Historically, we know that while presidential and senate races correlate, they don't always align perfectly. Sometimes a senate candidate can outperform or underperform the presidential candidate. Therefore, a reasonable starting point is that it's approximately 50% chance for either candidate to outperform the other.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Trump's Popularity:** The articles suggest Trump has a strong and reliable base in Florida. He also does well with certain demographics such as Cuban-Americans. Many polls show Trump leading Harris, often by a reasonable margin.
    *   **Scott's Popularity:** Rick Scott's polls are slightly less definitive, with some suggesting he is in a close race. His leads are often smaller than Trump's and he appears less popular with some Republicans.
    *   **Recent Polling Data:** Many polls show Trump leading Kamala Harris between 2-14% while Scott is leading Mucarsel-Powell between 1-9%. So Trump generally appears to be performing better than Scott based on the polling data provided, even if they both lead.
    *   **GOP strategist analysis:** Ryan Tyson predicts a Trump victory by 13 percentage points and Scott by 12, but this needs to be tempered with the fact that he is a GOP strategist who would be likely to want to present this as a possibility. 
    *   **Early voting trends:** Early voting data suggests a strong Republican turnout.
    *   **Scott's focus on the issues**: Scott seems to be focusing on issues like the economy, immigration and healthcare while Trump seems to be focusing more on his own narrative. 

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting:**

*   **Overreacting:** It would be unwise to overreact to the single strategist prediction of Trump by 13 and Scott by 12, since that is only one source and is quite specific.
*   **Underreacting:** It would be equally unwise to underreact to the fact that most of the polls presented show Trump leading by more than Scott. There also seems to be a suggestion that the Republican party is more behind Trump than Scott.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Favoring Trump Outperformance:** Trump's higher poll numbers across multiple polls, his stronger appeal to certain voter groups (Cuban-Americans), and his more enthusiastic base. The Republican party seems to be more fully behind Trump than Scott.
*   **Forces Favoring Scott Outperformance:** Scott is an incumbent senator with some level of name recognition and a focus on issues important to many Florida voters. 

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**

*   The trend in Florida is towards the Republicans, but polls still show that both the Senate and Presidential races are close.
*   Trump consistently appears to have a stronger lead than Scott.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is significant doubt about the precise margins of victory. While Trump is leading, the precise margin may be within the same range as Scott's margin.
*   There is less doubt about whether either of them will win overall given current polling but it is always possible for an upset to occur.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   There is a strong possibility that Trump will outperform Scott in terms of total votes, given his consistently larger poll leads, but this does not guarantee that will occur.
*   I need to avoid being overconfident in Trump outperforming Scott and allow for a decent margin of error.

**9. Looking for Errors (and Avoiding Hindsight Bias):**

*   It's important not to give too much weight to one source (GOP strategist), and to look for the range of potential outcomes given the polls. 
*   It is important to avoid being overly confident based on early polling numbers.
*  I will aim to take an objective view of the available data and not be unduly influenced by any personal bias.

**My Forecast:**

The base rate is 50% chance of either outperforming the other. After weighing all the evidence, Trump appears to be outperforming Scott by a small margin on most polling data. Therefore I will move the probability above the base rate, but not too high to account for uncertainty of final vote tallies.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question with a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No direct human predictions:** I don't have access to real-time predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this very specific question of Trump outperforming Scott in Florida vote totals, which makes this analysis more reliant on the data I have provided.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

To evaluate this, I need to consider:
    *   **Trump's expected vote share in Florida:** This is influenced by national trends, his base support in Florida, and his ability to turn out voters.
    *   **Scott's expected vote share in Florida:**  This is impacted by his incumbency, his own base, and any potential split-ticket voting.
    *   **Comparison:**  The key isn't their absolute vote share, but *who gets more.*
    *   **Potential for surprises:** Late-breaking events or unexpected turnout shifts.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside view:**
    *   **Historical precedent:**  Florida has become increasingly Republican. In recent elections, Trump has performed well in Florida, although not always by large margins.
    *   **Incumbent advantage:** Incumbents usually have an advantage, especially in a state that leans towards their party.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Polling Data:** Numerous polls show Trump leading Harris in Florida and Scott leading Mucarsel-Powell in the senate race.
        * The most recent polling data leans towards a mid-single-digit lead for Trump in the state. 
    *   **GOP Enthusiasm/Turnout Models:**  Some sources suggest Republicans will have high turnout due to Trump's ability to mobilize low-propensity voters.
    *   **Split-Ticket Potential:** Some polls suggest that some Republicans are not fully backing Scott, potentially leading to a slightly lower turnout for him.

**4. Balancing Under- and Over-Reacting:**

*   I need to be wary of recent polls that are within the margin of error. Many polls show close races. 
*   I must avoid being overly confident about a high Republican turnout. There's a possibility of Democratic surprises, or voters not showing up as forecasted by Tyson.
*   I need to consider the possibility that the abortion and marijuana amendments on the ballot may affect voter turnout and potentially motivate more Democrats to vote.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces favoring Trump outperforming Scott:**
    *   Trump is a bigger national draw with a more enthusiastic base.
    *   He has higher name recognition, which may drive a larger turnout.
    *   Tyson model predicts that Trump wins by 13 percentage points and Scott by 12 points
    *   Trump appears to have stronger backing than Scott among likely Cuban-American voters in Miami-Dade.
    *   Recent polls show that Trump is significantly ahead of Harris, with 53% to 44% among likely voters.
*   **Forces favoring Scott outperforming Trump:**
    *   He is an incumbent senator and has the associated advantages of recognition and resources.
    *   Some Republican voters may not be enthusiastic about Trump, potentially affecting his numbers more than Scott.
    *   Scott has been campaigning and invoking Trump's name to sell his conservative credentials.
    *   The senate race has had a lot of focus put on it, especially in the last couple of weeks which could indicate a higher turnout in that race.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The current trend shows a Republican advantage in Florida, with Trump and Scott leading in most polls.
*   However, some polls indicate that the margins are narrowing, and the possibility for a surprise is present.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The level of doubt should be moderate. While most polls show leads for Trump and Scott, the data isn't consistent. Some suggest close races, so a narrow win in either direction is possible, as are surprise outcomes.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

I will avoid being too confident on a clear Trump win, even if some polls show a large lead. I will also avoid dismissing the possibility that Scott might outperform Trump in the total vote count. This is because of the lack of consistent polling and the fact that polling is a snapshot in time and can be subject to change.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I need to be aware that I might be overemphasizing certain polls or ignoring some contradictory information, I will re-evaluate the situation should more data become available.
*   I will also remember not to think in hindsight that I should have made a different call after the results become clear.

**Analysis and Probability:**

Based on the above analysis, the following is true:
* There is strong evidence that Trump will perform well in Florida given his base support, the large amount of registered Republican voters and the fact that he won both times when he previously ran.
* Recent polls show that he is ahead of Kamala Harris by single and double digit numbers.
* Rick Scott is also likely to perform well, as he is a well known incumbent in a Republican leaning state.
* Recent polls also show that Scott is leading Mucarsel-Powell in the Senate race.
* There have been some suggestion of a high turnout of Republican voters in the state.
* Both candidates are campaigning hard, and focusing on getting out their vote.

Given these factors, it is more likely that Trump will get more votes than Scott, as he is the more popular candidate with the higher turnout. The fact that Scott is an incumbent is not likely to impact his overall numbers, given the context of Florida elections. However, the fact that he may get more votes from Republican voters who do not support Trump, while likely, is not enough to impact overall predictions.

**My Prediction:** Between 60.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

**2. Break Down into Sub-Problems:**

To answer the overall question ("Will Trump outperform Scott in Florida?"), we need to consider:

*   **Trump's expected vote share in Florida:** This is the numerator in our comparison.
*   **Scott's expected vote share in Florida:** This is the denominator in our comparison.
*   **The relationship between presidential and senate race turnout:** Do voters reliably split their ticket or tend to vote straight-party? Are they more likely to turn out for Trump or Scott?
*   **How likely are the polls to be wrong, and in which direction?**  We have a range of polls, so some will likely be outliers in either direction.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**  Looking at past election results in Florida, there is a strong correlation between presidential and senatorial results. Historically, it is very unusual for a presidential candidate of the same party to receive a substantially lower vote total than a Senate candidate from their party. Florida has also trended Republican in recent years. In general, we can start from the assumption that for candidates from the same party, both of whom are well known, that their vote total should be relatively close, within a few percentage points at most.
*   **Inside View (Specific Information):** Here, we examine the unique factors related to Trump and Scott in 2024 in Florida.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I need to avoid both ignoring relevant information and overreacting to the most recent poll.
*   I will focus on overall trends across multiple polls, not just one or two outliers.
*   I will consider the reliability of the pollsters (based on FiveThirtyEight ratings, where available), while understanding this is not a guarantee of accuracy.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces favoring Trump outperforming Scott:**
    *   Trump is a unique figure who is known to turn out a dedicated base of voters, and may bring out more low-propensity voters than Scott.
    *   Some analysts suggest that Trump is significantly outperforming generic Republican vote share.
    *   Some polls show Trump with a double-digit lead, though many others suggest a single-digit lead.
    *   Trump's rallies tend to draw a lot of people which may translate to enthusiasm and votes.
    *   Scott is seen as less popular than Trump, or as a less inspiring figure by some observers.
*  **Forces favoring Scott outperforming Trump:**
    *   Scott is an incumbent senator with a strong, well-funded campaign and well-known in the state.
   *  The senate race is attracting a lot of attention because of the tight margin and impact it could have on control of the senate, this may lead to higher voter turnout.
    *   Scott is also a well-known figure in Florida with a strong brand.
    *   Some polls show Scott with a slight lead over his Democratic opponent, which suggests he could have a higher base vote share.
    *   The two have different electorates - Scott will likely pull more centrist/moderate Republicans, while Trump is pulling a more populist vote. It is unclear which will have more votes at the end.
*   **Forces that suggest both may underperform:**
    *   The state has been affected by hurricanes in the run up to election day, which may impact voter turnout.
    *   A significant amount of early voting has already occurred (2.25 million), which may limit the impact of last-minute shifts in voter sentiment.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The overall trend is that both Trump and Scott are favored to win their respective races in Florida. Most polls have Trump up by a few points and Scott also up by a few points. There are some outliers on both sides, but these tend not to be from the most reputable pollsters.
*   Based on the current trends, I'd expect the vote totals for Trump and Scott to be relatively close in percentage terms. The most recent high quality poll (FAU, October 29) has Trump 53% to Harris 44% and Scott up by 4 percentage points against his competitor.
*   There is also some indication that Trump can draw more low propensity voters to the polls than Scott, which may give him the edge.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I have a reasonable level of certainty that both will perform strongly in Florida. I'm less certain that Trump will win more votes than Scott, given the different dynamics of a presidential vs senate race, and that some polls show Scott very close to, or even slightly ahead of, Trump.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I will avoid being overconfident, acknowledging that polling can be wrong and shifts can occur. I also won't be too timid, given the clear lean of the state towards Republicans.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will keep track of how polls performed, focusing on my calibration. If polls are biased in one direction, it will be important to learn and to adjust predictions going forward.

**Reasoning for Prediction:**

The polls consistently show that Trump and Scott have an edge in Florida. However, the range of results suggest a degree of uncertainty about whether Trump will outperform Scott. Some polls suggest Trump is outperforming generic Republican support, while others show close races or even have Scott slightly ahead. The two have slightly different electorates, but the overlap is very large. Scott may have more moderate Republican support that is turned off by Trump. Trump is a unique figure with high name recognition and a dedicated base. However, both are well-known and well-funded and are likely to turn out a lot of voters. Some historical evidence suggests that a presidential candidate in the same party may get slightly more votes than a senator in the same state, but not consistently. Taking all factors into account, a reasonable prediction is that Trump is somewhat more likely to outperform Scott.

**My Prediction:** Between 40.00% and 70.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

*   I will consider the reliability of the pollsters (based on FiveThirtyEight ratings, where available), while understanding this is not a guarantee of accuracy.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces favoring Trump outperforming Scott:**
    *   Trump is a unique figure who is known to turn out a dedicated base of voters, and may bring out more low-propensity voters than Scott.
    *   Some analysts suggest that Trump is significantly outperforming generic Republican vote share.
    *   Some polls show Trump with a double-digit lead, though many others suggest a single-digit lead.
    *   Trump's rallies tend to draw a lot of people which may translate to enthusiasm and votes.
    *   Scott is seen as less popular than Trump, or as a less inspiring figure by some observers.
*  **Forces favoring Scott outperforming Trump:**
    *   Scott is an incumbent senator with a strong, well-funded campaign and well-known in the state.
   *  The senate race is attracting a lot of attention because of the tight margin and impact it could have on control of the senate, this may lead to higher voter turnout.
    *   Scott is also a well-known figure in Florida with a strong brand.
    *   Some polls show Scott with a slight lead over his Democratic opponent, which suggests he could have a higher base vote share.
    *   The two have different electorates - Scott will likely pull more centrist/moderate Republicans, while Trump is pulling a more populist vote. It is unclear which will have more votes at the end.
*   **Forces that suggest both may underperform:**
    *   The state has been affected by hurricanes in the run up to election day, which may impact voter turnout.
    *   A significant amount of early voting has already occurred (2.25 million), which may limit the impact of last-minute shifts in voter sentiment.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The overall trend is that both Trump and Scott are favored to win their respective races in Florida. Most polls have Trump up by a few points and Scott also up by a few points. There are some outliers on both sides, but these tend not to be from the most reputable pollsters.
*   Based on the current trends, I'd expect the vote totals for Trump and Scott to be relatively close in percentage terms. The most recent high quality poll (FAU, October 29) has Trump 53% to Harris 44% and Scott up by 4 percentage points against his competitor.
*   There is also some indication that Trump can draw more low propensity voters to the polls than Scott, which may give him the edge.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I have a reasonable level of certainty that both will perform strongly in Florida. I'm less certain that Trump will win more votes than Scott, given the different dynamics of a presidential vs senate race, and that some polls show Scott very close to, or even slightly ahead of, Trump.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I will avoid being overconfident, acknowledging that polling can be wrong and shifts can occur. I also won't be too timid, given the clear lean of the state towards Republicans.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will keep track of how polls performed, focusing on my calibration. If polls are biased in one direction, it will be important to learn and to adjust predictions going forward.

**Reasoning for Prediction:**

The polls consistently show that Trump and Scott have an edge in Florida. However, the range of results suggest a degree of uncertainty about whether Trump will outperform Scott. Some polls suggest Trump is outperforming generic Republican support, while others show close races or even have Scott slightly ahead. The two have slightly different electorates, but the overlap is very large. Scott may have more moderate Republican support that is turned off by Trump. Trump is a unique figure with high name recognition and a dedicated base. However, both are well-known and well-funded and are likely to turn out a lot of voters. Some historical evidence suggests that a presidential candidate in the same party may get slightly more votes than a senator in the same state, but not consistently. Taking all factors into account, a reasonable prediction is that Trump is somewhat more likely to outperform Scott.

**My Prediction:** Between 40.00% and 70.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using the superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No specific human predictions:** I don't see any relevant predictions from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus about this specific question (Trump vs. Scott in terms of *raw vote count*). This means I'll have to rely on the available news articles and my analysis.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

To tackle this, I need to think about:

*   **Trump's expected vote share in Florida:** How many votes is Trump likely to receive in the presidential election?
*   **Scott's expected vote share in Florida:** How many votes is Scott likely to receive in the Senate race?
*   **Comparing those two:** Given the expected turnout for each, what is the probability that Trump's raw vote total will be higher?
* **Factors Affecting Turnout**  The past few years in Florida have been trending Republican, and I will need to factor in the impact of any issues like abortion and marijuana, which might have an effect.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**
    *   It's unusual for a presidential candidate not to outperform a Senator in the same state *unless* there is significant third-party support (which doesn't appear likely here), or there are other unusual factors, I do not have any strong base rates here to begin with but generally, in the past, Presidential races have more turnout. 
    *   Presidential races tend to have higher turnout than senate races.

*   **Inside View (Specific Factors):**
    *   **Trump's Strength:** Articles consistently point to Trump's strong position in Florida. Several polls show him leading, and he is favored by the GOP in Florida, which is trending Republican. There are a couple of outliers that show Trump barely ahead, but the general trend of polling is that he leads in the state.
    *   **Scott's Strength:** Scott is also a well-known figure in Florida and is also shown to be ahead in polls, however, it's worth noting, he is *not* outperforming Trump, and some polling even suggests that the Senator is underperforming the ex-president.
    *  **Early Voting**: The articles note that a large number of Republicans have already voted early, this is a good sign for both Trump and Scott, as well as highlighting the general partisan lean of the state.
    *   **Voter Demographics:** Trump seems to be doing especially well with Hispanic voters, particularly Cuban-Americans, which is a key demographic in Florida.
    *   **Contradictory Polls:** We see a variety of poll results that seem at odds with each other. For instance, Tyson predicts double-digit wins for both Trump and Scott, while others show very narrow leads. Also, in some cases Trump is ahead, and in others the races are close, it is important to take these with a grain of salt, as polls can be volatile and there are plenty of articles that show that the two candidates have support from the state, while they are ahead, some have margins of error that indicate that the races are too close to call.
    *   **Impact of Ballot Initiatives**:  The article mentions the ballot initiatives on abortion and marijuana that could potentially affect turnout, especially for democratic voters. While both amendments are likely to pass, it is unclear what effect these could have on the race.
     *   **Underperforming Incumbents** One article points out that incumbents Cruz and Scott aren't blowing out their opponents as much as might be expected. This points to an opportunity for a lower vote share than expected.
     *   **GOP Strategist Predictions:** Ryan Tyson's prediction of R+11 turnout model, with Trump winning by 13 percentage points and Scott by 12, is notable. This suggests that both candidates may outperform public polls.
    *   **Campaign rhetoric:** In the leadup to the election, Scott himself mentioned that Trump would be the next President, this indicates that there is a clear focus within the Republican party on putting Trump ahead, and while this is not an explicit push to get him more votes, it is a subtle one.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   It's important not to overreact to any single poll. The variety in the data suggests that some polls may be outliers.
*   I need to be careful not to overemphasize the "Florida is a Republican state" narrative, while this is trending, the state *can* still be competitive.
*   I need to not overreact to the R+11 prediction, as it is just one source.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Trump's base:** Strong Republican support, particularly with certain demographics (Cuban-Americans). His base may be more motivated to vote.
*   **Scott's base:** Scott is an incumbent Senator, but some evidence shows he might be underperforming Trump.
*   **Democratic Turnout:** The articles mention that Democrats are making efforts, however, they do not have the same level of voter turnout as Republicans.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   Extrapolating from current trends, Trump is likely to win Florida, and Scott is also likely to win the Senate race. However, this doesn't directly address the question, which is about total vote count.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's a high likelihood that Trump will win in Florida, and a likely chance that Scott will win his seat. However, the polling variance on margins of victory means it's harder to determine the precise vote totals that each will receive.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I need to be confident but not overconfident. It's likely that Trump will outperform Scott in terms of total votes due to the high turnout in presidential elections, but there is a chance that this might not happen if democratic turnout is higher than anticipated.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   I will need to examine what polling errors may have taken place when looking back.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Given the analysis above, here's how I'm balancing the evidence:

*   The base rate suggests that presidential candidates get more votes, and that trend looks likely to hold in this case.
*   Trump is consistently shown as the stronger performer than Scott. He has a powerful and energised base.
*   While some polls have Scott close, all signs point to Trump having the stronger turnout, specifically in key demographics such as the Cuban-American population.
*   The GOP strategist prediction of a significantly better turnout for Republicans also lends itself to this point.

Therefore, it is more likely that Trump will receive a larger number of votes than Scott. It isn't a guarantee, as elections are unpredictable, however, the data points to that direction.

**My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.**

Okay, let's tackle this question systematically, using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No direct reference predictions found:**  I haven't found explicit predictions for this exact comparison of Trump vs. Scott vote totals in Florida in the sources provided, including sites like 538, Polymarket or Metaculus. There is lots of polling on both of them individually but not against each other directly. Thus I need to build my own forecast.
*  **General Context** Florida has become a Republican stronghold in recent years, with Trump winning the state in both 2016 and 2020. Both Trump and Scott are Republicans, which makes the comparison more complex.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To assess this, I need to consider a few sub-problems:
*   **Trump's expected vote share:** What is Trump's likely performance in Florida?
*   **Scott's expected vote share:** What is Scott's likely performance in Florida?
*   **Comparison of turnout:** Given they are on different ballots (Presidential vs. Senate) how will the different turnout dynamics affect the result.
*   **Polling Uncertainty:** How reliable are the polls, and how much variance should we expect?
*   **Unique factors:** Are there factors that might disproportionately affect one candidate over the other, such as the abortion amendment or specific demographic trends?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, in states with Republican dominance and high polarization, it's unlikely for a US Senator to outperform the Republican candidate for President. Presidential elections usually have higher turnout and greater focus than Senate elections.  So a first guess based on the base rate is that Trump would likely get more votes than Scott. This would suggest an initial base rate probability above 50%.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this election):** This involves analyzing polling data and other specific information for this election.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Polls:** The polls show both Trump and Scott leading their respective Democratic opponents. However, there's considerable variation in the margins, and most polls show single-digit leads for both candidates.
*   **Trend towards Republican Dominance:**  Florida has moved further into the Republican camp in recent cycles, as evidenced by wins for Trump in 2016 & 2020, and DeSantis and Rubio in 2022. The registered Republican voter advantage of ~1 million is quite large.
*  **Trump's Turnout Advantage:** GOP strategist Ryan Tyson's analysis suggests that Trump is expected to turn out low-propensity voters better than other Republicans, and expects a 13 point margin compared to Scott's 12 point margin.  This suggests that Trump might outperform Scott more than usual.
*   **Cuban American Support:**  The fact that 68% of Cuban-American voters in Miami-Dade intend to vote for Trump compared to a much smaller fraction for Kamala Harris suggests that there will be a strong Trump performance in South Florida. The articles from CiberCuba and cubaheadlines.com confirm this.
*  **Possible Scott Underperformance:** Some articles suggest Scott might underperform Trump, due to Republicans not fully backing his reelection. (see the NY Post article). This means that the base rate will need some adjustment in this case.
*   **Tight Senate Race:** The Senate race between Scott and Mucarsel-Powell appears to be very close in the polls which makes it more likely that Scott would have a smaller absolute vote total than Trump
* **Scott Campaigning With Trump's Name** The fact that Scott is invoking Trump's name in campaign rallies with Rubio and Cotton means he thinks that will boost turnout for him. It also highlights the fact that Trump is the main driver of GOP turnout.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1: Strong Republican Trend:** Florida has a strong Republican base, favouring both candidates.
*   **Force 2: Trump's Turnout Power:** Trump seems to have a unique ability to boost turnout and is expected to have better voter turnout than Scott.
*   **Force 3: Close Senate Race:** The Senate race is very competitive which could cause the result to vary from historical norms.
* **Force 4: Demographics**: Trump has disproportionate support amongst key demographic groups, such as Cuban Americans.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   Given Trump's expected better turnout, there is nothing obvious to prevent this from being a linear extension of his past performance. The trend is for the state to become more Republican and there is no specific reason this would change now.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I'm confident that Trump will likely outperform Scott. However, the exact margin is uncertain, given the close senate race and possible underperformance from Scott.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I'm not going to be overconfident, but I'm also not going to be swayed by the possibility of an outlier outcome. I need to balance the evidence to make my estimate.

**9. Errors and Biases:**

I will attempt to avoid hindsight bias by focusing on the current polling data. I am also not going to be overly influenced by the close senate race or outlier polling numbers.

**My Reasoning and Forecast:**

Based on all of the above, the probability that Donald Trump will outperform Rick Scott in Florida in 2024 is quite high. Given Trump's stronger turnout capability, and the fact that presidential races usually have higher turnout, this is the most likely outcome. The polls indicate that both candidates will win but the margin for Trump is higher than the margin for Scott in polls. In addition, the specific data on Cuban American support suggests Trump will have a high vote total in Miami Dade County. This would also be consistent with a linear extrapolation of past trends in the state. There is little to suggest this trend will reverse between now and the election. I will put my median estimate at 75%. I will allow for some room for error given the competitiveness of the Senate race with a lower range of 65% and upper range of 85%.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.
