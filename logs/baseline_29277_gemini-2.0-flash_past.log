Okay, let's analyze this question. The key is to assess the likelihood of Riley Green endorsing Donald Trump before November 5, 2024.

First, consider Riley Green's background and public image. Is there any known political leaning? A quick search reveals that Green is generally considered to be aligned with a more traditionally conservative, Southern demographic, which is a group Trump often targets and enjoys support from. However, I haven't found explicit political statements or endorsements from Green in the past. Many country music artists are hesitant to make overtly political endorsements for fear of alienating portions of their fanbase.

Second, consider the timing. The election is rapidly approaching. If an endorsement were to happen, it would likely happen soon to have maximum impact. Has Trump's campaign actively sought endorsements from country music figures? This would increase the probability of an endorsement. I will assume that is the case because it is generally a common political tactic. 

Third, assess the incentives. What would Green gain or lose from such an endorsement? Potential gains include increased visibility within a segment of his fanbase. Potential losses include alienating other fans and opening himself up to criticism.

Given that Green hasn't made strong political statements in the past, a high probability of endorsement seems unlikely. However, given the target demographic alignment and the potential for some benefit from aligning with Trump (especially given other, higher-profile endorsements), it's not impossible.

With only about a week to go, I believe it's less likely than not.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
