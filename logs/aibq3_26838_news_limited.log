**How long before Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos go broke if they spent $1 million a day?**
According to a 2024 Oxfam report, the top four richest men in the world, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, have grown their wealth by $14 million per hour since 2020. If they spent $1 million per day, it would take Bezos 558.9 years and Musk 660.27 years to go broke. Their combined net worth is $445 billion, with Bezos having $204 billion and Musk having $241 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. However, their net worth may not represent their true wealth, as it is subjective to their holdings and investments. For instance, Musk's net worth fell by $16 million in a matter of hours after Tesla's stock tanked. In comparison, the average American household has a net worth of $1.06 million, but the median net worth is $192,900, a significant difference from the billionaires' wealth. There are online games available that allow players to spend virtual money like Musk and Bezos, giving people a taste of their riches.

**Top Three Billionaires Compete for Top Spot on Bloomberg Billionaires Index**
The top three billionaires in the world are competing for the top spot, with Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault holding the top three positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for over 94% of the time this year. However, fluctuations in their wealth have led to them swapping places six times since May 29, with a frantic pace in the hierarchical sequence that has remained largely stable since Musk lost his top spot in early March. Musk, 52, regained the top spot on Monday for the second time since early March, replacing Bezos. This comes after Tesla's shares rose last week following a vote by shareholders to approve a compensation package for Musk, which was previously blocked by a Delaware court and transferred the company's headquarters to Texas. The package, which includes stock options worth up to $55.8 billion, now represents nearly a quarter of Musk's net worth. His net worth has also been boosted by a new funding round that values his artificial intelligence project, xAI, at over $24 billion. Bloomberg's wealth index estimates that Musk owns 65% of the company, which uses social media data to train its chatbot program, Grok. Meanwhile, Arnault, 75, has recently fallen to third place with a net worth of $199 billion, after spending most of the past three months in first place, and has seen his net worth decline by $13 billion since the surprise presidential election call by French President Emmanuel Macron sent the country's markets into their worst week in years. Most of his wealth comes from LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods manufacturer. Bezos, the 60-year-old founder of Amazon, currently holds the second spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $206.6 billion. Since May 29, he has regained the top spot three times, with Amazon's shares trading near all-time highs. The share has benefited from a broader rally in major technology companies responsible for nearly three-quarters of the S&P 500's gains this year.

**Three-way race for world's richest emerges**
The world's three richest billionaires, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, have been in a fierce race for first place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with the top spot changing hands six times since May 29. The fluctuations in their wealth have been influenced by a fight over Musk's pay package, a snap election in France, and a tech-stock rally. Musk, with a net worth of $210.1 billion, moved back into first place on Monday, replacing Bezos, after Tesla shares rallied following the re-approval of his 2018 compensation package and the company's move to Texas.

**Bernard Arnault's Fortune Plummeted by $20 Billion This Year**
LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's net worth has plummeted by $20 billion this year, the largest loss of any billionaire in 2024, according to Bloomberg. This decline has brought his net worth down to $187 million, ranking him third on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index behind Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. The decline is attributed to a slowdown in demand for luxury goods, especially in China, where LVMH recorded a 14% slump in sales in Asia. Arnault's statement acknowledged the company's resilience in a challenging climate, but rival Kering, which owns Gucci and other luxury brands, has also been struggling, estimating a 30% drop in operating profit in the second half of the year.

**Bernard Arnault Has Lost More Wealth Than Any Billionaire in 2024**
Bernard Arnault, the founder of LVMH, has lost more wealth than any other billionaire in 2024, with his net worth dropping by $20 billion to $187 billion. The decline is due to the economic malaise in China, a key market for the luxury industry. Arnault has fallen to No. 3 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, behind Elon Musk and Zhong Shanshan. Musk's wealth has also taken a hit, dropping $21.7 billion after Tesla's disappointing quarterly results. Despite this, he remains the world's richest person, ahead of Jeff Bezos.

**Donald Trump's Net Worth Doubles in 2024**
Donald Trump, the former US President and Republican candidate, has seen his net worth increase significantly in 2024. According to Forbes, Trump's net worth is estimated to be over $7.5 billion, with his main sources of income coming from his golf clubs and resorts, including Mar-a-Lago, which is valued at $292 million. Trump's net worth has increased due to his 58% stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns Truth Social, a social media platform. The platform went public on the stock market and saw a 54% increase in value within hours, making Trump's net worth jump to over $4 billion. However, Trump is no longer listed on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, although his net worth is still estimated to be in the millions.

**Elon Musk Donates Significant Amount to Fund Supporting Donald Trump**
According to Bloomberg, Elon Musk donated a significant amount of money to a fund supporting Donald Trump. The exact amount is unknown, but sources described the donation as substantial. This move highlights Musk's growing influence as the leader of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $263.6 billion, and his shift from being an independent political figure who claimed to stay out of politics to a figure who regularly uses his platform X to support right-wing views and attack Democrats. Musk's donation aims to 'leave a mark on the US political landscape'. The billionaire has not publicly endorsed any candidate in the 2024 elections, and earlier this year, he stated that he would not fund either Trump or Biden's campaigns.
