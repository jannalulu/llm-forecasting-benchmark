**Nandi-Ndaitwah candidacy a milestone for Namibia: Shaningwa**
Swapo Party Secretary General Sophia Shaningwa has hailed the Electoral Commission of Namibia's (ECN) confirmation of Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah as the party's presidential candidate as a significant milestone for Namibia. Shaningwa said Nandi-Ndaitwah is the first woman to run for the highest office in Namibia, and her declaration by the ECN should end malicious and politically motivated campaigns to delegitimise her candidacy. Shaningwa praised the party's members for remaining committed to supporting the party and its presidential candidate, saying 'We are happy that our members remained committed to supporting the party and its presidential candidate amidst a sea of lies, fake news and a politically motivated campaign of misinformation.' The ECN declared 15 presidential candidates, including Nandi-Ndaitwah as the only female candidate, as duly nominated for the upcoming general elections.

**Swapo registers Nandi-Ndaitwah as presidential candidate with ECN**
Swapo deputy secretary general Uahekua Herunga announced that the party has registered Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah as its presidential candidate with the Electoral Commission of Namibia. Herunga made the announcement at a Swapo rally in Endola, saying, 'She is officially registered at the ECN as our presidential candidate. Go out in huge numbers and vote Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah and Swapo party so we can go beyond a two-third majority – as we normally do.' This comes after a group of Swapo members requested that the ECN not allow Nandi-Ndaitwah to be registered as the party's presidential candidate, claiming she was not procedurally nominated.

**Who is Fooling Who, Madam NNN?**
Swapo presidential candidate Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah has been criticized for accepting donations from prominent individuals and companies, which she claims were given without strings attached. However, critics argue that this is a common practice in many democratic countries, where big companies give money to politicians in exchange for influence. Nandi-Ndaitwah has responded by saying that 'we cannot sell this country, not Swapo, not under the leadership that is in this room. It will not happen.' However, this is at odds with the fact that Swapo has hosted fundraising events explicitly inviting rich people for networking to 'influence government policies'. The article highlights the lack of transparency in party funding in Namibia, where parties do not submit detailed audited financials and their assets to parliament and the Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN). The public is left uninformed in a culture set by years of apartheid slush funds and independent Namibia's overwhelmingly dominant ruling party. The article also mentions that about 70% of Namibia's economy is dominated by the state's public works and purchasing contracts, better known as 'tenders', and that Swapo companies and entities owned by cronies of ruling party officials routinely get preferential treatment in winning the bids.

Nandi-Ndaitwah has denied any health issues, saying she is fine and ready to deliver her commitments for the next five years.

**PDM leader Venaani accuses Swapo’s Nandi-Ndaitwah of ignoring corruption claims amid controversial election tender**
PDM leader McHenry Venaani has accused Swapo's Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah of ignoring corruption claims amid a controversial election tender. Venaani said Nandi-Ndaitwah has a tendency of not voicing her opinion on alleged corruption, and that Swapo has a habit of protecting corrupt deals. He also accused the Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN) of using an emergency process to hire a company with corruption scandals in Zimbabwe to print ballot papers. Venaani said the ECN is eroding the integrity of Namibia's elections and demanded the immediate termination of the contract and an independent investigation into the procurement process. Political analyst Ben Mulongeni said it's concerning that the ruling party is silent on the issue. 'The fact that the company is rumoured to have been involved in some corruption scandals is enough for all of us to be concerned,' he said. Venaani warned the ECN chief referenda officer Peter Shaama that referenda officers have taken countries to war and that the ECN must distance itself from the alleged corrupt company. 'This place has lost integrity. You are a body that is firing at will, hiring at will, with no concern for procedure,' he said.

Mbumba emphasized the party's vision for economic emancipation and its readiness to secure another five-year mandate in the upcoming elections. He highlighted the party's 34-year governance, which has contributed to Namibia's peace, stability, and development. Mbumba stated that the party's election manifesto focuses on inclusive growth, sustainable use of natural resources, and youth empowerment. He emphasized the importance of value addition to raw materials, such as diamonds, uranium, and lithium, to create jobs and benefit Namibia directly. Mbumba also stressed the need to equip the youth with skills to become productive citizens, providing opportunities through education, vocational training, and support for small and medium enterprises. He pointed to Swapo's success in reducing poverty, growing the economy, and creating employment, citing the expansion of Namibia's GDP from N$7.2 billion in 1990 to N$227.8 billion by 2023, and the increase in formal employment from 180,000 in 1990 to over 725,000 by 2024. Mbumba said, 'History remembers creators, not critics,' and 'When you vote SWAPO back into power, many more factories will be built to add value to our minerals and generate wealth for Namibians.'

**ECN disqualifies three presidential hopefuls**
The Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN) has disqualified three presidential hopefuls, Ally Angula, Else Ndapandula Chen, and Jeremia Kaambo, from participating in the upcoming Presidential and National Assembly Elections due to non-compliance with nomination requirements. The ECN cited issues with the collection of registered voters' signatures, with Angula and Chen failing to secure the necessary 500 signatures per region, and Kaambo having a mismatch in signatures. The ECN has confirmed the successful nominations of 15 other presidential candidates, including prominent figures such as Erastus Shuumbwa, Job Shipululo Amupanda, and Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. The full list of presidential candidates will be published in the Government Gazette as stipulated by the Electoral Act. 'After a thorough review of the documents submitted by the presidential candidates, the Commission found that the nominations of Angula, Chen, and Kaambo did not meet the stringent legal requirements,' the ECN statement reads. 'The Commission attempted to seek clarification from Chen on the matter, but no response was received, leading to the rejection of her nomination,' the statement adds. 'Although he expressed his dissatisfaction with the process via email, the issues raised remained unresolved, resulting in his disqualification,' the ECN said about Kaambo.

**Criticism Surrounds Dino Ballotti's Sudden Return to NIPDB**
The sudden return of Dino Ballotti to the NIPDB's Investment and Development Board has raised questions. Ballotti had recently switched to a leadership role at FNB Namibia in August, but was also appointed as a SWAPO candidate for the National Assembly by Vice-President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. According to a report by the Namibian Sun, FNB and Ballotti ended their collaboration after just a few weeks. His prompt return to NIPDB has sparked sharp criticism. The PDM accuses the SWAPO of creating jobs for their political supporters, stating that Ballotti's new role as a technical advisor may have been created solely to secure his economic future for the coming months. The NIPDB itself says that Ballotti's departure to FNB left a significant gap in the company's structure, and that a temporary engagement is essential to achieve the NIPDB's strategic goals due to his comprehensive understanding of the institution.

**Namibia: Ad880 - Namibians Support Equal Access to Jobs but Say More Needs to Be Done to Protect Women and Girls From Discrimination and Harassment**
Namibia ranks 8th globally on the Global Gender Gap Index 2024, with impressive performance in educational attainment, health, and political empowerment. However, significant gaps exist in wage equality, ministerial positions, and female head of state. Despite progress in politics, women experience lower levels of full-time employment and earn less than men across most industries. Most Namibians support gender-equal opportunity, but minorities report frequent discrimination and harassment of girls and women. Only half of citizens believe that complaints of discrimination and harassment will be believed, and most think the police and courts should do more to protect women and girls. As the country approaches election year, women's participation in politics is a key focus, with the SWAPO Party electing its first female presidential candidate, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. 'Despite progress in the political sphere, gender disparities persist in the labour force,' said Christiaan Keulder, national investigator for Namibia. 'Only about one-third of the indicators needed to monitor the Sustainable Development Goals from a gender perspective are available, making it difficult to determine the exact extent of gender imparity in Namibia.'

**Swapo educates voters**
The Swapo Party, led by Omri-Onn Kavandje, held a mobilization campaign at Ohainana village in Ohangwena Region to educate voters on how to cast their votes during the upcoming elections. This initiative follows a request by Swapo's vice president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who called on party leaders to train voters on how to use ballot papers to reduce spoiled ballots. Kavandje emphasized the importance of preserving the peace and stability that Swapo fought for during the liberation struggle. Julia Helondo, a member of the Former Plan Combatants Association, joined the initiative and urged party supporters to bring back those who had joined other political parties, saying 'return home to Swapo.'

**Swapo challenges urgent application against extraordinary congress decision, labels it as abusive**
Swapo has labeled an urgent application against its decision to hold an extraordinary party congress next year as 'abusive'. The High Court struck the case from the roll after Judge Eileen Rakow identified numerous problems with the application. Lawyer Sisa Namandje, representing Swapo, argued that the application was 'abusive' and 'frivolous', and that the applicants were not vigilant enough to protect Swapo's right to a fair trial. The applicants, including Reinhold Shipwikineni, Petrus Shituula, Joshua Martins, Erich Shivute, and Aina Angula, wanted the court to review and set aside Swapo's decision to postpone the congress and nominate Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah as the party's presidential candidate. However, the court rejected their application, and Rakow remarked, 'You picked the date, you picked the time. You decided Monday is enough time.'

**Swapo extraordinary congress urgent application in court today**
Five Swapo members, including Reinhold Shipwikineni, have brought an urgent application to the Windhoek High Court to compel the party to hold an extraordinary congress before the November election. They claim that party presidential candidate Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah became a candidate in an irregular manner, violating the party constitution. Shipwikineni stated, 'If the urgent relief is not granted, we shall not obtain any substantial relief at any forum in future.' The applicants fear that if their case is not heard before the general election, they will lack recourse if Nandi-Ndaitwah is elected, as a president can only be removed through parliamentary impeachment. The party's secretary-general, Sophia Shaningwa, has described the lawsuit as 'abusive and malicious,' arguing that the applicants want to damage the party. However, Shipwikineni and his co-applicants consider Nandi-Ndaitwah to be an unconstitutional presidential candidate for Swapo, citing the party's constitution and succession policy. They also charge that Nandi-Ndaitwah nominated 10 members to the party's parliamentary list without authority, further justifying their urgency. The court has directed all implicated parties and their legal representatives to attend the urgent application hearing today.

She emphasized the transformative potential of AI in broadcasting, but stressed the importance of ensuring that it serves the public good without compromising journalistic principles. Nandi-Ndaitwah also highlighted the need for African nations to contribute to the world's innovation heritage, rather than just consuming global innovations. She encouraged the use of digital transformation to improve lives and extend digital connectivity to rural areas and schools. The Namibian Broadcasting Corporation's director general, Stanley Similo, emphasized the critical role public broadcasters play in supporting government communications during crises and encouraged attendees to use the convention as a platform for dialogue and innovation.

Namibia is interested in cooperation with BRICS and is studying the potential benefits of interaction, said Vice-President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah in an interview with RIA Novosti. 'We must be connected to different systems and see where we can get the best offers to follow our development agenda. That's why it's really important for us to be connected to BRICS and consider how we can maximize the benefits', she said. Nandi-Ndaitwah also noted the geographical coverage of BRICS and expressed confidence that it helps the adaptation of new members. 'If they (BRICS countries) unite on the basis of common understanding and mutual respect, you will have more chances, because, regardless of who comes from the same environment, they can understand each other and bring great benefits to the global economic system', she said.

**Shipwikineni’s legal challenge against Swapo moved to 30 October**
The court case involving Reinhold Shipwikineni and four other Swapo members against the party and its presidential candidate, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, has been postponed to 30 October. Shipwikineni's lawyer, Richard Metcalfe, stated that his client is not challenging Nandi-Ndaitwah's nomination as Swapo's presidential candidate, but rather seeking to hold the party accountable for constitutional violations. Metcalfe emphasized that Swapo members must obey the law and the party's constitution, and that his clients will not be intimidated by internal party politics. The case was initially scheduled for 18 October, but was postponed due to a change in judges. The plaintiffs argue that the Swapo Party Constitution mandates an extraordinary congress following the passing of President Hage Geingob, which has not been held.

**NAMIBIA STRENGTHENS GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN GREEN INDUSTRIALIZATION THROUGH STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH ELON MUSK: GREEN HYDROGEN ORGANISATION**
Namibia is strengthening its position as a global leader in green industrialization through a strategic partnership with Elon Musk's Tesla. The country aims to tap into Tesla's Energy Master Plan to further its green industrialization strategy, focusing on critical mineral resources and positioning itself as a hub in the global energy transition. Namibia's Green Hydrogen Commissioner, James Mnyupe, and His Excellency, Dr. Nangolo Mbumba, met with Elon Musk in New York to discuss the potential for investment in Namibia, particularly through SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service. The country's prominence in the global renewable energy conversation is also reflected in its hosting of the Namibia Green Hydrogen Forum, where Namibia's Minister of Mines and Energy, Hon. Tom Alweendo, presented the country's vision for developing competitive green hydrogen industries. As Namibia looks to achieve its ambitious vision, SWAPO candidate Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah stressed the importance of unity in achieving the country's goals, stating, 'We are delivering and we are going to deliver. Just give us that chance.'

**Namibia: Swapo's Manifesto Printed in Braille**
Swapo vice president Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah announced that the party has printed 500 copies of its manifesto in Braille, making it the first time in Namibian history that an election manifesto has been translated into this language. This move aims to ensure inclusivity among all Namibians, particularly visually impaired persons. Nandi-Ndaitwah emphasized the party's commitment to unity, peace, inclusiveness, and prosperity for all Namibians, and urged party leaders and supporters to explain the election campaign manifesto to citizens with enthusiasm. She also expressed confidence in her ability to lead Namibia and continue the work of her predecessors. Sophia Shaningwa, Swapo secretary general, welcomed back 50 youths who had rejoined the party and expressed confidence in Nandi-Ndaitwah becoming Namibia's first female president. 'We commit ourselves to inclusivity. I am happy that today I have the privilege to launch the Swapo Party election manifesto in Braille,' Nandi-Ndaitwah said. 'This is the first time in the history of our country to have an election manifesto translated into this language,' she added. 'We are going to increase our allocation of student support. What you must realise, if you analysing deeply, is that education in Namibia is basically free because many university students get their funding from the government,' Nandi-Ndaitwah emphasized. 'Let the turnout define our democracy, and let's go and get the two thirds majority (in the National Assembly) for Swapo and a decisive victory for the party's presidential candidate,' she urged. 'We commit to seeing Namibia move towards a path of shared economic prosperity,' she added.

**Swapo’s Veikko Nekundi predicts 96 parliamentary seats following Nandi-Ndaitwah’s rescue**
Deputy minister of works and transport Veikko Nekundi believes Swapo will secure 96 parliamentary seats after the November Presidential and National Assembly elections. Nekundi was saved by Swapo vice president Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who added his name to her list of 10 nominated candidates, after he failed to make it to Swapo’s top 96 list at the electoral college. Nekundi says he is confident that Swapo will have 96 in parliament. Swapo national spokesperson Hilma Nicanor says Nekundi’s capacity and capability earned him a spot on Nandi-Ndaitwah’s list. However, political analyst Ndumba Kamwanyah raises several questions about the sudden replacement, suggesting it may indicate internal conflicts or power struggles behind the scenes. Kamwanyah also notes that the move may be a strategic way to ensure key party members have a place in parliament if they don’t make it through the regular election process.

Go out in huge numbers and vote Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah and Swapo party so we can go beyond a two-third majority – as we normally do.' This comes after a group of Swapo members requested that the ECN not allow Nandi-Ndaitwah to be registered as the party's presidential candidate, claiming she was not procedurally nominated.

Swapo party secretary, Sophia Shaningwa, in her inaugural speech, made a special mention to friendly political parties, including the PSUV of the Bolivarian nation, ZANU-PF of Zimbabwe, and the PCC of Cuba, among others.

He demanded that Swapo leadership, led by Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, apologize for the 'grave harm' inflicted upon the people. Itula stated, 'Fellow Namibians, I am utterly appalled by the degrading actions displayed by Swapo... Such behaviour is not only undignified, but it also shows a complete and utter disregard for the very humanity of our people.'

**Who is Fooling Who, Madam NNN?**
Swapo presidential candidate Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah has been criticized for accepting donations from prominent individuals and companies, which she claims were given without strings attached. However, critics argue that this is a common practice in many democratic countries, where big companies give money to politicians in exchange for influence. Nandi-Ndaitwah has responded by saying that 'we cannot sell this country, not Swapo, not under the leadership that is in this room. It will not happen.' However, this is at odds with the fact that Swapo has hosted fundraising events explicitly inviting rich people for networking to 'influence government policies'. The article highlights the lack of transparency in party funding in Namibia, where parties do not submit detailed audited financials and their assets to parliament and the Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN). The public is left uninformed in a culture set by years of apartheid slush funds and independent Namibia's overwhelmingly dominant ruling party. The article also mentions that about 70% of Namibia's economy is dominated by the state's public works and purchasing contracts, better known as 'tenders', and that Swapo companies and entities owned by cronies of ruling party officials routinely get preferential treatment in winning the bids.

**Namibia: NNN Camp Eyes Swapo Pot Dominance**
The Swapo electoral college, also known as 'The Pot', is set to elect the ruling party's list of parliamentarians for the National Assembly next year. Vice president Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah will shape her potential parliamentary team this weekend. The contest will decide the fate of several veteran politicians, including anti-gay lawmaker Jerry Ekandjo, who is facing a challenge from Nandi-Ndaitwah for the party throne. Ekandjo said, 'I am not interested in questions, please ask the organisers.' Former ministers Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana and Alpheus!Naruseb are seeking a comeback into politics. The electoral college will consist of 600 delegates, including regional structures, central committee members, and party officials. Only 96 positions are available. There are concerns that some politicians in Nandi-Ndaitwah's camp are using de-campaigning tactics to allegedly secure positions. Swapo central committee member John Elago said, 'There are some comrades who want to strive on de-campaigning others because some people were supporting different candidates at the congress.' Former Nandi-Ndaitwah campaign manager Kaire Mbuende said, 'I don't subscribe to the notion that there is a deliberate agenda to exclude other people. We are just hoping that we are going to have a balanced team.' Mbuende emphasized the importance of a balanced team that includes young people, candidates who advocate gender equality, and those who advocate workers' rights, economic development, farming, and regional balance.

**Kenya-Namibia set to revamp trade ties**
Kenya and Namibia are set to strengthen their bilateral cooperation to boost trade ties between the two countries. Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi will meet with Namibian officials, including Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah and Minister for International Relations and Cooperation Peya Mushelenga, to discuss several business and diplomatic protocols. Mudavadi will push for increased collaborations, including the review of business and diplomatic protocols, and the establishment of a Diplomatic Mission in Nairobi. Kenya and Namibia have a long history of cooperation, dating back to 1964, and are signatories to the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) and the COMESA-SADC-EAC Tripartite Free Trade Area. The balance of trade has been in favour of Namibia, but Mudavadi will seek to have Kenyans take advantage of the robust diplomatic relations and visa-free protocols to invest in the cereal sector. Potential areas for cooperation include the fields of livestock keeping, blue economy, beef and water dam building, and water conservation. There are also opportunities for Kenyan businesses to export products such as black tea and coffee to Namibia.

**Ethical Mining: Balancing Progress, Heritage, and Sustainability in the Namib Desert**
Namibia's mining sector is a crucial driver of economic growth, contributing 10% to the GDP and attracting global investment. However, the country's recent lifting of the ban on exporting unprocessed lithium has highlighted the need for ethical and sustainable mining practices. The tension between economic gains and environmental stewardship is particularly evident in sensitive areas like the Namib Naukluft National Park. Experts at the Southern Desert 6 Conference emphasized the importance of balancing economic growth with preserving the country's environment and cultural heritage. They called for rigorous regulatory adherence, minimising environmental and social impact, and involving indigenous communities in decision-making. Vanessa Elliott highlighted the effects of mining on First Nations in Australia, advocating increased involvement and regulatory changes. Social anthropologist Elsemi Olwage explored the Aonin community's efforts to reclaim maritime heritage in Namibia. The National Heritage Council of Namibia faces challenges in managing mining impacts, and Namibian archaeologist John Kinahan emphasized the need to reconcile economic development with preserving the Namib Desert's cultural and ecological heritage. Kinahan called for integrating archaeological impact assessments with environmental impact assessments and stricter standards for heritage preservation. Vice president Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah advocated stronger legal frameworks to prevent heritage loss in mining activities. To balance the energy transition with heritage preservation, Namibia must reform laws like the Minerals Act, the Environmental Management Act and the National Heritage Act.

**Namibia's Hydrogen Ambitions Take Shape**
Namibia is aiming to become a central location for hydrogen production in southern Africa, with eight projects currently in development, three of which could start production this year. The projects, including the HyIron and Daures Green Hydrogen Village, are being financed by the German government, with a total of €25.2 million in funding. However, the projects currently face a challenge in competing with grey products, which are significantly cheaper. To address this, the German government has proposed a mandatory quota system to offer companies in Namibia investment security, and a bidding competition for green hydrogen products. The German government has also agreed to provide further grant agreements for Namibia, totaling €36.9 million, to support the development of hydrogen infrastructure and regulatory framework. 'Namibia is open to business relationships that have a significant impact on our development and at the same time benefit investors,' said Namibian Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah. 'Our goal is to become completely competitive in the medium term,' added HyIron managing director Johannes Michels. 'Namibia should become a central building block in the decarbonization of Western economies,' said BMWK State Secretary Kellner. 'What is working well are refined products, and of course that also creates added value here, which is why it is not colonial, but a partnership of equals,' Kellner told DW.
