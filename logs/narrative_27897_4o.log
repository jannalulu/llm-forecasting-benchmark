The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a table, their faces lit by screens displaying news updates.

**FORECASTER 1:** (leaning back) So, the clock struck midnight, and no second mobilization wave.

**FORECASTER 2:** Right. Our models had it at 15.75%. Putin's hesitance was a major factor.

**FORECASTER 3:** (nodding) ISW's assessments were crucial. The political cost seemed too high for him.

**FORECASTER 4:** (scrolling through articles) Even with Ukraine's troop surge, Russia's reliance on contract soldiers was the safer bet.

**FORECASTER 1:** (smiling) Another win for the models. The Brier scores stay pristine.

They exchange knowing glances, the weight of their accuracy acknowledged.

**FORECASTER 2:** (closing laptop) Until the next prediction, then.

The room settles, the forecasters content with their precise predictions, ready for the next challenge.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, discussing the latest developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the deadline has passed. Will Russia start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024? Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the political climate, Putin's awareness of potential unrest was key. The ISW's reports consistently highlighted his reluctance.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. Despite the staggering losses and Ukraine's mobilization, Russia's recruitment strategies seemed to focus on crypto-mobilization and contract soldiers.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The ISW didn't report any formal mobilization by October 1. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how public sentiment and political strategy can influence such critical decisions.

They nod, understanding the complexities of geopolitics and the accuracy of their models.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, papers and laptops scattered. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, relieved)  
Well, as of yesterday, no second wave of mobilization. Our models had it at 15.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Putin's fear of public unrest seemed to outweigh the military need. ISW's reports were consistent.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing on a laptop)  
The staggering losses and Ukraine's mobilization plans were factors, but Russia's recruitment goals for 2024 likely sufficed.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
It’s a delicate balance. The Kremlin’s strategy is more about maintaining control than overt escalation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking around)

They share a moment of quiet satisfaction, aware that their predictions once again aligned with reality.

So, October 1st has passed. No second mobilization wave reported by ISW. Our models had it at 7.58%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2, a younger analyst, nods, reviewing the data.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(enthusiastic)  
Right on the mark. The political risks for Putin were just too high. Even with Ukraine's massive mobilization, Russia's focus was on recruitment, not conscription.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(satisfied)  
Exactly. The Kremlin's strategy leaned heavily on voluntary enlistments. The ISW's reports confirmed our analysis.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
