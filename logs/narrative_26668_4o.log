INT. FORECASTING HUB - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, screens aglow with post-event analysis.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, JD Vance didn't make it to the election day as the VP nominee.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The signs were there—his net favorability was abysmal.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. The resurfaced footage and negative press didn't help. The Eagleton precedent was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with Harris stepping up after Biden's exit, the dynamics shifted dramatically.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. Vance's unpopularity in the Midwest was a red flag we couldn’t ignore.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
A fascinating case study. Even official nominations aren't immune to the tides of public opinion.

They nod in agreement, the room buzzing with the thrill of a forecast well-calculated.

FADE OUT.

The room buzzes with anticipation as the superforecasters gather around a table, analyzing data. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
Well, it's official. JD Vance is the Republican vice presidential nominee. Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Despite the resurfaced footage and his low favorability, the odds were always in his favor after Biden's exit. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(skeptical)  
But with a net favorability of -16% in the Midwest, it's risky. Eagleton's precedent was our only wildcard.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(agreeing)  
True, but Harris's sudden rise and the lack of viable alternatives solidified his position.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(looking at notes)  
Our models accounted for all variables. Vance was controversial, but the political landscape favored him.

They exchange knowing glances, their models vindicated once again.

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, papers and laptops scattered. They discuss the previous day's events.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, JD Vance didn't drop out. Our models had it at 85.75% that he'd remain the nominee.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Even with that "childless cat ladies" comment resurfacing, the odds were stacked in his favor. The historical precedent with Eagleton was a factor, but not enough.

FORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
His Midwest favorability was a concern, but nationally, it wasn't a dealbreaker. Our models never wavered.

FORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the dynamics shifted after Biden's withdrawal and Harris stepping up.

FORECASTER 2  
Indeed. Despite Vance's unpopularity, the political machinery kept him in place.

FORECASTER 3

Another day, another accurate prediction.
