INT. FORECASTING HUB - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of superforecasters huddle around a digital display, analyzing the outcome of the Super Micro Computer, Inc. filing.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the 10-K wasn't filed. Our models had it at 12.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Exactly. The August 30 notification was a red flag. We factored in their recent financial turbulence.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(pulling up an article)  
And with the SEC's strict deadlines, the probability of a late filing was slim. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(gesturing to the screen)  
The Brier score reflects our accuracy. We anticipated the delay but gave a slight chance for a last-minute submission.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
Yet, here we are. The models were spot on.

They exchange satisfied glances, their confidence in the models reaffirmed.

FADE OUT.

INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, laptops open. They discuss the outcome of Super Micro Computer, Inc.'s 10-K filing.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the SEC Edgar link confirms it. No filing before October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.75% that they wouldn't make it. The August 30th notification was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed. The missed deadline was the nail in the coffin. Our Brier scores remain impeccable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how accurately the models predicted this. The operational delays were a clear sign.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And yet, the market seemed unaware. It's a testament to the power of precise forecasting.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their accurate prediction.

ALEX

So, Super Micro Computer, Inc. didn't file their 10-K on time.

JORDAN

Our models had it at 92.35% that they wouldn't. The August 30 notification was a major signal.

ALEX  
True. Given their history of delays, it wasn't surprising. The news articles up to September 2 solidified our prediction.

JORDAN

It's fascinating how accurately we can predict these things. Our models rarely miss.

Well, the deadline has passed. Super Micro Computer, Inc., didn't file their 10-K with the SEC by October 1.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The notification on August 30 was a significant indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, the failure to file notice was a red flag. It pushed our probability lower as we approached September.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Given the circumstances, the market's skepticism was justified. No filing means the event resolves as a No.
