**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the Warhammer 40,000 WTC has wrapped up. Will Germany win the 2024 World Team Championship?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.35%. Germany was strong, but not strong enough. The Swiss format favored consistent performers.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Belgium and New Zealand were the dark horses. The new entries like China and South Korea added unpredictability.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, and with Games Workshop's popularity soaring, competition is fierce. But our models remain undefeated.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. The data up to July 25th was clear. Germany had potential, but it wasn't their year.

*They clink their coffee mugs in agreement.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Here's to the next championship. Maybe Germany will surprise us then.

*They both smile, contemplating future probabilities.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did Germany take the championship this year?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.32%. Close, but not quite enough. They faced some tough competition, especially with five new teams entering the fray.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and Belgium's performance was exceptional in the Swiss rounds. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Their strategic plays were on point. Plus, Germany's usual edge was slightly dulled by the unexpected rise of China and South Korea.
