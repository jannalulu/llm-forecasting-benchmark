*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers strewn between them. A digital clock reads 15:41.*

NATE: So, the big question—did Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue experience exactly one day with an AQI above 150 in Q3?

PHILIP: No, our models had it at 32.67%. Given historical patterns and the July 5th spike, the probability was low.

NATE: Right, especially considering the consistent rain patterns that kicked in by mid-August.

PHILIP: Exactly. The absence of significant wildfires after July was a key factor. Even with past trends, the models held firm.

NATE: It's fascinating how the 2022 Bolt Creek scenario skewed perceptions. But data doesn't lie.

PHILIP: Indeed. The models never falter. The air stayed cleaner than anticipated.

*They exchange a knowing nod, the accuracy of their predictions reaffirmed once again.*

So, Philip, the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area had exactly one day with an AQI above 150 in Q3 2024. Our models were spot on again.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate, our models had it at 55.67%. Given the historical data, it was a close call, but the probability leaned slightly towards one day.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, especially with that early spike on July 5th. The wildfires have been unpredictable, but the rains came early this year.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It’s fascinating how even with the worst air quality in 2022, the patterns aligned differently this time.

Well, Philip, the data's in. Will the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area have exactly one day with an AQI above 150 in Q3 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate, our models had it at 65.00%. The July 5th spike was significant, but the rest of the summer stayed clear.

**NATE SILVER**  
Remarkable accuracy, considering Seattle's history with wildfire smoke. Remember 2022? Eleven days above 150.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, but this year, the conditions aligned differently. The rains came early, and the wind patterns shifted favorably.

**NATE SILVER**
