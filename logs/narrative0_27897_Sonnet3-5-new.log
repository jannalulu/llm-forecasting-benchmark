Nate: "Well, Philip, another prediction in the books. No second mobilization wave from Russia before October."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 15.5%. Putin's fear of domestic unrest proved to be the decisive factor."

Nate: "The signs were there. Despite heavy losses, they opted for that aggressive volunteer recruitment campaign instead. 400,000 contract soldiers is quite the alternative to formal mobilization."

Philip: "The crypto-mobilization strategy was clever - achieving similar results without the political backlash of an official announcement. Our models caught that distinction early."

Nate: "True. The February ISW assessment about Putin's concerns over public discontent was particularly telling. Combined with their successful volunteer recruitment numbers, a second mobilization just wasn't necessary."

Philip: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from understanding what leaders won't do, rather than what they might."

Nate Silver: (reviewing papers) Well, Philip, our models were pretty definitive on this one. We had the probability of a second Russian mobilization at 22.5%.

Philip Tetlock: (nodding) Indeed. Putin's concern about domestic unrest proved crucial. The successful recruitment of contract soldiers through their "crypto-mobilization" efforts made formal mobilization unnecessary.

Nate: The ISW's February assessment was spot-on. Putin couldn't risk the political backlash, especially with their current recruitment meeting targets.

Philip: What's fascinating is how they managed to maintain troop levels without formal mobilization. The combination of high contract soldier salaries and covert recruitment strategies worked better than expected.

Nate: True. Our models caught the significance of their successful 400,000 recruitment drive in 2023. When they replicated that in 2024, the need for formal mobilization basically evaporated.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. The signals were there if you knew where to look.

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books about Russia's second mobilization wave. Our models were solid on this one."

Philip: "No surprise there. Looking back at our February data, when ISW reported Putin's concerns about public discontent, combined with their successful crypto-mobilization efforts, our models gave it just 22.5% probability."

Nate: "Exactly. Russia's ability to recruit 400,000 contract soldiers in 2023 and their similar target for 2024 made a formal mobilization unnecessary. The political cost wasn't worth it for Putin."

Philip: "The key indicator was their shift toward professional contract soldiers rather than conscripts. Even with Ukraine's 500,000-troop mobilization plan, Russia found alternatives to formal mobilization."

Nate: "Another accurate forecast in challenging circumstances."

[They both nod, satisfied with their prediction.]

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Russia's second mobilization.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given what we knew by September 3rd, our models gave it just a 22% probability. Putin's concerns about domestic unrest were too significant to ignore.

Nate: The recruitment drive for "contract soldiers" proved sufficient for their needs. Our analysis of the ISW reports showing Putin's reluctance to risk public backlash was crucial.

Philip: Exactly. The successful recruitment of 400,000 contract soldiers in 2023 and similar targets for 2024 made formal mobilization unnecessary. Though Ukraine mobilized more troops, Russia found alternative ways to maintain force levels.

Nate: The crypto-mobilization strategy was their preferred approach. Our models factored in Putin's political calculations perfectly.

Philip: Yes, the 22% probability reflected the real, but limited, chance they'd be forced into formal mobilization by battlefield losses.

Nate Silver: [shuffling through papers] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. The probability of Russia announcing a second mobilization wave was only 15.32%.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Putin's strategy of relying on "crypto-mobilization" and voluntary recruitment proved sufficient. Our analysis of the February ISW reports showing Putin's concerns about domestic unrest was a crucial indicator.

Nate: The successful recruitment of 400,000 contract soldiers in 2024 made formal mobilization unnecessary. Though Ukraine mobilized their 500,000, Russia managed to maintain force levels without risking political instability.

Philip: [nodding] The key was understanding Putin's political calculus. With the 2022 mobilization's negative public response still fresh, and the effectiveness of their covert recruitment methods, our models correctly predicted they'd avoid another formal mobilization.

Nate: Just goes to show - sometimes what doesn't happen is as telling as what does.
