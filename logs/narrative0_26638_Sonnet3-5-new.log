[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like no federal court ruled against any major Clean Air Act provisions before the October deadline. Our models had this at 32.5%."

Phil: "Indeed. Despite the Chevron doctrine's overturning in June causing quite a stir, the timeline was simply too tight. Most major environmental cases take longer to work through the system."

Nate: "The pending lawsuits needed more time to develop their arguments around the Chevron angle. Three months wasn't enough to see a final ruling."

Phil: "Exactly. Our models factored in the typical duration of federal environmental cases, the Supreme Court's summer recess, and the complexity of Clean Air Act challenges. The probability was always going to be under 50% given such a short window."

[They both nod, making notes for their next forecast]

Title: "The Probability Prophets"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, September 28, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing papers.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another deadline passed. The Clean Air Act challenge prediction..."

Philip: [interrupting] "No, our models had it at 32.5%. Given the short timeline after Chevron's overturn, it was unlikely we'd see a major ruling by October 1st."

Nate: "The models were spot on. Despite the flurry of lawsuits after June's Chevron decision, federal courts typically need more time to process complex environmental cases."

Philip: "Exactly. While our last data from July showed increasing challenges to EPA regulations, the compressed timeline was the key factor. The probability would've been much higher with a 2025 deadline."

Nate: "Agreed. Though the foundations are shaking, the Clean Air Act remained intact through this window. But the next few years..." [trails off ominously]

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again. We had this at 32% probability.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. The timing was crucial - with only three days left before the October 1st deadline, no federal court issued a ruling challenging major Clean Air Act provisions using the Chevron overturn as justification.

Nate: The models factored in the slow pace of federal litigation. Even with multiple pending lawsuits after Chevron's June overturn, three months wasn't enough time for a final ruling.

Philip: Exactly. While the Supreme Court's decision created an opening for Clean Air Act challenges, our analysis showed that such cases typically take 6-12 months minimum to reach final rulings. The short window made a "No" outcome more likely.

Nate: [nodding] The real wave of Clean Air Act challenges is still coming. Just not before October 1st.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight, September 28, 2024]

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Our models gave this Clean Air Act ruling a 32.45% chance.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] No surprises there. Even with Chevron's overturning in June, the timeline was too compressed for a major federal court challenge to succeed by October 1st.

Nate: The EPA cases in the pipeline needed more time to mature. Most legal experts we consulted expected the first significant rulings to come in early 2025.

Philip: [pulling up a chart] Our models factored in the historical pace of federal court decisions, especially on complex environmental regulations. The short window between Chevron's reversal and October really limited the probability.

Nate: Though I suspect when we run these numbers again for 2025, we'll see very different probabilities.

Nate Silver: [reviewing papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had this at 32% probability back in July.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Despite the Supreme Court's Chevron overturn creating a pathway for challenges, no federal court issued a ruling against major Clean Air Act provisions. The pending lawsuits just didn't move fast enough through the system.

Nate: [nodding] The timing was key. Even with multiple cases in the pipeline challenging the NAAQS and greenhouse gas regulations, the courts' traditionally slow pace meant no final rulings by October 1st.

Philip: Our models accounted for the judicial system's inherent delays. Though we saw increased challenges after Chevron's fall, getting a final ruling in just three months was always unlikely.
