**If Deadpool & Wolverine Hits Its Opening Weekend Box Office Projections, It's All But Assured To Make $1B**
Deadpool & Wolverine is expected to make $1 billion at the box office due to its projected $200m+ opening weekend. The movie's success is attributed to its multiversal story, which connects to Spider-Man: No Way Home, and its impressive cast, including Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. The movie's trailer broke records, and its ticket sales are doing well, making it a strong candidate to pass the $1 billion mark. If the movie meets its projected opening weekend, it will be the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, surpassing Joker by at least $230 million.

The 2024 box office is struggling, but Marvel's 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is expected to save the year with a massive opening of $200M-$239M, which would be the highest R-rated domestic box office opening of all time.
