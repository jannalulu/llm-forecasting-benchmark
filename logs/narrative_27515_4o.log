INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 11, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the event's over. No 40W announcement.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. The rumors were strong, but Apple played it safe.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
They’re sticking to incremental upgrades. 27W is still the peak.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
Android competitors are ahead, but Apple's ecosystem keeps users loyal.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(checking phone)  
The news up to August 23 didn't hint at a breakthrough. Our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(grinning)  
Brier scores don’t lie. We knew the odds.

They all nod, satisfied with their accuracy. The conversation shifts to future tech predictions as the camera pans out.

*Three superforecasters, JAMES, LUCY, and ALEX, sit at a table, sipping coffee, their laptops open.*

**JAMES**  
Well, that was some event. Apple finally did it. 40W fast charging.

**LUCY**  
Our models had it at 92.75%. The rumors were strong, and Apple's trend towards faster charging was clear.

**ALEX**  
Right, especially with competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi pushing the envelope. It was a logical step.

**LUCY**  
And the leaks from China were consistent. But still, until it's official, you never know with Apple.

**JAMES**  
True. But the writing was on the wall. The tech landscape is evolving rapidly, and Apple needed to keep pace.

**ALEX**  
Exactly. The models never lie. It's all about reading the signals correctly.

*They nod in agreement, satisfied with their predictive prowess.*

**FADE OUT.**

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY AFTER APPLE EVENT - MORNING**

The sun streams through the windows as SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

**ALEX**  
Well, the Apple event came and went. No mention of 40W charging.

**JORDAN**  
Yeah, our models had it at 12.35%. The lack of credible leaks made it unlikely.

**ALEX**  
Right. The focus seemed more on AI features and display upgrades. Forbes did mention those faster Android chargers, but Apple plays its own game.

**JORDAN**  
Exactly. They’re not in a rush to match specs. The rumors swirling in July were just that—rumors.

**ALEX**  
I guess we wait for the next cycle. Maybe 2025?

**JORDAN**  
Perhaps. Until then, we keep our eyes on the data.

They clink their coffee cups, exchanging a knowing smile.

*Two superforecasters, JANE and TOM, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee in hand.*

**JANE**  
Well, that was a surprise. Apple didn't announce the 40W fast charging for the iPhone 16.

**TOM**  
Yeah, our models had it at 35.67%. The rumors were strong, but Apple played it safe.

**JANE**  
I guess they’re sticking to their gradual upgrades. But the market is shifting. The Android competition is fierce with those 120W chargers.

**TOM**  
True. But remember, Apple often prioritizes battery health over speed. It’s a strategic choice.

**JANE**  
Right. Still, the anticipation was high. Maybe next year?

**TOM**  
Possibly. We’ll adjust our models for the next cycle. Always something to learn.
