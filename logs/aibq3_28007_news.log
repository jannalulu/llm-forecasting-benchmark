**Could gas prices fall to $3 per gallon by the end of 2024?**
The national average price of gasoline has fallen by $0.50 per gallon compared to last year, with some states along the Gulf of Mexico already seeing prices below $3 per gallon. According to Andy Lippo of Lipo Oil Associates, there is a 'good possibility' that the national average retail price of gasoline could hit $3 per gallon by the end of the year. This is due in part to a downtrend in oil prices, with gasoline futures at three-year lows and oil prices expected to continue to fall if OPEC Plus adds more supply in October.

**Gas prices could drop to $3 by year end, says analyst**
Gasoline prices have been declining due to lower oil prices and approaching three-year lows in gasoline futures. The national average price on Wednesday was $3.32 per gallon, $0.15 lower than a month ago and $0.49 less than last year. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, predicts that the national average could fall to $3 per gallon by the end of the year, as most of the country switches to a less expensive winter grade gasoline. Lipow notes that the low prices may force OPEC+ to rethink its policy and stick with existing production levels. Currently, oil prices have collapsed 4% amid concerns over China's economy and additional supply expected from OPEC+ this fall.

Gasoline prices have been declining due to falling oil prices and lower demand. The national average price on Wednesday was $3.32 per gallon, $0.15 lower than a month ago and $0.49 less than last year. Analyst Andy Lipow predicts that the national average could drop to $3 per gallon by the end of the year, citing the end of the summer driving season and a quiet hurricane season. Lipow also notes that oil prices may force OPEC+ to rethink its production policy, potentially sticking with existing levels. As of Wednesday, nine states had average retail prices below $3 per gallon, with half the country expected to reach those levels by the end of September.

**Gasoline prices 'have seen their summer peak': Analyst**
According to oil analyst Andy Lipow, gasoline prices have already seen their summer peak and are expected to decline as we get into October. The national average price of a gallon of gas is currently at $3.46, down from $3.51 a month ago and $0.37 lower than a year ago. Lipow attributes this to adequate gasoline inventories and a decrease in demand. However, he notes that an oil supply disruption due to conflict in the Middle East could send prices higher. Meanwhile, oil prices have decreased by 10% since the beginning of July, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices hovering above $75 per barrel and Brent prices trading just above $78 per barrel. Analysts at Capital Economics predict that Brent prices will rise back to $80 per barrel by the end of the year.

**Gas prices rise again**
The national average price of gasoline is $3.47 per gallon, a 0.7 cent increase from last week. In New York State, prices are down 2.1 cents, averaging $3.57 per gallon. According to GasBuddy data, the national average is 0.8 cents lower than a month ago and 25.2 cents lower than a year ago. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said, 'We continue to see a mixed bag when it comes to gas prices across the country.' He also noted that the summer winding down and disappointing gasoline demand could lead to a further decline in national average prices. US retail gasoline demand rose 0.6 percent during the week ending Saturday, July 27. The most common price per gallon encountered by motorists remains unchanged at $3.39.

**Gas prices: More decreases at the pumps to start the work week - Washington Examiner**
Gas prices have continued to fall across the country, with 11 states now having an average price below $3 per gallon. The national average price for a gallon of regular gas on Monday was $3.296, a decrease from $3.273 on Sunday and $3.331 a week ago. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, will need to address the country's high gas prices and energy costs in the 2024 presidential election. Gas prices vary significantly among states, with the lowest price in Mississippi at $2.79 per gallon and the highest in Washington, D.C. at $3.526 per gallon. California's gas prices are also soaring, with a gallon of regular gas costing $4.712 on Monday.

**Falling gas prices are yet another blow to the Trump campaign**
Former President Donald Trump has been using high gas prices to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming they have 'soared' to $8 a gallon. However, fact-checkers have dismissed this as false. While gas prices have risen in recent years, reaching a high of $4.93 a gallon in mid-2022, they have been declining steadily for the last five months, according to the American Automobile Association. As of now, 10 states have gasoline averages below $3 a gallon, and the national average price for a gallon of gas is $3.30, a 6-cent decline from the previous week. Andrew Gross, a spokesperson for AAA, said that this trend is likely to continue due to low gas demand and the current cost of oil at about $70 per barrel.

**Gas Prices Could Drop Below $3 By Thanksgiving Due To Increased Production**
Gas prices in the US have been falling and are expected to continue dropping over the next few months. According to CNN, the average price of a gallon of gas in the US fell to $3.30 on September 6, a six-month low, which is 50 cents lower than last year. Currently, ten states are enjoying sub-$3-a-gallon gasoline, and another nine states could dip below the $3 mark in the next two weeks. GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan predicts that between 35 and 40 states could see gas prices drop under $3 by Thanksgiving, stating, 'Gas prices, after two-plus years of sizzling because of outside factors like COVID and Russia, are finally coming back into balance.' The low gas prices are being driven by record production in the US and soft demand in China, causing OPEC+ countries to abandon plans to increase oil supplies on October 1.

**Gas Station Charges Less Than $2.50 Per Gallon: How Inflation, Energy Prices Are Faring Now**
Gas prices have fallen below $2.50 per gallon at some stations, according to Patrick De Haan, aka GasBuddyGuy. The national average is around $3.30, down from $3.80 a year ago. This decrease in gas prices could be a sign of a cooling global economy, but it also means consumers have more money to spend in other areas, potentially stimulating the economy. Data shows inflation has come down significantly from its 40-year high in May 2022, with the July consumer price index (CPI) report showing a 2.9% year-over-year increase. Gas prices can be an early indicator of price fluctuations in the overall economy, and a 20% drop in crude oil prices since April is contributing to the decline in gas prices.

**Could Gas Prices Actually Fall Below $3 Before the End of the Year?**
Gas prices may drop below $3 per gallon by the end of the year, according to analysts. The national average is currently $3.30, having decreased 17 cents in the past month. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, expects prices to fall another 15 to 20 cents per gallon over the next three weeks, potentially hitting $3 per gallon by the end of the year. The last time the national average was below $3 was in May 2021. Oil prices are down to around their lowest level in a year, paving the way for cheaper gasoline. However, factors such as OPEC+ potentially restoring oil output and a hurricane impacting refining capacity could deter the forecast for prices to drop below $3 a gallon. Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, says that five more states could easily be below $3 a gallon by the end of the month, and that gas prices are 51 cents cheaper than a year ago.

**Gas Prices: More decreases at the pumps as nine states now with prices under $3 per gallon**
Gas prices in the US have continued to decrease, with the national average price for a gallon of regular gas on Wednesday being $3.317, according to AAA. This is a drop from a week ago when the average price was $3.361 per gallon. Nine states now have an average price for regular gas at under $3 per gallon, the highest total number of states having such a cost in 2024. Gas prices remain an important issue heading into the 2024 presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, needing to address the country's high gas prices and energy costs. While prices have fluctuated in 2024, they have decreased in recent weeks and months. However, gas prices remain significantly higher than when former President Donald Trump was in office. Prices vary significantly among states, with Mississippi having the least expensive gas prices in the country on Wednesday, at $2.848 per gallon.

**Labor Day gas prices on track to reach lowest level in 3 years**
American motorists can expect to pay significantly less at the pump this Labor Day, with gas prices projected to be the cheapest for the holiday in three years. According to GasBuddy, the average price of gas nationwide will fall to $3.27 per gallon, a 50-cent decrease from last year's average of $3.77. This represents a 13% decrease in prices, with Americans expected to spend roughly $750 million less at the pump this Labor Day compared to last year. As Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted, 'Prices have basically been in a free fall since mid-July.' De Haan also stated, 'We're seeing perhaps the best opportunity in years for the national average to fall below $3 per gallon.' With cheaper winter gasoline on the horizon and declining oil prices, gas prices are likely to continue to drop, with tens of thousands of stations potentially offering sub-$3 gas by Thanksgiving.

**Fact Check Team: Why are gas prices dropping?**
The national average for a gallon of gas has dropped by about 20 cents since May and is almost fifty cents lower than this time last year, according to AAA. Experts attribute this decline to several factors, including a mild hurricane season, Iran's continued oil production despite political tensions, China's slower economy, and the rise of electric vehicles. Additionally, the U.S. is producing a record-breaking average of 12.9 million barrels of oil per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Some experts predict gas prices could drop below $3 a gallon before Thanksgiving and stay that way through the end of the year. However, prices vary significantly across states, with California having the highest prices at an average of $4.59 per gallon and Mississippi having the lowest at $2.93 per gallon, largely due to local taxes and fees.

**Why gas prices are so much cheaper than last summer**
Gas prices are expected to be significantly lower this Labor Day weekend compared to last year. The national average price of gas is projected to be $3.27 a gallon, a decline of 50 cents or 13% from last year. This is the cheapest Labor Day gas price since 2021. According to GasBuddy, Americans are expected to spend about $750 million less on gas this holiday weekend compared to last year. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, said, 'This is a really good situation.' The recent drop in gas prices is attributed to weaker oil prices, softer demand for gasoline, and stronger refinery activity. US oil production has also shattered all-time highs, offsetting the loss of oil from OPEC and its allies. If OPEC adds significant supply to the market as scheduled, there is a 50/50 chance the national average gas price will drop below $3 a gallon.

For the fourth consecutive week, the national average price of gasoline has decreased by 6.2 cents, reaching $3.30 per gallon, according to GasBuddy's survey of 6,118 stations in New York. In New York State, prices are down 3.8 cents, averaging $3.46 per gallon. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said, 'It seems fitting that, in the run-up to Labor Day, the national average has fallen for four straight weeks to its lowest point since February, giving Americans one last chance to hit the road with gas prices being less of a factor.' GasBuddy predicts that the average price of gas per gallon will continue its downward trend, falling to $3.27 per gallon on Labor Day, the lowest Labor Day price since 2021. US retail gasoline demand rose 1.9 percent during the week ending Saturday, Aug 24.

**US Gas Lower at $3.36/Gallon Ahead of Labor Day**
U.S. gasoline prices averaged $3.36 per gallon on August 29, down 13% from last year, according to the American Automobile Association. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects demand to be weaker than last year after the Labor Day weekend, which should keep gasoline prices lower in the months ahead. The EIA attributed the lower prices to weak growth in global and U.S. petroleum product demand, continued crude oil production growth from countries outside of OPEC+, and China's slowing economy. As of August 26, the Brent crude oil price was down 4% from the same time last year, with crude prices contributing 55% to the price of gasoline as of June. U.S. gasoline inventories currently sit at 221 million barrels, about 3% higher than this time last year.

**Graphic Truth: Get gassed up for your roadtrip**
As August 2024 comes to a close, gas prices across the United States are declining, with the national average for regular gasoline at $3.36 per gallon, down from $3.45 at the beginning of the month. This downward trend is part of a broader pattern, with prices falling steadily since May. Analysts predict that prices could dip below $3 per gallon before Thanksgiving, potentially remaining low into 2025. This could have significant implications for the upcoming US presidential election, potentially benefiting Kamala Harris. However, Donald Trump's campaign points to the fact that gas prices hit historic lows during his presidency, when the pandemic halted travel and lowered demand.

**Why Summer Gas Prices Are Falling To Lows We Haven't Seen in Years**
According to AAA, the average price for a regular gallon of gas has decreased significantly since last month and even more over the same time last year. The national average price is $3.36 a gallon, 14 cents lower than the same time last month and $1.66 less than the all-time high recorded in June 2022. Analysts attribute the lower gas prices to geopolitical tensions having a limited effect, a relatively calm storm season, and limited disruptions at gasoline-producing oil refineries. As stated by AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross, 'The clouds of war overseas are less dark at the moment and the Atlantic is quiet now too, which is taking pressure off of oil prices.'

**Gas prices: An increase at the pumps in the middle of the workweek**
Gas prices in the US have increased, with the average cost for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.361, according to AAA. This is the first rise in over a week, but still lower than last week's price of $3.398 and a month ago's price of $3.506. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, will need to address the country's high gas prices and energy costs, which remain a vital topic heading into the 2024 presidential election.

**Here's How Gas Prices Look Ahead of This Labor Day Weekend**
The national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.35 as of August 27, trending below 2023 and 2022 levels for this time of year. AAA expects a 9% increase in Labor Day weekend travel over 2023, but overall demand for fuel is relatively soft due to pandemic-era changes in weekday travel. Gas prices are still falling in many parts of the country, with the current average resting about half a dollar below that of the two previous years. According to AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross, 'The clouds of war overseas are less dark at the moment, and the Atlantic is quiet now too, which is taking pressure off of oil prices.' Despite summer travel holidays having seen some high water marks, commutes and daily driving trends are now different enough to be noticeable year round.

**Gas prices dropping ahead of Labor Day, may fall below $3 by fall**
Gas prices are expected to drop ahead of Labor Day, with the national average price of gas per gallon predicted to be $3.27 per gallon, the lowest anticipated price for Labor Day since 2021. According to GasBuddy, prices peaked at $3.69 per gallon in April but have since tapered off due to lower demand. Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said, 'While many Americans may wish summer could last forever, the good news is we're seeing perhaps the best opportunity in years for the national average to fall below $3 per gallon.' Many states will see gas stations switch to their winter blend in mid-September, contributing to lower gas prices. By fall, gas prices may fall below $3 per gallon.

**Cheapest ever? $3-a-gallon gasoline for the first time since 2021? Yes it could happen**
Gasoline prices in the United States are expected to reach record lows, with the national average having fallen by nearly 20 cents since May. According to reports, prices could drop to $3 per gallon for the first time since 2021, which would increase demand for gasoline. The drop in prices is attributed to refineries in Texas and Louisiana, which have not been affected by heat waves, allowing for a steady supply of gasoline. However, a hurricane could disrupt refinery operations and lead to a shortage of gasoline supply, potentially halting the downward trajectory of prices. 'If the oil refineries in US regions stay shut due to hurricane, then the prices and demand for gasoline across the country will be influenced,' reports suggest. While there is a high chance of gas prices falling to $3, external factors could disrupt the current market conditions.

According to a recent report from AAA Western and Central New York, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.35, down six cents from last week. The New York State average is $3.50, down four cents from last Monday. Gas prices are down across the region due to a quiet overseas war zone and Atlantic storms holding off, which is taking pressure off of oil prices. Oil prices are below $80 per barrel, giving drivers some relief at the pump. The national average price for diesel is $3.70, down three cents from last Monday. AAA recommends conserving fuel by mapping routes, avoiding peak traffic times, combining errands, and checking tire pressure. Motorists can also compare pump prices using the AAA Mobile App.

**The States With the Most Expensive Gas Prices**
As of August 23, 2024, the national average cost for regular unleaded gasoline was $3.374, but some states are over a dollar more expensive. Hawaii has the highest gas price at $4.657 per gallon, followed by California at $4.590. Experts say the nicer weather, global events, EVs, and an aging U.S. population are influencing the downward trend in gas prices. However, an active hurricane season could change everything. 'The late-season wild card is always hurricanes,' said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. 'If a hurricane makes landfall in a refining area, it can really disrupt things.' The top 9 states with the most expensive gas prices are: Hawaii, California, Washington, Nevada, Oregon, Alaska, Illinois, Washington, D.C., and the District of Columbia.

**The price of gas is one of the few inflation bright spots**
The price of gas is a rare bright spot in the inflation landscape. According to AAA, the national average price of regular gasoline has decreased from $3.85 a gallon a year ago to $3.38 today, a savings of 47 cents a gallon. Patrick DeHaan of GasBuddy notes that prices are softening further, with the top five states for price declines being Oregon (-89 cents), Washington (-86 cents), Alaska (-81 cents), Arizona (-78 cents), and California (-69 cents). California is no longer the most expensive state for gas, with Hawaii taking the top spot. Three states have seen their statewide average price fall below $3 a gallon: Mississippi ($2.93), Oklahoma ($2.96), and Texas ($2.99). GasBuddy's data also show six states in the below $3 a gallon club. Andrew Gross of AAA attributes the price relief to decreased tensions overseas and the Atlantic being quiet, but notes that the evidence is growing that this relief might not last.

The most common price per gallon encountered by motorists stands at $3.29, down 20 cents from last week. The states with the lowest average prices per gallon are Mississippi at $2.91, Oklahoma at $2.92 and Texas at $2.97.

**Gasoline Prices Drop To 23-Week Low (UGA)**
Gas prices have dropped to a 23-week low, with regular gas averaging $3.38 per gallon and premium gas averaging $4.25 per gallon. According to GasBuddy.com, Hawaii has the highest average price for regular at $4.57 and Oklahoma has the cheapest at $2.90.

**Gas Prices Continue to Slide Lower**
The national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.41, down three cents from last week. The New York State average is $3.54, down two cents from last Monday. According to AAA Western and Central New York, gas prices in various cities in New York are as follows: Batavia - $3.58, Buffalo - $3.56, Elmira - $3.35, Ithaca - $3.61, Rochester - $3.59, Rome - $3.63, Syracuse - $3.50, Watertown - $3.55. Oil prices remain low, between $76 and $79 per barrel, and gas demand has edged slightly higher while production decreased slightly. This may cause pump prices to slide further down.

**Joe Biden Shares the Blame for the Nation's Soaring Gas Prices**
The average U.S. gasoline price is $3.60 per gallon, with some arguing that this is a bargain compared to the June 2022 peak of $5.03 per gallon, while others point out that it is higher than the April 2020 low of $1.94 per gallon. While global events have contributed to the current prices, the Biden administration is not entirely blameless. The administration's energy policies, which include imposing a moratorium on drilling permits on federal land and restricting oil and gas leases, have limited oil production and contributed to higher gasoline prices. The inflation-adjusted gasoline price from July 2019 would be about $3.45 per gallon, suggesting that inflation is also a significant factor. As President Ronald Reagan managed to address high gasoline prices by ending price controls, which led to a surge of production, the Biden administration's approach has been the opposite, limiting production and making him blameworthy for policies that have exacerbated pump prices.

**Gas prices: Slight increase at the pumps for the second consecutive day - Washington Examiner**
Gas prices in the US have increased for the second consecutive day, with the national average price for a gallon of regular gas rising to $3.445. This is a slight increase from the prior day, but a decrease from a week ago when gas cost $3.455 per gallon. Despite fluctuations, gas prices remain significantly higher than when former President Donald Trump was in office. Prices vary significantly among states, with Hawaii having the highest average price at $4.667 per gallon and Mississippi having the lowest at $2.965 per gallon. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, will need to address the country's high gas prices and energy costs in the 2024 presidential election.

**New Gasoline Prices in Effect Nationwide as of August 12, 2024**
As of August 12, 2024, at 00:00, new gasoline prices are in effect nationwide. The prices for extra and ecopaÃ­s gasoline will be $2.766 per gallon, a 2-cent increase from July, according to the Agencia de RegulaciÃ³n y Control Hidrocarburos. The prices are regulated by a price band, and the Government has implemented a scheme to limit price increases to 5% per month or decreases to 10% based on international oil and fuel prices. The price of super gasoline, or 95-octane gasoline, increased by 9 cents per gallon in terminals, but the public sale price is still unclear. Diesel prices remain the same, at $1.79 per gallon including IVA, with a subsidy in place. The Government has decided not to change diesel prices, citing concerns about competitiveness and the impact on the country's basic product costs, as heavy transportation uses this type of fuel.

**AAA reports Gas Prices at the Pump Prices Dip**
The national average for a gallon of gas has dropped to $3.45, a three-cent decrease from last week. According to AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross, 'With Tropical Storm Debby drifting up the I-95 corridor to visit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, the threat to Gulf Coast oil production and refining is over.' However, tensions in the Middle East and economic uncertainty may mitigate any drop in oil prices. Gas demand fell from 9.25 million b/d to 8.96 last week, while total domestic gasoline stocks rose from 223.8 to 225.1 million barrels. Lower gasoline demand, rising supply, and stable oil costs may lead to sliding pump prices. Today's national average for a kilowatt of electricity at an L2 commercial charging station is 34 cents.

**Gasoline prices 'have seen their summer peak': Analyst**
According to oil analyst Andy Lipow, gasoline prices have already seen their summer peak and are expected to decline as we get into October. The national average price of a gallon of gas is currently at $3.46, down from $3.51 a month ago and $0.37 lower than a year ago. Lipow attributes this to adequate gasoline inventories and a decrease in demand. However, he notes that an oil supply disruption due to conflict in the Middle East could send prices higher. Meanwhile, oil prices have decreased by 10% since the beginning of July, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices hovering above $75 per barrel and Brent prices trading just above $78 per barrel. Analysts at Capital Economics predict that Brent prices will rise back to $80 per barrel by the end of the year.

**Gas Prices Have Likely Passed Summer Peak - Kelley Blue Book**
The nationwide average price of a gallon of gas has decreased to $3.45, according to AAA, with a 3-cent drop from last week and a 37-cent drop from this time last year. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, notes that the peak of US summer driving season is over, citing a significant drop-off in US gasoline demand this week. Americans used 8.9 million barrels of oil per day, 4.3% less than the same week a year ago. Further price declines are ahead, but gas prices can be unpredictable due to hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned of an extremely active hurricane season that could rank among the busiest on record.

**Will Hurricane Debby affect gas prices? GasBuddy weighs in**
The national average price of gasoline has decreased by 3.5 cents to $3.44 per gallon, according to GasBuddy data. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, expects gasoline prices to gently decline in the week ahead, but notes that the Middle East situation is a wildcard.

**Oregon Gas Below $4**
The average price of regular gas in Oregon has dropped below $4 a gallon for the first time since March 14. The national average has also decreased, slipping half a cent to $3.52 a gallon. According to Marie Dodds, public affairs director for AAA Oregon/Idaho, gas prices will likely continue to see small fluctuations in the short-term, barring unforeseen events. The Oregon average began 2024 at $3.79 a gallon and has been steadily decreasing. Crude oil prices remain around $80 per barrel, impacted by geopolitical events and production cuts by OPEC+. The price of crude oil reached the year-to-date high of nearly $87 per barrel on April 5. West Texas Intermediate has remained above $80 since June 17. Crude prices have been volatile after the attack on Israel by Hamas last October. The main ingredient in gasoline and diesel, crude oil, accounts for about 54% of what we pay for in a gallon of gasoline.
