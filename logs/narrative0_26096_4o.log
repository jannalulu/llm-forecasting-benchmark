**NATE SILVER**  
So, on July 21, 2024, did the BSE SENSEX close between 75k and 76k?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 43.75%. The election aftermath added too much uncertainty.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, Modi's narrower victory stirred volatility. The market's been a rollercoaster.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Despite the initial drop and rebound, the reforms' uncertainty kept investors wary.

**NATE SILVER**  
A classic case of political impact on markets. Our Brier scores remain intact.

*They both chuckle, nodding in agreement.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Always a challenge, predicting markets amidst political shifts.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yet, here we are, with probabilities aligning with reality once again.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question was: On July 21, 2024, did the BSE SENSEX close between 75k and 76k?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. The election aftermath led to unexpected market volatility.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The BJP's narrower victory shook investor confidence. The initial drop and subsequent bounce were unpredictable.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. Despite Modi's win, the market's uncertainty was palpable. Our models factored in the policy paralysis risk.

**NATE SILVER**  
And yet, the SENSEX defied the odds. It’s a reminder of how even the most accurate models can't foresee every nuance.

*They nod, acknowledging the complexity of forecasting.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. Another day, another lesson in probabilities.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 42.35%.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Given the post-election volatility and Modi's narrower victory, it makes sense. The market's been on edge.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The initial drop, followed by that bounce, kept the probability below 50%.

**NATE SILVER**  
And the policy paralysis fears didn't help. So, we're looking at a "no" then.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Correct. The models reflected the uncertainty accurately.
