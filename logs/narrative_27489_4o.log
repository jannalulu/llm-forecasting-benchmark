INT. FORECASTING ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 12, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, eyes scanning the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the BLS just released the core CPI for August. It's confirmed at 0.1%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.75%. With inflation moderating, it was a strong likelihood.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The Fed's rate hikes seem to be working. But with recession fears, it’s a tightrope.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. The 0.1% aligns with the recent trend towards the Fed's 2% target.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, any persistent inflation could complicate future policy moves.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
For now, this reading gives some breathing room. But the path ahead is still uncertain.

The superforecasters nod, acknowledging the delicate balance between inflation control and economic growth.

FADE OUT.

**INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE – DAY AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, 2024**

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, analyzing data on their screens. The atmosphere is tense, yet focused.

**JANE**  
(looking at her screen)  
So, the BLS released the core CPI numbers for August. It came in at 0.1%.

**TOM**  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 95.67%. Given the recent interest rate hikes and moderating inflation trends, it aligned well with our expectations.

**SARA**  
The Fed's been under pressure, but this reading suggests they might be closer to their 2% target. It’s a relief, considering the recession fears.

**MIKE**  
True, but we need to watch the upcoming months. If core inflation remains stable, it could ease some of the economic tensions.

The group nods in agreement, each lost in thought about the implications of their accurate prediction.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the numbers are in. Will the month-over-month core CPI increase for August be 0.1%?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 15.23%. The persistent inflation trends and recent Fed policy moves suggested it wouldn't hit that low.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Exactly, with the ongoing recession fears and interest rate hikes, a 0.1% increase was always unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
True. The Fed's been aggressive, but the market's expectations were misaligned.

They exchange knowing glances, a quiet acknowledgment of their model's accuracy.

JAMES

So, the core CPI for August was released. Our models had it at 0.1% with a probability of 85.75%.

SARAH  
(nodding)  
Right on the money. Given the signs of moderating inflation and the Fed's recent rate hikes, it made sense.

DAVID

The July reading was 0.2%, and the trend seemed to be edging downwards. We accounted for the potential recession impacts too.

Our models never miss. The Fed's watching closely now, especially with the recession whispers growing louder.
