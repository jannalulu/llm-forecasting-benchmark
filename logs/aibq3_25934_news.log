**Nuclear Powers Increase Arsenals, Modernize and Deploy New Weapons**
The report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) reveals that nuclear powers have increased their nuclear arsenals in 2023, modernizing and deploying new weapons to rely more on deterrence. The global total of approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads in January 2024 includes 9,585 in military stockpiles, with 3,904 deployed on missiles and aircraft, 60 more than in January 2023. China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country, with India, Pakistan, and North Korea also seeking to deploy more warheads on ballistic missiles. The US and Russia together possess nearly 90% of all nuclear weapons, with the US having deployed 36 more warheads in 2023. The transparency of nuclear forces has decreased in both countries since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Sipri report also notes that the UK has not increased its nuclear arsenal in 2023, but is expected to do so in the future, while France has continued to develop a third-generation nuclear-powered submarine and a new air-launched cruise missile. India and Pakistan have also expanded their nuclear arsenals, with India focusing on long-range weapons, including those capable of reaching targets across China. North Korea continues to prioritize its military nuclear program as a central element of its national security strategy, with the Sipri estimating that the country has assembled around 50 warheads and has sufficient fissile material to reach a total of 90 warheads, both significant increases from January 2023. Israel, which does not publicly acknowledge possessing nuclear weapons, is reportedly modernizing its nuclear arsenal and appears to be upgrading its plutonium production site at Dimona.

**Kushal Kumar Predicts the Start of the Third World War on June 18, 2024**
Kushal Kumar, an Indian astrologer known as 'New Nostradamus', predicts that the Third World War is 'very close' and sets a specific date for the start of the 'large-scale conflict'. Kumar uses the 'Vedic astrological chart', a method of predicting the future based on Hindu culture, which supposes 'a map of our karma', using planetary and stellar alignment. He mentions recent events such as the launch of Hezbollah forces in Lebanon after the death of a commander, Russia's deployment of warships to Cuba, including a nuclear submarine, and the recent terrorist attack in the Himalayas. He believes that the scenario of war in critical points around the world is unfolding and that the Tuesday, June 18, 2024, has the strongest planetary stimulation to trigger the Third World War. He also mentions that June 29 could be the day of judgment.

**Indian Navy's 'Stealthy' Nuclear Submarine Base In World's Largest Bay Set To Puncture Chinese PLAN**
India is building a $3.75 billion nuclear submarine base, INS Varsha, in the Bay of Bengal, which will be the world's largest bay. The base will accommodate at least 10 nuclear submarines and will be operational by 2025-2026. The base is designed to be stealthy, with tunnels bored into a mountain to allow submarines to enter and exit without surfacing and being detected by enemy spy satellites. The base will also have repair and maintenance facilities, amenities for crew rest, and advanced command and control systems. The base is seen as a counterbalance to China's growing naval assertiveness in the region and will bolster India's credible deterrence capabilities and strategic interests.

**China-Pakistan Naval Developments Increase India's Challenge**
India is facing a significant challenge from China and Pakistan in the naval domain. Pakistan has launched its first Hangor class submarine, which is bigger than India's Kalvari class submarines and equipped with an Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system. China has also made significant naval developments, including the launch of its third aircraft carrier, Fujian, which is expected to enter service by 2025/2026. The Chinese Navy is also increasing its submarine fleet, with plans to have 80 submarines by 2035. The author, a former IAF and Indian Navy officer, warns that the recent naval developments in Pakistan and China pose a serious threat to India's naval capabilities and recommends that India collaborate with France on constructing a nuclear-powered next-generation aircraft carrier.

**Significant stealth boost! India's Kalvari-class submarines to get indigenous AIP system to enhance ability to stay underwater**
The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed an indigenous Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) system for India's Kalvari-class submarines, enhancing their underwater endurance. The AIP system, designed to increase stealth and operational effectiveness, will be fitted on the first submarine, INS Kalvari, during its major refit in September next year. The system will enable submarines to stay underwater for almost two weeks, a significant upgrade from the current few days. Developed in collaboration with private sector entities, the AIP has undergone extensive trials and has been demonstrated to the Navy. DRDO chief Samir Kamat inaugurated an AIP Integration and Testing facility at L&T's AM Naik Heavy Engineering Complex, where the system will be manufactured and tested before being installed on the submarine.

**‘Rise in N-warheads to check China's buildup'**
According to Aditya Ramanathan, a nuclear and military strategist, the reported increase in Indian nuclear warheads is an 'educated guess based on limited information'. He believes that if there is an increase, it is a direct response to China's nuclear buildup. Ramanathan notes that China has developed new missiles, including the DF-41 ICBM and the DF-27 hypersonic glide vehicle, and has also put its nuclear deterrent to sea with ballistic missile submarines. India is concerned about ensuring its nuclear forces can survive a Chinese first strike and inflict unacceptable damage in retaliation, and Ramanathan thinks India's response is cautious and well-reasoned.

**Brazil Cuts First Steel Plate for Nuclear-Powered Submarine**
Brazil has cut the first steel plate for its first nuclear-powered submarine, marking a significant milestone in the construction of the vessel. The submarine, named Alvaro Alberto, is part of the ProSub program, a partnership between Brazil and France's Naval Group. The submarine is expected to be operational by 2034, but its construction is facing obstacles, including concerns about Brazil's ability to overcome the technological challenges. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has hinted at a possible partnership between the two countries to develop the technology, but no official information has been released. The construction of the submarine is a significant step for Brazil, as it would make it one of the few countries to possess nuclear-powered submarines, joining the ranks of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and India.

**US Navy Considers Alternatives to Expensive Atomic Submarines**
The US Navy is considering alternatives to expensive atomic submarines. According to The Telegraph, the US Navy currently operates only large atomic submarines that can travel thousands of miles at high speed through the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and stay in conflict zones for months. However, these submarines are complex, expensive, and require technical maintenance. 'New classes of robotic underwater vehicles may help fill the underwater gap for Americans', writes the publication. For example, the diesel-electric Orca, which is approximately 50 feet long, has a 35-foot module of useful load with doors. It can displace about 85 tons of water and can autonomously sail up to 6,000 miles, periodically surfacing to raise antennas for communication with operators. 'Orca also, like a conventional submarine with a diesel engine, will launch its diesels on the surface to charge its batteries. Charging batteries during or under the surface is the greatest danger and weakness for a manned submarine – this is the main reason why the US Navy and the Royal Navy insist on nuclear energy for manned submarines, despite its staggering cost. But higher levels of danger are much more acceptable for an unmanned platform', the article states. The authors also note that regardless of the form the future fleet of robotic underwater vehicles takes, it is clear that the US Navy has options. 'And they will need them when they try to fill the underwater gap left by the rapid withdrawal of old manned submarines', summarizes the publication. The article also mentions that in December 2023, an American atomic submarine arrived at the shores of South Korea, and the Pentagon plans to print details for atomic submarines on a 3D printer, investing $300 million in the development of additive technologies for submarines.

**New Delhi-Berlin Working On Co-production Of Submarine: German Envoy To India**
The German Ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann, has stated that the Indian government is now faster with approval requests, which is expected to lead to more initiatives in the coming months. The German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is set to visit India in October, where key topics such as ease of doing business, migration, geopolitics, and climate change will be discussed, in addition to defence discussions. The 18th Asia-Pacific Conference of German Business 2024 (APK 2024) will take place in New Delhi from October 24 to 26. The German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) has signed an agreement with Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders (MDL) to construct conventional, air-independent propulsion submarines. The German government is also supporting negotiations with the Indian Navy for Project 75 India, which involves building six new conventional submarines with MDL. The Indo-German Chamber of Commerce's Director General, Stefan Halusa, expressed optimism about India's economic growth, noting that German companies have never been more hopeful about their business prospects in India. According to the German India Business Outlook survey, over 80 per cent of German companies expect revenue growth in India over the next five years and nearly 74 per cent anticipate higher profits.

**Russia to Receive Atomic Submarine 'Knyaz Pozharsky' in December 2024**
The Russian Navy will receive the atomic submarine 'Knyaz Pozharsky' in December 2024, according to Andrei Puchkov, head of the United Shipbuilding Corporation. This is the fifth submarine of the 955A 'Borei-A' project, which ensures Russia's strategic security and significantly strengthens the country's nuclear triad. The submarine will be handed over to the Russian Navy in December 2024, said Andrei Puchkov, head of the United Shipbuilding Corporation, at the International Maritime Salon 'Fleet-2024'. The 'Borei-A' project is a modernization of the 'Borei' project, which was developed in the 1970s. The submarines are equipped with a single-ship nuclear power plant and can carry 16 intercontinental ballistic missiles 'Bulava'. The 'Borei-A' submarines are strategic, carrying 16 intercontinental ballistic missiles 'Bulava'. They have the ability to launch missiles from under the Arctic ice without having to break through it. The 'Bulava' missile has a range of 10,000 km, a length of 12.1 meters, a payload of 1.1 tons, and a probable circular error of 120-350 meters. Each missile is equipped with six individual guidance blocks with a power of 150 kilotons. The 'Borei-A' submarines will be the foundation of the Russian Navy's nuclear triad, said Konstantin Strelbitsky, head of the Moscow Club of Naval History. 'This is the most important component of Russia's nuclear shield, which was given great attention in the Soviet Union. The sea component was the main component of the nuclear triad. Later, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, this component decreased. Now it is growing again with new ships, new carriers of strategic weapons. 'Knyaz Pozharsky' and other 'Borei-A' will strengthen the sea component of the nuclear triad, as well as the overall nuclear strategic forces of Russia.'

**India 'Leases' Nuclear Submarines from Russia (and Returns Them Early)**
India has a history of leasing nuclear submarines from Russia, with the Charlie-class INS Chakra being leased in the late 1980s and the Akula-class Nerpa being leased in 2010. However, both submarines were returned early due to operational challenges and maintenance issues. The Nerpa was returned to Russia in 2021 due to 'increasingly unreliable power plant and maintenance issues.' India has become one of Moscow's primary economic partners since the Ukraine invasion, with trade expected to top $50 billion this year.

**Kushal Kumar's Prediction of World War III: A 'Second Call' on June 29?**
Kushal Kumar, known as the 'Indian Nostradamus', predicted the start of World War III on June 18, but it did not happen. However, he claims that the 'second call' for the start of the conflict will be on June 29. Kumar's predictions are based on Vedic astrology, a practice linked to Hindu culture. He sees the Vedic astrological map as a 'map of our karma', using planetary alignments to identify significant events. Kumar emphasizes the need for meticulous interpretation of these planetary impacts, recognizing the potential for human error in such predictions. He himself considered the error in making the prediction about World War III. Kumar highlights the recent global events, such as the escalation of tensions between Israel and Lebanon, North Korea's provocative actions on the South Korean border, and Russia's sending of warships, including a nuclear submarine, to Havana, as well as China's military exercises near Taiwan, which have alarmed American authorities.

**Indian Astrologer Predicts Third World War to Start on June 18, 2024**
Indian astrologer Kushal Kumar, known as the 'new Nostradamus', believes that the third world war may start this year. He shared details with journalists about when to expect this day. According to Kumar, June 18, 2024, has the strongest planetary stimulus that can trigger a third world war. He advises people to observe the development of the war scenario in hotspots around the world over time. Kumar believes that these events can trigger a large-scale conflict, including a terrorist attack in the Himalayas, shooting in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, escalation of the conflict in Israel, sending Russian warships, including an atomic submarine, to Cuba, Chinese military exercises off the coast of Taiwan, which cause concern among American officials. He predicts that events will unfold closer to midnight. Additionally, according to the predictor, planetary events indicate the proximity of the planet to a nuclear war, reports The Daily Star. It is worth noting that in the fall of 2024, Russian forces may occupy Kharkiv. This prophecy was given by medium Inna Misha.

**Nuclear Disarmament No Longer the Trend: Sipri Report 2023**
According to the Sipri report 2023, nuclear disarmament is no longer the trend. Instead, nine nuclear powers are currently modernizing or increasing their arsenals. The US and Russia are the largest, followed by China, the UK, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. These countries spent over $91 billion on their nuclear arsenals in 2023, which is a 13% increase from the previous year. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) has also reported that nearly 9,600 operational nuclear warheads are currently available, which can be launched by rockets, aircraft, or submarines. Sipri Director Dan Smith expressed concern that all nuclear powers are modernizing or increasing their arsenals, despite the fact that a nuclear war cannot be won. The report highlights the risks of nuclear deterrence, including the possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of militias or terrorist organizations. The UN has a treaty banning the use of nuclear weapons, but no country has signed it yet.

**Global Nuclear Spending Increases by 13.4% in 2023, US Accounts for Half**
The global spending on nuclear weapons increased by 13.4% in 2023, with the United States accounting for more than half of the total expenditure. According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the nine nuclear-armed countries (US, China, Russia, UK, France, India, Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea) spent an average of $173,884 per minute on nuclear weapons. The US spent the most, with $51.5 billion, followed by China with $11.9 billion. ICAN warns that Russia and Israel are responsible for the highest risk of nuclear use since the Cold War due to their involvement in conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, respectively. The organization estimates that Israel spent around 5% of its military budget on nuclear weapons, and has around 90 nuclear weapons that could be launched through missiles, submarines, or aircraft. ICAN is working to promote the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and has been warning about the risks of nuclear weapons use, including the potential for increased use due to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.

**US Deploys Submarine in Response to Russian Naval Fleet in Cuba**
The United States has deployed a submarine, the USS Helena, in the Bay of Guantanamo, Cuba, in response to the arrival of a Russian naval fleet in Havana. The US Southern Command has stated that the submarine is a rapid attack nuclear-powered submarine and has ruled out the possibility that its transfer to the area is in response to a threat posed by Russian ships on the island. 'It's not a surprise, we've seen them make these types of port calls before. Naturally, we take them seriously, but these exercises are not a threat to the United States', said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. The Russian military fleet (a frigate, a nuclear submarine, an oil tanker, and a rescue tug) will remain in the port of Cuba until June 17.

Russia has deployed a nuclear-powered submarine and a navy frigate to Cuba for military exercises in the Caribbean, but the Kremlin has assured the US that the vessels pose no threat. The submarine, part of the Severodvinsk class, is known for its stealth and striking power, while the frigate is armed with hypersonic cruise missiles. The US has said it is monitoring the situation, but does not anticipate any threat from the warships. The deployment is seen as a flex by Russia to compensate for its losses in the Black Sea, where Ukraine destroyed several Russian warships in April.

**US Sends Nuclear-Powered Submarine to Guantanamo in Response to Russian Warships in Cuba**
The United States has sent a nuclear-powered submarine to its military base in Guantanamo, Cuba, in response to the arrival of Russian warships in Havana. The USS Helena, a rapid-attack submarine, arrived near the US base in Guantanamo, just a day after a Russian frigate, a nuclear-powered submarine, an oil tanker, and a rescue tugboat crossed into Havana Bay after conducting exercises in the Atlantic Ocean. The move is part of a 'routine port visit' as the submarine travels through the region under the command of the US Southern Command. Other US ships have been tracking and monitoring the Russian exercises, which the Pentagon says do not pose a threat. 'This is not a surprise. We've seen them do this type of port call before,' said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. 'Of course, we take it seriously, but these exercises do not represent a threat to the United States.' The exercises come less than two weeks after President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to attack inside Russia and protect Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested his army might respond with 'asymmetric steps' in other parts of the world. 'We don't see any reason to worry in this case,' said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. 'It's a normal practice for all states, including a maritime power like Russia.'

**What is Indian Navy's Project Varsha? How Will It Be a Game-Changer**
The Indian Navy's Project Varsha aims to build an underground sanctuary for nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) near Visakhapatnam, India. The project will provide a secure and self-sufficient base for the submarines, allowing for the de-congestion of the Visakhapatnam Port and the navy's dockyards. The base will also enhance India's second-strike capability and regional power projection, making it a game-changer for the country's maritime interests.

**Russia's Impressive Nuclear Submarine Arrives in Cuba, US Monitors Its Movements**
Russia's Navy deployed a fleet of ships accompanied by a nuclear submarine, the Kazán (K-561), which arrived in Cuba on Wednesday. The group of ships from the Northern Fleet had previously announced their arrival in Havana after circling the eastern coast of Florida, in the United States. In response, the US government, led by Joe Biden, authorized the use of weapons in areas where Russia has attacked Ukraine. The arrival of the imposing machine, known as the Kazán (K-561), comes at a time of tension between Moscow and Washington over the war in Ukraine. The submarine is part of the Project 885M of the Russian Navy and is equipped with nuclear armament. It has a length of approximately 130 meters and is the second of its class built by Russia, following its predecessor, the Severodvinsk. The submarine began its sea trials on September 24, 2018, and was expected to enter military service the following year. However, it was delayed due to technical issues with its control systems. It was not until May 2021 that it was finally able to join the Russian naval service. In addition to its impressive features, it can fire high-caliber cruise missiles such as the 3M-54 Kalibr and the P-800 Oniks. According to a naval analyst, the costs of building the Severodvinsk and Kazán (K-561) submarines represented a reduction in the budget. The Russian Navy aimed to reduce the budget without compromising the submarine's capabilities, which will also feature a nuclear reactor and an innovative cooling system. The US will monitor the Russian submarine's movements, but officials say they do not consider the arrival of this fleet as a threat.

**Indian Navy will have to wait longer to carry out Field evaluation trials of S-80 Plus submarines.**
The Indian Navy's field evaluation trials for the S-80 Plus diesel-electric submarines equipped with the Bio-Ethanol Stealth Technology (BEST) Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) system will likely be delayed until 2025. The delay is due to the sequential rollout of the S-80 Plus submarines being constructed by Navantia for the Spanish Navy. The first submarine to be integrated with the BEST AIP system, Cosme García (S-83), is expected to commence sea trials later this year or in early 2025, pushing back the field evaluation trials for the Indian Navy. The Indian Navy will have to wait until 2025 to assess the effectiveness of the BEST AIP system in real-world conditions.

**Russian warships will arrive in Havana next week**
Cuba has announced that four Russian warships, including a nuclear-powered submarine, will arrive in Havana between June 12 and June 17. The ships, which do not carry nuclear weapons, are said to be part of a historically friendly relationship between the two nations. The move comes as tensions escalate over Western military support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. The Russian military presence is not considered concerning, but it is part of a broader Russian response to US support for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that Moscow could take 'asymmetrical steps' elsewhere in the world in response to US President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia.

**Modi 3.0 must bite the bullet to make military future-ready**
India's defence establishment must prepare for an aggressive China and its expanding military collusiveness with Pakistan in the maritime domain. To achieve this, the government must implement several reforms, including the rollout of tri-service theatre commands, a national security strategy, and a stronger defence-industrial base. India needs a more robust nuclear triad, including ballistic missiles and nuclear-powered submarines. The government should also prioritize the development of military capabilities in space, cyberspace, and other areas. Additionally, India should focus on indigenously manufacturing advanced weapon systems and platforms, and revamp the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to concentrate on fundamental and applied R&D.

**India's Submarine Base in the Bay of Bengal: A Strategic Move to Counter Pakistan and China**
India is building a submarine base in the Bay of Bengal, which will provide a refuge for its maritime nuclear deterrent against Pakistan and China. The Indian Defense Research Wing has reported that the ambitious project, called Varsha, is rapidly taking shape on the eastern coast at Rambilli. Recent satellite images indicate a rapid expansion, suggesting that the project is on track to be completed within the expected timeframe. The Varsha project is a strategic naval base designed to host a fleet of over 12 submarines with nuclear-powered ballistic missiles. Its most striking feature is a vast underground complex, revealed by satellite images, which includes probable submarine pens. The underground base aims to protect Indian submarines, SSBN, from aerial and satellite threats, while providing essential support structures for nuclear engineering. On the surface, the construction of piers suggests the ability to accommodate a variety of surface ships, improving the operational flexibility of the base. The Varsha project is designed to significantly improve India's naval deterrence, allowing the deployment of nuclear-armed submarines from a secure underground base. This signals India's commitment to maintaining a formidable presence in the Indian Ocean, ensuring national security and strengthening its position as a major maritime power.

**Project-75I**
The Indian Navy is seeking six submarines under Project-75I, which will feature Fuel Cell Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology combined with a Lithium-ion battery, allowing them to remain submerged for longer periods and reach high speeds without giving away their position. ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (tkMS) is the frontrunner for the contract, offering its 214-class submarines, which combine advanced technology with AIP capabilities. The submarines will be tailored to the Indian Navy's requirements and will feature a Lithium-ion battery, advanced sensors, and stealth features. The AIP technology will enable the submarines to remain submerged for three weeks at a time and operate silently, making them more lethal. The project is expected to be a high-priority for the Indian Navy, which currently has only 16 submarines, with the rest being over 30 years old and approaching decommissioning. The tkMS is confident about its technology, having already proven it in sea trials. The company is partnering with Mazagon Dockyard Limited (MDL) to build the submarines in India, with the first submarine expected to be delivered around seven years from the contract date.

**US may expand nuclear arsenal – Biden aide**
The US is considering increasing its nuclear warheads in the coming years due to the international situation, according to a senior official on the National Security Council. Pranay Vaddi, senior director for arms control, disarmament, and nonproliferation, stated that the US may need to increase its deployed numbers to deter adversaries and protect the American people and allies. This comes as the New START treaty with Russia is set to expire in 2026 and China has shown no interest in negotiating a nuclear treaty with the US. The US has already announced plans to update its nuclear triad, including new bombers, submarines, and gravity bombs, but these projects are over budget and behind schedule.

**US Considers Alternative Agreements with Russia Instead of START**
The US is considering alternative agreements with Russia instead of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). According to Pranay Vaddi, the senior director of the National Security Council for non-proliferation, the US has a specific approach and wants Russia and China to adopt it as well. Vaddi stated, 'For us, it looks like the beginning of negotiations with Russia on a subsequent agreement or a complex of agreements to ensure at least the preservation of restrictions between the US and our largest nuclear opponent.' He also expressed hope that the US can start negotiations with Russia on arms control and strategic stability before the expiration of the treaty. The START was signed in 2010 and aimed to reduce the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and their launchers, as well as heavy bombers and their nuclear weapons. The treaty was set to expire in February 2026, but Russia suspended its participation in February 2023. The US has been urging Russia to return to compliance with the treaty.

**US Open to Discuss New START Treaty with Russia**
The White House has expressed its willingness to discuss a new START treaty with Russia, according to US Assistant to the President for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, Brian Faddi. Faddi stated that Washington is open to the discussion and will welcome a response from the Russian Federation if they are ready to talk about it now. In September 2023, the US submitted an informal document to Russia, proposing a meeting to discuss a new treaty on strategic offensive arms and nuclear risk management, as well as any additional issues in this field. In February 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia will suspend its participation in the START treaty, emphasizing that the country will not withdraw from the treaty. He noted that before returning to the discussion, it is necessary to understand what countries like France and Britain are demanding, and how to take into account their strategic arsenals, including NATO's overall military capabilities. A formal note on Russia's suspension of participation in the treaty was sent to the US side on February 28 last year. In early June 2023, as a countermeasure under the New START treaty, Washington announced the suspension of information transfer to Russia about the status and location of its strategic weapons covered by the treaty, and revoked the clearance for Russian specialists to conduct inspections under the New START treaty, as well as the suspension of providing Russia with remote sensing information that affects the launch of American ballistic missiles and ballistic missiles launched from submarines. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov previously stated that Russia's return to implementing the New START treaty will not be possible unless the US changes its hostile policy towards Moscow, and it is clear that this is still far away. The Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, pointed out that the discussion on reducing strategic arms with the US is impossible until the Americans change their anti-Russian policy.

**US May Expand Strategic Nuclear Forces to Counter Growing Threats**
The US may expand its deployment of strategic nuclear forces in the coming years to counter growing threats from Russia, China, and North Korea, said Pranay Vaddi, a high-ranking official of the US National Security Council. Vaddi emphasized that the US is committed to the international regime of non-proliferation, but noted that Russia has refused to discuss a treaty to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START-3), which expires in 2026, and China is unwilling to negotiate on its growing nuclear arsenal. 'In the coming years, we may reach a point where we need to expand the number of deployed weapons to deter our opponents and protect the American people and our allies and partners,' Vaddi said. The US has expressed concerns over Russia's recent statements on deploying weapons to Ukraine's opponents and the planned arrival of four Russian warships, including an atomic submarine and a rocket frigate, in Havana for exercises. The US Navy will monitor the exercises, which are seen as a potential threat to the region.

**US to Develop New Gravitational Bomb and Extend Nuclear Submarine Life**
The US administration has decided to develop a new gravitational bomb and extend the service life of several Ohio-class nuclear submarines, according to a senior administration official. The move comes after Russia and China failed to support US efforts to discuss arms control last year. The US is also considering further evolution of its nuclear forces in the face of growing nuclear threats and is working to ensure that key allies have the potential for long-range strikes and surveillance capabilities necessary for self-defense. The US has been negotiating with Russia and China on arms control, but the talks have been stalled. The US is still hoping to bring its geopolitical rivals to the negotiating table, but wants to show that refusing to cooperate will have consequences. Russia and China will face a deterioration in security if they continue to refuse cooperation, said the official. The US and Russia are still bound by the New START treaty, which was signed in 2010 and limits the number of nuclear warheads and delivery systems. However, Russia suspended its participation in the treaty in 2023, citing uncertainty over how to account for the nuclear arsenals of NATO countries such as the UK and France.

The new strategy will be announced by the National Security Council's Senior Director for Arms Control, Disarmament, and Nonproliferation Pranay Vaddi at an arms control conference on Friday. The US believes that Beijing and Moscow have effectively rejected its proposal to discuss arms control without preconditions, and therefore, the Biden administration is forced to shift its approach. The changes may include the development of new types of nuclear bombs, extending the life of Ohio-class nuclear submarines, and considering a different evolution strategy for the US nuclear arsenal. The White House is also laying the groundwork for key nuclear issues Biden would face if re-elected, including the New START treaty's expiry in 2026.

**US to Adopt More Aggressive Strategy on Nuclear Weapons**
The Biden administration plans to adopt a more aggressive strategy on nuclear weapons after China and Russia rejected US efforts to discuss arms control. A high-ranking administration official said, 'The US believes it is necessary to take a more competitive approach to non-proliferation and arms control in the context of global tension, and to make some adjustments to our position and capabilities.' The US is expected to outline its new direction on Friday, June 7, at a conference on arms control. Last year, national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the US was willing to discuss arms control with China and Russia 'without preconditions.' However, Beijing and Moscow effectively rejected these proposals, prompting the US to change its approach. The administration still hopes to bring its geopolitical rivals to the negotiating table, but wants to demonstrate that refusal to negotiate will have consequences. 'Russia and China will face a deteriorating security environment if they continue to refuse to negotiate,' the official said. While details on future policy changes are scarce, a source noted that the administration's increasingly tough thinking is reflected in decisions to develop a new nuclear gravity bomb and efforts to extend the service life of some Ohio-class nuclear submarines. The White House is also laying the groundwork for key nuclear issues that Biden will face in the event of his re-election. Although the US and Russia remain legally bound by the New START treaty, the last agreement limiting the world's two largest nuclear arsenals, it expires in 2026. The US conducted test launches of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles on June 4 and 6, according to the US Space Force Command.

**Indian Navy's 'Stealthy' Nuclear Submarine Base In World's Largest Bay Set To Puncture Chinese PLAN**
India is building a $3.75 billion nuclear submarine base, INS Varsha, in the Bay of Bengal, which will be the world's largest bay. The base will accommodate at least 10 nuclear submarines and will be operational by 2025-2026. The base is designed to be stealthy, with tunnels bored into a mountain to allow submarines to enter and exit without surfacing and being detected by enemy spy satellites. The base will also have repair and maintenance facilities, amenities for crew rest, and advanced command and control systems. The base is seen as a counterbalance to China's growing naval assertiveness in the region and will bolster India's credible deterrence capabilities and strategic interests.

**How to Sink a $3 Billion Dollar Submarine: Leave a Hatch Open**
A $3 billion nuclear submarine, INS Arihant, was nearly sunk in 2017 due to a hatch left open, resulting in extensive repairs and a year-long inoperative period. The incident highlights the risks of human error in the military, with numerous notable incidents throughout history, including collisions, poor planning, and design flaws. The article discusses the consequences of such mistakes, including the sinking of the Vasa in the 17th century and the near-sinking of a German U-boat during WWII. The INS Arihant's mishap was particularly embarrassing, as it was India's first nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine and was left inoperative for nearly a year due to the damage caused by the open hatch.

**INS Arihant's wake: Make in India's Defense rise**
India's INS Arihant, the first home-built nuclear submarine, was launched on the 10th anniversary of the Kargil War victory. The project, started in 1998, showcases India's industrial prowess, with various Indian companies contributing to its construction. The launch marked a significant milestone in India's defense sector, which has seen a transition towards indigenisation. The Make-in-India initiative has led to a significant increase in defense exports, with a record ₹21,083 crore in 2024. Indian manufacturers are expanding their capacities and capabilities, and investors are showing interest in companies like HAL and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders. The market value of HAL has grown significantly, making it India's largest public sector defense company by market capitalization.

A French delegation, including representatives from the industry, manufacturers, and defense ministry officials, will arrive in India. The sources in the Indian government stated that the parties aim to complete the negotiations and sign an agreement by the end of the year. The deal is estimated to be worth 500 billion Indian rupees (approximately $6 billion). This is a follow-up to the July 13, 2023, approval by the Defense Acquisition Council of the Indian Ministry of Defense to purchase 26 Rafale M fighter jets from Dassault Aviation for the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier Vikrant and three Scorpene-class diesel-electric submarines from Mazagon Dockyards Limited in Mumbai. The contract will extend France's cooperation with MDL, which has completed the construction of six Kalvari-class attack submarines with French technical assistance. In 2022, India purchased 36 French multi-role Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force. The Indian Air Force currently operates Su-30MKI and MiG-29 fighter jets, with the Tejas Mark-1 indigenous fighter jets being introduced into service.

**The Navy's Virginia-Class Submarine Nightmare Won't Go Away**
The US Navy's Virginia-class nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines are advanced vessels designed for diverse missions, set to replace the older Los Angeles-class submarines. Despite plans for a fleet of 66, budget cuts in the Fiscal Year 2025 request reduced funding to just one submarine, down from two. This decision has raised concerns about the stability of the defense supply chain and undersea dominance. The Navy has also faced delays in submarine delivery and other shipbuilding projects, with a focus on immediate needs and innovative technologies, particularly in response to potential conflicts with China.

**US Discusses Russian Military-Cosmic Developments with India and China**
The United States is discussing Russian military-cosmic developments, including plans to create a potential nuclear anti-satellite weapon, with several countries, including India and China. US Deputy Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins stated that there were talks with Russia, as well as separately with China and India, on this issue. The US is seeking to work with other countries to urge Russia not to proceed with such developments. Jenkins emphasized that the US will continue to work with international forums, multilateral forums, and other countries to prepare for responsible behavior in space. In February 2024, the US government, including President Joe Biden, accused Russia of considering the possibility of placing nuclear weapons in space, without providing evidence. Russia has denied these allegations, with President Vladimir Putin stating that Moscow has always been against and remains opposed to placing nuclear weapons in space.

**China-Pakistan Naval Developments Increase India's Challenge**
India is facing a significant challenge from China and Pakistan in the naval domain. Pakistan has launched its first Hangor class submarine, which is bigger than India's Kalvari class submarines and equipped with an Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system. China has also made significant naval developments, including the launch of its third aircraft carrier, Fujian, which is expected to enter service by 2025/2026. The Chinese Navy is also increasing its submarine fleet, with plans to have 80 submarines by 2035. The author, a former IAF and Indian Navy officer, warns that the recent naval developments in Pakistan and China pose a serious threat to India's naval capabilities and recommends that India collaborate with France on constructing a nuclear-powered next-generation aircraft carrier.

**Pokhran anniversary: Why May 11, 1998 is Bharat's pivotal moment**
May 11, 1998, marked a pivotal moment in India's nuclear history when the country conducted the Shakti series of nuclear tests under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. This led to India's nuclear capability growing significantly, with a complete nuclear triad and robust second strike capability. The tests also marked a shift in India's stance, with Vajpayee naming China as the key reason for going nuclear. Today, India has a 5000 km range land-based Agni ballistic missile and a 3000 km range K-4 submarine-based ballistic missile, which can cover India from threats posed by China, Pakistan, and beyond. The article highlights how India's nuclear deterrence has helped the country stand up to military and diplomatic coercion from global powers, and how the country has utilized its nuclear capability to produce clean energy and respond to climate change.
