Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Timeline and Facts:
- Today is July 26, 2024
- Target date is October 1, 2024 (approximately 2 months ahead)
- We need less than 2 debates before October 1 for "Yes"
- Based on news, Biden has dropped out and Harris is presumptive nominee

2. Key Evidence For Higher Probability (Yes - Less than 2 debates):
- Trump's campaign explicitly refusing to commit to debates with Harris until she's officially nominated
- Democratic nomination won't be official until August convention
- Trump showing resistance to ABC debate scheduling
- Historical precedent of candidates sometimes avoiding debates
- Limited time window between Harris's official nomination and October 1
- Trump's team citing "political chaos" as reason to delay debates

3. Key Evidence For Lower Probability (No - 2 or more debates):
- Trump has publicly stated willingness to debate "more than once"
- Fox News has proposed specific debate date (Sept 17)
- Traditional expectation of presidential debates
- Harris expressing eagerness to debate
- Both campaigns previously agreed to debate framework when Biden was nominee

4. Analysis:
- Timeline is very tight: Even after Harris's nomination in August, organizing debates takes time
- Trump's recent statements show clear reluctance and delay tactics
- Previous debate agreements with Biden are likely void
- Only about 6 weeks between Democratic convention and October 1
- Organizing two debates in this window would be logistically challenging

5. Historical Patterns:
- Presidential debates typically occur in September-October
- Candidates sometimes skip debates for strategic reasons
- Last-minute debate scheduling is rare due to logistics

Given the combination of Trump's current resistance, the tight timeline after Harris's official nomination, and the logistical challenges, it appears highly unlikely that two debates will occur before October 1.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Timeline:
- Today is July 26, 2024
- Question resolution date: October 1, 2024
- Democratic Convention: August 19-22, 2024
- Kamala Harris appears to be presumptive nominee after Biden's withdrawal

2. Evidence FOR less than two debates (YES):
- Trump's campaign is explicitly refusing to commit to debates until Harris is officially nominated
- Trump has withdrawn from previously scheduled September 10 debate
- There's limited time between Democratic convention (Aug 19-22) and October 1
- Trump's campaign appears to be using debate participation as a strategic tool
- Historical precedent shows candidates sometimes skip debates for strategic reasons

3. Evidence AGAINST less than two debates (NO):
- Trump has publicly stated willingness to debate Harris multiple times
- Fox News has proposed a September 17 debate
- Both campaigns recognize the importance of debates
- There's still sufficient time for two debates between convention and October 1
- High voter interest and media pressure for debates

4. Analysis:
- The timing is very tight: Even if debates are agreed upon after Harris's nomination, organizing two debates before October 1 would be challenging
- Trump's recent statements show increasing reluctance to commit to debates
- The campaign's explicit stance on waiting for official nomination creates a significant delay
- Strategic considerations may incentivize Trump to limit debate exposure

5. Key uncertainties:
- Whether Trump will maintain his current position after Harris's official nomination
- How quickly debates could be organized post-convention
- Whether external pressure could force earlier commitment

Given the tight timeline, Trump's current stance, and the organizational challenges, I assess there's a high probability of less than two debates occurring before October 1.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.30%, with 75.40% being the most likely. Probability: 75.40%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris around July 21, 2024
- Only one debate (June 27) has occurred between Trump and Biden
- Harris is not yet officially nominated
- Trump's campaign is refusing to commit to debates with Harris until she's officially nominated
- Democratic nomination will be finalized by August 7, 2024
- Fox News has proposed a September 17 debate

2. Key Timeline:
- Today: July 26, 2024
- Democratic nomination: By August 7, 2024
- First potential Harris-Trump debate: September 17, 2024 (proposed)
- Question resolution date: October 1, 2024

3. Factors Supporting Yes (less than 2 debates):
- Trump's campaign is actively avoiding commitment to debates
- Limited time window between Harris's official nomination and October 1
- Trump's recent statements showing reluctance
- Historical pattern of Trump being debate-averse in 2020
- Trump using Democratic nomination uncertainty as a reason to delay

4. Factors Supporting No (2 or more debates):
- Trump has expressed willingness to debate Harris multiple times
- Both campaigns typically want debates for exposure
- Traditional expectation of presidential debates
- Pressure from media and public for debates

5. Analysis:
The time constraint is crucial. Even if Harris is nominated by August 7, that leaves less than 8 weeks until October 1. Given Trump's current stance and the time needed to organize debates, it seems unlikely that two debates could be arranged and executed in this window.

6. Updating:
The most recent news strongly suggests Trump's team is creating preconditions and showing reluctance to commit to debates. This significantly increases the probability of fewer than two debates occurring.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.20% being the most likely. Probability: 80.20%.

- Historical pattern of Trump being reluctant to debate
- Limited time window between Harris's nomination (Aug 7) and October 1
- Trump using Democratic "chaos" as excuse to delay

- Today is July 26, 2024
- Question resolves for debates before October 1, 2024
- One debate already occurred on June 27, 2024 between Biden and Trump
- However, Biden has withdrawn and endorsed Harris
- Harris not yet officially nominated (will happen at Democratic Convention Aug 19-22)

2. Key Evidence For "Yes" (less than 2 debates):
- Trump's campaign explicitly refusing to commit to debates with Harris until she's officially nominated
- Trump campaign citing "political chaos" and possibility Democrats could change nominee
- Recent pattern of Trump being hesitant about debates
- Limited time window between Harris's nomination (late August) and October 1
- Trump already using delay tactics by demanding Fox News host instead of ABC

3. Key Evidence For "No" (2 or more debates):
- Trump publicly stating he's "absolutely" willing to debate Harris multiple times
- Fox News has proposed a September 17 debate
- Previous scheduling of September 10 debate with Biden
- Traditional expectation of presidential debates
- Both campaigns likely to face pressure to debate

4. Analysis:
- Time constraint is significant: Only ~5 weeks between Harris's nomination and October 1
- Trump's recent statements show clear pattern of delay tactics
- Even if debates eventually happen, likely to be after October 1
- Trump's team already laying groundwork for avoiding/delaying debates with Harris

5. Historical Context:
- Presidential candidates typically debate 2-3 times
- However, this is an unusual situation with late nominee change
- Trump has history of debate negotiation tactics and withdrawals

Given these factors, particularly the tight timeline and Trump's current positioning, there's a high probability of fewer than two debates before October 1.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.20% being the most likely. Probability: 80.20%
