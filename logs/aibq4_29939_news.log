**Trump Plans to Cancel Biden's Executive Orders**
According to Caroline Livitt, a spokesperson for the Trump team, the newly elected US President Donald Trump plans to cancel a number of executive orders signed by the Biden administration during his first week in office. 'This will be the cancellation of all executive orders signed by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to reverse the effective political course of the first Trump administration,' she said. Livitt added that Trump will sign 'dozens of executive orders' during his first week in office. She also stated that the 94 executive orders signed by Biden during his first week in office 'led to a crisis at the border and an economic crisis.' 'That's why Trump was re-elected as president to give a 'do-over' to the executive orders that the Biden and Harris administration gave him,' Livitt said. Trump won the 2024 US presidential election with 312 electoral votes, defeating incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris.

**Biden Extends US National Emergency with Iran for Another Year**
US President Joe Biden announced that the national emergency with Iran will be extended for another year. Biden stated, 'Our relations with Iran have not been normalized yet, and the implementation of the agreements with Iran dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 regarding Iran.' According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'

**US Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Voter Registration Order**
The US Supreme Court rejected a challenge by Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania to an executive order by President Joe Biden aimed at increasing voter registration. The justices did not comment on their rejection of the Republicans' appeal, which argued that the order is an unconstitutional attempt to interfere with the November elections. Lower courts had previously dismissed the lawsuit. Nine Republican secretaries of state and 11 members of Congress had asked the highest court to intervene. In May, the judges declined to take the case and issue a quick decision on it. Separately, the judges also rejected two appeals related to baseless claims made by Republicans that voting machines and Dominion Voting Systems software were responsible for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential election loss.

**Supreme Court Won't Hear Challenge to Biden's Order on Voter Registration**
The Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order that increased government involvement in voter registration and voter mobilization. The order, which was issued in 2021, requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration drives aren't a legitimate function of government. However, Judge Jennifer Wilson of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit, stating that the lawmakers did not have standing to bring the challenge. The judge wrote, '[The individual state lawmakers] did not have standing to bring a challenge to an action that allegedly injured the legislature as a whole.' The lawmakers had requested expedited consideration of the standing issue, so they could obtain a preliminary injunction before the November 2024 election.

**Biden Takes Aim at 3D-Printed Firearms, Machine-Gun Conversion Devices in Executive Order**
President Joe Biden's administration has released a new executive order aimed at reducing gun violence, targeting machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms, as well as improving active-shooter drills in schools. The order comes after a mass shooting in Birmingham, Ala., where local law enforcement believe the shooters used conversion devices. Biden will direct a task force to assess the threat these weapons pose and the federal agencies' operational and legal capacities to detect and seize them. The order also sets out to improve school-based active-shooter drills by keeping guns away from potential school shooters and investing more federal resources in school safety and gun-violence prevention. According to the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there has been a 17-percent drop in the national homicide rate between January and June, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive reported that the number of mass shootings so far in 2024 has dropped by 20 percent. Biden said, 'The Biden-Harris administration's latest effort to crack down on gun violence.'

**Which Biden executive orders will be the first to go under Trump - Washington Examiner**
President-elect Donald Trump has promised to undo many of the executive orders signed by President Joe Biden during his first eight days in office. Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said that 'there will be tens of [executive orders]' on his first day in office, including one to secure the southern border and another to launch the largest mass deportation operation in American history. Trump is also expected to bring back the Remain in Mexico program for migrants seeking asylum and expedite permitting for fracking and drilling. However, Trump is unlikely to match Biden's pace of signing executive orders, and may not undo Biden's efforts to forgive student loans, according to CATO Institute scholar Andrew Gillen. Trump is expected to focus on Title IX regulations regarding transgender students and may reimplement Schedule F, which would allow him to fire some federal employees who previously enjoyed job protections.

**Trump to Reverse Biden's Executive Orders, Including Those Related to Ukraine**
Donald Trump plans to repeal around 100 executive orders issued by Joe Biden during his first week in office, according to Trump's press secretary Caroline Leavit. Some of these orders relate to Ukraine. However, Biden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan stated that the outgoing president will try to convince Trump to continue supporting Kiev. Their meeting is scheduled for November 13. Given Biden's recent behavior, the conversation is unlikely to be straightforward for either party.

**Biden’s 2024 Federal Register page count already second highest ever**
The 2024 Federal Register page count has reached 89,476 pages, making it the second-highest yearly count of all time, with over a month and a half to go. This is a significant increase from the 89,368 pages in 2023 and the 79,856 pages in 2022. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the costs imposed by the rules of 2024 are among the highest on record. President Biden has instructed agencies to advance progressive aims through whole-of-government regulatory initiatives, resulting in big jumps in page counts. The article notes that Donald Trump's regulatory streamlining priority was an anomaly, and a thicker Federal Register generally means more regulations. The article suggests that if Trump formalizes his promised one-in, ten-out campaign for rules in 2025, the Register could flex again.

**Biden's Last-Minute Efforts to 'Trump-Proof' Institutions**
As Donald Trump's second term approaches, Joe Biden is racing against time to 'Trump-proof' the institutions before his departure. With a Republican-controlled Senate and a likely Republican-controlled House of Representatives, Biden aims to consolidate his achievements and protect his legacy through executive orders and administrative actions. Trump, on the other hand, plans to surround himself with loyalists and replace a significant portion of the federal administration with partisans. His 'Schedule F' plan would allow for up to 50,000 federal positions to be accessible to political nominations, potentially compromising the independence of the administration and putting institutions in place to limit presidential influence under control. Biden is also working to strengthen federal protections in sensitive areas such as minority rights, abortion rights, and LGBTQ+ rights, and to solidify alliances with key partners to anchor the US position on the world stage. However, the judiciary remains a potential check on Trump's power, and Biden may work with independent lawyers and judges to maintain the balance of power and prevent the invalidation of essential protections.

**Trump won. Here are 3 Biden priorities under scrutiny**
President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to roll back several key policies championed by the Biden administration. Three priorities under scrutiny include the Schedule F executive order, which aimed to politicize the federal workforce, the Inflation Reduction Act, and US support for Ukraine. The Biden administration has taken steps to 'Trump-proof' these policies, including rescinding the Schedule F order and allocating remaining funds for Ukraine before the end of his term. According to experts, it would be difficult for a Trump administration to rescind the Inflation Reduction Act, as it has spurred investments in manufacturing projects in Republican congressional districts and has been incorporated into business plans. 'They would have to put it out for public comment, and they then would have to issue a final rule that survived judicial scrutiny,' said Howard Shelanski, former head of the federal Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 'I actually think it would take a fair bit of luck for a Trump administration to actually rescind the rule and get that affirmed by a court within the one presidential term he would have,' he added.

**Workforce Shake-Up, AI Rules Loom Large for Early Trump Agenda**
The incoming Trump administration is expected to make significant changes to the Federal workforce and artificial intelligence (AI) policies. Experts believe that the new administration will resume work on restructuring the top layers of Federal agency workforces, similar to the cancelled 'Schedule F' executive order from the previous Trump administration. This order would have placed 50,000 Federal employees in a new classification, making it easier to remove them and replace them with people more apt to carry out the administration's aims. The Biden administration's AI executive order, issued in October 2023, will likely be modified or scrapped by the new administration. Federal tech experts expect the incoming administration to adopt a more muscular and less cautious approach to AI tech, potentially opening up greater opportunities for private sector developers and contractors. Jason Oxman, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, expressed optimism about working with the incoming administration, while National Active and Retired Federal Employees President William Shackelford urged the administration to preserve merit-based civil service protections.

**One year later, how has the White House AI Executive Order delivered on its promises?**
The White House Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has reached its one-year anniversary. The order, signed by President Joe Biden on October 30, 2023, aimed to establish the U.S. as a leader in safe, ethical, and responsible AI use. The order directed federal agencies to address several core areas, including managing dual-use AI models, implementing rigorous testing protocols, enforcing accountability measures, safeguarding civil rights, and promoting transparency. The White House released a scorecard of achievements, highlighting the work of federal agencies, voluntary agreements with industry stakeholders, and efforts to ensure AI benefits the global talent market and protects American workers. The U.S. AI Safety Institute has spearheaded pre-deployment testing of advanced AI models and signed agreements with leading AI companies to conduct red-team testing. The National Institute of Standards and Technology released Version 1.0 of its AI Risk Management Framework, which provides guidelines for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across generative AI and dual-use models. The White House EO on AI marks an essential step in shaping the future of U.S. AI policy, but its path forward remains uncertain with the pending presidential election.

**3 Ways the Left Plans to Stack Every Branch of Government | @amacforamerica**
Democratic Party candidates in the 2024 election have proposed policies that would fundamentally transform all three branches of government, assure permanent left-wing power, and effect the domination of American politics by a polarized ideological minority. One of these plans involves 'stacking' the Supreme Court by expanding its size and packing it with liberal judicial activists. This idea has been discussed openly in the Democratic Party, with 11 presidential hopefuls supporting it in the 2020 primaries. President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14023 to study the issue, but the commission's report concluded that court-packing could undermine the Court's legitimacy and be perceived as a partisan maneuver. 'The risks of Court expansion are considerable,' the report stated.

He expressed gratitude to military and veteran families, saying 'We owe them a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay.' The President highlighted various initiatives to support veterans and military families, including the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, which has provided new benefits and services to over 1.1 million veterans and 11,000 survivors. He also mentioned efforts to prevent military and veteran suicide, eliminate homelessness, and improve financial security for military families. Additionally, the President signed an Executive Order to support the economic security of military families and veterans' spouses, caregivers, and survivors. He emphasized that these actions are personal for him and his family, who have experienced the pride and pain of having a loved one serve in the military. The President called upon the people of the United States to honor veterans and military families with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

**'Biden Bucks' Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration's Executive Order 14019 has been criticized as 'Biden Bucks' for its potential to alter the election process and favor Democrats. The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.

**On November 5, AI is also on the ballot**
The 2024 election will determine whether America leads or retreats from its crucial role in ensuring AI develops safely and in alignment with democratic values. The Biden-Harris administration has developed a comprehensive approach to AI governance, including the landmark Executive order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. Critics who claim this framework would stifle innovation argue that rigorous safety standards and air traffic control systems developed through international cooperation didn't inhibit the airline industry, they made it possible. The administration's framework directs federal agencies to address the full spectrum of AI challenges, including preventing AI discrimination, promoting research that serves the public good, and creating new initiatives across government to help society adapt to AI-driven changes. The framework also tackles the most serious security risks by ensuring that powerful AI models undergo rigorous testing so that safeguards can be developed to block their potential misuse. The Biden-Harris Executive Order on AI establishes a foundation that must be built upon, and strengthening United States' role in setting global AI safety standards and expanding international partnerships is essential for maintaining American leadership.

**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**
The U.S. Code archives federal laws, while the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations contains rules from the daily Federal Register. The Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate. The dispensation of federal dollars is an increasingly powerful regulatory mechanism, and the stipulations embedded within grant programs and Notices of Funding Opportunity belong in any compilation of regulatory dark matter.

**Missouri attempts to halt Biden’s voter registration executive order**
The state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued that the order is a federal overreach and that the state already has an election system in place. However, an attorney representing the U.S. Department of Justice stated that the state has failed to present any evidence that the executive order has caused harm. The state's attorney claimed that the order will lead to an added burden for the state by verifying voter registration information shared through federal channels. The case has been taken under advisement by the judge, and it's unclear when a ruling will be issued.

Lower courts had previously dismissed the lawsuit. Nine Republican secretaries of state and 11 members of Congress had asked the highest court to intervene. In May, the judges declined to take the case and issue a quick decision on it. Separately, the judges also rejected two appeals related to baseless claims made by Republicans that voting machines and Dominion Voting Systems software were responsible for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential election loss.

**US Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Voter Registration Order**
The US Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order increasing government involvement in voter registration and mobilization. The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'

**Supreme Court won’t hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**
The Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, allows nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers claimed the order was unconstitutional and an attempt to influence the 2020 election. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in a 2023 decision, ruling that state legislatures are not insulated from state judicial review. The denial of the challenge is a blow to groups seeking more transparency behind the executive order's functions, including America First Legal, which has called the order an 'unprecedented election interference program'.

The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers challenging President Joe Biden's executive order on voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, aimed to 'solicit and facilitate' nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers argued that the order was an unconstitutional attempt to influence the 2020 election and that the authority for regulating federal elections is solely vested in state legislatures. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v. Harper, ruling that the Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from judicial review.

**Ahead of the Election, Biden Rolls Out New Executive Action on Guns**
President Joe Biden has signed an executive order to create a federal task force to combat 'emerging firearms threats,' including cheap devices that can convert semiautomatic pistols into fully automatic machine guns. The task force, which will be responsible for developing a plan to combat machine gun conversion devices, has 90 days to issue a report. The executive order also seeks to crack down on 3D-printed guns and improve school active shooter drills. Biden said, 'The streets are flooded with machine gun conversion devices because the parts are small, cheap, and easy to make. The impact of these devices is devastating.' The task force will be composed of leaders from several federal departments and agencies. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said, 'We've been working with our U.S. attorney, with the Justice Department, to get machine gun conversions like Glock switches off our city streets.' Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'For as much as we have accomplished, more must be done. We need more leaders like the leaders in this room, in Congress, who have the courage to take action, to stand up to the gun lobby, and to put the lives of our children first.' The work may build on the administration's previous efforts to combat 'ghost guns.' 3D-printed firearms are typically produced at home with computer code downloaded from the internet and often lack a serial number, making them undetectable by law enforcement. Stefanie Feldman, the director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, said, 'Some 3D-printed firearms can be made to be undetectable by magnetometers used to secure airports, courthouses and event spaces.' A second provision of the executive order aims to improve school-based active shooter drills, which have come under increasing scrutiny as parents, students, and educators say that some versions of the drills are traumatic. Christian Heyne, the president of the gun violence prevention group Brady, said in a statement, 'The Biden-Harris administration has been the strongest gun violence prevention administration in history, and today's news tells us they have no intention of slowing down.'

**Biden orders schools to make active shooter drills less traumatic for students**
President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that aims to make active shooter drills less traumatic for students while still being effective. The order also seeks to restrict new technologies that make guns easier to fire and obtain. According to Stefanie Feldman, the director of Biden's office of gun violence prevention, the order will help schools create drills that 'maximize their effectiveness and limit any collateral harms they might cause.' The order also establishes a task force to investigate the threats posed by machine-gun-conversion devices and 3D-printed guns. Gun violence continues to plague the nation, with at least 31 mass killings in the U.S. so far in 2024, leaving at least 135 people dead. The order was praised by gun-control groups, but criticized by the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, who said it was 'just one more attempt by the Biden-Harris Administration to deflect attention from their soft-on-crime policies.'

**Biden Takes Aim at 3D-Printed Firearms, Machine-Gun Conversion Devices in Executive Order**
President Joe Biden's administration has released a new executive order aimed at reducing gun violence, targeting machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms, as well as improving active-shooter drills in schools. The order comes after a mass shooting in Birmingham, Ala., where local law enforcement believe the shooters used conversion devices. Biden will direct a task force to assess the threat these weapons pose and the federal agencies' operational and legal capacities to detect and seize them. The order also sets out to improve school-based active-shooter drills by keeping guns away from potential school shooters and investing more federal resources in school safety and gun-violence prevention. According to the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there has been a 17-percent drop in the national homicide rate between January and June, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive reported that the number of mass shootings so far in 2024 has dropped by 20 percent. Biden said, 'The Biden-Harris administration's latest effort to crack down on gun violence.'

**Biden Administration Reports Significant Decrease in Migrant Encounters at US-Mexico Border**
According to US Customs and Border Protection, there was a nearly 68% decrease in encounters with migrants at the border in August 2024 compared to the previous year. Officials attribute this to an executive order issued by President Joe Biden. The White House reported a significant decrease in migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border since Biden's executive order to strengthen immigration law enforcement. The number of migrant encounters in August was significantly lower than the previous year, wrote White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández in a statement. Since Biden's executive order on June 4, there has been a 50% decrease in encounters at the border. According to US Customs and Border Protection, in August there were around 58,000 migrant encounters at ports of entry along the southern border, a nearly 68% decrease from the 181,000 in August 2023. The total number of encounters at the southern border was around 63,000. This number includes around 5,000 migrants who arrived at ports of entry without a CBP One registration. CBP One is a mobile app that allows migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry instead of crossing illegally. US border officials said the app has played a crucial role in streamlining border processes. In August, around 44,700 people were processed through CBP One. Since its introduction in January 2023, over 813,000 people have scheduled appointments. US border officials also said that the June executive actions led to an increase in deportations of migrants, with over 131,000 people deported to more than 140 countries since June. Around 400 international repatriation flights have taken place during this time. However, even with the latest numbers, some Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration during a hearing on Thursday to discuss possible terrorist threats and national security issues related to illegal immigration. Lawmakers argued that the perception of border agents as welcoming, rather than focused on law enforcement, is contributing to the number of migrants arriving in the US. 'Our border patrol, our law enforcement agents were moved from their role of national security, their role of enforcing immigration law [to] repel illegal entry and capture those crossing illegally as much as possible to a kind of reception and care and transportation, food, etc.,' said Rep. Clay Higgins, a Republican from Alabama, expressing his concern about migrants crossing illegally and evading Border Patrol. There is no indication that the Biden administration has officially changed the role of Border Patrol agents in law enforcement. Alex Nowrasteh, vice president of economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, testified during the hearing that the main reason migrants come to the US, legally or illegally, is to work. 'It's still the economy. That's what attracts people, and the rapid economic recovery after COVID-19 may explain more than any other factor,' he said.

**Nine months of progress – President Biden's Landmark AI Executive Order**
In the nine months since President Biden's Landmark Executive Order on AI, US federal agencies have made significant progress in achieving the directives set forth in the order. The July Fact Sheet reports that the agencies have achieved all 90-day and 270-day deadlines set forth in the order. Some key achievements include the release of new technical guidelines for managing AI risks, the development of AI testbeds and model evaluation tools, and the hiring of over 200 individuals to increase the federal government's AI capacity. The agencies have also made progress in advancing responsible AI innovation, including the preparation of a report on the potential benefits and risks of dual-use foundation models. The final deadline for the agencies to achieve the remaining 13 directives in the order is October 30, 2024. As stated by the July Fact Sheet, 'substantial progress has been made in achieving the AI Executive Order's mandate to protect Americans from the potential risks of AI systems while catalyzing innovation in AI and beyond.'

**President Joe Biden Proclaims Tuesday, September 17, 2024, as National Voter Registration Day**
President Joe Biden has proclaimed Tuesday, September 17, 2024, as National Voter Registration Day. He emphasized that American democracy begins and ends with the ballot box, and that voting defines our threshold of liberty. However, there are forces trying to suppress voters and subvert elections. To combat this, Biden signed an Executive Order to promote non-partisan access to voter registration and election information. Federal agencies have worked to make voter registration more accessible for veterans and college students, and the Department of Justice has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff. Biden called on all eligible Americans to ensure they are registered to vote and to cast a ballot in upcoming elections. He also encouraged Americans to verify their registration and to help their neighbors do the same. According to Biden, 'A republic, if you can keep it,' as Benjamin Franklin once said, and it is incumbent upon us to maintain it. The Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act must be passed by Congress to fully secure the right to vote in every State.
