INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LIAM, sit at a table, analyzing their data.

JANE  
(looking at her tablet)  
Well, it’s official. Forbes confirmed it. Musk didn’t make it.

LIAM  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 27.35%. Bezos’s aggressive investments paid off, and Musk's legal issues took a toll.

JANE  
True. The August tech market crash was a curveball. Our data from 2024-08-09 hinted at volatility, but not this.

LIAM  
And Bernard Arnault’s unexpected surge? Our models had that at just 3.12%.

JANE  
(smiling)  
Goes to show, even with all the data, the future’s a mystery. But we got close.

They sip their coffee, satisfied with their near-perfect predictions.

FADE OUT.

Superforecasters LUCAS and MAYA sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

LUCAS  
Well, it's official. Elon Musk isn't the richest today.

MAYA  
No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.75%. 

LUCAS  
Right. Even with his July lead, Bezos had a strong August. 

MAYA  
And let's not forget Arnault's luxury boom in September.

LUCAS  
True. The market's unpredictable dance. 

MAYA  
Yet, our predictions held up. Feels good to be right.

LUCAS  
Always does. On to the next forecast?

MAYA  
Absolutely. What's the world got for us next?

JANE  
Well, the numbers are in. Forbes confirmed it. Elon Musk is still the richest.

MIKE  
Our models had it at 95.67%. Given his ventures and market trends, it seemed inevitable.

JANE  
Exactly. Even with Bezos and Arnault closing in, Musk’s diversification kept him ahead.

MIKE  
Remember the volatility in tech stocks? Our August data showed resilience in Musk's portfolio.

JANE  
True. And with Tesla’s new innovations, it was a strong lead. No surprises here.

MIKE  
Yet, the probability was never 100%. The economic landscape can shift rapidly.

JANE  
Indeed. But, as predicted, Musk maintained his position.
