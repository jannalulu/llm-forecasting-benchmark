Let me carefully analyze this specific forecast:

Key considerations:
- We're looking specifically at core CPI (excluding food/energy)
- Looking at month-over-month change in August 2024
- Specific threshold is 0.5% increase
- Current date is late August 2024

Recent inflation trends:
- 2024 has seen gradual moderation in inflation
- Last few months have been around 0.2-0.3% monthly core CPI increases
- Federal Reserve has been carefully monitoring inflation
- Signs of economic softening suggest continued moderation

Factors suggesting potential for 0.5%+:
- Potential unexpected supply chain disruptions
- Wage pressures
- Potential geopolitical events impacting prices

Factors suggesting <0.5%:
- Fed's continued restrictive monetary policy
- Slowing economic growth
- Recent trends of inflation stabilization

Probabilistic reasoning suggests a slightly higher likelihood of staying below 0.5%, but with meaningful uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 64.50%, but 49.75% being the most likely. Probability: 49.75%.
