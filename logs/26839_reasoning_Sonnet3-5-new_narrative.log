Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. Based on the data we had up to August 2nd, we gave Apple's stacked battery announcement a 78.5% probability."

Tetlock: *nodding* "The signals were strong. The EU battery regulations, the consistent MacRumors leaks about the iPhone 16 Pro, and Apple's historical pattern of September announcements. But what really pushed our confidence was their battery supplier's retooling reports."

Nate: "Still, that 21.5% chance of no announcement was real. Supply chain issues could have delayed it, or they could have held it for the iPhone 17."

Tetlock: "True. But Apple needed this for the European market compliance. The stacked design solved multiple problems at once - repairability, capacity, and heat management."

[Both turn to their monitors, already working on their next prediction.]

[Scene: A dimly lit office with multiple monitors displaying data. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasts.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 85.50%."

Philip: [nodding] "The stacked battery technology announcement was practically inevitable. Those MacRumors reports from August about the iPhone 16 Pro models were telling. When you combined that with the EU's battery replacement requirements for 2025..."

Nate: "Right. The metal casing design, the promised 10% density increase - all the pieces were there. Plus, Apple needed something big to compete in the market."

Philip: "The timing made perfect sense too. Their September events are traditional launch windows, and with the EU deadline looming, they had to move on battery innovation."

Nate: "Another win for probabilistic forecasting. When multiple indicators align like that, the signal becomes pretty clear."

[Both turn back to their monitors, satisfied]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Apple's stacked battery announcement."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the supply chain reports and EU battery regulations we saw by August 2nd, our models had it at 82.45%. The signs were there - the metal casing patents, the push for higher energy density, and Apple's need to comply with EU repairability laws by 2025."

Nate: "The timing made sense too. Apple needed a significant battery innovation for the iPhone 16 Pro models, and stacked technology was the logical next step, especially with their competitors moving in that direction."

Philip: "The MacRumors leaks about the 10% density increase were particularly telling. Once we saw those technical specifications, combined with their supplier agreements, the probability became quite clear."

[Both nod in satisfaction at their accurate prediction]
