**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, yesterday marked a pivotal moment. The question was: Will the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index come from the Energy industry?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate, our models had it at 70.25%. Given the recent surge in energy stocks and the consistent rankings of those in positions 248 through 253, it seemed likely.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Despite the financial sector's push, energy's dominance was clear. Our data up to July suggested a strong trend.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely, and with Bloomberg's strict classification rules, the probability of a category shift was minimal.

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating outcome. Once again, our models prove their accuracy.

*They exchange knowing glances, the weight of their predictions hanging in the air.*

**FADE OUT.**

*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, seated at a table. A headline reads: "Billionaire Index Surprise?"*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the big question was whether the median billionaire would hail from the Energy sector. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 65.34% for a "Yes" outcome. 

**NATE SILVER:** And it turns out, "Yes" was spot on. The 250th billionaire is indeed from Energy. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Remarkable, considering the shifts in the rankings and the slight chance of Bloomberg altering industry classifications.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The energy sector's volatility played a significant role, but our models accounted for that.

*Both forecasters nod, satisfied with their predictions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Another testament to the power of accurate forecasting. 

*The camera fades out as they continue discussing the implications.*
