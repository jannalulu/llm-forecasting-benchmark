NATE SILVER  
So, Philip, the question was whether Rivian would post on their Stories site before October 1, 2024. What did our models say?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. Given the data up to September 11, 2024, Rivian seemed to be focusing more on product launches and partnerships rather than updating their Stories page.

NATE SILVER  
Interesting. And it turns out, they didn't post. It seems the focus on strategic growth and external communications was prioritized over digital content updates.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. Plus, the possibility of the page being down might have also played a role in our forecast. Our models factored in every angle.

NATE SILVER  
As always, accuracy prevails. Another win for the models.

They exchange a knowing nod, the conversation shifting to the next topic.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a news desk, papers scattered before them.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, it's the day after our prediction window closed. Did Rivian post anything new on their Stories site?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate, our models had it at 35.20%. We anticipated their digital presence, but the lack of activity aligns with recent trends.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. Given their last post on August 15, 2024, we assumed some momentum. But perhaps their strategy is shifting?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The absence of updates could suggest a pivot in their communication strategy or unforeseen technical issues. Our models account for such variables.

**NATE SILVER:** A reminder of the unpredictability in forecasting digital engagement. Until next time, we'll keep refining our models.

*They exchange a knowing nod, the weight of their accurate prediction lingering in the air.*

**FADE OUT.**

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did Rivian surprise us this time?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. Rivian stayed quiet after their August post.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given their recent media strategy, it seemed unlikely they'd post again so soon.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Their focus has shifted towards product development and less on storytelling.

**NATE SILVER:** And the risk of the page being down?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Low, but factored in. Still, Rivian's digital footprint remains stable.

**NATE SILVER:** So, no post before October 1st. Our models hold strong.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Another win for data-driven forecasting.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, did Rivian make any posts on their Stories site before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the data up to September 11, 2024, Rivian's posting frequency was sporadic. Plus, the risk of the page being down was factored in.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. Their last post was on August 15, 2024, but no updates since. The probability reflected their recent trend and potential technical issues.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Despite the buzz around Rivian, their digital engagement strategy seemed inconsistent. Our models captured that uncertainty perfectly.
