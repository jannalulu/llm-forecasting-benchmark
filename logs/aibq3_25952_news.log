**France: From the Cord to the Bolillo Lace**
The New Popular Front (NFP) coalition of socialists, communists, ecologists, and independents won the French Assembly elections, defeating Marine Le Pen's Reagrupamiento Nacional (RN) party. The coalition, along with the Macronists, blocked Le Pen's party from gaining power. The results led to the resignation of Gabriel Attal, the designated prime minister for 2024. The election has created a complex situation for governance, with the need for a coalition government between the center, right, and left. Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the radical left, has called for the new prime minister to come from the updated Popular Front. However, the president will have the final say in the nomination, and the negotiations will be difficult to reconcile the winner of the left with their allies from the right and center. The extraordinary mobilization of voters has prevented the rise of Le Pen's party and has alleviated concerns for European institutions. The French society's malaise and fragmentation require now, after emergency alliances, solvent responses to the latent and expressed problems.

**New Popular Front to Designate Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, will designate a prime minister candidate this week to govern without Macron. Olivier Faure, the Socialist Party's first secretary, emphasized that Macron must recognize his defeat in the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Faure excluded Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insumisa, from the running and stressed that the new prime minister must be able to dialogue with the outside world. The coalition, which includes La France Insumisa, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, won 182 seats in the legislative elections, far from the 289 needed for an absolute majority. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, will present his resignation to the president this morning, but may remain in office as long as necessary, considering France is hosting the Paris Olympics starting July 26.

**No coalition or party wins absolute majority in French parliament**
The 'New Popular Front' alliance of left-wing forces won the parliamentary elections in France, according to the results of the second round of voting. The presidential coalition 'Together' came in second, and the National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, came in third. The results are as follows: 'New Popular Front' - 182 seats; 'Together' - 168; National Rally - 143; Republicans - 45. Other coalitions combined received 39 seats. Early parliamentary elections were held in France after President Emmanuel Macron's coalition lost in the European Parliament elections. The first round took place on June 30, and the second on July 7. As a result, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal will resign.

**Left-Wing New Popular Front Coalition Leads French Election, Polls Show**
The left-wing New Popular Front coalition won the most seats in the second round of French parliamentary elections, leading pollsters said on Sunday. This puts them on track for a surprise win over the far-right National Rally (RN) party but short of an absolute majority in parliament. Financial analysts are expecting a relief in the market, with some predicting a slight gap lower in French bond prices and higher yields. The real question is who will be running the country and who will be the next prime minister.

**What Political Scenarios for July?**
The French political landscape will be put to the test. The first round of legislative elections will take place on June 30, 2024. If the National Rally or the New Popular Front wins, nothing is guaranteed for them. Once the result is known, the National Assembly must convene on the second Thursday following the election, as stipulated by Article 12 of the Constitution, which relates to the dissolution of the National Assembly. This will be on July 18. If Emmanuel Macron obtains an absolute majority, he can govern without hindrance. In the event of an absolute majority for the National Rally, a cohabitation with Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister would be inevitable. However, Macron, as President, has the right to refuse to appoint the Prime Minister proposed by the opposition, although this could lead to tensions and motions of censure. If the RN obtains a relative majority, Jordan Bardella has already announced that he would refuse the Prime Minister position, leading to a potential deadlock. Finally, without a clear majority, an apolitical technical government could be formed to manage current affairs. If instability persists, Macron could consider a new dissolution of the Assembly after a year or even his own resignation, although he has ruled out this option in the short term.

**Left-wing camp in France divided over pick for prime minister**
The New Popular Front (NFP) alliance, a broad leftist coalition, is struggling to choose a candidate for prime minister after winning the French parliamentary elections. The alliance consists of Socialists, Greens, Communists, and France Unbowed, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The Socialists want their leader Olivier Faure to be the prime minister, while France Unbowed is pushing for Clémence Guetté, who organized Mélenchon's 2022 presidential campaign. The alliance hopes to name its pick by the end of the week or early next. The left-wing government is still uncertain, as the NFP did not win a majority and is facing opposition from President Emmanuel Macron's centrist allies and the far-right National Rally. The Socialists are considering splitting from the NFP and joining Macron's camp, while the Republicans are also considering joining Macron's team.

**What Happened in France is Astonishing**
The far-right was on the brink of power in France. In the first round of voting on June 30, Marine Le Pen's National Rally party came first with 33% of the vote, winning more than half of the local elections. With the expectation that the party would be close to a majority, France was plunged into a frenzy of speculation and anxiety. The National Rally's main candidate, Jordan Bardella, insisted that he would only accept being prime minister if he had the support of the Parliament. According to polls, he seemed well-positioned to demand a mandate. However, the second round on Sunday showed that he was wrong. Bardella not only came close to the prime minister's office, but his party came third with 143 seats. Although the number of seats increased compared to the previous election, it is far from the predictions made a few days ago. The coalition of President Emmanuel Macron, which had lagged behind throughout the short campaign, surprised everyone by coming second with 168 seats. The biggest surprise was who came first. The New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition of four parties formed hastily before these elections, emerged as the largest force with 182 seats. It's a truly astonishing result. Through an impressive act of collective responsibility, the far-right has been stopped. But France has not suddenly changed. As no group has obtained more than a third of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, problems are looming. The far-right, although chastened, is in a stronger position than ever, at the helm of a growing and decently positioned electoral coalition for the 2027 presidential elections. But France, thanks to pragmatic cooperation between parties and enthusiastic voter resistance, has obtained a brilliant reprieve.

**Q+A: What's next for France after unprecedented legislative elections**
France's legislative elections have resulted in a hung parliament, with no party securing a majority. The left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP), surprised everyone by coming in first place, while Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble coalition came in second. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) fell to third after a strong showing in the first round. Eric Maurice, a French policy analyst at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, explains the implications of this unprecedented situation. He notes that Macron will have to wait for the new parliament to structure itself before choosing a prime minister, and that the left and centre will need to form a coalition to govern. Maurice also highlights the challenges facing the next government, including addressing people's needs, achieving political stability, and preparing for the 2027 presidential election.

**French Left Seeks Prime Minister Candidate After Legislative Elections**
The French left is seeking a prime minister candidate after the legislative elections held on June 30 and July 7. The New Popular Front, with 189 elected deputies, is now the largest force in the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament. However, the party's leaders have said they want to try to govern alone, without allying with Ensemble and without dividing, but their parliamentarians are below the absolute majority threshold of 289. This means they would have to negotiate with Macron's wing every time they want to pass a law. The negotiations are expected to last at least until July 18, the deadline for registering deputies before the formation of groups and the election of commission presidents in the National Assembly.

**French Political Intrigue Heats Up After Unexpected Election Results**
Joanna Rolland, the chief negotiator of the Socialists and the mayor of Nantes, stated that the left-wing alliance 'New Popular Front' (NPF) will be open to negotiations with those who want to work with them, including left-wing Macronists. The NPF, which includes Socialists, Greens, and the extreme left-wing 'Unbowed France' party of Jean-Luc Mélenchon, aims to take the initiative after its unexpected victory in the parliamentary elections. The election created a complex situation in the National Assembly, which opens the door to unprecedented coalition agreements. Macron needs to find a candidate who can withstand the no-confidence votes in the divided National Assembly. However, his power base has shrunk, squeezed between the extreme right-wing 'National Rally' of Marine Le Pen and the resurgent left-wing forces that no one expected to win the elections. The left-wing lawmakers are unlikely to agree to work with Macron, who has called 'Unbowed France' extremist and accused its pro-Palestinian group of anti-Semitism. Rolland excluded the candidacy of Mélenchon, the leader of 'Unbowed France', for the post of prime minister. 'No one in the 'New Popular Front' can say who it will be - we need calm and discussion', she said. The first session of the new National Assembly is scheduled for July 17.

**La marea de Le Pen continúa pese a la victoria del Nuevo Frente Popular**
The New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, led by Melenchon, has won the most seats in the French parliamentary elections, surpassing the Macronist bloc and relegating Marine Le Pen's far-right party to third place. However, the NFP has not achieved a majority, and France now has a divided parliament. The 'cordon sanitaire' principle, where major parties unite to prevent the far-right from gaining power, has been achieved. The NFP's victory is seen as a 'cordón sanitario' rather than a majority win. The shift in trend is attributed to 80 electoral districts moving to the right and 75 to the left between the 2022 and 2024 elections. According to Pablo Simón, a political scientist, the first-round results are more indicative of popular support than the second-round results, which are influenced by strategic withdrawals. The outcome of the elections leaves France with a divided parliament, and Macron's first decision will be to appoint a new Prime Minister. The party that will lead the government is still unknown, and the possibility of a minority government or a technocratic government is being considered.

**Who will be the next Prime Minister of France?**
The Nouveau Front populaire (NFP) has won the second round of the 2024 legislative elections, but no party has obtained a majority. The left-wing coalition is pushing for a new prime minister, with Marine Tondelier, leader of the Ecologists, suggesting that Emmanuel Macron should call on the left to propose a candidate. Olivier Faure, socialist, wants the NFP to present a candidate for prime minister within the week. The NFP is facing difficulties in choosing a method for selecting a representative, with some advocating for consensus and others for a vote. The qualities of the ideal candidate include being able to dialogue with the outside world, being a 'tisserand' (a weaver), and being able to gather civil society. Marine Tondelier also emphasized the need for someone who has experience and competence. The choice of candidate will be crucial, as it will determine the direction of the government. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of La France insoumise, is still in the running, but some are skeptical about his ability to unite the coalition.

**Surprise Election Outcome Sparks Political Uncertainty in France**
France is facing political uncertainty after a surprise victory by a left-wing coalition in the July 7 legislative election. The New Popular Front, National Rally, and President Macron's centrist alliance must navigate a fractured legislature. The New Popular Front is expected to secure between 171 and 205 seats, while National Rally is anticipated to secure between 130 and 152 seats. Macron's alliance is expected to secure between 152 and 180 seats. The parties have pledged to increase public expenditures significantly, with the New Popular Front's campaign pledges requiring roughly €179 billion annually. Macron has delayed any further decisions regarding the appointment of the next prime minister until the National Assembly's new configuration is established. France is now faced with two options: a coalition government or a technocratic administration. Both alternatives will likely result in a government that is less influential on the international stage and unable to enact significant legislation.

**QUOTES-French Political Leaders on How to Find a Government Majority**
After the French parliamentary election, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) will have the most lawmakers, followed by President Emmanuel Macron's centrists and the far-right National Rally (RN). Political leaders are discussing how to form a governing coalition, with some calling for Macron to officially call on the NFP to name a prime minister. Manuel Bompard, leader of France Unbowed, believes the President has a duty to summon a prime minister from the NFP. Yael Braun-Pivet, a senior centrist lawmaker and Macron ally, thinks the coalition is now necessary due to the will of the French people. Francois Bayrou, leader of the Centrist Modem Party, believes the path to a coalition is difficult but necessary, as the National Assembly cannot be dissolved before July 2025.

The New Popular Front, a French left-wing coalition, unexpectedly won the second and final round of France's snap elections on Sunday (7 July), surpassing Marine Le Pen's National Rally.

**French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal Resigns After Ultra-Right Victory**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced that he will resign after the victory of the ultra-right on the parliamentary elections. He stated, 'I say to the French: I respect each of you. Some people's lives are harder than others, and it is these lives that we must make better. Wherever I am, I will always strive to achieve this goal.' He is willing to stay in office until the approaching Olympic Games in Paris on July 26. 35-year-old Attal became the youngest head of the French government on January 9, 2024, previously serving as Minister of Education. During his appointment as Minister of the Interior, Gerald Darmanin called him 'the most Macronist among us.' According to the results of the second round of the snap parliamentary elections, the left-wing coalition New Popular Front received the most votes, ahead of the alliance of President Emmanuel Macron and the ultra-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. A survey by the company IFOP for TF1 predicts that the New Popular Front may receive 180-215 seats in parliament. An Ipsos survey for France TV forecasts 172-215 seats for the left-wing block. Macron's coalition may receive 150-180 seats in the lower house, and Le Pen's party - 120-150 mandates.

**New Popular Front Emerges as Dominant Force in French Legislative Elections**
The New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the dominant force in the French National Assembly in the recent legislative elections, held on July 7, 2024, according to various polls. The NFP obtained between 160 and 215 seats, while the Macronist block and the far-right of Marine Le Pen were relegated to second and third place, respectively. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the French radical left, demanded that President Emmanuel Macron appoint a prime minister from the left-wing alliance. He stated, 'The results confirm the defeat of the president and his coalition.' Gabriel Attal, the current prime minister, announced his resignation and expressed his willingness to lead the government provisionally due to the parliamentary deadlock. Olivier Faure, first secretary of the Socialist Party, warned that the party will not accept any coalition that betrays the French people's vote and prolongs Macron's policies. François Hollande, former socialist president, urged the left to show responsibility, as they do not have an absolute majority. He stated, 'The result gives us satisfaction because the extreme right has been relegated, but it also imposes a responsibility to implement the left's program.' The French political landscape is at a critical point, with the NFP as the dominant force, the Macronist block in second place, and the far-right in third place, posing a significant challenge to governance and policy implementation in a context of deep division.

**What is the left-wing NFP coalition, and who will be France's next prime minister?**
The New Popular Front (NFP), a left-wing coalition, has won the most seats in the French parliament and could provide France with its next prime minister. The coalition, comprising several parties, including the far-left France Unbowed party, the Socialist Party, and the green Ecologist party, campaigned on a platform of high public spending and has pledged to raise the minimum monthly wage and cap the price of essential goods. However, the coalition's economic policies have spooked financial markets and could tip France into economic chaos. The NFP's most prominent figure is Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a 72-year-old populist firebrand, who has been accused of antisemitism. The coalition will have to enter into another coalition with Macron's Ensemble party to pass laws, which may dilute some of its more radical spending policies.

**French Left-Wing Coalition to Designate Prime Minister Candidate This Week**
The French left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), will designate a prime minister candidate this week to govern without Emmanuel Macron's coalition. Olivier Faure, the Socialist Party's first secretary, emphasized that Macron must acknowledge his defeat in the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Faure refused to comment on who the prime minister candidate might be, but excluded Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insumisa (LFI), and stated that the candidate must be able to dialogue with the outside world. The NFP coalition, which includes LFI, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, became the first political block in the legislative elections with around 182 seats, far from the 289 needed for an absolute majority. The block of parties that supported Macron's outgoing government came in second with around 168 deputies, while Marine Le Pen's extreme right-wing party secured 143 seats. Manuel Bompard, an LFI deputy, emphasized that the NFP is the first political formation in the National Assembly and should govern. He also stated that the coalition will propose a method and a name for the prime minister to apply their program, as they must respect the word given to the electors. On the question of how they will implement their program without a majority to pass it in Parliament, Bompard recalled that Macron's outgoing government did not have an absolute majority. Olivier Faure noted that the reality of power will be in the Parliament and that they will likely have to find majorities text by text. He also called on the Macron camp to show responsibility and decide whether they are willing to unite their votes with the RN in the future to topple a NFP government through a censure motion.

Attal noted that the presidential coalition 'Together' received three times more parliamentary seats than predicted, and expressed confidence that the newly elected deputies will meet the expectations of the country. The second round of the parliamentary elections in France ended on July 7, with the left-wing 'New Popular Front' leading the polls, potentially gaining 175-205 seats, while the presidential coalition 'Together' is expected to get 150-175 seats, and the right-wing 'National Union' party 115-150 seats.

**Melenchon's coalition heads for shock victory in France**
Jean-Luc Melenchon's New Popular Front is expected to win the French elections, with Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble party coming in second and Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) in third place. Tactical voting to stop the RN seems to have worked, leading to a hung parliament. Macron must now negotiate with parties to form a coalition government. Melenchon has declared that the will of the people must be respected and that the program of the Popular Front will be implemented in its entirety. Gabriel Attal, the current prime minister, has announced his resignation. The left-wing bloc is forecast to take between 180 and 205 seats in the National Assembly, with Macron's party taking 165 to 175 seats and RN taking 130 to 145 seats.

**French left-wing alliance leads parliamentary race over far right**
A loose alliance of French left-wing parties, the New Popular Front (NFP), is on course to become the biggest parliamentary bloc and beat the far-right National Rally (RN) in the snap elections, according to projected results. The NFP, formed last month, is predicted to take between 172 and 215 seats, while the RN is expected to take 115 to 155 seats. The results mark a new high-water mark for the far-right but fall short of an absolute majority. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of France Unbowed, has called on Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to resign and said the left-wing coalition is ready to govern. The election campaign has been marked by a febrile national mood, threats and violence, and high turnout, with 61.4% of voters having turned out by 5:00 pm.

**France says 'no' to the far-right**
The New Popular Front, an alliance of French left-wing parties, won a majority of votes in the second round of the legislative elections, ahead of the alliance of Emmanuel Macron and the far-right National Rally. The participation rate was historically high, 67%. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the Unbowed France (LFI, left), exclaimed, 'It's a great relief.' The first results of the second round of the French legislative elections confirmed the victory of the left-wing parties, grouped in the New Popular Front. According to the first results, the NFP would have obtained between 172 and 192 seats in the National Assembly, ahead of Macron's alliance (between 150 and 170 seats) and the National Rally (far-right) of Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella (between 132 and 152 deputies). At 8pm local time, the French discovered the results of these elections that kept the country on edge for three weeks. France was suspended from the possibility of being governed by the far-right party, a big winner in the European elections and the first round of the French legislative elections, decided by Macron. 'We have avoided the worst,' said Olivier Faure, president of the French Socialist Party, who added that the goal now is to apply the government program presented by the NFP. France was suspended from these elections that opened the possibility of a far-right government for the first time in its history. In effect, the French president must now appoint a new prime minister from the ranks of the left-wing coalition. The problem is that this coalition is made up of several formations, including LFI, and Macron has rejected forming a government with this party. The next few days will be decisive for French politics. Macron must appoint a new prime minister, and this person will have the task of deciding on the ministers of his cabinet.

**Left-Wing New Popular Front Coalition Leads French Election, Polls Show**
The left-wing New Popular Front coalition won the most seats in the second round of French parliamentary elections, leading pollsters said on Sunday. This puts them on track for a surprise win over the far-right National Rally (RN) party but short of an absolute majority in parliament. Financial analysts are expecting a relief in the market, with some predicting a slight gap lower in French bond prices and higher yields. The real question is who will be running the country and who will be the next prime minister.

**Esquerda lidera em primeiras projeções para a Assembleia na França**
The first projections released by The Guardian indicate that the NFP (New Popular Front) is leading in the French National Assembly elections on Sunday (July 7, 2024). The left-wing coalition, formed to defeat the RN (National Rally) of the right, is expected to win around 192 seats. The centrist coalition of President Emmanuel Macron's party, Juntos, is in second place and is expected to elect between 150 and 170 deputies. Marine Le Pen's group had a result much below expectations in the first projections, with an expected 132-152 seats in the 577-seat Chamber of Deputies. To achieve a majority, 289 seats are needed in the National Assembly. The polls closed at 20:00 (15:00 Brasília time) on Sunday (July 7). The first numbers released by the British newspaper are from the Ipsos Institute, a multinational market research and consulting firm based in Paris.

**French Legislative Elections: Second Round Underway**
The second round of the French legislative elections is taking place on July 7, 2024, with over 2.4 million proxy votes active. The first round saw the National Rally (RN) win 33.1% of the votes, followed by the New Popular Front (NPF) with 28%, and the presidential coalition with 20%. The article provides updates on the voting process, including the opening of polling stations, the voting process, and the reactions of various politicians. It also addresses questions such as whether President Macron would be forced to appoint Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister if the RN wins a majority, and whether Macron could resign and run for president again.

**France Holds Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
France is holding the second round of parliamentary elections on July 7, 2024, after President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly following the European Parliament elections. The elections are being held under a majoritarian system, with the first round taking place on June 30. According to opinion polls, the far-right 'National Rally' party, led by Marine Le Pen, is likely to win a majority of seats, but may not have the absolute majority needed to form a government. The party has been criticized for its economic program, which is seen as left-wing, and its stance on migration and Ukraine. The left-wing coalition, led by the 'New Popular Front', is expected to come in second, while the centrist parties, including Macron's party, are likely to come in third. The outcome of the election will determine who will become the next Prime Minister of France.

**Columna de Gilles Vergnon: What could happen in France?**
The results of the first round of the French legislative elections on June 30th largely matched the predictions of polling agencies, which had anticipated the rise of the National Rally, which received over 33% of the votes. The results show a stark contrast between two Frances: one of the metropolises and their suburbs, which overwhelmingly voted for the left, and one of the countryside and medium-sized cities (the 'peripheral France' revealed by geographer Christophe Guilluy) which leads in 489 of the 577 constituencies. It is difficult to predict the results of the second round this Sunday. The rapid creation of the 'new Popular Front' by all left-wing parties, the calls from left-wing parties and the presidential party to withdraw any candidate opposing RN in the second round, will undoubtedly limit its advance and prevent it from achieving an absolute majority. However, the configuration of the new Parliament could lead to an ungovernable country without a clear majority. A coalition government between the left (without Mélenchon), the presidential party, and the right will quickly become paralyzed by its contradictions, and it is likely to return to the polls within a year. There are two questions. The first refers to the reason for the dissolution of President Macron, a decision taken without informing the prime minister, incomprehensible to all observers, and which raises the question of the scope of presidential powers. The second refers to the political and social polarization of the country. The RN is not a 'fascist' party, but populist and anti-liberal. However, it has managed to capture the majority of the working-class and popular vote outside of the big cities. Left-wing parties should reflect on their inability to win over this electorate and respond to their concerns about security and control of migration flows. Otherwise, a 'popular front without the people' has little future.

**France's 2024 Legislative Elections: How the Second Round Works**
The future of France will be decided on July 7, 2024, in the second round of the 2024 legislative elections. This election is considered the most significant since 1945, as a far-right party, led by Marine Le Pen, could potentially come to power. French President Emmanuel Macron called for an early election after his party's poor performance in the European elections. However, the early election did not yield the desired results. The legislative elections in France typically take place every five years in two rounds, with the second round taking place one week after the first. In the first round, the far-right party, National Rally (RN), won with 33.5% of the votes, followed by the left-wing coalition, New Popular Front (NFP), with 28.1%, and the centrist coalition, Together for the Republic, led by Macron, with 20.7%. The Republicans, the classical right, were eliminated from the second round. The French electoral system is complex, and the results are often decided in the second round. In this case, the left and the presidential bloc have joined forces to recompose the anti-Le Pen front. The New Popular Front and Together for the Republic have decided to withdraw their candidates in the constituencies where they came third in the first round to support other parties that are not from RN and have received more votes. This mechanism has been used in other elections to prevent the far-right from coming to power. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and Jordan Bardella, who is running for prime minister, are also trying to seek support to win a majority in the Parliament and form a government. The latest polls indicate that RN would win between 190 and 220 seats, far from the majority required to form a government.

**French Legislative Elections: National Rally in the Lead, Government Puts Unemployment Reform on Hold**
The first round of the French legislative elections has ended with the National Rally (RN) in the lead, followed by the New Popular Front (NFP) and the majority presidential coalition. The RN's leader, Jordan Bardella, could potentially become the next Prime Minister. The government has put on hold a controversial reform of the unemployment insurance system, and the price of gas is increasing by 11.7%. An extremely dangerous hurricane, Béryl, is threatening the Caribbean, and a series of wildfires has broken out in Greece. The Brevet exam, which is being reformed by the government, will be taken by nearly 860,000 students this week. France will face Belgium in the Euro 2024 quarterfinals.

**Far-Right Leader Jordan Bardella: 'I Will Be the Prime Minister of All French People'**
Jordan Bardella, leader of the French far-right party National Rally, stated that he will be the prime minister of all French people. He commented on the results of the early elections in France, saying that citizens responded to the call to vote with the highest level of electoral participation in the last 40 years. Bardella requested that voters remain mobilized for the second round on July 7. He also stated that the presidential majority has been abandoned by voters and is no longer able to win. The National Rally party obtained 34% of the votes, according to provisional results, while the New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, obtained 28.1%. The party of French President Emmanuel Macron came in third place, with 20.3% support. Thousands of French people mobilized across the country, with clashes between protesters and police in Nantes and Lyon, and a protest in Paris's Republic Square against the election results.

**French Presidential Coalition to Withdraw 60 Candidates from Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' in France has decided to withdraw around 60 candidates from the second round of parliamentary elections. According to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, this decision was made to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. 'We made this choice after the first round in more than 60 electoral districts. This will mean withdrawing our candidates, which would have led to the election of a National Union deputy against another candidate who, like us, would have defended the values of the republic', said Attal. In the first round of parliamentary elections, the right-wing party 'National Union' received 33% of the votes, while the left-wing 'New Popular Front' received 28.5%. The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' received 22%. The second round is scheduled for July 7.

**Polls are open in France's early legislative election**
France is holding an early parliamentary election on June 30 and July 7, which could bring the country's first far-right government since World War II. The election is highly uncertain, with three major political blocs competing: the far-right National Rally, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance, and the New Popular Front coalition. The outcome could impact European financial markets, Western support for Ukraine, and France's nuclear arsenal and global military force. National Rally president Jordan Bardella has said he would oppose sending French troops to Ukraine and refuse French deliveries of long-range missiles and other weaponry capable of striking targets within Russia. Meanwhile, in New Caledonia, a French Pacific territory, the top French official reported a higher turnout than in the 2022 parliamentary election.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.

**What Political Scenarios for July?**
The French political landscape will be put to the test. The first round of legislative elections will take place on June 30, 2024. If the National Rally or the New Popular Front wins, nothing is guaranteed for them. Once the result is known, the National Assembly must convene on the second Thursday following the election, as stipulated by Article 12 of the Constitution, which relates to the dissolution of the National Assembly. This will be on July 18. If Emmanuel Macron obtains an absolute majority, he can govern without hindrance. In the event of an absolute majority for the National Rally, a cohabitation with Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister would be inevitable. However, Macron, as President, has the right to refuse to appoint the Prime Minister proposed by the opposition, although this could lead to tensions and motions of censure. If the RN obtains a relative majority, Jordan Bardella has already announced that he would refuse the Prime Minister position, leading to a potential deadlock. Finally, without a clear majority, an apolitical technical government could be formed to manage current affairs. If instability persists, Macron could consider a new dissolution of the Assembly after a year or even his own resignation, although he has ruled out this option in the short term.

**German Chancellor Expresses Concern Over French Parliamentary Elections**
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed concern about the upcoming French parliamentary elections, as the far-right party, Agrupación Nacional, is leading in the polls. Scholz stated, 'I'm worried about the elections in France. I want to say it clearly. And I hope that the parties that are not Marine Le Pen's party will have success in the elections. But that will be decided by the French.' He emphasized that a new parliament with a majority of the far-right party would be a significant change. The elections are scheduled for June 30 and July 7, with Agrupación Nacional expected to win around 250-280 seats, close to the majority required. According to a recent survey, the party would gain 36% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (27%) and the center-right coalition supporting President Emmanuel Macron (20%). If these results hold, Jordan Bardella, the leader of Agrupación Nacional, would not seek the position of prime minister, as he promised not to do so without a majority.

**French Election: National Union and New Popular Front Neck and Neck**
A survey by Ipsos has shown that the gap between the right-wing National Union and the left-wing New Popular Front in France is narrowing. According to the survey, 31.5% of respondents plan to vote for the National Union in the first round of the parliamentary elections on June 30, while the New Popular Front has a rating of 29.5%. The presidential coalition is in third place with 19.5% support. If the National Union and its allies from the Republicans party are combined, they would receive 35.5% of the votes, while the New Popular Front, including support from non-participating left-wing parties, would receive 32%. Jordan Barrella, the leader of the National Union, believes that his party can win the election and come to power in a few days, saying, 'History is accelerating. We can win.' He is willing to take the post of Prime Minister if his party receives an absolute majority of votes. Marine Tondelle, one of the founders of the New Popular Front, believes that the presidential coalition cannot win the parliamentary elections, saying, 'The victory will be for the right or for us.' She thinks that the left has a chance to win, saying, 'We have a week to survive. We are ahead of the presidential coalition by 10 percentage points and are only a few points behind the National Union.'

Bruno Le Maire, representing the majority, criticized the programs of the New Popular Front and National Rally, calling them 'delirious'. Édouard Philippe, a former prime minister, advocated for a 'pro-business' policy, while Bruno Retailleau, of Les Républicains, warned that a radical change in the social model was necessary. The audience of business leaders seemed unconvinced or reassured by the presentations.

French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal presented his government program on Thursday, June 20, 2024, in Paris. Attal criticized the economic programs of his opponents, including the extreme right and the New Popular Front, saying they would lead to massive unemployment. He proposed reducing electricity bills for French households by 15% next winter, linking pensions to inflation to prevent them from losing purchasing power, and flexibilizing the inheritance tax. Attal also attacked the extreme right and the New Popular Front, saying their economic line would lead to massive unemployment. He emphasized the importance of a 'useful vote' and moderate social democracy to block the extreme right. The election will be held on June 30, 2024, with a second round on July 7, 2024, if necessary. Attal's government would prioritize the fight against fraud and the reduction of public debt. He also proposed a four-day workweek, which would allow employees who cannot work from home to have an additional day off. Additionally, Attal called for the creation of a 'national recovery' in France, with a focus on economic patriotism and a reduction in the wealth gap. The election is expected to be a close race, with the extreme right and the New Popular Front leading in the polls.

**French Government Promises to Boost Domestic Finances to Overcome Extremes**
The French government, led by President Macron, is promising to boost domestic finances to overcome the far-right and left-wing extremes. The upcoming legislative election will take place in two rounds, on June 30 and July 7. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal stated that the policies defended by the RN and the reformed left-wing coalition, known as the Popular Front, would lead to massive unemployment. 'We won't take a leap into the unknown, from a great height without a parachute', he said in a press conference. The RN and the Popular Front, at an event organized by the Medef, an employers' organization, presented themselves as responsible economic managers, seeking to refute Macron's attacks. Eric Coquerel, from the extreme-left party France Insubmissive, which represents the Popular Front, said that the extra spending promised by the block, such as reducing the retirement age, would be financed by stronger economic growth and higher tax revenues from the rich.

**Macron's Package of Measures to Improve Purchasing Power**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal presented a package of measures to improve purchasing power ahead of the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. The government aims to change the trend of polls that show the far-right party, National Rally, and the new Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, leading in the elections. Attal stated that the purchasing power will be central to the electoral program, with the slogan 'win more and spend less'. He announced that electricity bills will decrease by 15% starting next winter due to the European market reform obtained by the government. The government also plans to create a fund for middle and low-income households to renovate their homes, financed by a tax on stock purchases. Additionally, the government will increase the annual premium that companies can pay to their employees, from 3,000 euros to 10,000 euros. The government also promised to provide public health insurance for those who do not have private insurance, at a cost of one euro per day. Before announcing these measures, Attal criticized the two main opposition parties, National Rally and the Popular Front, saying 'we don't want the economic ruin they propose' and warning that 'the opposition offers us the gold and the morrow'.

**Left-Wing Parties Seal Deal on Government Program for Upcoming Elections**
The 'New Popular Front' has announced that it has reached an agreement on a government program to support 'unique candidatures' in the upcoming legislative elections on June 30 and July 7. The agreement was reached after four days of intense negotiations between the main left-wing parties. Olivier Faure, the first secretary of the Socialist Party, expressed relief and optimism, saying 'We have succeeded. A page of French history is being written.' Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the Insoumis, hailed the event as 'a significant political event in France.' The agreement includes the allocation of 229 seats to LFI, 175 to the PS, 92 to the Ecologists, and 50 to the PCF. The parties have also agreed on a clear program, including the qualification of crimes committed by Hamas in Israel and the liberation of hostages.
