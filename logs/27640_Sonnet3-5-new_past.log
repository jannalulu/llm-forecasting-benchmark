Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Multiple sources indicate a planned September 2024 blocking, including gazeta.ru citing sources close to presidential administration
2. YouTube has already been significantly slowed down (by 40-70%) since July 2024
3. Russia has blocked 207 Russian channels since 2020, with 83 in 2024 alone - showing escalating tensions
4. Alternatives like RuTube are being promoted actively
5. High-profile figures like Medvedev are publicly criticizing YouTube
6. Recent protests against YouTube show government preparing public opinion

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Kremlin spokesman Peskov explicitly denied plans to block YouTube on July 12, 2024
2. Deputy Anton Gorelkin stated no plans for "forced blocking" in August 2024
3. YouTube remains important for Russian propaganda and content creators
4. Previous predictions of YouTube blocking haven't materialized
5. Economic impact of blocking would be significant
6. Technical challenges in full blocking given VPN usage

Balancing Factors:
1. The timeline to October 1 is relatively short
2. Current slowdown could be testing public reaction
3. Pattern of gradual restrictions matches previous social media blocks
4. Russia has shown willingness to block major platforms (Facebook, Instagram)

Considering Recent Developments:
- August 2024 has seen increased slowdowns and technical issues
- Official statements are contradictory
- Protest activities suggest imminent changes
- Alternative platforms are being strengthened

Looking at the specific resolution criteria (Roskomnadzor blocklist), and considering the timeline to October 1, 2024, I assess that while full blocking is likely in the longer term, the compressed timeline reduces probability.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Question resolves for period between July 30 and October 1, 2024
- We're currently at August 27, 2024
- About 1 month left in the resolution window

2. Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
- Multiple reports indicate YouTube slowdowns already implemented
- Official statements about 70% speed reduction
- Government promoting alternative platforms like VK and RuTube
- Pattern of increasing restrictions on foreign social media
- Recent blocking of 83 Russian channels in 2024
- Independent media reports suggesting September 2024 blocking timeline
- Medvedev's recent critical statements about YouTube
- UK intelligence suggesting September 2024 blocking timeline

3. Key Evidence Against:
- Official Kremlin denials of plans to block YouTube
- Recent statements preferring slowdown over complete blocking
- Economic impact concerns of full blocking
- No viable domestic alternative fully ready
- Technical challenges of complete blocking
- YouTube's continued importance for Russian content creators

4. Specific Timeline Indicators:
- Multiple sources specifically mention September 2024
- Gradual degradation pattern observed through August
- Recent protests indicating imminent action

5. Pattern Analysis:
- Russia has previously blocked other Western platforms
- Typically implements restrictions gradually before full blocks
- Current actions follow historical pattern of incremental restrictions

Given the convergence of multiple sources on September timing, existing slowdowns, official rhetoric, and historical patterns, but balanced against official denials and practical challenges, I assess there's a significant but not overwhelming probability of blocking within the specified timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Multiple sources report plans for complete YouTube blocking by September 2024
2. Russian authorities have already begun slowing down YouTube speeds significantly (up to 70% reduction)
3. Increased restrictions on YouTube content, with 83 Russian channels blocked in 2024 alone
4. Officials like Kadyrov calling for complete shutdown
5. Development of domestic alternatives like RuTube
6. Historical precedent of Russia blocking other Western platforms (Facebook, Instagram)

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent explicit denials from Kremlin spokesperson Peskov about YouTube ban plans
2. Statement from Deputy Anton Gorelkin that blocking "is not being considered"
3. Economic impact concerns - YouTube remains highly popular with ~50% of Russians using it monthly
4. Technical challenges in implementing a complete ban
5. Potential public backlash, with some protests already occurring
6. YouTube's importance for Russian content creators and businesses

Balancing Factors:
1. Timeline is very specific (before October 1, 2024)
2. Current slowdown strategy suggests gradual approach rather than immediate ban
3. Pattern of Russian government denying plans before implementing restrictions
4. Multiple independent sources confirming September timeline
5. Increased technical preparations for potential blocking

Looking at the progression of events, there's a clear escalation in restrictions but also consistent official denials. The government appears to be testing public reaction through gradual deterioration of service. The specific timeline mentioned in multiple sources about September 2024 is particularly noteworthy.

Considering the explicit resolution criteria (Roskomnadzor blocklist), recent actions, and multiple corroborating sources about September plans, while accounting for official denials and potential implementation challenges:

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Multiple credible sources (Meduza, Gazeta.ru) report plans to block YouTube by September 2024, citing sources close to the presidential administration
2. Technical groundwork appears to be laid with widespread slowdowns reported since July 2024
3. Increasing government control over media/internet, with precedent of blocking other platforms (Facebook, Instagram)
4. YouTube has blocked 83 Russian channels in 2024 alone, escalating tensions
5. Recent laws restricting VPNs and alternative access methods
6. Strong statements from officials like Medvedev about YouTube's "hostile actions"

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Official Kremlin denials of plans to block YouTube (July 2024)
2. YouTube's large Russian user base (≈50% of population) makes blocking politically risky
3. No viable domestic alternative fully ready (RuTube lacks comparable content/features)
4. Government statements preferring "slowdown" approach over complete blocking
5. Previous predictions of YouTube blocking haven't materialized
6. Economic impact on content creators could create domestic pushback

Analysis:
The timeline until October 1, 2024 is relatively short (about 1 month). There's strong evidence of preparation for blocking through technical measures and legal framework. However, the Kremlin's recent explicit denials and preference for graduated pressure (slowdowns) suggest they may not take the final step of complete blocking before October 1.

The pattern of gradually increasing restrictions while maintaining deniability seems more likely than an abrupt block. The government appears to be building capacity for a block while keeping options open.

Weighing these factors and considering the specific timeframe:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 55.50%, with 45.50% being the most likely. Probability: 45.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:

- Source reports YouTube may be blocked by September 2024
- Mass slowdowns already implemented (40-70% speed reduction)
- Roskomnadzor demanding unblocking of 200+ Russian channels
- Increasing restrictions on VPNs that could bypass blocks

2. Pattern of escalating actions:
- 83 Russian channels blocked in 2024 alone
- YouTube labeled as conducting "terrorist activities" by Roskomnadzor
- New laws restricting bypass methods
- Shift of content to VK and RuTube

3. Official statements becoming more hostile:
- Medvedev calling YouTube "openly hostile"
- Kadyrov saying YouTube needs to be "shut down to hell"
- Multiple officials discussing blocking scenarios

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent official denials:
- Kremlin spokesman Peskov explicitly denied plans to block YouTube (July 2024)
- Deputy Gorelkin stated no plans for "forced blocking"
- Focus on slowdowns rather than complete blocks

2. Economic/practical considerations:
- YouTube remains highly popular (42.9% daily Russian users)
- No viable domestic alternative yet available
- Risk of public backlash (protests already occurring)

3. Historical pattern:
- Years of threats without following through
- Previous focus on regulation/slowdown rather than blocks
- Technical challenges of full implementation

The evidence suggests increasing likelihood of blocking, with concrete preparations and escalating actions. However, given:
1. The short timeframe (about 1 month)
