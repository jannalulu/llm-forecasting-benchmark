Okay, let's tackle this forecast systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Class**

*   **Reference Class:**  The question asks about the temperature in Phoenix for the entire month of December. A good starting point is to look at historical temperature data for Phoenix in December.  Unfortunately, I don't have access to that data directly. However, the articles mention that the *average* last 80-degree day is November 24th, implying that temperatures below 80 are the norm in December. This is our initial outside view: it is highly likely for the whole of December to stay below 80. However, the articles also report recent exceptions with 80 degree days extending into mid-December, meaning we cannot treat this as a certainty.
*   **Human Predictions:** I don't have access to specific forecasts on Metaculus, Polymarket or FiveThirtyEight for this precise question. However, weather forecasts in the articles provide some insight, and we'll use them.

**2. Break Down the Problem**

The core problem is whether there will be *any* day in December with a high temperature at or above 80°F. This means even one day reaching 80 degrees will resolve the question as "No". We need to consider factors that could cause an unusually warm day.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views**

*   **Outside View:** As mentioned earlier, the historical trend is for temperatures to be below 80 degrees in December. The articles state that the average last 80-degree day falls around November 24, though there are exceptions.
*   **Inside View (Specific Evidence):** Let's review the news articles.
    *   **La Niña:** There's a 60% chance of a weak La Niña pattern persisting through the winter, which is expected to bring *drier and cooler* conditions to Phoenix in November and December. This pushes us towards the 'below 80' outcome.
    *   **Recent Trends:** The articles note a recent heatwave, with record-breaking temperatures in September and October. However, this is clearly ending in late-October/early November, with cooler temperatures being discussed frequently in November.
    *   **Late 80s Last Year:** It is worth noting that the articles indicate that, last year, the Valley stayed in the 80s until *after* December 17. This raises the probability of an 80 degree day occurring in December.
    *   **Short-Term Forecasts:** The articles indicate cooler weather in late November and heading towards Thanksgiving. They also indicate that the average last 80-degree day is around November 24. Forecasts from November 23-25 indicate the highs were in the mid-70s and that a storm system is moving through bringing more cool weather.
    *   **Thanksgiving:** Multiple forecasts specifically mention that the weather will be pleasant in the mid-70s by Thanksgiving, indicating cooler temperatures.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting**

*   We should avoid anchoring too much on the historical average.  Last year's exception shows that December 80 degree days are possible.
*   The La Niña forecast is important but only a probability. We should not overreact to it; a 40% chance of not having the La Nina conditions suggests some chance of a return to slightly warmer weather.
*   We need to avoid over-adjusting based on the recent heatwave. The articles clearly indicate a change in pattern, with cooler weather becoming normal.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Cooling Forces:** La Niña, the typical seasonal drop in temperatures as winter approaches, storm systems moving through the region in November.
*   **Warming Forces:** Potential variability due to climate change and the possibility of a late-season warm spell, high-pressure systems building over the area. We know from last year, that such a late-season warm spell is possible in December, and as we're only at the start of December, this is a possibility we need to account for.

**6. Linear Extrapolation**

Extrapolating the recent cooling trend would suggest a high chance of temperatures staying below 80 in December. But, the historical variability, as well as the last year's event, should make us cautious of overconfidence.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

This problem allows for a good range of doubt. It's not a binary outcome with high certainty.  There is considerable weather variation in Phoenix.

**8. Confidence vs. Decisiveness**

I should be decisive in providing a prediction, but also express the uncertainty.  Last year's event provides a reason not to be overly confident of this 'below 80' outcome.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes**

*   **Hindsight bias:** If I had underestimated the chance of higher temperatures last year, I need to avoid that mistake this year, but not over-correct.
*   **Overconfidence in the norm:** The typical weather pattern should be a starting point, but we need to take into account the information of recent exceptions to the average.

**Balancing the Evidence**

The evidence strongly points towards temperatures remaining below 80 degrees for the entire month of December due to the La Nina weather pattern and the seasonal change in weather. However, the fact that the city has recorded 80+ degree temperatures until well into December last year suggests a small but tangible chance of a similar pattern occurring again this year. Moreover, there remains a 40% chance of the La Nina pattern not holding, which might make 80+ temps more likely. We must account for that possibility in our forecast.

**Final Probability Judgment**

Taking everything into account, I think the probability of Phoenix staying below 80 degrees for the *entire* month of December is more likely than not. But, given the unusual warm temperatures last year, we must reduce our confidence to account for possible exceptions. Therefore, I would give a slightly lower probability due to the past occurrence of an exception to the norm.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no relevant human predictions to triage for this specific weather-related question.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether Phoenix, AZ will stay below 80°F *every day* in December 2024. This can be broken into:
    *   Understanding historical temperature patterns for Phoenix in December.
    *   Analyzing current weather patterns and forecasts leading up to December 2024.
    *   Identifying potential factors that could lead to unusual warming trends.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** We know that Phoenix experiences cooler temperatures in December.  Historically, it's rare for *every* day of December to be above 80 degrees F. We should check historical data from the provided source to get an idea of how often this has happened in the past for Phoenix specifically. 
*   **Inside View:** We need to analyze the specific news and weather reports for the region leading up to the event.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   We need to avoid anchoring too heavily on recent news about record-breaking heat in the fall. These conditions will not likely persist. However, we shouldn't completely ignore these conditions.
*   We need to consider both the short-term forecasts and longer-term climate trends and consider their possible effects on this specific question.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Cooling Force:** The seasonal shift towards winter and the La Niña pattern is expected to bring cooler and drier conditions. We have seen a sharp drop in temperature recently and this is likely to continue.
*   **Warming Force:** The recent news articles highlight extreme heat events that occurred through much of the year, plus some indications that La Nina will be weak.
    *   The articles also mention the possibility of 80-degree days occurring into December.
*   We need to assess the relative strength of these opposing forces.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The short-term trend is for temperatures to cool into the mid-70s and lower, based on the articles from late November.
*   The long-term trend for the Phoenix area, given the weak La Nina, is for a drier and slightly cooler winter than the rest of the USA.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the variability in weather patterns, a binary "yes" or "no" is too definitive. We need to express a probability. We also need a range given that forecasts can change.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   We should be confident in the cooling trend given the seasonal shift.
*   We should be cautious of unusual weather anomalies due to the weak La Nina and the general climate change effects.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes and Hindsight Biases:**

*   Avoid being influenced by recent record heat events in October. That’s in the past.
*   We should have a record of all previous forecasts to check in order to avoid bias in the future.

**Analysis and Forecast:**

**Historical Data (Outside View):** I need to analyze historical data for Phoenix in December to determine the likelihood of the temperature remaining below 80°F for the entire month. However, I am unable to check that directly so I will use news articles as a substitute. The articles state that it is unusual for temperatures to be above 80 degrees F at this time of year and that the last 80 degree day typically occurs on November 24th. Last year, however, they continued into mid-December, so this is possible. The articles also mentioned that it has gotten down to below 20 degrees F before, showing how cold Phoenix can get.

**Current Weather and Forecasts (Inside View):**

*   The articles from late November show that the temperatures have dropped into the 70s in Phoenix. A storm system was forecast to bring temperatures into the mid-70s for the Thanksgiving period.
*   There is a weak La Niña pattern predicted for the winter that favors drier and slightly cooler conditions for Phoenix in November and December. This suggests the high temperatures are unlikely.
*   The articles mention that the average last 80-degree day is November 24th, but it was after December 17th last year. Therefore, there is some recent precedent for temperatures above 80 degrees F into December.
*   Phoenix experienced record-breaking heat throughout much of 2024, but this does not mean that the pattern will continue into December.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

While the historical data shows it's not impossible to have some days above 80F in December, it's rare for the *entire* month to be consistently that warm, particularly once we are into the third week of the month. The recent weather reports show temperatures dropping to the mid-70s in late November. La Niña is expected to bring cooler temperatures, making it less likely to see the entire month above 80F, but the fact that the pattern is weak makes this less certain. The articles did state that last year, 80 degree temperatures continued into mid-December. 
Given these factors, I think it's unlikely, but still a possibility, that every day of December will be below 80 degrees. Therefore, my probability range needs to lean toward "no", but with a fair bit of uncertainty.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 45.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.**

Okay, let's break down this forecasting challenge systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no direct human predictions for this specific question available in the provided context. Metaculus, Polymarket, and 538 are not included in the articles provided, which is the only source of data. Therefore, I will proceed without reference class predictions.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on whether *every* day in December 2024 in Phoenix will have a high temperature below 80°F. To assess this, we can consider:

*   **Historical Temperature Data:** What are typical December temperatures in Phoenix?
*   **Recent Trends:** Are temperatures trending warmer or cooler than usual?
*   **La Niña Influence:** The articles mention La Niña – how does it typically impact Phoenix temperatures?
*   **Current Weather Patterns:** What are the short-term and mid-term weather forecasts leading up to December?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  I don't have specific historical data readily available for December's daily high temperatures in Phoenix but the articles do provide some information. For example, one news article says 'Typically, the last 80-degree day of the year falls around November 24, but last year, we held on to those warm temperatures until after December 17.'  The average last 80 degree day is November 24 according to one article. This suggests that temperatures below 80 in December are quite common, but not guaranteed. The article also states that 'last year the Valley stayed in the 80s until after December 17.'
*   **Inside View (Specific Details):** We need to assess the news articles for specific clues about this coming December.

**4. Under- vs. Over-Reacting:**

The key is to avoid being overly swayed by recent anomalies while still acknowledging that the weather is dynamic.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Cooling Trends:** The transition to winter naturally brings cooler temperatures. The articles note several times that cold fronts can move in and drop temperatures significantly. La Niña *generally* brings cooler temperatures to the area.
*   **Warming Trends:** Climate change and high-pressure systems are pushing temperatures higher. One article stated 'Typically, the last 80-degree day of the year falls around November 24, but last year, we held on to those warm temperatures until after December 17.' Another article states 'The average last 80-degree day is November 24, but last year the Valley stayed in the 80s until after December 17.' It has been suggested that there is a decent probability of another 80-degree day in Phoenix before December. One article notes that Phoenix has broken records for heat in 2024, so there is some reason to believe that trend could continue.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

I need to be cautious here.  While the most recent articles indicate a cooling trend into the 70s by late November, it is a mistake to assume that that linear trend would continue for the entire month of December.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I'll use a fairly narrow probability range here as it is the temperature in December, which is very likely to have highs below 80. I will use two decimal places, per the instructions.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

I'll err slightly on the side of caution, acknowledging the possibility of a late heatwave or unseasonably warm day. However, the evidence strongly suggests that below 80-degree highs are very likely during the entire month of December. The forecast data shows that the area will be in the 70s around Thanksgiving and the general trend is a cooling trend over the coming weeks as winter approaches.

**9. Errors & Hindsight:**

I'll need to check back to see if I relied too heavily on the La Niña prediction or if I underestimated any late-season heat potential.

**Analysis:**

The news articles suggest a strong likelihood of daily highs below 80 degrees in December. The following are some specific data from the news articles.
*   La Niña is expected to bring cooler and drier conditions, especially in November and December.
*   The average last 80-degree day is November 24th.
*   However, last year saw temperatures in the 80s until after December 17th, so it is possible for temperatures to reach 80 degrees in December.
*   There is a cooling trend expected to continue into late November.
*   While 2024 has been a record-breaking year for heat, this is expected to change as winter approaches.
*   There is no indication that any warm conditions will stick around for long over the next couple of months.
*   The most recent forecast (November 24th) states that it's likely the Valley will get one more 80 degree day soon, but it is unlikely that temperatures will remain at those levels.

The evidence suggests that temperatures below 80 degrees in the entire month of December is likely, but not guaranteed. I will account for a small chance of a heat spike during December and put the most likely value near to 90%.

My Prediction: Between 84.00% and 94.00%, but 89.00% being the most likely. Probability: 89.00%.

*   There is no indication that any warm conditions will stick around for long over the next couple of months.
*   The most recent forecast (November 24th) states that it's likely the Valley will get one more 80 degree day soon, but it is unlikely that temperatures will remain at those levels.

The evidence suggests that temperatures below 80 degrees in the entire month of December is likely, but not guaranteed. I will account for a small chance of a heat spike during December and put the most likely value near to 90%.

My Prediction: Between 84.00% and 94.00%, but 89.00% being the most likely. Probability: 89.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecast using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I haven't found any direct, relevant predictions on this specific question from other superforecasters or platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I need to rely more on my own analysis.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Historical Temperature Data:** What are typical temperatures in Phoenix in December? We need to understand the baseline.
*   **Recent Trends:** Are there any recent trends that suggest a shift from the historical norm (e.g., climate change, La Niña effects)?
*   **Short-Term Weather Forecasts:** What are the forecasts leading up to December and how might they influence December's weather?
*   **Specific Event:** Will the temperature stay *below* 80 degrees *every single day* in December? This is a crucial distinction.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** I'll need to find historical temperature data for Phoenix in December. This will give me a base rate of how often December temperatures stay below 80 degrees for the entire month.
*   **Inside View (Specific Information):** Then, I'll examine the news articles, La Niña predictions, and specific trends leading up to December to adjust from that base rate.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I'll be cautious about overreacting to short-term weather forecasts. They are often unreliable beyond a few days. However, I'll also try not to completely ignore them.
*   La Niña is a relevant factor. I will not over or under estimate its impact.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Cooling Forces:** December is typically a cooler month, and La Niña conditions are expected to bring cooler and drier conditions.
*   **Warming Forces:** Climate change is causing higher average temperatures and more extreme heat events, as evidenced by the record heat seen in Phoenix throughout 2024, so there might be some counteracting forces.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The articles suggest a cooling trend into November, but with some variability and some warmer days possible. La Niña is expected to bring cooler temperatures, and this could influence December.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I'll aim to express my uncertainty using a probability range, recognising that weather patterns have inherent variability.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I'll strive to be both prudent in considering that weather is hard to forecast and decisive based on the best evidence.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

* I'm not making any predictions for this question now so I cannot review previous mistakes. However, I will ensure that my analysis will not over or under estimate the different inputs that influence my final probability.

**Analysis:**

*   **Historical Data:**  (I cannot provide the exact historical data here, but in a real forecasting scenario, this is where I would research typical temperature ranges in Phoenix in December using historical weather records for the Sky Harbor Airport weather station). Based on general knowledge, Phoenix does usually drop below 80F for the majority of the days in December. However, temperatures can fluctuate, with some days reaching the 70s and some dropping into the 60s and even 50s. I would also be checking to see the average number of days with highs at 80 or above for December. It is not expected to be zero.
*   **Recent Trends:** The articles repeatedly emphasize the record-breaking heat in Phoenix during 2024 and especially the summer and autumn.  They also mention that the "average last 80-degree day is November 24, but last year the Valley stayed in the 80s until after December 17." This suggests a tendency for heat to persist later into the year.  This will push down my probabilities for a cool December.
*   **La Niña:**  The La Niña forecast for drier and cooler conditions in November and December does support the possibility of cooler temperatures. However, it's described as "weak," suggesting it might not have a strong effect and given how late the current heatwaves are, may not be strong enough to drop temperatures sufficiently.
*   **Short-Term Forecasts:** The forecasts leading up to December point towards a cooling trend, with some fluctuations and occasional warm spells in the mid-70s to low 80s. It seems likely that temperatures will be below 80 for a good portion of the latter half of November, but December is still too far out to say with any certainty.
*   **Specific Event:** This is the most important consideration. The question requires *every single day* of December to be below 80. This makes it significantly harder for the question to resolve as "Yes." Even with a general trend of cooler weather, the risk of one or two days with highs of 80 or above will bring the probabilities down significantly.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

*   The historical data suggests cooler temperatures in December.
*   The strong trend in 2024 towards record-breaking heat, continuing later into the year, is a strong counter-argument. The fact that last year the 80s persisted until after December 17th is a major factor.
*   The weak La Niña prediction nudges the probability slightly in the direction of cooler temps but is not a major factor.
*   The need for *every* day to be below 80F is the most crucial factor and decreases the chances of success.

**Conclusion and Probability:**

Given the above factors, I believe that the chances of Phoenix remaining below 80 degrees for the *entire* month of December 2024 are lower than would be expected on a normal year. While December is usually cooler, the record heat this year, the fact that the 80s persisted in December last year, and the fact that only one high temperature above 80 would make the question resolve as 'No', I have decided to decrease my original base rate.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

2024-12-11 14:25:28,699 - INFO - Run 4:
Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to specific human predictions for this precise question (temperature below 80F for the entire month of December in Phoenix 2024). Weather forecasting is a fairly specific prediction task that often uses advanced models and algorithms so there's not going to be a readily available Metaculus-style market prediction for this.
*   However, I can use the news articles provided to gauge human expectations for the near-term weather and to assess how unusual any forecast for a full month of temps below 80F would be.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether *every single day* in December 2024 in Phoenix will have a high temperature below 80°F. This requires analysing the likelihood of that occurring for each day and then thinking about them as a sequence of events. I will break this into the following sub-problems:
*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical frequency of daily high temperatures below 80°F in Phoenix during December?
*   **Recent Trends:** What do recent weather patterns and forecasts suggest about the likelihood of an unusually cold December this year?
*   **Specific Forecasts:** Are there any specific predictions in the news for December 2024 temperatures in Phoenix? What do the news stories say about the probability of a string of cooler days, and about the risks of a brief return to warmer conditions?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** I will start by considering historical temperature data for December in Phoenix. Unfortunately, I don't have that specific historical data at hand. However, I can use the provided articles to get a sense of base rates by using phrases like "Typically the last 80 degree day falls around November 24" and "Last year the Valley stayed in the 80s until after December 17". This suggests that a full December below 80F would be atypical, however, it is possible. Without exact climate records I cannot precisely quantify the historic frequency of this event, so this suggests a low initial probability.
*   **Inside View (Unique Circumstances):** I will examine the news articles for information specific to the current weather patterns. The strongest evidence will likely come from forecasts that are specifically for Phoenix in late November/December, and that discuss any relevant climate patterns.

**4. Under- vs. Over-Reacting to Evidence:**
*   I need to avoid simply extrapolating recent short-term trends. The news articles show fluctuating temperatures and the risk of being overconfident about either recent warming or recent cooling trends.
*   I should avoid over-adjusting based on a single weather system. Rather, look for indications of a longer-term trend.
*   I need to consider the risk of a brief warm spell in the month.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Cooling Forces:** The approaching winter and any La Niña effects would push temperatures down. This is partially offset by the fact that the Phoenix area is used to higher temperatures so a 'cool' temperature is still quite high for many other regions of the world.
*   **Warming Forces:** High-pressure systems could bring warmer temperatures, as could the continued effect of climate change. Even though La Nina is expected, this is only a 'weak' La Nina which means it might not be too influential.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The current trend is for fluctuating temperatures with a slow decline into winter, this suggests that the probability of a fully below 80F December is low, as a few days even above 80 is enough to make the answer to this question 'No'.
*   I should avoid simple linear extrapolation and focus on the balance of the evidence.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I should not provide a precise probability, rather a range, as there is much uncertainty surrounding weather forecasts. However, I also need to avoid being overly vague, hence the need for the most-likely probability, in addition to the range.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I should be conservative with any extreme probabilities and be sure to include both the risk of warmer temperatures in Phoenix, while also recognising the possibility for colder temperatures.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I need to be aware of my hindsight biases and to recognise that even if I can find a pattern in the past, that this doesn't necessarily mean the future will follow that pattern.
*   After resolution, I will analyse where my forecast went wrong by examining the daily temperatures during December 2024 as well as any additional weather forecasts made, that could have changed my mind.

**Analysis of the News Articles:**

*   **La Niña:** Several articles mention a weak La Niña pattern, which is expected to bring drier and *cooler* conditions to Phoenix in November and December. However, these forecasts also suggest the cool stretch may not last long and temperatures may return to the mid-90s at times.
*   **Late November Cooling:** Articles from late November 2024 suggest a cool down is underway, with temperatures reaching the mid-70s. However, this also discusses the possibility of Phoenix reaching 80F again in the coming days and in the recent past temperatures have stayed in the 80s until after December 17th.
*   **Fluctuating Temperatures:** There are numerous mentions of temperature fluctuations with highs going up and down and a trend towards cooler weather in late October and into November. This means it is not a linear process towards cooler weather, and that there's still a chance of warmer weather periods even in December.
*   **Record Heat:** Phoenix experienced record-breaking heat in 2024 with many days over 100F or 110F. This shows the risk of warmer conditions continuing even into what are usually the cooler months.
*   **Drought:** The ongoing drought is mentioned in several articles, as is the lack of rainfall. This suggests that even if temperatures go down, there is no indication that cooler weather is going to bring more rain.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The articles highlight the possibility of a cooler December due to La Niña, but also the risk of high-pressure systems and the recent history of warm weather extending into late December. The news articles also indicate that the weather fluctuates a lot with many ups and downs, and the fact that last year temperatures stayed in the 80s until after December 17. The historical base rates also suggest that a whole month below 80 degrees would be atypical. All of these point towards a low probability of every day in December staying below 80F. I will reduce the probability from a theoretical maximum of 99% down to my current estimate. I have a lot of uncertainty but as I have analysed this thoroughly, I will be confident that the most likely outcome is close to the central probability.

**Forecast:**

Based on the above analysis, I believe that it's more likely than not that there will be at least one day in December with a high temperature of 80 degrees or more.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to specific human predictions for this precise question (temperature below 80F for the entire month of December in Phoenix 2024). Weather forecasting is a fairly specific prediction task that often uses advanced models and algorithms so there's not going to be a readily available Metaculus-style market prediction for this.
*   However, I can use the news articles provided to gauge human expectations for the near-term weather and to assess how unusual any forecast for a full month of temps below 80F would be.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether *every single day* in December 2024 in Phoenix will have a high temperature below 80°F. This requires analysing the likelihood of that occurring for each day and then thinking about them as a sequence of events. I will break this into the following sub-problems:
*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical frequency of daily high temperatures below 80°F in Phoenix during December?
*   **Recent Trends:** What do recent weather patterns and forecasts suggest about the likelihood of an unusually cold December this year?
*   **Specific Forecasts:** Are there any specific predictions in the news for December 2024 temperatures in Phoenix? What do the news stories say about the probability of a string of cooler days, and about the risks of a brief return to warmer conditions?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** I will start by considering historical temperature data for December in Phoenix. Unfortunately, I don't have that specific historical data at hand. However, I can use the provided articles to get a sense of base rates by using phrases like "Typically the last 80 degree day falls around November 24" and "Last year the Valley stayed in the 80s until after December 17". This suggests that a full December below 80F would be atypical, however, it is possible. Without exact climate records I cannot precisely quantify the historic frequency of this event, so this suggests a low initial probability.
*   **Inside View (Unique Circumstances):** I will examine the news articles for information specific to the current weather patterns. The strongest evidence will likely come from forecasts that are specifically for Phoenix in late November/December, and that discuss any relevant climate patterns.

**4. Under- vs. Over-Reacting to Evidence:**
*   I need to avoid simply extrapolating recent short-term trends. The news articles show fluctuating temperatures and the risk of being overconfident about either recent warming or recent cooling trends.
*   I should avoid over-adjusting based on a single weather system. Rather, look for indications of a longer-term trend.
*   I need to consider the risk of a brief warm spell in the month.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Cooling Forces:** The approaching winter and any La Niña effects would push temperatures down. This is partially offset by the fact that the Phoenix area is used to higher temperatures so a 'cool' temperature is still quite high for many other regions of the world.
*   **Warming Forces:** High-pressure systems could bring warmer temperatures, as could the continued effect of climate change. Even though La Nina is expected, this is only a 'weak' La Nina which means it might not be too influential.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The current trend is for fluctuating temperatures with a slow decline into winter, this suggests that the probability of a fully below 80F December is low, as a few days even above 80 is enough to make the answer to this question 'No'.
*   I should avoid simple linear extrapolation and focus on the balance of the evidence.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I should not provide a precise probability, rather a range, as there is much uncertainty surrounding weather forecasts. However, I also need to avoid being overly vague, hence the need for the most-likely probability, in addition to the range.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I should be conservative with any extreme probabilities and be sure to include both the risk of warmer temperatures in Phoenix, while also recognising the possibility for colder temperatures.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I need to be aware of my hindsight biases and to recognise that even if I can find a pattern in the past, that this doesn't necessarily mean the future will follow that pattern.
*   After resolution, I will analyse where my forecast went wrong by examining the daily temperatures during December 2024 as well as any additional weather forecasts made, that could have changed my mind.

**Analysis of the News Articles:**

*   **La Niña:** Several articles mention a weak La Niña pattern, which is expected to bring drier and *cooler* conditions to Phoenix in November and December. However, these forecasts also suggest the cool stretch may not last long and temperatures may return to the mid-90s at times.
*   **Late November Cooling:** Articles from late November 2024 suggest a cool down is underway, with temperatures reaching the mid-70s. However, this also discusses the possibility of Phoenix reaching 80F again in the coming days and in the recent past temperatures have stayed in the 80s until after December 17th.
*   **Fluctuating Temperatures:** There are numerous mentions of temperature fluctuations with highs going up and down and a trend towards cooler weather in late October and into November. This means it is not a linear process towards cooler weather, and that there's still a chance of warmer weather periods even in December.
*   **Record Heat:** Phoenix experienced record-breaking heat in 2024 with many days over 100F or 110F. This shows the risk of warmer conditions continuing even into what are usually the cooler months.
*   **Drought:** The ongoing drought is mentioned in several articles, as is the lack of rainfall. This suggests that even if temperatures go down, there is no indication that cooler weather is going to bring more rain.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

The articles highlight the possibility of a cooler December due to La Niña, but also the risk of high-pressure systems and the recent history of warm weather extending into late December. The news articles also indicate that the weather fluctuates a lot with many ups and downs, and the fact that last year temperatures stayed in the 80s until after December 17.
