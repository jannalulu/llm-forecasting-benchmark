I'll break this down systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
- First comprehensive LLM-enabled cyberattack research emerges in 2024
- Multiple articles document increasing AI/LLM cybersecurity risks
- Specific articles show proof-of-concept attacks using ChatGPT/LLMs

Key Evidence for Higher Probability:
1. Researchers demonstrating virus using ChatGPT to write human-like emails
2. LLM agents autonomously exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities
3. 90% of cyber threats now involve social engineering
4. OpenAI admits systems used for malicious phishing campaigns
5. Increasing sophistication of AI-powered attack techniques

Mitigating Factors:
1. Cybersecurity defenses are actively adapting
2. Many attacks still require human intervention
3. Detection technologies improving

Quantitative Considerations:
- Increasing trend suggests higher likelihood
- Specific techniques for LLM-based attacks emerging
- Concrete proof-of-concept attacks already demonstrated

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base probability of major cyberattack: ~20-30%
- LLM-specific enhancement: +15-25%
- Temporal constraint (before Sept 30, 2024): Slight reduction

Balancing these factors carefully, considering both potential and constraints:

My Prediction: Between 35.40% and 52.70%, but 44.30% being the most likely. Probability: 44.30%.
