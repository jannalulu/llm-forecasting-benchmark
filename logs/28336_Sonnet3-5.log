To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the key evidence and then analyze it using superforecasting principles:

Key Evidence:
1. Tom Iseghohi was initially a candidate for the Action Alliance (AA) party.
2. On September 16, 2024, multiple sources reported that Iseghohi stepped down from the race and endorsed the APC candidate Monday Okpebholo.
3. The election was held on September 21, 2024, as scheduled.
4. As of the latest news articles (dated September 19, 2024), Iseghohi was not listed as one of the main contenders for the election.
5. The main candidates mentioned were Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (LP).

Analysis:
1. Triage: There are no readily available predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus for this specific election.

2. Breaking down the problem: The key question is whether Iseghohi could have won despite withdrawing from the race.

3. Inside vs. outside view: The outside view suggests that candidates who officially withdraw from an election very rarely win. The inside view confirms this, as there's no evidence of Iseghohi continuing his campaign after withdrawing.

4. Reacting to evidence: The multiple, consistent reports of Iseghohi's withdrawal provide strong evidence that he was not a contender in the election.

5. Clashing causal forces: There are no apparent forces pushing for Iseghohi's victory after his withdrawal.

6. Extrapolating trends: The trend of Iseghohi's non-participation continued up to the election date.

7. Degrees of doubt: Given the clear evidence of withdrawal and lack of any contradictory information, there's very little doubt about Iseghohi's non-participation.

8. Confidence balance: While it's theoretically possible for unforeseen circumstances to lead to an unexpected victory, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests this did not happen.

9. Learning from mistakes: In this case, there's no clear prior mistake to learn from, but it's important to remain open to the possibility of highly unlikely events.

Given this analysis, I can conclude with high confidence that Prince Tom Iseghohi did not win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election. The probability of his victory is extremely low, approaching zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Election date: The election is scheduled for September 21, 2024, which has already passed. This is crucial information.

2. Candidate status: Multiple news articles from September 16, 2024 report that Prince Tom Iseghohi-Okojie, the Action Alliance (AA) candidate, withdrew from the race and endorsed Senator Monday Okpebholo of the All Progressives Congress (APC). This occurred just days before the election.

3. Main contenders: After Iseghohi's withdrawal, the main candidates were reported to be Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (Labour Party).

4. Election results: There are no reports in the provided articles about the final election results or a declared winner.

5. Resolution criteria: The question resolves as "Yes" if Prince Tom Iseghohi is declared the next governor of Edo State based on the September 21, 2024 election results.

Given these factors, we can conclude:

1. Prince Tom Iseghohi was not a candidate in the election, having withdrawn days before.
2. As a non-candidate, it is virtually impossible for him to have won the election.
3. The resolution criteria specifically require him to be declared the winner for a "Yes" resolution.

The only extremely unlikely scenario where he could win would be if there was some sort of extraordinary legal challenge that nullified the election results and somehow reinstated him as a candidate and winner. However, there's no evidence of such an occurrence, and it would be exceedingly improbable.

Given the clear evidence that Iseghohi withdrew from the race before the election, and the lack of any information suggesting an extraordinary scenario where he could have won, the probability of him winning is effectively zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

After carefully reviewing the available information, here is my analysis and forecast:

Key factors to consider:

1. Prince Tom Iseghohi was initially a candidate for the Action Alliance (AA) party, but withdrew from the race on September 16, 2024 and endorsed the APC candidate Monday Okpebholo. This effectively removes him from contention to win the election.

2. The main contenders appear to be Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (Labour Party). 

3. The incumbent PDP governor Godwin Obaseki is term-limited and not running, which could reduce any incumbency advantage for the PDP.

4. There are allegations of potential electoral manipulation and violence from multiple sides, creating uncertainty about the fairness of the process.

5. Predictions from various sources seem to favor either the PDP or APC candidate, with less mention of the Labour Party candidate's chances.

6. The APC controls the federal government, which some argue could give them an advantage, though others dispute this.

Given that Prince Tom Iseghohi withdrew from the race over a month before the election and endorsed another candidate, there is essentially no chance he could win. Even if he had remained in the race, as a minor party candidate he would have been a long shot.

The only extremely unlikely scenario where he could potentially win would be if the election was somehow invalidated or postponed and he re-entered the race. However, there is no indication of this possibility in any of the recent news articles.

Therefore, I assess the probability of Prince Tom Iseghohi winning the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election to be effectively zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

Based on the information provided and analyzing the situation, here are the key factors I considered:

1. Prince Tom Iseghohi was initially running as the Action Alliance (AA) candidate, but multiple sources confirm he withdrew from the race on September 16, 2024, and endorsed the APC candidate Monday Okpebholo.

2. The main contenders appear to be Asue Ighodalo (PDP), Monday Okpebholo (APC), and Olumide Akpata (Labour Party).

3. There's significant political tension and accusations of potential rigging from both major parties (PDP and APC).

4. The incumbent governor Obaseki (PDP) is term-limited, which could reduce any incumbent party advantage.

5. The APC is expressing confidence in winning, with the party's national chairman predicting victory.

6. There are concerns about potential violence and electoral malpractices.

7. No reliable polling data was provided to gauge public sentiment accurately.

Given that Prince Tom Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate, it is virtually impossible for him to win the election.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key factors and examine the available evidence:

1. Candidate viability: 
Prince Tom Iseghohi was initially listed as a candidate for the Action Alliance party. However, multiple news articles from September 16, 2024 report that he stepped down from the race and endorsed the APC candidate Monday Okpebholo. This is a critical piece of information that essentially eliminates his chances of winning.

2. Main contenders:
The articles consistently mention three main candidates:
- Asue Ighodalo (PDP)
- Monday Okpebholo (APC)
- Olumide Akpata (Labour Party)

3. Political landscape:
- The incumbent PDP governor Obaseki is term-limited and supporting Ighodalo.
- The APC, led by former governor Oshiomhole, is trying to regain control of the state.
- The Labour Party had success in Edo during the 2023 presidential election.

4. Campaigning and support:
- Ighodalo seems to have strong establishment support within the PDP.
- Okpebholo has gained additional support from Iseghohi's endorsement.
- Akpata is leveraging his legal background and multi-lingual appeal.

5. Potential for electoral manipulation:
Several articles mention concerns about potential rigging or violence, which adds uncertainty to the outcome.

6. Predictions and endorsements:
- Some religious leaders have made predictions, but these are not based on empirical evidence.
- There are conflicting claims of support and momentum from different parties.

Given that Prince Tom Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race and endorsed another candidate, his chances of winning are effectively zero. Even if he hadn't withdrawn, as a minor party candidate he would have been a long shot.

The only scenarios where Iseghohi could possibly win would be if:
1. The news of his withdrawal was false or he re-entered the race (extremely unlikely given multiple corroborating reports).
2. There was a massive write-in campaign for him (virtually unheard of in Nigerian elections).
3. Some kind of unprecedented legal challenge invalidated all other candidates (extremely improbable).

All of these scenarios are so unlikely as to be nearly impossible.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

All of these scenarios are so unlikely as to be nearly impossible.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.
