Let me analyze this methodically:

Key factors supporting higher probability:
1. Active US-Saudi negotiations for a defense agreement linked to Israel normalization are ongoing, with recent WSJ reports indicating progress
2. Biden administration is pushing hard to achieve this diplomatic win before US elections
3. Saudi Arabia has shown openness to normalization if conditions are met
4. There are strong strategic interests for all parties (US, Saudi Arabia, Israel)
5. We have 2 months until the deadline

Key factors supporting lower probability:
1. Saudi Arabia's firm public stance requiring Palestinian state recognition and Gaza ceasefire
2. Netanyahu's government strongly opposes Palestinian statehood
3. Most recent statements (July 2024) from Saudi ambassador to UK reaffirming no normalization without Palestinian state
4. Recent reports suggest deal unlikely before US elections
5. Growing Saudi-Iran relationship could complicate normalization
6. Complex requirements including US Senate approval make quick deal difficult

Analysis:
- The window is very tight (2 months)
- Multiple challenging preconditions need alignment
- Recent official statements suggest positions are hardening
- War in Gaza continues to be major obstacle
- Netanyahu's government instability adds uncertainty

The deadline being so close with major obstacles still unresolved makes this unlikely in this timeframe, though not impossible. Recent statements from both sides suggest positions have if anything hardened. While there's clear interest from all parties, the complexities and preconditions make this very difficult to achieve in just 2 months.

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 15.50%, with 10.50% being the most likely. Probability: 10.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline: We need to predict whether this will happen by September 30, 2024 - about 2 months from now.

2. Recent Strong Evidence FOR:
- US and Saudi Arabia are reportedly close to signing a defense agreement (multiple June 2024 reports)
- Biden confirmed Saudi Arabia wants to recognize Israel (July 2024)
- US actively working on a three-way deal including security guarantees and nuclear program support
- High-ranking Israeli source stated agreement possible before US elections (July 26, 2024)

3. Recent Strong Evidence AGAINST:
- Saudi ambassador to UK explicitly stated (June 20, 2024) they won't normalize without Palestinian state recognition
- Netanyahu strongly opposes Palestinian state recognition
- Recent news (July 12-14, 2024) suggests deal unlikely before US elections
- Israel-Gaza conflict continues to be a major obstacle

4. Key Conditions Required:
- Palestinian state commitment from Israel
- End or significant de-escalation of Gaza conflict
- US Senate approval of defense agreement (needs 2/3 majority)

5. Critical Analysis:
- Time pressure from US elections creates incentive to move quickly
- But multiple complex conditions make 2-month timeline very challenging
- Saudi position appears firm on Palestinian state requirement
- Netanyahu government unlikely to make required concessions
- Recent statements from officials increasingly pessimistic about near-term deal

Given the very short timeframe (2 months), multiple required conditions that seem unlikely to be met quickly, and recent official statements suggesting delays, the probability appears quite low. However, intense US pressure and potential strategic benefits keep it from being near-zero.

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 15.50%, with 10.50% being the most likely. Probability: 10.50%

Let me analyze this methodically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Active US-Saudi negotiations for a defense agreement explicitly linked to Israel normalization
2. Biden administration pushing hard for a deal before US elections
3. Recent statements by Biden about Saudi Arabia wanting to recognize Israel
4. Strategic benefits for all parties (US, Saudi Arabia, Israel)
5. Precedent of Abraham Accords showing such deals are possible

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Latest news (July 2024) from Saudi ambassador to UK firmly stating no normalization without Palestinian state
2. Netanyahu government's strong opposition to Palestinian statehood
3. Multiple recent sources indicating deal unlikely before US elections
4. Ongoing Gaza conflict complicating negotiations
5. Saudi requirement for Palestinian state recognition which Israel refuses
6. Short timeframe (only 2 months until September 30)

Additional Considerations:
- Saudi Arabia has consistently maintained position on Palestinian state requirement
- Recent strengthening of Saudi-Iran relations may complicate Israel normalization
- Complex requirements including US defense treaty needing Senate approval

The most recent authoritative statements (Saudi ambassador, July 2024) strongly indicate Saudi Arabia will not compromise on Palestinian state requirement. With Netanyahu's government opposed to this and limited time remaining, probability appears low.

However, rapid diplomatic breakthroughs are possible, and there's clear motivation from US administration to achieve this.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.80%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Active US-Saudi negotiations for a defense agreement are ongoing, with recent reports from WSJ indicating progress
2. Biden administration is pushing hard for normalization before US elections
3. Saudi Crown Prince has shown openness to normalization with specific conditions
4. There are strong strategic interests for all parties (US, Saudi Arabia, Israel)
5. A high-ranking Israeli source stated in July 2024 that agreement is still possible before US elections

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Saudi Arabia has firmly stated (June 20, 2024) it won't normalize without Palestinian state recognition
2. Netanyahu strongly opposes Palestinian statehood, a key Saudi condition
3. The Gaza war continues with no immediate end in sight
4. Multiple recent sources indicate normalization unlikely before US elections
5. Time constraint - only about 2 months remain until deadline
6. Saudi-Iran relations are warming, potentially reducing urgency for Israel ties

Analysis:
- The most recent statements from Saudi officials (June 20) explicitly ruling out normalization without Palestinian concessions
- Multiple recent sources suggesting deal unlikely before US elections
- Very short timeframe remaining (2 months)
- Complex conditions that seem unlikely to be met (Palestinian state, Gaza ceasefire)
- Saudi Arabia strengthening ties with Iran suggests less urgency

Looking at both the evidence supporting and opposing normalization before September 30, 2024, the obstacles appear significant and the timeframe very tight. While there's ongoing diplomatic activity, the fundamental conditions (Palestinian state, Gaza ceasefire) seem unlikely to be met in such a short period.
