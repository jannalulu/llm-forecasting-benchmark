To forecast whether Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) will win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, we need to evaluate various factors and draw from multiple sources of evidence:

1. **Reference and Comparison Classes**: We can begin by looking at past Olympics and the performance of countries like Russia and Belarus in various individual sports events. However, there's a unique situation here, as athletes from these countries are competing under a neutral banner due to geopolitical reasons.

2. **Number of Athletes and Events**: According to available data, approximately 25 Russian and Belarusian athletes have been authorized to compete as INAs in various sports, including cycling, gymnastics, trampolining, wrestling, and weightlifting. Comparable past performances of these athletes would provide some insights.

3. **Performance Expectations**: It is reported that some of the heavyweight athletes such as high-profile Russian wrestlers are not allowed to compete, potentially impacting the chances for gold medals significantly. Furthermore, prominent athletes like Daniil Medvedev in tennis will compete under a neutral status, but the chances of gold could still be tough.

4. **Past Gold Medal Wins**: We should consider how many gold medals athletes from Russia and Belarus typically win at the Summer Olympics. For example, in the past Olympics (Tokyo 2021, for instance), their combined gold tally was significantly higher than 15. However, the current geopolitical climate and limitations (such as not being part of team events) could greatly reduce this number.

5. **Geopolitical Constraints**: The external factors and the ongoing conflict-related restrictions could play a significant role in their preparedness and performance. Additionally, the sanctions and participating under a neutral flag might have motivational impacts on the athletes.

6. **Linear Extrapolation and Adjustments**: If we were to extrapolate past performances linearly and adjust for the current constraints, the likelihood of winning over 15 gold medals seems challenging. The constraints, both in terms of eligibility and the emotional/psychological toll, are higher now than in any recent Olympics.

7. **Resolution Criteria and Conditions**: The question specifically targets individual events, excluding team events where these countries traditionally perform well, adding another layer of difficulty to achieve 15 golds.

Given the information and considerations above, it appears that while it's possible for INAs to secure several gold medals, reaching or exceeding 15 would require exceptional performances across multiple sports, without any margin for underperformance. The number of athletes and specific disciplines allowed under neutral status further narrows the probability range.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 17.00% being the most likely. Probability: 17.00%.

To forecast whether Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) will win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, we'll analyze the given information and apply the superforecasting principles.

### Initial Assessment/Reference Class Considerations

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context**: Normally, the estimation would consider how often athletes from Russia and Belarus have historically achieved such counts at previous Olympics. However, given the neutral status and limited number of participating AINs, using past data on these countries might be misleading. As a baseline, we know that 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes were expected, but actual numbers participating as AINs are much lower. 

2. **Medal Winning Capacity**: In previous Olympics, Russia has been a high medal-winning country. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Russian athletes won 71 medals in total, 20 of which were gold. However, these numbers included team events and athletes representing traditional national delegations.

### Analysis of Current Situation

1. **Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs)**: Initially, there were 25 AINs (14 Russians, 11 Belarusians), which later increased to 47. The likelihood of winning 15+ gold medals is significantly influenced by this smaller number and the exclusion from team events.

2. **Competitive Edge**: Without key athletes from sports like taekwondo and swimming (with only a partial lineup), some typically strong medal prospects are absent. Reports suggest over half of athletes have declined or withdrawn, reducing the competitive edge.

3. **Sports Covered**: AINs are primarily competing in wrestling, weightlifting, trampoline gymnastics, and road cycling. They do not cover traditionally high-gold-yielding sports like athletics or swimming significantly.

4. **Support and Motivation**: The reward scheme from the St. Petersburg government might motivate athletes to push for excellence, despite adversity.

### Superforecasting Criteria

1. **Updating and Flexibility**: It's crucial to remain open to new information as it becomes available, especially during the Olympics. For now, extensive withdrawals and the limit in participation numbers calls for a conservative estimate.

2. **Balancing Factors**: The number of AINs, fewer events, and lack of training conditions typical for national teams in their home countries reduce the probability of achieving 15 gold medals.

### Final Forecast

Given the restricted participation, absence in team events, and the competitive performance of non-AIN athletes globally, the probability of AINs achieving 15 or more gold medals appears low. Adjusting for their previous medal performance and the current context:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To estimate the likelihood that Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) will win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, we need to consider several factors, drawing on the superforecasting techniques outlined:

**Relevant Information and Considerations:**

1. **Reference and Comparison Classes:**
   - Historically, Russian and Belarusian athletes have been strong competitors in specific sports, such as gymnastics, wrestling, and some track disciplines. However, they typically participate as part of a broader team. The new situation involves them competing without the advantage of team events.
   - Past Olympics have seen major countries like Russia and Belarus winning large medal counts, often exceeding 15 golds across multiple disciplines, but these counts were under national teams, which provided support and morale boosts often lacking in neutral conditions.

2. **Current Status and Constraints:**
   - Only 25 INAs (including 14 Russians and 11 Belarusians) are confirmed to participate under neutral status.
   - These athletes will not participate in team events. This restriction significantly impacts potential gold medal wins, especially in disciplines like relays or synchronized sports.
   - Several high-profile Russian competitors in wrestling and other promising disciplines have been excluded from participation, potentially reducing chances of success.

3. **Psychological and Motivational Impact:**
   - Competing as neutral athletes may impact performance due to absent national support and reduced motivational factors linked to national representation. This could affect the athletes' ability to reach peak performance and win gold.

4. **Analyst Predictions:**
   - Referencing prediction markets or similar public sentiment (if available), there is limited data directly forecasting the INAs' prospects as they are a new category under unique circumstances. This means reliance on past data might be less informative.

5. **Balancing Opposing Forces:**
   - While individual INAs may excel in their disciplines, the reduced team morale, less extensive support infrastructure, and lack of national symbols might counterbalance individual efforts.

**Balancing Arguments for Higher or Lower Estimates:**

- **For Higher Estimates:**
  - Strong individual athletes might still win gold due to their innate talent and competitive drive.

- **For Lower Estimates:**
  - The limited number of athletes, exclusion from team events, and potential reduced motivation could significantly lower gold medal chances.

Considering these factors, a grounded estimate can be formed by considering similar past situations where athletes competed under restrictive settings, all while accounting for the uncertainty inherent in such unprecedented circumstances.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 18.00% being the most likely. Probability: 18.00%.**

To address the question of whether Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) will win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, let's break down available information and consider relevant factors:

1. **Reference Class and Base Rates**: Typically, in past Olympics, nations with full participation win numerous gold medals. However, INAs in Paris will have limited representation (14 Russians and 11 Belarusians, currently approved according to the news) and will not be competing under their national flags. In the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Russian athletes competed as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and achieved 20 gold medals from a delegation of over 330 athletes. The current participation is significantly less in numbers, which limits their medal-winning potential.

2. **Inside View**: The individual neutral athletes, due to restrictions and fewer entrants, will face a challenging scenario to amass a significant number of gold medals. Notable athletes are missing, reducing their chances. Individual athletes typically contest various sports such as cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, and wrestling. However, without a substantial number of contestants and given the competitive nature of the Olympics, winning at least 15 golds becomes an uphill task.

3. **Outside View**: If we use the previous reference of the Russian team performance, which is representative of their talent base, and adjust for limited numbers and stronger opposition (against full strength teams from countries like the USA and China), the probability of achieving high gold medal counts diminishes.

4. **Extrapolation and Trends**: Current reports show only about 47 INAs are confirmed from Russia and Belarus, with others yet to be finalized. Importantly, even if the full suggested numbers (up to 83) compete, based on base success rates from Moscow's and Belarus' historical data, it's likely improbable that they can reach 15 gold medals given the competitive environment.

5. **Recent Adjustments**: Consideration needs to be given to recent performances, incentives for participation, and readiness, which seem to provide some impetus for participation. However, the political circumstances and limited training opportunities could negatively impact performance.

In summary, the factors such as reduced athlete pool size, quality restrictions, and competitive fields make achieving ≥15 gold medals unlikely. The historical precedence where fully represented Russian teams achieved 20 golds under full participation suggests a reduced likelihood now, under hampered conditions.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 18.00% being the most likely. Probability: 18.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood of Individual Neutral Athletes (INA) winning 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, we need to consider several factors, including the number of participating athletes, their competitive strength, the sports they are competing in, and historical performance of similar groups.

1. **Reference Class and Base Rates:** Typically, Russian and Belarusian athletes have been strong contenders in Olympics, contributing significantly to medal tallies. However, in this case, participation is limited, with a cap on total athletes and no team events allowed. Historically, Russian athletes would have a higher medal count if allowed full participation.

2. **Current Situation and Unique Factors:**
   - Total authorized participants as Individual Neutral Athletes are 39 (22 Russian and 17 Belarusian as per updated reports), which is a constraint compared to previous Olympics where there was no neutral status.
   - Athletes are competing across individual sports including cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, and wrestling. These are areas where historically Russia has had strong performances, but not all events have equal opportunities for gold medals.
   - The criteria for participation requires athletes to renounce political affiliations, which might affect morale or willingness to participate fully.

3. **Evaluation of Strengths:**
   - Russian athletes have historically been strong in wrestling and weightlifting, though the absence of key athletes (like mentioned top wrestlers not being permitted) may reduce gold medal chances.
   - The Russian and Belarusian athletes' outlook in high-impact disciplines remains limited, possibly reducing their odds of reaching a high medal count.

4. **Challenges and Adjustments:**
   - Potential lack of national representation and support could impact athlete motivation.
   - With restrictions on the number of competitors and the stringent criteria, the potential impact of random events that can shift outcomes (injuries, disqualifications) is more impactful due to smaller pool size.

In conclusion, assessing these insights while recognizing historical performance, the specific details about participation as neutral athletes, and the distribution of strength across disciplines, the probability of INAs winning ≥15 gold medals seems lower than the traditional expectation based on historical performance of Russian/Belarusian athletes at the Olympics. However, it's necessary to acknowledge the capacity of top-tier athletes to individually impact their respective disciplines positively.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood of Individual Neutral Athletes (INA) winning 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, we need to consider several factors, including the number of participating athletes, their competitive strength, the sports they are competing in, and historical performance of similar groups.

1. **Reference Class and Base Rates:** Typically, Russian and Belarusian athletes have been strong contenders in Olympics, contributing significantly to medal tallies. However, in this case, participation is limited, with a cap on total athletes and no team events allowed. Historically, Russian athletes would have a higher medal count if allowed full participation.

2. **Current Situation and Unique Factors:**
   - Total authorized participants as Individual Neutral Athletes are 39 (22 Russian and 17 Belarusian as per updated reports), which is a constraint compared to previous Olympics where there was no neutral status.
   - Athletes are competing across individual sports including cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, and wrestling. These are areas where historically Russia has had strong performances, but not all events have equal opportunities for gold medals.
   - The criteria for participation requires athletes to renounce political affiliations, which might affect morale or willingness to participate fully.

3. **Evaluation of Strengths:**
   - Russian athletes have historically been strong in wrestling and weightlifting, though the absence of key athletes (like mentioned top wrestlers not being permitted) may reduce gold medal chances.
   - The Russian and Belarusian athletes' outlook in high-impact disciplines remains limited, possibly reducing their odds of reaching a high medal count.

4. **Challenges and Adjustments:**
   - Potential lack of national representation and support could impact athlete motivation.
   - With restrictions on the number of competitors and the stringent criteria, the potential impact of random events that can shift outcomes (injuries, disqualifications) is more impactful due to smaller pool size.

In conclusion, assessing these insights while recognizing historical performance, the specific details about participation as neutral athletes, and the distribution of strength across disciplines, the probability of INAs winning ≥15 gold medals seems lower than the traditional expectation based on historical performance of Russian/Belarusian athletes at the Olympics. However, it's necessary to acknowledge the capacity of top-tier athletes to individually impact their respective disciplines positively.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.
