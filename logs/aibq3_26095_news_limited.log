The International Olympic Committee (COI) has authorized the participation of 11 Belarusians and 14 Russians in the 2024 Paris Olympics, under the condition that they compete individually and under a neutral flag.

The number of authorized athletes is lower than the 58 expected, with no athletes from Russia or Belarus participating in track and field events. The Russian and Belarusian teams will not be able to participate in the opening ceremony or appear on the medal table.

**IOC Authorizes 25 Russian and Belarusian Athletes to Compete Under Neutral Flag**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has authorized 25 Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics under a neutral flag. The athletes, who will compete in four sports, including cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, and wrestling, have been cleared after passing a double check by international federations and the IOC to ensure they do not support the war in Ukraine and have no links with their country's army. This is a smaller number than the 55 Russians and 28 Belarusians expected to participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The neutral athletes will not be able to march under their national flags during the opening ceremony and will not appear in the medal table. Instead, they will use a dedicated flag with the letters 'AIN' on a green background and a short instrumental composition as their anthem if they win an Olympic title.

**Elena Isinbaeva Featured on Paris Olympics Poster with Russian Flag**
A promotional poster for the 2024 Paris Olympics has been spotted in Paris, featuring Elena Isinbaeva with the Russian flag after winning the gold medal in the pole vault at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
