[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Tetlock: "Well, despite all that post-debate chaos in June, our models were spot on again."

Silver: "No surprise there. Even with Biden's disastrous debate performance and those calls for an open convention, our models had a brokered convention at just 2.3%."

Tetlock: "The virtual roll call before the in-person convention was a smart strategic move by the DNC. It effectively prevented any last-minute delegate chaos."

Silver: "Exactly. The math never supported a brokered convention scenario. Biden had secured 99% of pledged delegates, and despite the media frenzy, party leadership remained unified behind him. Obama's public support was particularly crucial."

Tetlock: "Though I must admit, those post-debate polls had me double-checking our models."

[Both chuckle and return to their computers]

Nate Silver: [removing glasses, looking exhausted] Well, Philip, our models were spot-on again. We had it at 12.35%.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Despite the post-debate panic in June and those dramatic NYT editorials calling for Biden to step down, it was always unlikely we'd see a brokered convention. The virtual roll call format basically guaranteed a smooth process.

Nate: The math was clear. Biden had secured 99% of pledged delegates before the convention. Even with that disastrous debate performance and the polling dip, the party leadership stayed unified behind him.

Philip: [nodding] Historical precedent was key too. Only five brokered Democratic conventions in the last 31 presidential elections. The infrastructure for a last-minute switch just wasn't there.

Nate: Though I'll admit, those "open convention" calls after the debate had me double-checking our models.

Philip: [chuckling] But the models never lie, Nate. They never lie.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Tetlock: "Well, Nate, despite all the drama after that June debate disaster, our models were spot on again."

Silver: "No surprise there. No brokered convention - our models had it at 12.3%. The virtual roll call went smoothly, just one ballot."

Tetlock: "The post-debate panic was fascinating though. Remember those calls for an open convention? Obama and Clyburn's quick damage control was crucial."

Silver: "The polling dip had everyone spooked, but the delegate math never supported a brokered scenario. Biden had 99% of pledged delegates. Even with the Times editorial board calling for him to step aside..."

Tetlock: "History was on our side too. Only five brokered Democratic conventions in the last century. The virtual format basically guaranteed a clean nomination."

Tetlock: [stirring coffee] "Well, that was quite predictable, wasn't it?"

Silver: "No surprise at all. Our models had it at 2.3% probability of a brokered convention. Despite the post-debate panic in June, the virtual roll call went exactly as expected."

Tetlock: "The data was clear. Even with Biden's poor debate performance and those editorial calls for him to step down, the delegate math simply wasn't there for multiple ballots. He had secured 99% of pledged delegates."

Silver: "Right. Obama and Clyburn's swift support helped steady the ship. The virtual format before the in-person convention also eliminated any last-minute dramatics."

Tetlock: "Just goes to show - sometimes the simplest prediction is the correct one."

Tetlock: "Well, that was quite something yesterday. Our models had it right again."

Silver: "Yes, we had it at 12.5%. The virtual roll call went exactly as predicted - one clean ballot for Biden. Despite all that post-debate chaos in June and those editorial calls for his withdrawal, the party machinery held firm."

Tetlock: "The Obama intervention was crucial. Once he publicly backed Biden after that rough debate, it effectively killed any chance of a floor fight. Though I must say, those three days after the debate were the most uncertain we'd seen since 1952."

Silver: [sipping scotch] "True. If Biden had stumbled again in July, things might have been different. But the virtual format and early timing essentially locked it in. The models never wavered."
