SUPERFORECASTERS LUCAS and MAYA sit at a corner table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

LUCAS  
(leaning back)  
Well, Maya, our models had it at 52.47%. Right on the money.

MAYA  
(nodding)  
Yeah, with the rate at exactly 6.35% on September 8, it was a tight call. But the Fed's decision in mid-September to hold rates steady tipped the scales.

LUCAS  
And the housing market's resilience surprised many. The economic indicators were mixed, but our models factored in those nuances.

MAYA  
(smiling)  
The accuracy of our models never ceases to amaze me. A 0.1% difference could've changed everything.

LUCAS  
Exactly. It's a reminder of how delicate these predictions can be.

They clink their coffee cups, acknowledging the successful forecast.

FADE OUT.

Inflation pressures, the Fed's stance... it all pointed upwards. Still, seeing it confirmed feels surreal.
