INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with quiet excitement. A group of superforecasters huddle around a table, eyes fixed on a screen displaying the latest NHC report.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, relieved)  
Well, that’s it. No more surprises. Just three major hurricanes in September.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. We were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
Amazing how the media hyped it up. But the data was clear—no fourth storm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(points to screen)  
Climate change is still the wild card. Next year could be different.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(serious)  
True. But for now, we got it right. Communities were prepared, and that’s what matters.

They exchange satisfied glances, knowing their precise predictions helped avert panic and ensured readiness.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning forward) So, did we hit the mark?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (nods) Our models had it at 87.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) We predicted four major hurricanes in September, and the NHC confirmed it.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: (reflective) Climate change is definitely shifting patterns. The increase in intensity is undeniable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (typing) Communities were prepared, thanks to our forecasts. That’s the real victory.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (looking at the screen) The Atlantic was a beast this year, but our models held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (closing laptop) Another successful prediction. Let’s see what October brings.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open. The atmosphere is tense but focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the question was: Will 4 or more major Atlantic hurricanes occur in September 2024?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 23.75%. Given the data until September 12, the likelihood was low.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. Historical patterns and climate models suggested increased activity, but four major hurricanes in one month? Rare.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And as of October 1, the NHC confirms only three reached Category 3 status.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models were spot on. A testament to accurate forecasting amidst climate change concerns.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. This precision helps communities prepare, even when the odds are low.

They nod, satisfied with their work, knowing preparation is key in uncertain times.

The room buzzes with anticipation. A digital clock reads 00:01. Superforecaster JANE, 40s, sips coffee, eyes glued to the screen displaying NHC data.

JANE  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, will 4 or more major hurricanes hit in September? Our models had it at 12.75%.

Superforecaster MIKE, 50s, joins her, scanning the reports.

MIKE  
And yet, just three. The models hold true again. Climate change is ramping up the stakes, but not this time.

JANE  
(nods)  
True. With above-normal predictions, one might have thought differently. But September spared us, relatively.

MIKE  
It's a reminder. Preparation is key, even when probabilities are low.

The screen flashes the final NHC report, confirming three major hurricanes. They exchange a knowing glance, their models vindicated once more.
