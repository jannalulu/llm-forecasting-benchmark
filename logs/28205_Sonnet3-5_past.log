To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Strike initiation and duration:
- The strike began on September 13, 2024, involving 33,000 Boeing machinists.
- Historical context: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days.

2. Union demands and Boeing's offer:
- The union initially demanded a 40% wage increase over 3 years.
- Boeing offered a 25% increase over 4 years, which was overwhelmingly rejected (94.6% against).
- The large gap suggests negotiations may be protracted.

3. Negotiation status:
- Talks are set to resume on September 17, 2024, under a federal mediator.
- This quick return to negotiations is a positive sign, but doesn't guarantee a swift resolution.

4. Economic pressures:
- Boeing faces significant financial pressure, with $60 billion in debt.
- A prolonged strike could cost Boeing $3-3.5 billion in cash flow.
- This may incentivize Boeing to reach a deal, but also limits their ability to meet union demands.

5. Worker sentiment:
- Workers voted 96% in favor of striking, indicating strong resolve.
- Quotes from workers suggest deep dissatisfaction with Boeing's offer and past concessions.

6. Company stance:
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg has emphasized the need to avoid a strike, suggesting some willingness to compromise.
- However, Boeing's initial offer was far from union demands, indicating potential for a prolonged negotiation.

7. Time frame:
- The question asks about continuous strike through September 30, 2024.
- This gives approximately 17 days from the strike's start to its potential resolution.

8. External factors:
- Boeing faces ongoing scrutiny over quality control issues, which may influence negotiation dynamics.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the strike will continue through September 30, 2024. The wide gap between union demands and Boeing's offer, combined with worker resolve and the historical precedent of the 57-day 2008 strike, suggests negotiations may be challenging. However, the economic pressures on Boeing and the quick return to negotiations provide some possibility of an earlier resolution.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, with 72.50% being the most likely. Probability: 72.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. This provides a baseline for potential strike duration.

2. Current worker sentiment: The recent vote was overwhelmingly in favor of striking (96%), suggesting strong resolve among workers.

3. Gap between demands and offers: Workers initially demanded a 40% raise over 3 years, while Boeing offered 25% over 4 years. This significant gap may prolong negotiations.

4. Boeing's financial pressures: The company is facing production delays, debt, and reputational issues, which may limit its ability to make major concessions.

5. Potential economic impact: Analysts estimate a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3-3.5 billion in cash flow, creating pressure to resolve quickly.

6. Negotiation progress: Talks are set to resume on September 16 with a federal mediator, which could help facilitate a resolution.

7. Time until resolution date: There are about 2 weeks between the strike start and the September 30 resolution date.

Considering these factors:

- The strong worker resolve and significant gap in demands suggest the strike is unlikely to be resolved very quickly.
- However, the economic pressure on both sides and involvement of a mediator could help reach a resolution before September 30.
- The 2008 strike lasting 57 days suggests it's possible, but not certain, that this strike could extend beyond September 30.

Given the uncertainties and competing pressures, I estimate there's a significant chance the strike could continue through September 30, but it's not highly likely.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Strike initiation and duration:
- The strike began on September 13, 2024, involving 33,000 Boeing machinists.
- Historical reference: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days.
- Current strike is set to last at least until September 30, 2024 (18 days from start).

2. Negotiation status:
- Talks between Boeing and the union are set to resume on September 17, 2024, under federal mediation.
- Both sides express willingness to negotiate, but significant differences remain.

3. Union demands and Boeing's offer:
- Union initially demanded 40% wage increase over 3 years; Boeing offered 25% over 4 years.
- Other issues include pensions and job security.

4. Economic pressures:
- Boeing faces financial challenges, including $60 billion in debt.
- Analysts estimate a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3-3.5 billion in cash flow.

5. External factors:
- Boeing is under scrutiny for safety issues and production delays.
- The company needs to rebuild trust with customers and regulators.

Considering these factors:

Arguments for a longer strike (beyond September 30):
- Large gap between union demands and Boeing's offer.
- High strike approval (96%) suggests strong worker resolve.
- Boeing's financial struggles may limit its ability to meet demands quickly.

Arguments for a shorter strike (ending before September 30):
- Economic pressure on both sides to resolve quickly.
- Federal mediation involvement could expedite negotiations.
- Boeing's need to resume production to address existing challenges.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the strike will continue through September 30, but also a substantial possibility of earlier resolution. The upcoming mediated talks on September 17 will be crucial.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

6. Company's financial situation: Boeing is facing financial difficulties and production delays.

7. Potential strike impact: Analysts estimate significant financial losses for Boeing if the strike continues.

Reasons for a lower probability:

1. Federal mediation involvement could lead to a quicker resolution.
2. Boeing's precarious financial situation may pressure them to make concessions.
3. The upcoming talks on September 17 provide an opportunity for progress.

Reasons for a higher probability:

1. The large gap between worker demands and company offer suggests difficult negotiations.
2. Historical precedent of the 57-day strike in 2008 indicates potential for a longer strike.

However, the economic pressure on Boeing and the willingness to resume negotiations provide some possibility of earlier resolution.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. This provides a baseline for potential strike duration.

2. Current negotiations: Talks are set to resume on September 16th under federal mediation. This suggests both sides are willing to negotiate, which could lead to a quicker resolution.

3. Worker demands: The workers rejected a 25% wage increase over 4 years, seeking 40% over 3 years instead. This significant gap may prolong negotiations.

4. Company position: Boeing is facing financial pressures and has expressed willingness to negotiate. However, meeting worker demands fully may be challenging for the company.

5. Economic impact: Analysts estimate a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3-3.5 billion in cash flow. This pressure could motivate the company to resolve quickly.

6. Union resolve: The strike vote was overwhelming (96% in favor), indicating strong worker solidarity.

7. Time pressure: The question resolves on September 30th, giving about 2 weeks for resolution from the current date.

8. Past labor relations: There's mention of stagnant wages for over a decade, suggesting long-standing issues that may take time to resolve.

9. External factors: Boeing faces other challenges (debt, safety concerns) that may influence its negotiating position.

Considering these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the strike will continue through September 30th. The strong worker solidarity, large gap in wage demands, and historical precedent of a 57-day strike in 2008 suggest this could be a prolonged dispute. However, the economic pressure on Boeing and the willingness to resume negotiations provide some possibility of earlier resolution.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.
