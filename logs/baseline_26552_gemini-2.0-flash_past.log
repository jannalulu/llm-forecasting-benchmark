Okay, let's analyze this question. The core of the issue is whether a senolytic therapy will be approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the US before September 30, 2024. Today is July 24, 2024, leaving just over two months.

Several factors are relevant:

1.  **FDA Approval Process:** The FDA approval process is generally lengthy, involving multiple phases of clinical trials (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3) followed by a review process. Even with "fast track" or "breakthrough therapy" designations, the process typically takes more than two months. A therapy would likely already have to be nearing the end of phase 3 trials and have submitted paperwork with the FDA.

2.  **Current Status of Senolytic Therapies:** While there's significant research into senolytics, very few (if any) are in the late stages of clinical trials ready for FDA approval. A quick search does not reveal any imminent approvals. Most are still in preclinical or early clinical trial stages.

3.  **Definition of "Senolytic Therapy":** The question specifies the intervention must be *marketed* as a senolytic, and medical evidence accepted by the FDA must demonstrate senescent cell removal. This is important because it rules out therapies that might incidentally have senolytic effects but aren't explicitly targeted or marketed as such. This detail adds a layer of stringency.

4.  **Commercial Sale**: The therapy has to be approved for *commercial sale*. That implies that it is safe for the intended purpose.

5.  **Time Remaining:** The remaining time is a critical constraint. Approvals rarely occur in such a short timeframe unless the drug has already gone through most of the approval steps.

Considering these factors, the probability of a senolytic therapy being approved for commercial sale by the FDA within the next two months seems very low. While scientific progress can be rapid, the regulatory hurdles and time required for FDA review make it improbable. It is possible that there is something I don't know (e.g. a trial that has not published the results and has already submitted the paperwork to the FDA). However, based on the available information, it seems very unlikely.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 1.50%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
