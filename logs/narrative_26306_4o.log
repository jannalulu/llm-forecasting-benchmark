A group of superforecasters sits around a table cluttered with laptops and printouts. The tension is palpable as they discuss yesterday's event.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, confident)  
"Our models had it at 85.32%. The 500th richest person did indeed have over $6 billion."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding, reviewing notes)  
"Yeah, the economic trends we analyzed up to July pointed towards a steady rise in tech stocks, which was a big factor."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(skeptical, arms crossed)  
"But what about the unexpected market dip in August? We almost didn't account for that."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
"True. But remember, our Brier scores are never wrong. The probability reflected reality perfectly."

They exchange relieved glances, knowing their predictions were right once again. The room buzzes with the satisfaction of a job well done.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table cluttered with laptops and printouts. They are reviewing the outcome of yesterday's financial event.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, it’s official. The 500th richest person didn’t reach the $6 billion mark.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the market trends and economic data up to July, it was always unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scanning a news article)  
The tech sector's downturn really hit hard. A few months ago, it seemed like a different story.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Once again, the models were spot on. It’s fascinating how a slight shift in global markets can ripple through the billionaire ranks.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning forward)  
Let’s see what the next quarter brings. With these probabilities, the future’s always a puzzle.

So, it turns out the 500th richest person did have over $6 billion. Our models had it at 92.75%.

The volatility in tech stocks played out just as we anticipated. The news articles up to July confirmed our assumptions.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
So, did the 500th billionaire make it to $6 billion?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 35.67%. Given the market volatility and economic downturns since July, it was a tough climb.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Right, the tech sector took a hit, and with it, many fortunes dwindled. We factored in geopolitical tensions too.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
Bloomberg showed the 500th at $5.95 billion. Close, but no cigar.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Fascinating. It’s incredible how precise our models were, even with limited data till July.
