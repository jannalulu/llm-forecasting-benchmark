**Diplomatic Efforts to Prevent War Between Iran and Israel**
Recent diplomatic efforts have attempted to prevent a full-scale war between Iran, Israel, and their allies. The negotiations, led by the US, Qatar, and Egypt, have been ongoing since August 15. The US has proposed a plan to help resolve the conflict, which includes a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and a significant prisoner exchange. However, Hamas has rejected the proposal, citing concerns about the presence of Israeli troops on the Gaza-Egypt border and the conditions for the release of its members from Israeli prisons. The US has also been working on a parallel plan, which includes a potential attack on Iran if negotiations fail. Meanwhile, France and the UK have been involved in separate diplomatic efforts, with the French foreign minister visiting Lebanon and the British foreign minister visiting Israel. The situation remains tense, with both sides waiting for the other to make a move. According to Israeli officials, the Iranian military has reduced its readiness for a potential attack, but the situation can change quickly. The next few days will be crucial in determining the outcome of the negotiations and the potential for a conflict.

**UK and France Call for Diplomatic Solution to Gaza Crisis**
The UK and France have called for a diplomatic solution to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and restore peace along the Israeli-Lebanese border. The two countries' foreign ministers, David Laming and Stéphane Séguin, visited Israel and the Palestinian territories together, aiming to urge an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and reduce tensions. The visit marked the first joint visit by the UK and France to Israel in over a decade. A joint statement released after the visit read: 'We, the French and British foreign ministers, share a common interest in the security of the State of Israel and stability in the region as a whole. As permanent members of the UN Security Council, we have a specific responsibility to support the current escalation and ensure a lasting peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and the region as a whole.' The statement emphasized the need to reduce tensions in the region, and urged Iran and its allies to retract their ongoing threats to launch a military attack against Israel. The ministers also stressed the importance of ending the cycle of revenge and retaliation, and reiterated their commitment to the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 on Lebanon. They expressed their full support for the current efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement and the release of hostages in Gaza, led by the US, Egypt, and Qatar. The statement concluded by emphasizing the need for all parties to fulfill their responsibilities, and for the urgent delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid without restrictions, as well as the protection of civilians. The ministers reaffirmed that only a two-state solution, in accordance with international law, can bring lasting peace to both Israelis and Palestinians. They strongly condemned the violence of settlers in the West Bank, which threatens both Israeli and Palestinian security and can jeopardize ongoing diplomatic efforts. The statement concluded by reaffirming the UK and France's commitment to supporting cooperation and normalization in the region, and urged all parties to take concrete steps to avoid war. 'We are ready to engage with them to achieve this goal,' the statement said.

**Israel-Hamas Conflict: Diplomatic Efforts for a Truce Amid Escalating Tensions**
British and French foreign ministers visited Israel on August 16 to call for a de-escalation in the region, as Hezbollah and Iran threatened to retaliate after the assassination of the Hamas leader and the Hezbollah military chief. Meanwhile, negotiations for a truce in Gaza continued in Cairo. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated that he expects his allies to 'join Israel' in attacking Iran if the Islamic Republic attacks Israel, according to a statement from his office. 'Israel expects France and the UK to clearly and publicly tell Iran that it is forbidden to attack Israel, and that if Iran attacks, the coalition led by the US will join Israel not only to defend it but also to attack important targets in Iran,' he said, according to a statement from his office. French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné disagreed, saying it was 'inconvenient to talk about Israeli retaliation, even defensive, while we are working towards a diplomatic agreement.' The US presented a revised proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza on August 16, but the Hamas immediately rejected 'new conditions' from Israel, as diplomatic pressure intensifies to avoid a regional military escalation. Mediators - the US, Qatar, and Egypt - announced the resumption of talks next week in Cairo, after presenting a new compromise in Doha to implement an agreement on a ceasefire. An agreement has 'never been so close,' US President Joe Biden assured. Several Israeli politicians condemned the deadly attack in the West Bank by dozens of Israeli settlers. The attack occurred near the city of Kalkiliya, killing at least one person on Thursday evening. 'Violent settler attacks against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank are unacceptable and must stop,' said a spokesperson for the National Security Council, urging Israeli authorities to take necessary measures to 'protect all communities.' The European Union's foreign chief, Josep Borrell, said he wants to 'submit a proposal for EU sanctions against accomplices of violent settlers, including some Israeli government members.' The UN described the attack as 'horrible,' adding that 'overall, we are witnessing impunity' for such acts. The Gaza Health Ministry announced the first confirmed case of polio in Gaza, which has been polio-free for 25 years. The case involves a 10-month-old baby who had not been vaccinated in Deir Al-Balah. Two UN agencies have requested 'humanitarian pauses' in the fighting in Gaza to vaccinate over 640,000 children under 10 against polio in the coming weeks.

**European Countries Urge Iran to Avoid Retaliation Against Israel**
European countries are in intense communication with Iran to persuade it not to retaliate against Israel after the assassination of Hamas' former political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Meanwhile, French, German, Italian, and British leaders issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. German Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Monday, discussing the recent escalation in the region and ways to contain it, as well as bilateral relations between the two countries. Raisi emphasized that Iran welcomes expanding cooperation with all countries and believes in resolving issues through diplomacy, but will not give in to pressure, sanctions, arrogance, and aggression. Steinmeier stressed the importance of strengthening relations in various fields, highlighting the need for stability in the region, a halt to war and violence in Gaza, and calling for a ceasefire. The Vatican also called for avoiding the spread of conflict. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, called for dialogue to prevent escalation in the Middle East. He expressed concern about the situation in the region and emphasized the need for all parties to work towards a peaceful resolution. The US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, urging Iran to stop threatening Israel with a military attack. The statement emphasized that such an attack would have severe consequences for regional security. The US has approved $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel, despite calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Since October 7, 2023, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza, killing over 131,000 people, mostly children and women, and injuring over 10,000, with many more missing.

**International Pressure Mounts to Avoid War Between Iran and Israel**
The international diplomatic pressure is increasing to avoid a war between Iran and Israel. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the G7 that an attack by Tehran and Hezbollah on Israel could happen in the next 24 hours. According to three anonymous sources cited by Axios, Blinken explained in a virtual meeting with allies that 'for the US, Iran and Hezbollah will both react', but Washington 'does not know the exact moment of the attacks' or their form. The US hopes to stop the escalation by convincing Iran and Hezbollah to limit their attacks and restrain any Israeli response, and Blinken 'asked other foreign ministers to join this push by pressuring the three'. While President Joe Biden saw the national security team and spoke with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the G7 foreign ministers, after Sunday's meeting, 'expressed deep concern for the rising level of tension in the Middle East, which threatens to trigger a wider conflict in the region'. In a joint statement, they launched an 'appeal to all parties to moderation and to engage in a constructive way for de-escalation', as also stated by the US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller. 'No country or nation has anything to gain from further escalation', the foreign ministers of Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, along with the EU's High Representative, stated. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also reiterated on X that 'we are working for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and intensified humanitarian engagement in the Strip. We will do our best to achieve peace'. Meanwhile, Israel has confirmed Blinken's information that the attack by Tehran could start within the next 24 hours, but from Jerusalem, they believe it is impossible to predict it with precision. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after warning that 'if they dare to attack us, they will pay a high price', spoke with Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin to inform him 'on the developments of security in the region and on the readiness of the Idf to defend Israel from potential threats posed by Iran and its delegates'. Gallant 'discussed a series of scenarios and the corresponding defensive and offensive capabilities', his office reported, adding that the minister 'expressed his appreciation to Austin for the close military and strategic coordination with the US, including the current and future deployment of military capabilities and the changes in the defense force position in Israel'. He also emphasized 'the importance of US leadership in forming a coalition of allies and partners to defend Tel Aviv and the region from a series of aerial attacks'. After the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, Washington sent additional military forces to the Middle East in anticipation of reprisals, insisting that it is a 'defensive deployment'. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto also spoke with Gallant, highlighting on X that 'Italy continues to work to promote dialogue, reduce tension, and avoid a grave and dangerous escalation'. Yesterday, as reported by the Israeli military, 'the head of the US Central Command, General Michael Erik Kurilla, arrived in the country' and met with the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi: the two 'held a joint assessment of the situation on strategic and security issues'.

**Joint Statement by French and British Foreign Ministers on Israel and the Region**
The French and British Foreign Ministers have issued a joint statement expressing their shared interest in Israel's security and regional stability. For the first time in ten years, they are conducting a joint ministerial visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, they have a duty to end the current escalation of the conflict and establish a lasting peace that benefits Israelis, Palestinians, and the entire region. They have urged Iran and its allies to cease their threats of military attack against Israel and have reminded all parties of the need to end the cycle of retaliation. They reiterated the importance of implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 on Lebanon. They reaffirmed their total support for the current efforts by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar to achieve a ceasefire and agreement on the release of hostages in the Gaza Strip. They called on all parties to take responsibility and to allow for the unimpeded delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid, and to protect civilians. They reiterated that only a two-state solution, in accordance with international law, can bring a just and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. They condemned the violence perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank, which threatens the security of Israelis and Palestinians and risks undermining diplomatic efforts. They are determined to support cooperation and regularization processes in the region and call on all actors to provide concrete efforts to genuinely end the conflict. They are ready to engage with all parties to achieve this goal. This joint visit demonstrates the common mission shared by the United Kingdom and France in the region and worldwide.

'We have also reminded all parties of the need to end the cycle of retaliation.' They added, 'We are determined to support the processes of cooperation and regularization of the situation in the region.'

**International Diplomacy Intensifies to Prevent Gaza War from Spreading**
International diplomacy has intensified to prevent the war in Gaza from becoming a larger regional conflict. British and French foreign ministers, David Lammy and Stéphane Séjourné, visited Israel and met with Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Lammy said, 'As we enter 315 days of war, the moment for an agreement to return the hostages, to bring in the necessary aid in Gaza, and to stop the fighting is now.' Katz warned that if Iran attacks Israel, Israel expects its allies to not only help defend it, but also to join a counterattack against Iran. The international mediators believe that the best option to calm tensions is an agreement between Israel and Hamas to stop the fighting and guarantee the release of the Israeli hostages in Gaza. The US, Qatar, and Egypt have initiated a new round of conversations with an Israeli delegation in Qatar. Hamas accuses Israel of adding new demands to a previous proposal that had international backing and was initially accepted by the group. Israel accuses Hamas of adding its own new demands. According to John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesperson, the conversations are an important step, but there is still much work to be done, and the negotiators are focused on implementing the agreement. A US official with knowledge of the Thursday conversations described them as 'constructive.' The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Qatar stated that the conversations will continue on Friday. The war began when Hamas insurgents crossed the heavily guarded border on October 7, killed over 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 as hostages. More than a hundred were released during a week-long ceasefire in November, and it is believed that around 110 remain in Gaza, although Israeli authorities claim that a third of them are dead. Israel responded with an offensive that has claimed the lives of 40,005 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, whose count does not distinguish between civilian and combatant victims. The Israeli military spokesperson, Admiral Daniel Hagari, said on Thursday that the army killed over 17,000 combatants in the enclave during the war, but did not provide evidence. The diplomats hope that a ceasefire agreement will convince Iran and Hezbollah to abstain from launching attacks in retaliation against Israel after the assassination of a high-ranking commander of the Lebanese group in an Israeli attack in Beirut and the leader of Hamas in an explosion in the Iranian capital, which has been widely attributed to Israel.

**French and British Foreign Ministers to Visit Israel to Address Regional Escalation**
The foreign ministers of France and the UK, Stéphane Séjourné and David Lammy, will visit Israel on Friday to discuss with their Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, 'efforts to avoid a regional escalation'. According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Minister Katz will meet with the Foreign Ministers of the UK and France tomorrow to discuss efforts to avoid a regional escalation.' The meeting is expected to focus on promoting 'severe economic sanctions against Iran in relation to the nuclear issue, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles, and the declaration of the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.' Additionally, the tripartite meeting is expected to promote an agreement for the release of the Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip by Hamas. Meanwhile, a delegation from Israel has arrived in Doha to resume negotiations with mediators (US, Egypt, and Qatar) for a ceasefire in the enclave, which would allow for the release of the hostages. However, Hamas has announced that it will not attend the meeting, citing Iran's threat to attack Israel in retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two weeks ago, as well as the killing of Hizbulá's military leader Fuad Shukr by Israel. Despite this, the international community is exhausting all diplomatic channels to achieve an agreement in the Gaza Strip that would dissuade Iran and its allies, and even the US has stated that Hamas has agreed to maintain contact with the mediators after the meeting.

**France, UK, Germany, Italy, and US Call for Ceasefire in Gaza**
France, the UK, Germany, Italy, and the US have called for a ceasefire in Gaza, urging Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to quickly conclude a truce. The leaders of the five countries, including US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, issued a joint statement after speaking by phone to analyze the escalation of tensions in the Middle East. 'We expressed our total support for the ongoing efforts to reduce tensions and achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza,' the statement said. The leaders supported the appeal of the mediator countries - the US, Egypt, and Qatar - for the Israeli and Hamas delegations to 'resume talks this week, with the aim of concluding the agreement as quickly as possible.' 'We emphasize that there is no more time to lose. All parties must fulfill their responsibilities,' they appealed, after Hamas announced that it would not participate in the next meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Cairo or Doha. The region is on high alert, with Iran and its regional allies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen threatening Israel with retaliatory attacks, following the assassination of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and the Israeli attack near Beirut that killed Fuad Shukr, the military chief of the Lebanese Hezbollah. Iran's president, Massud Pezeshkian, said that his country has the 'right to respond' to any aggression it faces. 'Although we emphasize the resolution of issues through negotiation, Iran will never yield to pressure, sanctions, and coercion, but considers it has the right to respond to aggressors in accordance with international standards,' he said, according to an official statement published by the Iranian News Agency after a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The US estimates that Iran may launch 'this week' a 'series of attacks' against Israel, said John Kirby, a White House spokesperson. The US 'shares the concern' of Israel about an imminent attack from Iran and its allies in the region, Kirby said. In recent days, the US has reinforced its military presence in the Middle East by deploying fighter jets and several warships. 'We emphasize that there is no more time to lose. All parties must fulfill their responsibilities,' they appealed, after Hamas announced that it would not participate in the next meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Cairo or Doha.

**France, Germany, and UK Warn Iran Against Attacking Israel**
France, Germany, and the UK have issued a warning to Iran not to attack Israel, following the recent assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The three countries stated that any retaliation would undermine peace negotiations and called on Iran and its allies to refrain from extreme actions. The statement read, 'We call on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that could further intensify regional tensions and jeopardize the opportunity to agree on a ceasefire and the release of hostages.' The importance of ending the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has lasted over a year, was also emphasized. Despite the allied nations' support for Israel, the Israeli military has already implemented strategies to protect its borders from potential Iranian attacks. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that they are preparing for any attack and have already met with the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) to discuss their readiness. However, Iran has stated that it will only return to peace agreements if mediators focus on a plan based on previous dialogues, leaving the future of diplomatic sessions uncertain.

**France, Germany, and UK Warn Iran of Responsibility for Escalation in Region**
The leaders of France, Germany, and the UK have issued a joint statement warning Iran of responsibility for escalating the situation in the region. The statement, released on the UK government's website, calls for an end to further delays in restarting negotiations between Israel and Hamas. 'We are working with all parties to prevent escalation and will do everything to reduce tension and find a path to stability. Fighting must stop now, and all hostages held by Hamas must be released,' the statement reads. The leaders also urged Iran and its allies to 'refrain from attacks that would lead to further escalation of regional tensions and threaten the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage release.' They emphasized that 'no country or nation will benefit from further escalation in the Middle East.' The conflict between Israel and Palestine began on October 7, 2023, with a Hamas attack. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated on July 1, 2024, that Israel would continue military operations in the Gaza Strip until Hamas is destroyed and 'all other war goals are achieved.' US President Biden announced on May 13 that Israel and Hamas had agreed on the boundaries of a ceasefire agreement for the Gaza Strip and the release of hostages. Reuters reported on August 9 that leaders of the US, Egypt, and Qatar had called for Israel and Hamas to meet for negotiations on August 15 to complete the ceasefire agreement for the Gaza Strip.

According to three anonymous sources cited by Axios, Blinken explained in a virtual meeting with allies that 'for the US, Iran and Hezbollah will both react', but Washington 'does not know the exact moment of the attacks' or their form. The US hopes to stop the escalation by convincing Iran and Hezbollah to limit their attacks and restrain any Israeli response, and Blinken 'asked other foreign ministers to join this push by pressuring the three'. While President Joe Biden saw the national security team and spoke with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the G7 foreign ministers, after Sunday's meeting, 'expressed deep concern for the rising level of tension in the Middle East, which threatens to trigger a wider conflict in the region'. In a joint statement, they launched an 'appeal to all parties to moderation and to engage in a constructive way for de-escalation', as also stated by the US State Department spokesperson, Matthew Miller. 'No country or nation has anything to gain from further escalation', the foreign ministers of Italy, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US, along with the EU's High Representative, stated. Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also reiterated on X that 'we are working for a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and intensified humanitarian engagement in the Strip. We will do our best to achieve peace'. Meanwhile, Israel has confirmed Blinken's information that the attack by Tehran could start within the next 24 hours, but from Jerusalem, they believe it is impossible to predict it with precision. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, after warning that 'if they dare to attack us, they will pay a high price', spoke with Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin to inform him 'on the developments of security in the region and on the readiness of the Idf to defend Israel from potential threats posed by Iran and its delegates'. Gallant 'discussed a series of scenarios and the corresponding defensive and offensive capabilities', his office reported, adding that the minister 'expressed his appreciation to Austin for the close military and strategic coordination with the US, including the current and future deployment of military capabilities and the changes in the defense force position in Israel'. He also emphasized 'the importance of US leadership in forming a coalition of allies and partners to defend Tel Aviv and the region from a series of aerial attacks'. After the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, Washington sent additional military forces to the Middle East in anticipation of reprisals, insisting that it is a 'defensive deployment'. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto also spoke with Gallant, highlighting on X that 'Italy continues to work to promote dialogue, reduce tension, and avoid a grave and dangerous escalation'. Yesterday, as reported by the Israeli military, 'the head of the US Central Command, General Michael Erik Kurilla, arrived in the country' and met with the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi: the two 'held a joint assessment of the situation on strategic and security issues'.

**Diplomatic Maneuvers to Avoid Military Escalation in the Middle East**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that his country is prepared to face Iran and its allies on all fronts. 'Anyone who kills our citizens or harms our country (...) will pay a very high price,' he warned on Sunday evening. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has urged all parties, as well as countries with influence, to act urgently to avoid a wider conflict in the region. Iran, the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, and the Lebanese Hezbollah have accused Israel of the death of Hamas leader Ismaïl Haniyeh, killed in his residence in Tehran on Wednesday. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death, but had vowed to destroy Hamas after the unprecedented attack by the movement on its soil on October 7, which triggered the devastating war in Gaza. 'Israel has crossed red lines,' said Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, while Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei threatened a severe punishment. The US, Israel's main ally, has strengthened its military presence in the Middle East while seeking to diplomatically de-escalate the situation. 'We are determined to oppose Iran and its allies on all fronts, in all arenas,' Netanyahu said at a ceremony in Jerusalem. The US, Sweden, the UK, France, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have called on their citizens to leave Lebanon, while several airlines have suspended flights to Beirut, including Lufthansa, Air France, and Transavia. The situation remains tense, with daily exchanges of fire at the Israeli-Lebanese border and Israeli airstrikes on the south of Lebanon, which have killed four people, according to Lebanese authorities and Hezbollah. 'We can't know what will happen in 20 minutes (...) But we are a strong country and I think we will win this war,' said Yehuda Levi, a shop owner in Haifa. '39,623 dead in Gaza according to Hamas' - The situation is critical, with many countries urging their citizens to leave the region.

**France and US Urge Maximum Restraint in Middle East**
The French and US diplomatic chiefs agreed to urge all parties in the Middle East to 'exercise maximum restraint' to avoid a regional conflict, according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Stéphane Séjourné spoke with Antony Blinken and shared 'their concerns about the increasing tensions' in the region, said Christophe Lemoine, the ministry's spokesperson. 'They agreed to continue to urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, in order to avoid any regional conflagration that would have devastating consequences for the countries in the region,' he added. The two countries will also continue joint efforts for a 'sustainable' ceasefire in Gaza. This meeting took place at a time when concerns about a possible military escalation in the Middle East have increased due to the amplification of threats against Israel by Iran and its allies. Iran, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah blamed Israel for the death in Tehran on Wednesday of the Palestinian movement's leader, Ismail Haniyeh. The assassination occurred just hours after an attack claimed by Israel killed the military chief of the Lebanese movement, Fouad Chokr, near Beirut on Tuesday night. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is at a 'very high level' of preparation for any scenario, 'both defensive and offensive.' On Friday, Paris asked French visitors still in Iran to leave the country 'as quickly as possible.' In the case of Lebanon, France did not explicitly ask its citizens to leave the country, unlike Washington and London. However, in its updated travel advice on Thursday, the ministry warned French citizens, particularly those passing through, that commercial flights to France are still available. Since the Gaza war, France has formally recommended that French citizens 'except for imperative reasons, not travel to Lebanon, including for tourism and family visits.'

**UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy: Britain seeks balanced stance on Israeli-Palestinian conflict**
British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in an interview with Reuters that his country wants to take a balanced stance towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and will use diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Hamas. Lammy is currently visiting Germany, his first foreign trip since the Labor Party's landslide victory in the British elections on Friday, which ended 14 years of Conservative rule and brought Keir Starmer to the position of Prime Minister. Lammy said, 'It's time for the United Kingdom to reconnect with the outside world.' He added, 'I want to return to taking a balanced stance on Israel and Gaza. We have made it clear that we want to see a ceasefire... We want the release of these prisoners.' He also stated, 'The fighting must stop, and humanitarian aid must be allowed in. I will use all diplomatic efforts to ensure a ceasefire.' Despite his party's landslide victory in the elections, the Labor Party suffered significant losses in areas with large Muslim populations due to their anger over the party's stance on the war in Gaza. The efforts to reach an agreement on a ceasefire and the release of prisoners in Gaza gained momentum on Friday after Hamas presented a modified proposal on the agreement terms, and Israel said the negotiations will continue this week. According to Gaza's health authorities, over 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign on Gaza since October 7, 2023, in response to Hamas's attack on Israeli towns on the same day. Israeli statistics indicate that 1,200 people were killed and over 250 hostages were taken in Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Lammy said that Britain will seek to re-establish its global positions on some issues, including the climate crisis and major relationships, such as its relations with European powers and emerging powers. He added, 'Let's put Britain's exit from the European Union behind us... There are many things we can do together.' The British Foreign Office said that Lammy will travel to Poland and Sweden on Sunday, where he will focus on areas including cooperation in NATO and the war in Ukraine.

**US Seeks Diplomatic Solution to Prevent War Between Israel and Hezbollah**
The United States is seeking diplomatic solutions to prevent a full-scale war between Israel and the Hezbollah group in Lebanon. The Biden administration is looking to Qatar to mediate between Israel and Hezbollah. The US is trying to prevent the conflict from escalating into a full-scale war in Lebanon, with American officials working to conclude an agreement to end the conflict. According to The Washington Post, US officials have asked Qatar, which has mediated talks between Israel and Hamas, to help resolve the issue on the border between Israel and Lebanon. A Hezbollah representative said that if a temporary ceasefire is reached between Israel and Hamas, Hezbollah will also pause its attacks. However, the group will not discuss other agreements until the war in the Gaza Strip is stopped. The US is also considering a ceasefire in the Golan Heights as a key step towards resolving the issue in Lebanon, but officials are exploring alternative options for de-escalation. A State Department representative, Matthew Miller, said that a diplomatic solution can be found that meets the interests of all parties, but did not provide details. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant said that Israel does not want war with Hezbollah, but is prepared for any scenario. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz promised to take necessary measures to stop Hezbollah's attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the country is ready for 'very strong actions' in the north and will not stand idly by while Hezbollah attacks its territory. The Israeli military has approved operational plans for an invasion of Lebanon. A former Pentagon intelligence official, Harrison Mann, expressed confidence that Israel will not launch an attack unless it is fully confident in US support. The US has not followed the example of other countries, such as Canada and Germany, which have urged their citizens to leave Lebanon, but has deployed a US Navy ship, the USS Wasp, to the Mediterranean to evacuate American citizens from Lebanon if necessary.
