To forecast whether Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) will win 15 or more gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics, let's carefully evaluate the information available:

1. **Understanding the Context of INAs**: 
   - INAs typically include athletes from countries that are not permitted to compete under their national flags, often due to sanctions or political issues, such as the Russian athletes who competed under the ROC designation in previous events.
   - Historically, INAs have performed well, especially if they hail from countries with strong Olympic traditions.

2. **Performance in Past Olympics**:
   - At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) athletes won 20 gold medals out of a total of 71 medals.
   - These numbers give a potential ceiling for what could be expected if similar circumstances apply for Paris 2024.

3. **Current Situation for Paris 2024**:
   - At this point, INAs have not been explicitly defined, but hypothetically they might comprise athletes from Russia, Belarus, or others impacted by international politics.
   - As of today, no official confirmation exists regarding the exact rules or participants competing as INAs.

4. **Potential Impact of Changes**:
   - If geopolitical situations (such as the crisis in Ukraine affecting Russian athletes) remain unresolved, INAs could have strong representation from countries banned from competing normally.
   - Depending on participation, athletic prowess, and events contested, a wide variance in performance is possible.

5. **Trends and Uncertainties**:
   - Political resolutions could affect INA participation positively or negatively.
   - Individual performances can vary broadly in any given year.

6. **Other Influencing Factors**:
   - The presence of dominant athletes or teams among INAs could boost gold medal counts.
   - International lobbying or rule changes could impact which athletes are eligible to compete as INAs.

Considering these factors, and the ability of INAs in previous similar contexts to win a significant number of medals, the probability of them winning ≥15 gold medals at Paris 2024 hinges on potential participation diversity, previous performance during restrictive conditions, and current political resolutions and decisions by the IOC.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
