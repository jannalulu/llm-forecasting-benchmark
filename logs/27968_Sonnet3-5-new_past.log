Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Pattern Analysis:
- In 2023, Taylor Swift won 9 out of her nominations
- She currently has 23 VMAs total
- She has consistently performed well at VMAs, especially in recent years

2. Current Nominations Analysis:
- Taylor Swift has 12 nominations total (initially 10, plus 2 additional in social categories)
- Most nominations are for 'Fortnight' with Post Malone
- She leads all artists in nominations

3. Positive Factors:
- Strong fan voting base (VMAs are largely fan-voted)
- Recent successful Eras Tour increasing popularity
- Current momentum in music industry
- Leading nominations historically correlates with multiple wins
- Previous year's performance (9 wins) shows recent strength

4. Risk Factors:
- Competition from other popular artists
- Possibility of vote splitting in some categories
- Not all 12 nominations may be competitive
- Historical regression to mean after big winning years
- Some categories may favor different musical styles

5. Specific Category Analysis:
- Strong chance in Video of the Year (looking for third consecutive win)
- Artist of the Year category has strong competition
- Technical categories for 'Fortnight' are competitive
- Social categories provide additional winning opportunities

6. Voting System Context:
- Fan voting system favors artists with strong fan bases
- Swift's "Swifties" are known for mobilized voting
- Voting period is still active until August 30 (except Best New Artist)

7. Current Trends:
- Continued strong popularity
- High media presence
- Strong social media engagement

Given her recent performance, current nominations, fan base strength, and voting system, winning 5 or more awards seems highly likely, but not certain. The historical pattern from 2023 (9 wins) and current momentum suggest a strong performance, but some regression should be expected.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 85.40%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%.
