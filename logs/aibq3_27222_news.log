**Deception and a Gamble: How Ukrainian Troops Invaded Russia**
Ukraine launched a surprise military offensive into Russia on August 6, 2024, with the aim of upending the dynamics of the war. The operation, planned and executed in secrecy, has pushed the limits of how Western military equipment would be permitted to be used inside Russian territory. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains, pushing 7 miles into Russia along a 25-mile front and taking dozens of Russian soldiers as prisoners. The operation has been successful so far, but analysts are skeptical that the Ukrainians can hold onto their gains. The incursion has created new vulnerabilities along the front where Ukrainian forces are already stretched thin. Videos show Ukrainian forces facing resistance at times, but there is no visual evidence of widespread losses. Ukrainian troops have been publicizing their moves, posting videos and selfies from Russian towns and villages, bragging about how they have finally taken the fight to Russia. The operation has also led to a haphazard evacuation of civilians, with many relying on each other for help. The city of Kursk has filled with people fleeing the fighting, with aid centers set up by charity groups to help those in need. 'We all have joy in our hearts,' said Oleksandr, a Ukrainian infantry soldier, 'but we realize that there are still difficult challenges ahead.'

**Full Offensive? Ukraine Is Now Taking the Fight to Russia (As In Inside Russia)**
The Ukrainian military has launched a significant offensive operation inside Russia, capturing 135 square miles of territory and advancing 15 miles into Kursk Oblast. This marks a shift from a cross-border raid to a full-blown offensive, threatening key Russian logistical lines and potentially even a nuclear facility. Russian casualties have been heavy, with over 1,140 men reportedly lost in 24 hours. Ukrainian losses are also substantial, but many wounded soldiers return to combat. The move is seen as an alternative strategy to the stalled counteroffensive along the contact line, aiming to force Russia to divert resources. As Stavros Atlamazoglou notes, 'It remains to be seen whether the Ukrainian military leadership launched the offensive just to distract the Russian forces, or if Ukraine means to establish a foothold on enemy territory and expand the contact line.'

**Russia maps show dramatic impact of Ukraine advances in 24 hours**
Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russia's Kursk region in just 24 hours, despite Russia's efforts to contain the offensive. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have 'rapidly advanced' into Kursk, with some reports suggesting they have reached as far as 22 miles into Russian territory. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Ukraine has lost nearly 1,000 servicemen and 27 armored vehicles, but ISW notes that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims.' Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the raid was intended to 'squeeze something out' of Russia and ensure Moscow bargains earnestly in future negotiations. Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, believes Ukraine's motives are likely 'building back up for another go at a counteroffensive in 2025' to try and reverse the momentum of the war and put the Russians on the backfoot. Savill also noted that there is a symbolic motive at play, with Kyiv intending to 'send a signal that they've got the stamina for a long conflict, and indeed one in which the balance will turn in their favor.'

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 10 Kilometers into Russian Kursk Region**
According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces have advanced 10 kilometers into the Russian Kursk region. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed data and confirmed the advancement of Ukrainian forces into the region. The ISW stated, 'Confirmed that on August 7, Ukrainian forces advanced 10 kilometers into the Kursk region of Russia in the context of ongoing mechanized assault operations on Russian territory.' The ISW also noted that Ukrainian forces have breached at least two Russian defensive lines and an outpost. The Russian government's reaction to Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region has been inconsistent, with officials trying to balance representing the efforts as a significant escalation by Ukraine while avoiding exaggerating the potential consequences and risking internal discontent. Some Russian 'military' bloggers have criticized the Russian military command for not preparing for Ukrainian offensive operations in the Kursk region or preventing them. Ukrainian forces have also successfully adapted their capabilities in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using a FPV-drone to shoot down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over the Kursk region. The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, estimated that the Russian offensive potential will reach its climax within 1.5-2 months, which aligns with the ISW's assessment of Russia's current offensive potential. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Daniel Bell, stated that Russia has been torturing 95% of Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russian prisons. The Central Election Commission of Moldova announced that it will not register the pro-Russian 'Victory' electoral bloc for the presidential election and referendum in October 2024. A Russian court sentenced Andriy Kurshin, the administrator of the Telegram channel of the Russian ultranationalist blogger 'Moscow Calls', to 6.5 years in prison for publishing 'fake' information about Russian military personnel. Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions south of Chasiv Yar, while Russian forces have advanced northeast of Siversk, southwest of Donetsk, and in the border areas of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 7, 2024**
Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory on August 7. The Kremlin's response to Ukrainian offensive activities in Kursk Oblast has been contradictory, with Russian officials attempting to balance presenting the effort as a notable Ukrainian escalation with avoiding overstating its potential implications and risking domestic discontent. Select Russian milbloggers have heavily criticized the Russian military command for not detecting preparations for or preventing Ukrainian offensive operations into Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have reportedly used a first-person view (FPV) drone to down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over Kursk Oblast, indicating that Ukrainian forces continue to successfully adapt their drone capabilities. Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Head Kyrylo Budanov assessed on August 7 that Russian offensive potential will culminate within one and a half to two months, generally consistent with ISW's assessment on current Russia's offensive capabilities. Head of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), Danielle Bell, stated that Russia has tortured 95 percent of Ukrainian prisoners-of-war (POWs) in Russian detention. The Moldovan Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announced on August 7 that it would not register the pro-Kremlin Victory electoral bloc in the October 2024 Moldovan presidential election and referendum. A Russian court sentenced Andrey Kurshin, administrator of the 'Moscow Calling' Russian ultranationalist milblogger Telegram channel, to six and a half years in prison on August 7 for publishing 'fake' information about the Russian military.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Operation into Russian Territory**
Ukraine's military launched a surprise operation on August 6, 2024, crossing the Russian border in the Kursk region and advancing up to 11 kilometers into Russian territory. According to the New York Times, the operation was a strategic turning point in the ongoing war, which began in February 2022. The Ukrainian forces caught the Russians off guard, and the operation has been described as a 'great gamble' by the Times. If Ukraine is able to maintain control of the territory, it could weaken Russia's military capabilities and create a bargaining chip for any future peace talks. However, if Russia is able to push the Ukrainian forces back and advance in the east, it could be seen as a victory for the Russian military and a blow to Ukraine's leadership. The Ukrainian military has been tight-lipped about the operation, with President Volodymyr Zelensky only acknowledging it publicly on Saturday. The operation has been described as a 'test of the Ukrainian military's ability to execute a complex operation in a highly contested environment.' The Ukrainian forces have been able to advance quickly, but they face significant challenges in maintaining control of the territory and defending against Russian counterattacks. As one Ukrainian officer said, 'We are facing a difficult situation, and we need to be careful not to overextend ourselves.' The operation has been seen as a significant development in the war, and it remains to be seen how it will play out in the coming days and weeks.

**Ukrainian Troops Advance 800 km2 in Russian Territory**
According to Russian sources relayed by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and analyzed by AFP on Tuesday, Ukrainian troops have advanced 800 km2 in the Russian region of Kursk. Ukraine has claimed control of 1,000 km2 of Russian territory in this border region. After months of retreat on the Eastern front, Ukraine launched its largest cross-border attack against Russia on August 6. In comparison, Russia has advanced 1,360 km2 in Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024, while Ukraine's counter-offensives on its own territory have only reclaimed 20 km2, according to AFP analysis. Ukraine's failed summer counter-offensive in 2023 allowed Kiev to retake up to 250 km2 from Russian forces in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. However, Russian advances in Ukrainian territory have not slowed since the August 6 attack: the Russian army has conquered an additional 69 km2 since then and 111 km2 in total since early August, adding to the 201 km2 taken in July. In total, Russia has taken 65,891 km2 of Ukrainian territory since the invasion on February 24, 2022. With Crimea annexed in 2014 and Eastern regions already under Russian control before the war, Russia occupies 108,070 km2, or 18% of Ukraine's internationally recognized borders.

**902nd Day of Russian Special Military Operation in Ukraine**
The Russian Armed Forces continue to conduct a special military operation in Ukraine, announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022. According to Putin, the main objectives of the operation are 'demilitarization and denazification' of the neighboring country. After over a year of confrontations, the Russian Army, along with the forces of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, has completely liberated the Lugansk People's Republic and part of the Donetsk republic, as well as the Kherson region, areas of Zaporozhie near the Azov Sea, and part of the Karkov region. In October 2022, following referendums in the regions, the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics and the Kherson and Zaporozhie regions officially joined the Russian Federation. On May 20, 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that Russian forces had taken control of the city of Artyomovsk, or Bakhmut, in Ukrainian nomenclature, an important transportation center for supplying Ukrainian troops in Donbass. In June 2023, Ukraine attempted to launch a large counteroffensive in the combat zone, but it failed for the Ukrainian Armed Forces - a fact recognized by military experts and even by Western media. In early May 2024, the Russian Army began advancing towards Karkov, with the Sever (North) troop group taking control of several localities in the area. On May 17, Putin stated that Moscow has no intention of taking Karkov, but rather creating a 'buffer zone' to protect the population of Russian border regions that are almost daily attacked by Ukrainian Armed Forces. 'We are not going to take Karkov,' Putin said. 'We are creating a buffer zone to protect the population of our border regions that are almost daily attacked by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.'

**Ukraine Regains Control of 1,000 Square Kilometers of Russian Territory**
Ukraine has taken control of 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the country's army chief Oleksandr Syrskyj. This was announced in a video shared by President Volodymyr Zelenskyj on the platform X. Ukraine launched a surprise offensive on Russian soil last week, which is reportedly the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. The offensive has reached approximately three miles into Russia. According to Russian sources, 28 areas in the region are under Ukrainian control, and 121,000 people have fled Kursk since Ukraine launched its ground offensive. Russian President Vladimir Putin claims that the offensive is an attempt by Ukraine to stop the Russian offensive in the Donbass region and to gain a better negotiating position in future talks. Zelenskyj confirmed in a video on Telegram on Monday that Ukrainian forces are operating in the Kursk region, praising the soldiers and commanders for their 'steadfastness and decisiveness'.

**Ukraine to Launch Effective Operations to Retake Crimea, Expert Says**
According to Mikhailov Amos, a Ukrainian military expert, Kyiv is certain that it will carry out effective operations to retake Crimea. Amos emphasized that Ukraine is trying to change its strategic plan to have a driving force and develop an offensive position. He stated, 'There are official comments and statements from Ukraine regarding the offensive operations it is conducting on Russian territory.' Amos added, 'The Ukrainian forces have specific targets, and these are non-standard operations that have changed the war landscape, in response to the ongoing military attacks by Russia against Donbas since October 2023.' He continued, 'For Ukraine, this is a critical matter, and it is essential to change the military equation in this war to ensure greater control by Ukrainian forces and to prevent Russian forces from advancing towards Donbas. The Ukrainian forces should start pushing forward with reserve forces and supplies to maintain control over Ukrainian territory.'

According to the governor of the Russian Belgorod region, Vjatjeslav Gladkov, the evacuation of residents in parts of the region has begun. So far, approximately 11,000 people have been evacuated, as reported by the state Russian news agency Tass. The evacuation is due to Ukrainian advances in the region, as stated by Gladkov. The Ukrainian ground offensive is said to have reached about three miles into Russian territory. This is reportedly the largest Ukrainian operation on Russian soil since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

**Ukraine's Incursion into Russian Territory: A High-Risk Operation with Unclear Objectives**
Ukraine's incursion into Russian territory has been a surprise to many, with units advancing 40 km towards the regional capital of Kursk. The operation, which has been shrouded in secrecy, has caught the Kremlin off guard. According to a Ukrainian security source, the success of the operation has been a 'cold shower' for the Russians, who are now feeling the same sense of vulnerability that Ukraine has felt since 2014. However, the accounts of wounded Ukrainian soldiers suggest that the operation has not been a cakewalk, and it remains a high-risk endeavor. The hospital where the soldiers are being treated is a grim reminder of the sacrifices made, with patients wrapped in bandages and tubes protruding from their bodies. The ultimate goal of the operation remains unclear, with some speculating that Ukraine may be trying to advance further, while others believe that the goal is to cause maximum embarrassment to Vladimir Putin. A Ukrainian security source warns that the operation should not be compared to the successful recapture of Kharkiv province in 2022, as the Russian army is now taking the war more seriously. The source also notes that the math of the war has never been in Ukraine's favor, and that the operation may have made things worse. However, the operation has boosted Ukraine's morale, which has allowed the country to defy the odds for nearly three years. 'Our bull demands a wolf,' warns the Ukrainian security source, cautioning against overly ambitious objectives.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Attack on Russian Territory**
The Ukraine has launched a surprise attack on Russian territory, with reports of Ukrainian forces advancing into the region of Kursk. Russia has responded by ordering evacuations in the region of Belgorod, which borders Kursk. The Russian Defense Ministry has reported the downing of 11 Ukrainian drones, while the US has announced that it will provide aid to help rebuild Ukraine's gas infrastructure. The situation remains fluid, with both sides trading accusations and counter-accusations. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Ukrainian attack is an attempt to regain the initiative on the battlefield, which Russia has controlled since November 2023. However, the ISW also notes that Ukraine is unlikely to be able to hold onto the territory for more than a month, as Russia will likely deploy its best units to counter the attack. Meanwhile, the US has announced that it will provide aid to help rebuild Ukraine's gas infrastructure, including the delivery of vehicles to repair the gas distribution network and equipment to restore the gas infrastructure in the region of Kherson. The situation remains tense, with both sides engaged in a propaganda war, with Russia releasing videos purporting to show successful strikes against Ukrainian forces, but which have been debunked as being filmed at other locations and times. The Ukrainian government has also announced plans to open underground schools in the city of Zaporizhzhia, which has been heavily damaged in the conflict. 'We are going to open the first schools by the end of October, that is our ambitious goal,' said the governor of the region, Ivan Fedorov. 'And today we see that we can implement this plan.'

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Campaign Against Russia**
Ukraine has launched a surprise campaign against Russia, crossing the border in the Kursk region with a significant military contingent and advancing over 10 kilometers into Russian territory. This is the first time a foreign army has invaded Russian territory since World War II. The Ukrainian advance was rapid, unexpected, and effective, led by the 22nd Mechanized Brigade and the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade, two of Ukraine's best-trained and equipped units by NATO standards. They are equipped with modern military technology, including Leopard and Abrams tanks, ATACMS missiles, and F-16 fighter jets. This move changes the scenario, as the conflict has been contained within Ukrainian borders since Russia's invasion in February 2022. Ukrainian President Zelenski said, 'Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.' The final intentions of this Ukrainian advance are unclear, but it has given Ukraine the initiative in the offensive and will force Putin to react, which could lead to unpredictable consequences. If Ukraine is successful, it could gain a powerful tool for negotiating the return of captured territory: a piece of Russia won during the summer.

**Russia Admits Ukrainian Troops Have Penetrated 30 km, Incursion Marks Deepest Since 2022 Invasion**
Russia has admitted that Ukrainian troops have penetrated 30 km into the country, marking the deepest and most significant incursion since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that its forces have clashed with Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, while the offensive in the Kursk region continues. Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, accused Kiev of 'intimidating the peaceful Russian population.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the attack for the first time, stating that Ukraine is pushing the war 'into the territory of the aggressor.' Zakharova warned that 'a harsh response will not be long in coming,' and that Ukraine 'fully understands' that the recent attacks 'make no sense from a military point of view.' Zelensky called on Ukraine's partners to take 'strong decisions to revoke restrictions on our defensive actions.' The Ukrainian President also stated that 'when Ukraine's long-range capabilities have no limits, this war will have a limit: we will be close to a more just end.' Meanwhile, an incident occurred at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with President Zelensky accusing Russian occupiers of setting a fire on the plant's territory. However, Russia claims that the fire was caused by an attack by Ukrainian forces on Energodar. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that experts have observed a strong dark smoke coming from the northern area of the Zaporizhzhia plant following multiple explosions heard in the evening. The IAEA also stated that there has been no reported impact on nuclear safety.

**Ukrainian Troops Advance 30 Kilometers into Russian Territory**
Ukrainian troops have advanced 30 kilometers into Russian territory, the deepest incursion since the conflict began in February 2022, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. This comes as the Ukrainian president, Volodimir Zelenski, said, 'We are demonstrating that we really can restore justice and guarantee the necessary pressure on the aggressor.' The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense confirmed that thousands of troops participated in the operation, more than initially reported by Russian border guards. A high-ranking Ukrainian official stated, 'We are on the offensive. Our goal is to expand the enemy's positions, inflict maximum losses, and destabilize the situation in Russia, as they cannot protect their own border.' However, the official also acknowledged that the pressure on Russian troops in the eastern front of Ukraine has not been alleviated. The incursion has boosted the morale of both the troops and the Ukrainian society, exhausted after two and a half years of Russian invasion.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 30 Kilometers into Russian Territory**
Ukrainian forces have reportedly advanced 30 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. This is the first time since the Russian invasion in February 2022 that Ukraine has sent soldiers onto Russian soil. Ukrainian troops have been fighting in the region for almost a week, and a high-ranking Ukrainian official said that thousands of soldiers are involved in the operation. 'We are in the offensive. Our goal is to expand the enemy's positions, inflict maximum losses, and destabilize the situation in Russia, as they are unable to protect their own border,' the official said. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that its forces have been fighting Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, 25-30 kilometers from the Russian-Ukrainian border. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has stated that the pressure on Russia is necessary, saying 'Russia has brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.' The situation is considered a risky move, as Ukraine may not be able to hold onto the territory in the long term without additional troops and equipment.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance into Russian Territory in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian forces have reportedly advanced 25-30 kilometers into Russian territory in the Kursk region, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. This is the first time since the Russian invasion in February 2022 that Ukraine has sent soldiers onto Russian state territory. Ukrainian troops have been fighting in the region for almost a week, and a high-ranking Ukrainian official said that thousands of soldiers are involved in the operation. 'We are in the offensive. Our goal is to expand the enemy's positions, inflict maximum losses, and destabilize the situation in Russia, as it is unable to protect its own border,' the official said. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has stated that the pressure on Russia is necessary, saying 'Russia has brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done.' The situation in the region remains tense, with heavy fighting reported in the city of Sudscha, and Ukrainian troops have been filmed taking control of administrative buildings in the region. Satellite images have also shown new defense lines being built by Russia near the Kursk nuclear power plant, which is part of the gas transport route from Russia to the EU.

**Moscow Says Ukrainian Troops Now 30 Kilometers Inside Russian Territory as Zelenskyy Admits Kursk Incursion**
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy confirmed that Kyiv was conducting a cross-border offensive into Russia, with Ukrainian forces advancing more than 10 km into the western Kursk region. Russia's defence ministry reported engagements with Ukrainian forces near towns located 25 km and 30 km from the border, marking Ukraine's deepest incursion since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Zelenskyy stated, 'Ukraine is demonstrating its ability to restore justice and apply the necessary pressure on the aggressor.' Ukrainian forces have reported capturing several settlements in the Kursk region, including Guevo, a village approximately 3 km inside Russia. A senior Ukrainian official informed the AFP news agency that the operation involved thousands of troops, significantly more than the minor incursion initially reported by Russian border guards.

**Ukraine Advances into Russian Territory, Launches Ground Offensive**
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukrainian forces have advanced three miles into Russian territory and are near the towns of Tolpino and Obsjtjy Kolodez. The Ukrainian military has launched a ground offensive, a first since the invasion began in February 2022, targeting Russian territory. Ukraine denies reports of 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers participating in the offensive, with a high-ranking official stating, 'It's false. It's thousands.' The official also clarified the purpose of the attacks: 'The goal is to stretch out the enemy's front lines, cause as many losses as possible, and destabilize the situation in Russia to the point where they can no longer defend their borders.' Ukrainian sources claim that the ground offensive is being carried out with Ukrainian resources, and that they have not informed Western allies of the plan. The Kremlin has warned of a 'powerful response' to the Ukrainian offensive, with Maria Zacharova, spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, stating, 'Kiev threatens the peaceful population of Russia. A powerful response from the Russian army will not be long in coming.' Russian forces have reportedly shot down several Ukrainian drones, with one crashing into a residential building in Kursk, injuring over a dozen people. Over 76,000 people have been evacuated in the Kursk region, with the governor urging local authorities to speed up the evacuation process.

**Ukraine Advances 30 km into Russia: Escalation Without Precedent**
The Ukrainian army has advanced up to 30 km inside Russia, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, which states that the Moscow army is facing the forces of Kiev in the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, while the offensive in the Kursk region enters its sixth day. This is the most significant and deepest incursion since Moscow began its invasion in 2022. The Russian Defense Ministry has stated that its troops have 'thwarted the attempts of enemy mobile groups with armored vehicles to penetrate deep into Russian territory.' Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, has accused Kiev of 'intimidating the peaceful Russian population.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged the attack for the first time, stating that Kiev is pushing the war 'into the territory of the aggressor.' Zelensky then said in a video message that Russia has launched over 30 missiles and 800 guided air bombs against Ukraine in the past week. 'Ukrainians are deeply grateful to all our partners who provide us with air defense systems and combat aircraft - he said -. However, to truly stop Russian terrorism, we need not only an effective air shield that can protect all our cities and communities, but also strong decisions from our partners that will eliminate restrictions on our defensive actions.'

**Ukraine Advances into Russian Territory, Marking Deepest Incursion Since 2022 Invasion**
Ukrainian forces have advanced at least 30 km into Russian territory in the Kursk region, marking the deepest and most significant incursion since Moscow launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the attack for the first time, saying that Ukraine was pushing the war 'onto the territory of the aggressor.' Zelensky praised the 'warriors' of Ukraine and said that he had discussed the operation in Russia with the country's top military commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi. The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had faced Ukrainian troops near the towns of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, while the Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region entered its sixth day. A Ukrainian official told AFP that thousands of troops were involved in the operation, much more than the initial small incursion reported by Russian border guards. The official said, 'We are on the offensive. The goal is to challenge the enemy forces, inflict maximum losses, and destabilize the situation in Russia, as they are unable to protect their own border.' The Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had 'frustrated attempts by enemy mobile groups with armored vehicles to invade deeply into Russian territory.' However, in an apparent admission that Ukrainian forces have now advanced deeply into the Kursk border region, the Russian Defense Ministry reported the involvement of Ukrainian troops near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez - which are about 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border. 'We are taking the war much closer to peace than 100 peace summits,' said Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian, praising the operation. 'When Russia needs to fight on its own territory, when the Russian people are fleeing, when people care, this is the only way to show them that they need to stop this war.' The Kursk offensive comes after weeks of Russian advances in the east, where a succession of villages was captured by Kremlin forces. Some analysts suggested that the Kursk attack is part of an effort to force Russia to redeploy forces away from eastern Ukraine and ease pressure on besieged Ukrainian defenses. However, the Ukrainian official told AFP that there had been little reduction so far in Russian operations in the east. In response to the Ukrainian attack, Moscow has retaliated. Ukrainian emergency services said that a man and his four-year-old son were killed in a missile strike in the capital during the night. Ukrainian air defenses also destroyed 53 of the 57 attack drones launched by Russia during its nighttime air raids, said authorities from the air force. Four missiles made by North Korea were also fired as part of the barrage, said. Russia was forced to turn to the isolated Asian state to re-supply its ammunition. The US said that large quantities of military equipment had been sent by Pyongyang.

**Ukraine Launches Major Cross-Border Counterattack Against Russia**
Ukraine launched a major cross-border counterattack against Russia, with clashes reported between the two sides in the Kursk region. According to reports, Ukrainian forces advanced at least 20 kilometers into the region, with the Russian Defense Ministry stating that they had sent additional troops, tanks, and artillery to the area to push back the Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the advance on Russian territory, saying that the conflict had become a 'battle for the borders' and that Ukraine was exerting pressure on the 'aggressive' side. The Kremlin declared a federal emergency in the region, with 76,000 people evacuated. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with government officials to discuss the situation in Kursk, saying that 'there are very important questions about the fight against terrorism' on the agenda. Putin also announced that 'operations to combat terrorism' would be launched in the cities of Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk. This comes after Putin stated in February 2022 that the Minsk agreements were no longer in effect. Ukraine and Russia had held peace talks in Istanbul in March 2022, but Ukraine later withdrew from the talks. In October 2022, Zelensky signed a decree banning any peace talks with Russia as long as Putin was in power. Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, when it annexed Crimea, and later supported separatist rebels in the Donbas region. In February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, citing the need to 'liberate' the country from 'Nazis'.

According to Moscow, Ukrainian forces have advanced 30 kilometers into Russian territory, marking the deepest and most significant incursion since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Ministry of Defense stated that they have engaged with Ukrainian forces near the villages of Tolbino and Obshchaya Kolodza, approximately 25 and 30 kilometers from the Russian-Ukrainian border.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance Deep into Russian Territory**
Ukrainian forces are advancing deep into Russian territory, with the city of Kursk in western Russia being a key battleground. The Ukrainian army has been conducting a surprise counterattack for five days, pushing into Russian territory. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that the fighting is ongoing and that 280 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in 24 hours, but this number has not been confirmed. It is believed that the Ukrainian forces are advancing 10 kilometers into Russian territory. This is the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 that Ukrainian forces have made it so far into Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelenskiy stated that Russia should 'feel the consequences' of its invasion. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned of the risk of a nuclear accident due to the proximity of the fighting to the Kursk nuclear power plant. Some residents of Kursk have been evacuated by train to Moscow. A witness told AFP, 'It's terrible, they're bombing.' The Russian Defense Ministry has announced that more troops with heavy weapons are being deployed to Kursk. Terrorist operations have also been launched in neighboring Belgorod and Bryansk regions. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian army has announced that it has targeted a Russian military depot, destroying hundreds of aircraft bombs. In response, Russia has targeted a shopping mall in the Ukrainian city of Kostyantynivka, killing 14 people and injuring 43. Many homes, shops, and cars were damaged. The Russian ruble also lost 2.5% of its value against the US dollar on the last trading day of the week.

**Russia Evacuates Civilians as Ukraine Intensifies Attacks**
Since the beginning of the week, Ukraine has intensified its attacks in the Russian border regions. In response, the Kremlin has organized the first population transfers to protect them from the Ukrainian invasion. On Saturday, August 10, 2024, dozens of people descended from one of the first trains taking evacuees from the Koursk region to Moscow. 'They're bombing,' said an elderly man, who did not want to give his name, about the situation on the ground. A woman from Kourtchatov, a town 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, said that while the fighting has not yet reached her town, 'the anti-aircraft defense is working hard to repel the Ukrainian bombings.' The Ukrainian army, which has been trying to push back a Russian offensive since February 2022, launched a large-scale incursion into the Russian border region of Koursk on Tuesday. Four days later, the fighting continues. 'The war has arrived, and all our relatives have left for Moscow because it's very scary,' said a woman who came to greet her relatives with her 10-year-old daughter. At least five civilians have been killed and nearly 3,000 people have been evacuated, according to Russian authorities. 'The next ones,' said a woman from Orel, a town 140 kilometers north of Koursk, 'we're afraid we'll be the next ones. Now it's Koursk. After Koursk, you know, Orel.'

**Full Offensive? Ukraine Is Now Taking the Fight to Russia (As In Inside Russia)**
The Ukrainian military has launched a significant offensive operation inside Russia, capturing 135 square miles of territory and advancing 15 miles into Kursk Oblast. This marks a shift from a cross-border raid to a full-blown offensive, threatening key Russian logistical lines and potentially even a nuclear facility. Russian casualties have been heavy, with over 1,140 men reportedly lost in 24 hours. Ukrainian losses are also substantial, but many wounded soldiers return to combat. The move is seen as an alternative strategy to the stalled counteroffensive along the contact line, aiming to force Russia to divert resources. As Stavros Atlamazoglou notes, 'It remains to be seen whether the Ukrainian military leadership launched the offensive just to distract the Russian forces, or if Ukraine means to establish a foothold on enemy territory and expand the contact line.'

**Russia maps show dramatic impact of Ukraine advances in 24 hours**
Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russia's Kursk region in just 24 hours, despite Russia's efforts to contain the offensive. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have 'rapidly advanced' into Kursk, with some reports suggesting they have reached as far as 22 miles into Russian territory. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Ukraine has lost nearly 1,000 servicemen and 27 armored vehicles, but ISW notes that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims.' Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the raid was intended to 'squeeze something out' of Russia and ensure Moscow bargains earnestly in future negotiations. Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, believes Ukraine's motives are likely 'building back up for another go at a counteroffensive in 2025' to try and reverse the momentum of the war and put the Russians on the backfoot. Savill also noted that there is a symbolic motive at play, with Kyiv intending to 'send a signal that they've got the stamina for a long conflict, and indeed one in which the balance will turn in their favor.'

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 8, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the ongoing situation in Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing into Russian territory. According to geolocated footage and Russian claims, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, with some reports indicating they are as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast. However, it is unclear if Ukrainian forces control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims. Russian milbloggers have provided conflicting reports on Ukrainian positions, with some claiming that Ukrainian forces have seized settlements while others claim that they have only advanced part of the way. The ISW notes that Ukrainian forces appear to be using novel and innovative tactics and technological capabilities during operations in Kursk Oblast, which may be a concern for the Russian military command. The Kremlin is likely to respond to the perceived threat to civilians in Kursk Oblast, and the Russian military command has several possible courses of action (COAs) it could pursue to respond to the Ukrainian operation. These COAs include using existing conscripts, Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia, and other irregular forces to push Ukrainian forces back; redeploying operational reserves to Kursk Oblast; or redeploying relatively better provisioned and more combat effective frontline units to Kursk Oblast. The ISW notes that the Russian military command's decision-making will be influenced by its perception of the size and capability of Ukrainian forces in the area, and it is unclear which COA is most likely.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Offensive in Kursk Region**
Ukraine has launched a surprise offensive in the Kursk region of Russia, with troops advancing 10-15 kilometers into Russian territory. The offensive, which began on Wednesday, has seen Ukrainian forces control the city of Sudzha and reach as far as Koronevo, 30 kilometers from the border. The Ukrainian military has reportedly used donated German Marder armored vehicles in the operation, which has been described as the largest advance since November 2022. The move has caught Russia off guard, with at least 20,000 Russian troops said to have crossed the border without warning. The Ukrainian government has not publicly stated the goals of the operation, but analysts believe it may be aimed at securing territory for future negotiations or to pressure Russia to withdraw from the Donetsk region. The operation has also raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict, with some critics arguing that Ukraine should focus on supporting its troops in the Donetsk region rather than opening a new front.

**Ukraine Launches Major Offensive into Russian Territory**
Ukraine has launched a major offensive, advancing 25 kilometers into Russian territory, capturing over 300 square kilometers and several municipalities. The operation, which began with a surprise attack, has caught the Russian military off guard. The Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Sudzha gas measurement station, a crucial route for Russian gas to Europe, and have also taken control of the railway that supplies Moscow's positions in the front line of Kharkiv. The true plans of Kiev are unclear, but some analysts believe that the operation may be an attempt to divert Russian units from the front lines to alleviate pressure on Ukrainian troops. Others believe that the operation may be an attempt to exert pressure on Vladimir Putin, demonstrating that his troops are vulnerable and capable of being defeated. The operation has also raised questions about the possibility of a negotiated peace, with Ukraine potentially using captured Russian territory as leverage. The situation is complex, and the outcome is uncertain.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 10 Kilometers into Russian Kursk Region**
According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces have advanced 10 kilometers into the Russian Kursk region. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed data and confirmed the advancement of Ukrainian forces into the region. The ISW stated, 'Confirmed that on August 7, Ukrainian forces advanced 10 kilometers into the Kursk region of Russia in the context of ongoing mechanized assault operations on Russian territory.' The ISW also noted that Ukrainian forces have breached at least two Russian defensive lines and an outpost. The Russian government's reaction to Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region has been inconsistent, with officials trying to balance representing the efforts as a significant escalation by Ukraine while avoiding exaggerating the potential consequences and risking internal discontent. Some Russian 'military' bloggers have criticized the Russian military command for not preparing for Ukrainian offensive operations in the Kursk region or preventing them. Ukrainian forces have also successfully adapted their capabilities in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using a FPV-drone to shoot down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over the Kursk region. The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, estimated that the Russian offensive potential will reach its climax within 1.5-2 months, which aligns with the ISW's assessment of Russia's current offensive potential. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Daniel Bell, stated that Russia has been torturing 95% of Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russian prisons. The Central Election Commission of Moldova announced that it will not register the pro-Russian 'Victory' electoral bloc for the presidential election and referendum in October 2024. A Russian court sentenced Andriy Kurshin, the administrator of the Telegram channel of the Russian ultranationalist blogger 'Moscow Calls', to 6.5 years in prison for publishing 'fake' information about Russian military personnel. Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions south of Chasiv Yar, while Russian forces have advanced northeast of Siversk, southwest of Donetsk, and in the border areas of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 7, 2024**
Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory on August 7. The Kremlin's response to Ukrainian offensive activities in Kursk Oblast has been contradictory, with Russian officials attempting to balance presenting the effort as a notable Ukrainian escalation with avoiding overstating its potential implications and risking domestic discontent. Select Russian milbloggers have heavily criticized the Russian military command for not detecting preparations for or preventing Ukrainian offensive operations into Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have reportedly used a first-person view (FPV) drone to down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over Kursk Oblast, indicating that Ukrainian forces continue to successfully adapt their drone capabilities. Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Head Kyrylo Budanov assessed on August 7 that Russian offensive potential will culminate within one and a half to two months, generally consistent with ISW's assessment on current Russia's offensive capabilities. Head of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), Danielle Bell, stated that Russia has tortured 95 percent of Ukrainian prisoners-of-war (POWs) in Russian detention. The Moldovan Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announced on August 7 that it would not register the pro-Kremlin Victory electoral bloc in the October 2024 Moldovan presidential election and referendum. A Russian court sentenced Andrey Kurshin, administrator of the 'Moscow Calling' Russian ultranationalist milblogger Telegram channel, to six and a half years in prison on August 7 for publishing 'fake' information about the Russian military.

**Russian Summer Offensive in Ukraine: A Mixed Bag of Success and Failure**
A recent graph by Finnish military analyst Pasi Paroinen shows that the Russian army has made significant territorial gains in Ukraine, while the Ukrainian forces' summer offensive in 2023 was largely unsuccessful. The Ukrainian forces gained around 320 square kilometers of land in three months, but most of it has been retaken by the Russians. In contrast, the Russian army has gained around 600 square kilometers of land since the start of their summer offensive in 2024. However, the Russian army has suffered heavy losses, with estimates suggesting that they lose around 1000 soldiers per day. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) concludes that the Russian summer offensive was relatively small and 'scaled back' due to the army's weakness and high losses. According to ISW expert Nico Lange, the Russian offensive was a 'disaster' that has weakened the Russian army for future attacks and wasted valuable time.

**How deep into Russian territory has Ukraine's surprise August incursion reached?  --  Meduza**
On August 6, 2024, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) entered Russian territory near the city of Sudzha in the Kursk region. The Ukrainian operation, which involved several battalions of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade, special forces, and air defense systems, deeply penetrated Russian defenses, facing weak forces. Meduza reports that the Russian military launched airstrikes using jets, helicopters, and Iskander missiles, but the Ukrainian troops continued their offensive. At least one Russian helicopter was shot down. The scale of the Ukrainian operation remains unclear, but it is evident that the Russian local territorial defenses in Kursk were caught off guard.

**Russia's Military Campaign in Ukraine: A Failure Despite Territorial Gains**
Despite gaining significant territory, Russia's military campaign in Ukraine has been deemed a failure by experts. The Russian army has made steady gains, capturing around 600 square kilometers of land between May and August 2024, but at a high cost in human lives and material. According to military analysts, Russia is suffering from high casualties, with estimates suggesting 1000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded per day. The Kremlin is also facing recruitment problems and is trying to motivate soldiers with financial incentives, as reported by the British Telegraph. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) concludes that Russia's summer offensive, despite its territorial gains, is relatively small and 'scaled back'. Instead of a large-scale attack, Russia has launched many scattered attacks, mainly in eastern Ukraine. Military analyst Nico Lange states that the Russian offensive has failed, as the Russian leadership has missed its strategic goal, suffered heavy losses, wasted valuable time, and achieved minimal territorial gains. 'This has weakened the Russians for further attacks. At least, it has cost a lot of time. You can already say that was a disaster,' Lange said.

**Russian Summer Offensive in Ukraine: A Mixed Bag of Gains and Losses**
A recent graph by Finnish military analyst Pasi Paroinen shows that the Russian army has made significant territorial gains in the Ukraine, while the Ukrainian forces have made minimal progress. The Ukrainian army's summer offensive in 2023 resulted in a gain of approximately 320 square kilometers, but most of these areas are now under Russian control. In contrast, the Russian army has made steady progress since the start of their announced offensive in the spring of 2024, gaining around 600 square kilometers. However, the Russian army has suffered heavy losses, with estimates suggesting 1000 casualties per day. Military analyst Nico Lange stated, 'The Russian offensive was a disaster.' The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) concluded that the Russian summer offensive was relatively small and 'abbreviated' despite significant territorial gains.

**Putin humiliated as Ukraine saboteurs launch surprise assault deep in Russian territory**
Approximately 300 Ukrainian soldiers launched a surprise cross-border attack into Russian territory on Tuesday, reaching as far as six miles (10 km) inside Russia, according to Moscow. The attack, which was bolstered by 11 tanks and more than 20 armored fighting vehicles, was initiated at 8am and persisted throughout the day between the border villages of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya in Russia's Kursk region. Russian claims of successfully repelling the incursion were quickly proved false, with reports from Russian military bloggers and social media footage indicating the Ukrainian attack was highly significant. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the anti-disinformation department at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, acknowledged the attack's occurrence, suggesting it had not been fully defeated. Military analysts suggest the attack could aim to divert Russian forces to defend an underactive part of the front since spring 2022 and boost Ukrainian morale. However, critics in Ukraine argue such assaults yield no long-term military advantage.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 6, 2024**
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted a series of cross-border raids into Kursk Oblast on August 6, but Russian milbloggers largely dismissed the claims. Ukrainian officials have largely yet to comment on the raids. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu heavily overexaggerated Russian advances in Ukraine since mid-June 2024, stating that Russian forces have seized 420 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory, when in fact ISW has observed evidence confirming that Russian forces have seized approximately 290 square kilometers since June 14. Russian officials continue coordination and military cooperation with Iran ahead of the Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel out of concern for Russian interests in the region. Armenia continues to abstain from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russian forces advanced east of Toretsk, and fighting continued in various areas of Ukraine, including Kharkiv Oblast, Luhansk Oblast, and Donetsk Oblast.

**Russia's Summer Offensive Failure**
Russia is unlikely to launch a new, coordinated offensive along the hundreds of miles of front lines in eastern Ukraine this summer, according to Kyiv authorities and Western analysis. Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency, said, 'A repeat of a broad offensive along the entire front line, like in February 2022, is out of the question for now.' Russia has slowly gained territory in eastern Ukraine, claiming the Donetsk city of Avdiivka in February 2024, but analysts and officials say Moscow is waging an attritional war, hoping to grind down opposition fighters and Kyiv's reserves of equipment. Ukraine receives significant aid from its Western backers, including military vehicles, but there are pressing questions over the future of military aid deliveries should former President Donald Trump clinch victory in the U.S. elections later this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that F-16 fighter jets, donated by at least one of Kyiv's supporter countries, were already operational. A large-scale offensive from Russia could be more likely next year, suggested Nick Reynolds, a research fellow in land warfare at the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank.

**Russian War Strategy: A War of Exhaustion**
According to Austrian Colonel Markus Reisner, the Russian army's operational goal is to stretch the Ukrainian army's active line, tie them down, and force them to redeploy valuable reserves to Kharkiv, while advancing on the Donbas. On a strategic level, the goal is to exhaust Ukraine using air strikes on critical infrastructure. Reisner divided the full-scale war into seven phases. The first phase, from February to March 2022, saw Ukrainian success. The second phase, starting in April 2022, marked the beginning of the war of exhaustion. The third phase saw Ukrainian counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson in September-October 2022. The fourth phase was Russia's reinforcement from November 2022 to April 2023, attempting to activate with strategic air strikes. The fifth phase was Ukraine's unsuccessful summer offensive from May to October 2023. The sixth phase saw Russia's attempt to regain momentum from November 2023 to February 2024. The seventh phase, starting in March 2024, is Russia's summer offensive, which involves stretching Ukrainian forces. Reisner noted that the start of this phase was Russia's advance on the territory north of Kharkiv. He believes that Russia's goal is to divert Ukrainian forces from the Donbas and ensure that reserves are not deployed there. Reisner also stated that Russia has significantly increased the number of troops involved, with around 650,000 Russian soldiers, of which around 520,000 are on the front lines, trying to advance, primarily on the Donbas. He emphasized that the war is a war of exhaustion, and that even if little seems to be happening on the front lines, the war's progression is determined by resource expenditure.

**Russia's Operational Goal: Stretching the Ukrainian Front Line**
According to Austrian Colonel Markus Raisner, the current operational goal of Russia is to stretch the Ukrainian front line, tie down Ukrainian forces, and force them to redeploy valuable reserves to the Kharkiv region. This would allow Russia to make progress on the Donbas front. Raisner believes that this is the seventh phase of the war, which began in March 2024, and is characterized by the Russian army's attempt to exhaust Ukraine through air strikes on critical infrastructure. He also notes that the war is being fought on a seven-phase plan, with the first phase being Ukraine's successful defense, and the second phase being the war of exhaustion from April to August 2022. The third phase was Ukraine's counteroffensive in September-October 2022, and the fourth phase was Russia's reinforcement during the winter of 2022-2023. The fifth phase was Ukraine's unsuccessful summer offensive in May-October 2023, and the sixth phase was Russia's second winter offensive in November 2023-February 2024.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, July 27, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has released its Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment for July 27, 2024. The report highlights several key developments in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian forces have reportedly conducted successful drone strikes against Russian military airfields and an oil refinery in Saratov, Ryazan, and Murmansk oblasts. Russia continues to deepen its relations with Iran and North Korea, with Iran set to launch its 'Hod Hod' and 'Kosar' satellites into low earth orbit from a Russian station in October 2024. The report also notes that Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions near Toretsk and Russian forces have advanced west and southwest of Donetsk City. The ISW assesses that Russian forces are continuing to push Ukrainian forces back from the international border with Belgorod Oblast and approach to within tube artillery range of Kharkiv City.

**Ukraine's War Effort: Challenges and Prospects**
According to military expert Pavel Narozhny, Ukraine's army will have to continue defending on the Donbass front for a long time, while in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be able to launch an offensive and liberate occupied territories from Russia. Narozhny listed the current problems in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including the slow pace of mobilization, the slow delivery of promised weapons, and the threat of Russian aviation. He noted that the flow of mobilized personnel will be felt in October 2024, and that Ukraine lacks the ability to shoot down Russian planes. The expert also stated that the transfer of F-16s is taking too long and will not happen before the end of 2024. He predicted that the situation on the front will be difficult, with the possibility of Ukrainian forces retreating and losing territory. However, he believes that by spring 2025, Ukraine may be able to regain the initiative, with the possibility of launching an offensive, striking at Russia, and liberating occupied territories.

**Ukraine's War Effort: Challenges and Prospects**
According to military expert Pavel Narozhny, the Ukrainian army will have to continue defending on the Donbas front for a long time, while in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian military will soon be able to launch an offensive and liberate occupied Russian territories. Narozhny listed three main problems facing the Ukrainian army: the slow pace of mobilization, the slow arrival of promised partner weapons, and the threat of Russian aviation. He stated that the mobilization process will be felt in October 2024, and that Ukraine lacks the ability to shoot down Russian planes. The expert also noted that Ukraine has been negotiating the transfer of F-16s for too long and that the situation will not be resolved until the end of the fall.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update July 16, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Ukrainian drone strikes continue to pressure Russia's air defense umbrella, forcing the Russian military to prioritize allocating limited air defense assets to high-value targets. Ukrainian forces are targeting Russian air defense systems in occupied Ukraine and Russia's border areas to prepare for the arrival of F-16 fighter jets in Summer-Fall 2024. The Russian 235th Garrison Military Court released former 58th Combined Arms Army Major General Ivan Popov from pre-detention and placed him under house arrest until October 11. Armenian police detained a Russian citizen at the request of Russian authorities amid deteriorating Armenian-Russian relations. An investigation found that approximately 650,000 people left Russia following the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and have not returned. Russian forces advanced northwest of Avdiivka, and the government is improving its bureaucratic mobilization and conscription systems.
