Nate: "Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status. With his strong polling at 9.5% and that impressive $98 million war chest, there was very little chance he'd suspend."

Tetlock: "Indeed, Nate. Our models gave it just a 12.45% probability of him dropping out before September 24th. The fundraising numbers were particularly telling - you don't raise that kind of money to quit."

Nate: "Exactly. And with him potentially being a kingmaker in such a tight race between Biden and Trump, the incentive to stay in was enormous. The polls showing him at nearly 10% - that's historic for an independent candidate."

Tetlock: "The data was clear. He had both the resources and voter support to justify staying in until the end. Our models factored in his October 2023 party switch and his March VP pick - all indicators of a committed campaign."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Kennedy's campaign status."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given his strong polling at 9.5% and that impressive $98 million war chest, our models gave only a 12.45% chance he'd suspend before September 24th. The numbers suggested he'd stay in."

Nate: "The fundraising was key. No third-party candidate has ever raised that much and dropped out this close to the election. Plus, with Biden at 40% and Trump at 42%, Kennedy knew he could be kingmaker."

Tetlock: "Exactly. His base remained surprisingly stable too. The model factored in historical third-party campaign patterns, but Kennedy's anti-establishment message and name recognition made him uniquely positioned to maintain momentum through September."

Nate: "Another win for the superforecasters. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right one."

Nate: "Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking at the data up to August 12th, our models gave it just a 12.5% chance he'd suspend his campaign before September 24th."

Nate: "The strong fundraising numbers - $98 million - and that consistent 9.5% polling were key indicators. That's remarkable for an independent candidate."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The data suggested he was building momentum, not losing it. His campaign infrastructure with Nicole Shanahan as VP pick showed long-term planning."

Nate: "And with both Trump and Biden polling below 45%, Kennedy had every incentive to stay in as a potential kingmaker."

Tetlock: "Sometimes the simplest prediction is the right one - a well-funded campaign with steady polls typically doesn't fold late in the game."

Nate: "Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status. Given his strong polling at 9.5% and that massive $98 million war chest, the probability of him dropping out was incredibly low."

Tetlock: "Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 12% likelihood of suspension before September 24th. The independent run announcement last October really cemented his commitment. Plus, those March polls with his VP pick Shanahan showed his serious intention to stay in the race."

Nate: "Exactly. With Biden at 40% and Trump at 42%, Kennedy knows he's positioned to be a major factor in November. The data suggested he'd ride this out – he's not your typical third-party candidate who fades away."

Tetlock: "The fundraising numbers alone told us he had staying power. Sometimes the simplest prediction is the right one."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status."

Phil: "No surprise there. Based on the data we had up to August 12th, our models gave it a 12.4% chance he'd suspend his campaign before September 24th."

Nate: "The fundraising numbers were particularly telling. With $98 million raised and consistent polling around 9.5% - unprecedented for an independent - there was little incentive for him to drop out."

Phil: "Exactly. The only scenario where he might have suspended was if his support completely collapsed or if there was massive pressure from one of the major parties. But with those poll numbers holding steady..."

Nate: "And let's not forget his running mate announcement with Shanahan. That kind of commitment signaled his intention to stay in through November."
