SCENE: A dimly lit office at Columbia University, September 18, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing market data.

NATE: (looking at charts) Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about the Warren Buffett Indicator.

PHILIP: Indeed. With the last major tech correction and the Fed's continued hawkish stance, our models gave it only a 12.3% chance of crossing 200% by September 17th.

NATE: (nodding) The July 2024 peak at 196.2% was the closest it got. The combination of rising interest rates and slower GDP growth made it mathematically improbable to reach 200%.

PHILIP: Remember when Buffett himself warned about "playing with fire" at these levels? Even with all the AI hype and market optimism, the fundamentals just weren't there.

NATE: (smiling) Another win for systematic forecasting. Sometimes the most valuable prediction is knowing what won't happen.

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the Warren Buffett Indicator."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the data we had until August 20th, our models gave it a 32% chance of exceeding 200% by September 17th. The market cap to GDP ratio was hovering around 196% in early July, but the combination of rising interest rates and market volatility kept it below the threshold."

Nate: "The historical context was crucial here. Even during the dot-com bubble, when Buffett first warned about this indicator, we rarely saw sustained periods above 200%. And with the Fed's hawkish stance through 2024..."

Philip: *interrupting* "Exactly. The economic fundamentals just weren't there for such extreme market valuations."

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a modern office, surrounded by screens displaying financial data.

NATE
(reviewing charts)
Well, Phil, the Warren Buffett Indicator didn't cross 200% by yesterday's deadline. Our models were pretty confident about this.

PHILIP
Indeed. Given the market conditions we observed until August 20th, our models had it at 12.3%. The July 8th reading of 196.2% was concerning, but the combination of rising GDP and market volatility made crossing 200% unlikely.

NATE
The Fed's hawkish stance and global economic headwinds played a big role. Even Buffett himself warned about playing with fire at these levels.

PHILIP
(nodding)
True. And historically, whenever we've approached these levels, market forces tend to create natural resistance points.

Philip: [nodding] "Our models had it at 32.4%. The July 8th reading of 196.2% was the closest it got, but the market cap to GDP ratio couldn't push through that final resistance."

Nate: "Makes sense. After the Fed's continued hawkish stance and that tech sector correction in August, valuations were bound to moderate."

Philip: "Precisely. Even with all the AI hype, the fundamentals couldn't justify pushing beyond the 200% threshold. Buffett's original warning about playing with fire near these levels proved prescient."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting. Want to grab coffee?"
