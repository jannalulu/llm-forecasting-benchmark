Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks about geomagnetic storms during a specific 12-day period (July 17-28, 2024), looking for Kp values specifically >4 and ≤5.

2. Key considerations:
- Geomagnetic storms are somewhat predictable in the short term but harder to predict weeks ahead
- Solar cycle 25 is currently approaching its peak, suggesting increased solar activity
- Mid-July typically sees moderate geomagnetic activity
- A Kp index between 4 and 5 represents a minor to moderate geomagnetic storm
- The narrow range (>4 to ≤5) makes this specific outcome less likely than a broader range

3. Historical patterns suggest:
- During solar maximum periods, Kp values >4 occur relatively frequently
- The specific range of >4 to ≤5 occurs in roughly 20-30% of moderate storm events
- The 12-day window provides enough time for at least one storm event
- However, many storms either stay below Kp 4 or exceed Kp 5

4. Given the current solar cycle phase and the specific time window, but considering the narrow Kp range:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.20%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%.
