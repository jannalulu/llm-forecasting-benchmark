To address the question of whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, I will systematically analyze the relevant factors and developments, referencing existing forecasts and appropriate base rates, and adjusting my estimation based on the available evidence.

1. **Reference Classes and Historical Context**:
   Historically, establishing diplomatic relations between countries with longstanding contentious issues—such as Saudi Arabia and Israel—requires complex negotiations and significant geopolitical shifts. Prior instances, like Israel's normalization with the UAE via the Abraham Accords, offer a precedent, albeit under somewhat different conditions.

2. **Evidence Review and Key Factors**:
   - **Political Stances**: Recent statements from Saudi officials emphasize that normalization will not occur at the expense of Palestinian rights. The insistence on recognizing a Palestinian state and establishing a ceasefire in Gaza are significant hurdles.
   - **Geopolitical Dynamics**: Despite ongoing mediation by the US, and the strategic importance both parties place on normalization, the window for a near-term agreement seems constrained. News reports suggest potential normalization is unlikely before the US presidential elections in November due to stalled talks and the current focus on the Gaza conflict.
   - **Recent Developments**: The US and Saudi Arabia are reported to be close to a defense agreement, potentially linked to Israel-Saudi normalization. However, given the need for complex prerequisites and current political stances, it is still an ambitious goal within the given timeframe.

3. **Forecasting and Estimation**:
   - **Base Rate**: The normalization of relations of this nature is rare and tends to occur over extended timelines. The current political impasse, along with Saudi Arabia’s conditions regarding Palestine, weigh against a quick resolution.
   - **Adjustments**: While there is diplomatic willingness and strategic interest, significant hurdles suggest a lower likelihood of diplomatic relations being established in the stipulated timeframe.

4. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - The inside view suggests ongoing efforts and strategic motivation; however, the outside view points toward larger geopolitical complexities and requires concessions that both nations seem unlikely to meet quickly.

5. **Degree of Doubt and Confidence**:
   While there are ongoing negotiations and a recognized strategic interest in normalization, key obstacles and the current geopolitical situation contribute to a significant degree of uncertainty.

Based on this analysis, I will assign a weight to the probability that Saudi Arabia and Israel will establish diplomatic relations before September 30, 2024. My judgment is informed by the clashing forces of strategic interest versus substantial political and ideological barriers.

My Prediction: 25.00% being the most likely, with 75.00% confidence. Probability: 25.00%.

To forecast whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, we must evaluate historical trends, news reports, regional dynamics, and international negotiations. Let's break it down into component steps.

**1. Historical Context and Base Rate Analysis:**
Historically, peacemaking and normalization agreements in the Middle East, such as those under the Abraham Accords, have required significant diplomatic effort and often hinge on the geopolitical climate. Israel has previously successfully normalized ties with UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, indicating a precedent for such agreements. 

**2. Recent Developments:**
Recent reports highlight significant obstacles to a Saudi-Israeli normalization agreement. Saudi Arabia insists on conditions involving the Palestinian issue, which Israel currently rejects. Reports from credible sources such as Saudi's ambassador to the UK emphasize that Saudi Arabia will not normalize relations without explicit recognition of a Palestinian state according to the 1967 borders.

There is lobbying involving the U.S., which is trying to broker a defense agreement as part of a diplomatic strategy involving Saudi Arabia and Israel. However, negotiations have stalled primarily due to ongoing conflicts and disagreements over Palestinian statehood, as indicated by multiple news articles.

**3. International and Regional Dynamics:**
The regional climate is tense, with ongoing conflicts in Gaza influencing any potential bilateral talks. Additionally, Saudi Arabia's recent strengthening of ties with Iran suggests a complex geopolitical landscape. Saudi Arabia's public and diplomatic positions focus on Palestinian rights, making a swift normalization with Israel unlikely without significant shifts in these areas.

**4. Recent Influence of External Mediation:**
While the U.S. is attempting to mediate, the effect of U.S. intervention is uncertain. The need for significant Senate votes for defense treaties, coupled with Israeli reluctance to make concessions to Palestinians, presents further obstacles.

**5. Conclusion and Probability Judgement:**
Given the comprehensive assessment, the historical precedents, and the current regional dynamics, I conclude that the probability of Saudi Arabia normalizing diplomatic relations with Israel by the given date is relatively low. The conditions currently required by Saudi Arabia — notably concerning the Palestinian issue — do not appear to be imminently resolvable under the current geopolitical conditions.

My Prediction: 20.00% being the most likely, with 80.00% confidence. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, let's consider the relevant factors, base rates, and the information available up to this point.

1. **Historical Context and Base Rates**: Diplomatic normalization of relationships between Arab states and Israel has been historically rare but has occurred more recently. The Abraham Accords facilitated normalization with the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan, suggesting a precedent for further regional involvement. However, Saudi Arabia is distinct with additional complexities given its leadership status in the Arab world and its historical stance on Palestinian statehood.

2. **Current Situation**: The diplomatic efforts and negotiations have been frozen due to the ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza, as corroborated by multiple sources. Saudi Arabia has maintained that recognition of a Palestinian state is a precondition for any such normalization, which remains a point of contention with Israel.

3. **Ongoing Negotiations**: Recent reports indicate that the US has been mediating a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia that could be linked to normalization, though the timeline appears constrained, and the complexities of regional politics, including Iran's influence, could further complicate these negotiations.

4. **Geopolitical Pressure and Incentives**: Both internal and external pressures exist. The US desires normalization to strengthen regional alliances, counterbalancing Chinese influence in the Middle East. Additionally, Saudi Arabia seeks assurances about its security and the development of its civilian nuclear program. Yet, the steadfast public stance on Palestinian statehood might delay such progress.

5. **Recent Developments**: High-profile reports and statements have surfaced as of July 2024, suggesting normalization is still possible, though many doubt its near-term viability given electoral and military considerations. The US elections are a referenced pivot point, with broad agreement that developments are more likely post-election.

6. **Current Forecasting Trends**: Platforms like Metaculus consistently capture the evolving sentiment and probabilities. As of the latest available updates, there's an increased likelihood anticipated in the medium to long term, contingent on broader geopolitical shifts and resolutions in ongoing conflicts—though less favorable in the immediate months.

7. **Causal Forces**: Clashing motivations between regional stability, power projection, the Palestinian issue, and Israel's security concerns serve as critical separators. The absence of resolution or substantial movement in these areas aligns with skepticism about immediate progress.

Balancing the evidence, including historical trends, current geopolitical standpoints, and timeline constraints, a cautious outlook reflects that while diplomatic relations may evolve post-election and conflict resolution, the short-term (by September 30, 2024) looks less promising.

**Analysis and Forecasting**

1. **Reference Class and Base Rate:** Historically, diplomatic normalization between countries that have long-standing tensions is rare and a complex process. The Abraham Accords, which involved several Arab countries normalizing relations with Israel, serve as a somewhat comparable reference point, though Saudi Arabia's involvement adds additional complexities due to its regional influence and stance on the Palestinian issue.

2. **Current Trends and Evidence:**
   - Saudi Arabia has consistently stated that normalization with Israel is contingent upon the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, which is a significant hurdle given the current Israeli government's position.
   - The United States' involvement as a mediator and the potential for a defense agreement indicates a strong interest in pushing for normalization. However, structural obstacles such as the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the necessity for meaningful Israeli concessions make swift progress challenging.
   - Recent articles and statements from key figures suggest that any diplomatic agreement may not be realized before the US presidential elections in November 2024. The Saudi requirement for Israel to recognize a Palestinian state and cease hostilities in Gaza remains a significant barrier.

3. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views:**
   - The outside view (historical patterns) suggests low frequency of successful normalization under tense geopolitical conditions.
   - The inside view (current dynamics and statements) aligns with this, indicating unresolved core issues related to the Palestinian state and regional conflicts.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - *Positive Forces:* US strategic interest in fostering relations, potential economic and security benefits for Saudi Arabia and Israel, common strategic goals (e.g., countering Iran).
   - *Negative Forces:* Strong domestic and regional opposition within Saudi Arabia and Israel regarding the terms of normalization, particularly without substantive progress on Palestinian sovereignty.

5. **Near-term Future and Probabilities:**
   - The current state of affairs does not suggest imminent resolution. With strong Saudi prerequisites unmet, significant Israeli reluctance, and limited time frame (by end of September 2024), probability of achieving a formal diplomatic agreement in the immediate future remains low to moderate.

**Conclusion:**
Given the historical context, the complexity of Saudi-Israeli relations, and the recent reinforcement of conditions by Saudi officials, the estimation leans towards a cautious probability that diplomatic normalization will be announced by the specified deadline.

My Prediction: 20.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether Saudi Arabia will establish diplomatic relations with Israel before September 30, 2024, let's start by synthesizing the information and trends from the presented articles and broader geopolitical context.

**Base Rate Considerations:**
Historically, diplomatic relations between countries in the Middle East, especially involving Israel and Arab nations, occur infrequently and usually rely on significant geopolitical shifts or outside incentives. The Abraham Accords were a recent breakthrough demonstrating that under certain conditions, normalization is possible. However, Saudi Arabia possesses a unique position due to its influence over the Islamic world and its strategic importance.

**Current Context:**
1. **Saudi Arabia's Preconditions**: Repeated emphasis on the requirement for Palestinian statehood and Israel's recognition of such is a significant barrier. Multiple statements from Saudi officials stress this point, making it a firm stance that Israel currently opposes, particularly under Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is against a Palestinian state.

2. **External Diplomatic Efforts**: The U.S. is heavily involved in trying to broker an agreement, offering defense treaties and support for Saudi Arabia's nuclear program. However, these efforts hinge on significant Israeli concessions regarding Palestine, which appear unlikely before the U.S. elections.

3. **Internal and Regional Dynamics**: The ongoing conflict in Gaza and the widespread regional opposition to normalization without significant Palestinian concessions act as strong inhibitors.

4. **Political Timing**: The U.S. presidential election complicates the timing. There is a window of opportunity perceived by some to achieve a deal before the elections, but this is heavily dependent on aligning the diverse political and regional interests, which seems unfeasible given the current deadlock.

5. **Recent Signals**: While there are signals of diplomatic movement, such as ongoing U.S. and Saudi communications and some talks, the substantial requirement that Saudi Arabia sets—Palestinian statehood—remains unmet.

**Adjusting the Probability:**
Given the strong emphasis on the Palestinian condition by Saudi Arabia, the consistent lack of flexibility from Israel, and the geopolitical actions required (such as U.S. backing and Senate approval), the probability of establishing relations by the deadline appears limited despite ongoing diplomatic efforts.

**Forecast Considerations:**
- **For Lower Probability**: Repeated firm demands by Saudi Arabia on the Palestinian issue without any sign of Israeli willingness to concede, combined with the complication of a soon to be determining U.S. election, tilt the scale towards a likelihood of "No" for the resolution of the question. 

- **For Higher Probability**: Any drastic shift in Israeli politics or an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough with U.S. facilitation could increase the probability, though current trends show minimal signs leading towards such outcomes.

**Analysis Conclusion:**
The political and diplomatic markers currently suggest that despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, significant roadblocks remain entrenched, making diplomatic relations before September 30, 2024, improbable.

My Prediction: 30.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 30.00%.

Historically, diplomatic relations between countries in the Middle East, especially involving Israel and Arab nations, occur infrequently and usually rely on significant geopolitical shifts or outside incentives. The Abraham Accords were a recent breakthrough demonstrating that under certain conditions, normalization is possible. However, Saudi Arabia possesses a unique position due to its influence over the Islamic world and its strategic importance.

**Current Context:**
1. **Saudi Arabia's Preconditions**: Repeated emphasis on the requirement for Palestinian statehood and Israel's recognition of such is a significant barrier. Multiple statements from Saudi officials stress this point, making it a firm stance that Israel currently opposes, particularly under Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is against a Palestinian state.

2. **External Diplomatic Efforts**: The U.S. is heavily involved in trying to broker an agreement, offering defense treaties and support for Saudi Arabia's nuclear program. However, these efforts hinge on significant Israeli concessions regarding Palestine, which appear unlikely before the U.S. elections.

3. **Internal and Regional Dynamics**: The ongoing conflict in Gaza and the widespread regional opposition to normalization without significant Palestinian concessions act as strong inhibitors.

4. **Political Timing**: The U.S. presidential election complicates the timing. There is a window of opportunity perceived by some to achieve a deal before the elections, but this is heavily dependent on aligning the diverse political and regional interests, which seems unfeasible given the current deadlock.

5. **Recent Signals**: While there are signals of diplomatic movement, such as ongoing U.S. and Saudi communications and some talks, the substantial requirement that Saudi Arabia sets—Palestinian statehood—remains unmet.

**Adjusting the Probability:**
Given the strong emphasis on the Palestinian condition by Saudi Arabia, the consistent lack of flexibility from Israel, and the geopolitical actions required (such as U.S. backing and Senate approval), the probability of establishing relations by the deadline appears limited despite ongoing diplomatic efforts.

**Forecast Considerations:**
- **For Lower Probability**: Repeated firm demands by Saudi Arabia on the Palestinian issue without any sign of Israeli willingness to concede, combined with the complication of a soon to be determining U.S. election, tilt the scale towards a likelihood of "No" for the resolution of the question. 

- **For Higher Probability**: Any drastic shift in Israeli politics or an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough with U.S. facilitation could increase the probability, though current trends show minimal signs leading towards such outcomes.

**Analysis Conclusion:**
The political and diplomatic markers currently suggest that despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, significant roadblocks remain entrenched, making diplomatic relations before September 30, 2024, improbable.

My Prediction: 30.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 30.00%.
