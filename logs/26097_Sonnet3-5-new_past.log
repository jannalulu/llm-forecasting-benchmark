Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 12, 2024, BSE SENSEX is at 80,519.34
- It has shown significant volatility in recent weeks
- The target range is 76,000-77,000

2. Recent Trends:
- July 12: 80,519.34 (+0.78%)
- July 11: 79,897.34 (+0.03%)
- July 10: 79,924.77 (-0.53%)
- Current trend shows the index above 79,000

3. Historical Analysis:
- The index has been consistently trading above 76,000 since June
- Last time it was in 76,000-77,000 range was in early June (76,693.36)
- Has shown strong upward momentum since then

4. Key Factors:
- Market showing resilience at higher levels
- Strong year-on-year growth (23.22%)
- Recent volatility but maintaining levels above 79,000
- Nine days until target date

5. Analysis for Target Range (76,000-77,000):
Positive factors:
- Historical volatility suggests large movements possible
- Profit booking at higher levels could trigger decline

Negative factors:
- Current level (80,519.34) is significantly above target range
- Strong upward momentum
- Would require ~4.5% decline in 9 days
- No immediate negative triggers visible

6. Probability Assessment:
- Given current trends and momentum, a fall to 76,000-77,000 range appears unlikely
- Would require significant negative event or sharp correction
- Historical patterns suggest index tends to consolidate rather than sharp falls

My Prediction: Between 8.50% and 12.50%, with 10.25% being the most likely. Probability: 10.25%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 12, 2024, BSE SENSEX closed at 80,519.34
- This represents a 0.78% gain from the previous day
- The index has shown significant volatility in recent weeks

2. Recent Trends:
- July 12: 80,519.34
- July 11: 79,897.34
- July 10: 79,924.77
- Previous weeks showed range between 76,693 (early June) to 80,519 (current)

3. Analysis:
For SENSEX to be between 76,000 and 77,000 on July 21:
- Would require a decline of approximately 4.4-5.6% from current levels
- The index has been consistently trading above 79,000 in recent days
- No major negative catalysts are visible in the immediate future
- Market has shown strong upward momentum with support at higher levels

4. Supporting factors for the target range:
- Historical volatility shows possibility of significant moves
- Profit booking after recent highs
- Some technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions

5. Factors against the target range:
- Strong upward momentum
- Current levels significantly higher (>80,000)
- Recent support levels above 79,000
- Positive market sentiment
- No immediate negative triggers visible

6. Time consideration:
- Only 9 days until target date
- Limited time for such a significant downward movement
- Recent trend shows stability at higher levels

Given these factors, particularly the current level being significantly higher and strong upward momentum, the probability of SENSEX being specifically between 76,000 and 77,000 on July 21 appears quite low.

My Prediction: Between 8.50% and 12.50%, with 10.25% being the most likely. Probability: 10.25%.

4. Key Factors:
- Strong market momentum currently
- Recent trading range has been between 79,400-80,900

- Current level is significantly above target range (76k-77k)
- Would require ~4-5% decline in 9 days to reach target range
- Recent volatility has been relatively contained within 1-2% daily ranges

4. Arguments For Target Range:
- Market might see profit booking after recent highs
- Some technical indicators might suggest overvaluation
- Historical patterns show periodic corrections

5. Arguments Against Target Range:
- Strong upward momentum
- Current level (80.5k) is too far from target range
- No immediate negative triggers visible
- Recent support levels are well above 77k

6. Analysis:
- For Sensex to fall to 76k-77k range:

Given the current level of 80,519.34, strong upward momentum, and limited time frame, the probability of Sensex specifically falling to and closing within the 76k-77k range on July 21 is very low. The market would need to fall by approximately 4-5% and then stay specifically within that 1,000-point range, which is highly improbable given current conditions.

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 7.50%, with 5.25% being the most likely. Probability: 5.25%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of July 12, 2024, BSE Sensex closed at 80,519.34
- The index has been showing high volatility recently
- There's been significant upward momentum in recent months

2. Recent Trends:
- July 12: 80,519.34
- July 11: 79,897.34
- July 10: 79,924.77
- Past week: +0.65%
- Year-to-date high: Around 80,893.51

3. Key Factors to Consider:
- Strong upward momentum continues
- Current level is significantly above target range (76k-77k)
- Would require ~4-5% decline in 9 days to reach target range
- Recent volatility has been relatively contained within 1-2% daily ranges

4. Arguments For Target Range:
- Market might see profit booking after recent highs
- Some technical indicators might suggest overvaluation
- Historical patterns show periodic corrections

5. Arguments Against Target Range:
- Strong upward momentum
- Current level (80.5k) is too far from target range
- No immediate negative triggers visible
- Recent support levels are well above 77k

6. Analysis:
- For Sensex to fall to 76k-77k range:
  * Would need significant negative event
  * Requires breaking multiple support levels
  * Goes against current momentum
  * Very short timeframe (9 days)
- Current trajectory and momentum suggest staying above 77k is highly likely
- Probability of such a specific range (76k-77k) is further reduced by the narrow band
