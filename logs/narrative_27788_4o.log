INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation as the SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a large screen displaying Tesla's delivery numbers.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in chair)  
So, it’s official. Tesla reported 455,000 deliveries for Q3 2024. Our models had it at 75.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The increase makes sense. The new factory ramp-up in Texas and the Model Y's popularity in Europe were key factors.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to screen)  
And let’s not forget the tax incentives in the U.S. Our models factored those in, boosting the probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
It’s always satisfying when the numbers align with reality. The data from August was spot on.

They exchange knowing glances, the air thick with the validation of their expertise.

FADE OUT.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LIAM, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
So, did it happen? 

LIAM  
(nods)  
Tesla reported 450,000 deliveries. Our models had it at 85.75%. 

JANE  
(sips coffee)  
Not surprising. They bounced back after Q1. 

LIAM  
True. The production ramp-up in Austin and Berlin was key. 

JANE  
And the new Model 3 update? 

LIAM  
Exactly. Plus, the tax incentives in Europe. 

JANE  
(smiling)  
Our models nailed it again. 

LIAM  
(chuckles)  
Yeah, but remember last year’s Q3 dip? We had that at 5.25%. 

JANE  
(nods)  
Tesla's unpredictability keeps us on our toes. 

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with another accurate prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
