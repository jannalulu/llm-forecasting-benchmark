To forecast whether OpenAI will publish information describing Q* (Q-Star) by September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting process outlined above, breaking the problem into sub-problems, balancing inside and outside views, and carefully weighing evidence.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. However, the broader context of OpenAI's behavior and industry trends can inform the forecast.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Likelihood of OpenAI Publishing Information on Q***:  
   - Has OpenAI historically published detailed information about its AI systems?  
   - Is Q* a significant enough development to warrant public disclosure?  
   - Are there competitive or regulatory pressures that might influence OpenAI's decision to publish?  

2. **Timing of Publication**:  
   - Is there evidence that OpenAI is actively working on Q* and nearing a stage where it could publish?  
   - Are there upcoming events (e.g., conferences, product launches) that might serve as a platform for disclosure?  

3. **Resolution Criteria**:  
   - Does the information need to be detailed, or is a general acknowledgment sufficient?  
   - Can the acknowledgment come from public statements by OpenAI staff, or must it be in a formal document?  

### Step 3: Outside View (Base Rates)
- **Base Rate for AI System Disclosure**: OpenAI has a history of publishing detailed information about its AI systems, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, often accompanied by research papers or blog posts. However, it has also been selective about releasing information on proprietary or sensitive projects.  
- **Base Rate for Rumored Systems**: Rumored systems like Q* often remain undisclosed unless they reach a significant milestone or are ready for public use.  

### Step 4: Inside View (Current Evidence)
- **Evidence for Q*'s Existence**: Multiple credible sources (e.g., Reuters, t3n Magazin) have reported on Q* as a breakthrough in solving mathematical problems, suggesting it is a real project within OpenAI.

1. **Likelihood of OpenAI Acknowledging Q***: Has OpenAI historically acknowledged rumored projects? (e.g., GPT-4 was acknowledged after rumors.)
2. **Likelihood of Publishing Details**: Does OpenAI typically publish detailed descriptions of its systems? (e.g., GPT-4 technical paper was not released.)
3. **Timeline Feasibility**: Is September 30, 2024, a realistic deadline given OpenAI's current priorities and challenges?

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Base rate for OpenAI publishing detailed descriptions of rumored systems is low (e.g., GPT-4 details were sparse).
- **Inside View**: Q* is rumored to be a breakthrough in mathematical reasoning, which aligns with OpenAI's AGI goals. However, OpenAI has been cautious about revealing sensitive advancements.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence For**: Q* is a significant development, and OpenAI has a history of eventually acknowledging major projects.
- **Strong Evidence Against**: OpenAI is currently focused on GPT-4o, Voice Mode delays, and security concerns (e.g., recent breach). Publishing Q* details may not be a priority.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces For**: Competitive pressure (e.g., Amazon's Metis), internal breakthroughs, and potential partnerships (e.g., Apple) may incentivize OpenAI to reveal Q*.
- **Forces Against**: Security risks, intellectual property concerns, and focus on commercializing existing models (e.g., GPT-4o) may delay or prevent disclosure.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- OpenAI's trend is to release incremental updates (e.g., GPT-4o) rather than groundbreaking disclosures. This suggests a lower likelihood of publishing Q* details.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to OpenAI's opaque communication style and the lack of direct evidence about Q*.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While Q* is a compelling topic, OpenAI's current focus on GPT-4o and security issues suggests caution in overestimating the likelihood of disclosure.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical errors include overestimating OpenAI's transparency (e.g., GPT-4 details) and underestimating its ability to surprise (e.g., GPT-4o release).

### Final Reasoning
Given OpenAI's current priorities (GPT-4o, Voice Mode delays, security concerns), the likelihood of publishing detailed information about Q* by September 30, 2024, is low. However, competitive pressures and the significance of Q* as a potential AGI breakthrough introduce some uncertainty. Balancing these factors, I estimate a low-to-moderate probability.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.**
