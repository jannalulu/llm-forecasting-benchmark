**Measles Outbreak in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes: 150 Cases Reported Since September 2023**
There has been a resurgence of measles cases in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, with over 150 cases reported since September 2023, compared to only one case in 2021 and one case in 2022. The disease is highly contagious and can cause serious respiratory and neurological complications. The French National Health Agency (ARS) has identified three main clusters of cases, all of which were linked to unvaccinated individuals who had recently traveled abroad. The ARS is urging people born after 1980 to check their vaccination status and be vigilant for symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also sounded the alarm, warning that the number of measles cases in Europe could exceed the high threshold of 2023. In the first three months of 2024, 56,634 cases and four deaths were reported in 45 of the 53 countries in the WHO's European region, which includes central Asia.

**Measles Cases Increase in Europe, WHO and UNICEF Warn of Devastating Impact**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, there has been an increase in measles cases in Europe. In the first three months of 2024, 45 countries in the WHO European Region reported 56,634 measles cases and 4 deaths. In 2023, 41 countries reported 61,070 cases and 13 deaths. The report highlights the devastating impact of measles on children's health, with serious complications being more common in young children. The report also emphasizes the need for urgent action, stating that even a single measles case is a call to action. The WHO European Region Director, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge, emphasized that the majority of reported cases in 2023 were in children under the age of five, which reflects the accumulation of missed routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow improvement in vaccination coverage in 2021. The report also notes that there were over 300,000 measles cases worldwide in 2023. It is emphasized that unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals are at high risk of contracting the virus, and that countries without measles cases should take proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The report concludes that countries with ongoing outbreaks should continue to vaccinate all vulnerable individuals, intensify case detection and contact tracing, and identify vaccination gaps to prevent future outbreaks.

**Measles Cases Continue to Rise in Europe, WHO and UNICEF Warn of Critical Situation**
The number of measles cases in Europe continues to increase, with 56,634 cases reported in the first three months of 2024, compared to 61,070 in 2023. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF warn that the situation is critical, with millions of children at risk. The measles virus is highly contagious and can cause serious health problems, especially in young children. The WHO and UNICEF urge governments to take immediate action to strengthen healthcare systems and implement effective public health measures to protect all children from this preventable disease. The situation is critical, with over 300,000 cases reported worldwide in 2023 and the number expected to exceed 300,000 in 2024. The WHO and UNICEF warn that the virus is spreading globally and will continue to spread wherever it finds unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. Dr. Matteo Bassetti, director of infectious diseases at the Policlinico San Martino hospital in Genoa, Italy, has been warning about the measles outbreak since January, saying that the situation is critical and that the theme of prevention must be addressed in all its complexity, from measles to pertussis to herpes zoster, otherwise it will not go anywhere.

**Measles Returns to Italy, Says Bassetti: 'The Problem is Not the Obligation, But the Lack of Enforcement'**
According to Matteo Bassetti, director of Infectious Diseases at the Policlinico San Martino hospital in Genoa, measles has returned to being a problem in Italy. The numbers show that cases have increased from May to June, with over 700 cases reported in the first six months of 2024, a 10-15 fold increase compared to 2023. Bassetti notes that most of those affected are unvaccinated individuals, which suggests that something is not working in the country, as some regions have not reached the 95% vaccination coverage rate. He proposes that instead of removing the vaccination obligation and replacing it with a recommendation, the law should be enforced more strictly to improve coverage. Bassetti emphasizes that children's health should be protected by a strong national healthcare system, not by individual parents' intelligence or decisions.

**Measles Outbreak in Petrozavodsk: Two Cases Detected, Vaccination Efforts Underway**
Two cases of measles were detected in Petrozavodsk, Russia, in June. One case involved a 34-year-old man, and the other involved three relatives: two adults and a one-year-old child. The authorities organized door-to-door visits in the buildings where the patients lived, searched for possible carriers, and vaccinated unvaccinated individuals. The observation period for those who may have contracted the infection will continue for three weeks, as the probability of infection is very high, approaching 100%. Fortunately, all infected individuals had a mild course of the disease. The only way to combat measles is widespread vaccination. In Russia, over 15,000 cases have been detected since the beginning of the year. Children are vaccinated against measles at 1 and 6 years old, but adults can also be vaccinated. If an individual is unsure if they have been vaccinated before, a repeat vaccination will not harm and will only strengthen their immunity. In 2023, 7,467 children and 6,768 adults were vaccinated in the Karelia region. In the first five months of 2024, 5,114 children and 1,805 adults have been vaccinated. The most children are being vaccinated in the Belomorsk, Muzeysky, Pitkyaranta, and Petrozavodsk districts, while adults are being vaccinated in the Muzeysky, Konstantinovsk, Sotavala, and Kostomuksha districts.

**¿Hay un brote de sarampión en Galicia?**
The Spanish Ministry of Health has reported an increase in cases and outbreaks of measles worldwide and in Europe, which has implications for Spain. Since 2016, Spain has been in a measles-free situation, with a vaccination coverage of 90% in two doses and 95% in one dose nationwide. In 2023, 14 cases were confirmed, and in 2024, 106 cases have been reported, with 21 outbreaks in 11 autonomous communities. In Galicia, there are only two confirmed cases in 2024, and no cases have been reported in A Coruña in recent years. A pediatrician from the Hospital Teresa Herrera in A Coruña attributes the increase in cases to imported cases, international travel, immigration, and lack of vaccination. He recommends following the vaccination schedule, particularly for measles, to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Swiss measles outbreak concerns health experts**
Since June 2023, there have been 103 measles cases in Switzerland, according to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). This is a significant increase compared to the 27 cases in the same period last year. The government had expected a low number of cases due to the high vaccination rate, which is 94% for young children. However, the FOPH believes that many cases involve people who were infected abroad or smaller outbreaks in which the pathogen was introduced into Switzerland. This increase is part of a global trend, with the World Health Organization (WHO) expecting a high number of measles infections in 2024. In 2023, there were around 320,000 reported cases, an increase of almost 90% compared to the previous year. The WHO estimates that 136,000 people died of measles in 2022, mainly children under the age of five.

**Measles Outbreak in Kyrgyzstan: Over 10,000 Cases Registered Since the Beginning of the Year**
According to the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic, as of June 3, 2024, there have been 10,798 cases of measles registered in the country since the beginning of the year. Despite a monthly decline in new cases, the virus remains active. The main cause of the outbreak is the high number of refusals to vaccinate against measles and rubella among children and adults. The analysis of the age distribution of measles cases shows that children under the age of 4 are still heavily affected, with 3,894 cases or 36% of the total. The vaccination campaign has started in several regions, and the Ministry of Health recommends that all children aged 9 months to 7 years receive the vaccine, except for those who have received two doses of the measles vaccine during routine and catch-up immunization. The vaccine is available free of charge at health centers and mobile vaccination points.

A tourist who traveled from the US to Europe and back has brought back measles, prompting health officials to warn Brits to check if they've been vaccinated or had the disease previously. Symptoms include a high fever, coughing, sneezing, and a rash. The UK Health Security Agency has recorded almost 900 cases of measles in 2024, a significant increase from 368 cases in 2023. Experts urge travelers to ensure they're fully vaccinated before traveling abroad, as measles is one of the most highly infectious diseases and can spread easily. The World Health Organization attributes the growing measles crisis to suboptimal vaccination rates worldwide.

**Measles cases surge across Europe, putting millions at risk**
Measles cases in Europe have surged, with over 56,000 cases and four deaths reported in the first three months of 2024, surpassing the total number of cases in 2023. The surge is attributed to a breakdown in immunization coverage, with over half of reported cases occurring among children under five who had not received any measles vaccination doses. The WHO and UNICEF urge countries to step up vaccination efforts, intensify case finding and contact tracing, and use epidemiological data to identify gaps in vaccination coverage to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Measles Cases in Russia Decrease Since April, Rospotrebnadzor Reports**
According to Rospotrebnadzor, the number of cases of measles in Russia has decreased since April. The peak of the outbreak occurred in March 2024, which is typical for the cyclical nature of the infection, which occurs every 4-6 years. The 2023 epidemic was complicated by the suspension of the virus's circulation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to active vaccination, the situation was brought under control, with over 90% of cases not spreading due to single cases. In 2023, approximately 1.4 million people were identified as having had contact with infected individuals, with 272,000 requiring vaccination, of which 75% received timely vaccination. Rospotrebnadzor is concerned about measles outbreaks among unvaccinated groups, including migrants, Romani people, and those who refuse vaccination due to religious beliefs. Genetic analysis of the viruses shows that the infection is imported from 28 countries.

**Measles Cases Increase in Europe, WHO and UNICEF Warn of Devastating Impact**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, there has been an increase in measles cases in Europe. In the first three months of 2024, 45 countries in the WHO European Region reported 56,634 measles cases and 4 deaths. In 2023, 41 countries reported 61,070 cases and 13 deaths. The report highlights the devastating impact of measles on children's health, with serious complications being more common in young children. The report also emphasizes the need for urgent action, stating that even a single measles case is a call to action. The WHO European Region Director, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge, emphasized that the majority of reported cases in 2023 were in children under the age of five, which reflects the accumulation of missed routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the slow improvement in vaccination coverage in 2021. The report also notes that there were over 300,000 measles cases worldwide in 2023. It is emphasized that unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals are at high risk of contracting the virus, and that countries without measles cases should take proactive measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The report concludes that countries with ongoing outbreaks should continue to vaccinate all vulnerable individuals, intensify case detection and contact tracing, and identify vaccination gaps to prevent future outbreaks.
