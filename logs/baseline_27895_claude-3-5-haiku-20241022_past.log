Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Key Considerations:
1. Specific timeframe: Before October 1, 2024
2. Current date is September 3, 2024 - very close to the deadline
3. Alexandre de Moraes is a controversial Supreme Court justice known for making strong interventions in Brazilian politics

Factors Reducing Likelihood of Removal:
- Very close to end of potential removal window
- Brazilian institutional mechanisms for removing Supreme Court justices are complex
- He has significant political support
- Short timeframe remaining makes rapid removal unlikely

Factors Increasing Likelihood of Removal:
- Ongoing political tensions in Brazil
- De Moraes has been a polarizing figure
- Continued conflicts with political figures like former President Bolsonaro

Probability Assessment:
- Low probability of sudden removal so close to deadline
- Institutional inertia works against quick removal
- Political risks of removing a sitting minister are high

Quantitative Reasoning:
- High base probability of remaining in position
- Small window for potential removal
- Significant procedural barriers

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 8.75%, but 5.25% being the most likely. Probability: 5.25%.
