The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a nationwide recall of Con Yeager Spice Company's Trail Bologna Meat Processing Kits due to the presence of undeclared allergens, namely wheat and soy.

Impacted products come in 17.88 oz pouches with a UPC code of 797442404137 and a best-by date of February 2, 2027. Con Yeager has suspended production while the cause of the matter is investigated.

**USDA Recalls Nearly 10 Million Pounds of Ready-To-Eat Meat**
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has announced a nationwide recall of nearly 10 million pounds (9,986,245 pounds) of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products due to concern that they may be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes. The products, produced between June 19, 2024, and October 8, 2024, were shipped to companies and distributors across the country and further distributed to retailers, restaurants, institutions, and establishments. Consumers are urged to check the labels of ready-to-eat meat or poultry products they may have in their possession or see on store shelves for the establishment numbers '51205 or P-51205' within or beneath the USDA mark of inspection. The USDA is advising all restaurants, institutions, stores, and establishments not to serve, use, or sell the recalled products, and to throw them away or return them to wherever they were purchased. Consumers should also throw away or return any recalled product they have in their possession. According to the USDA, Listeriosis can cause symptoms including fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, and can be treated with antibiotics. However, the infection can be more serious in older adults and people with weakened immune systems, and can be life-threatening for pregnant women and newborn babies.

**Boar's Head shutters Virginia plant linked to listeria outbreak**
Boar's Head is shutting down its Jarratt, Va., plant, which was linked to a deadly listeria outbreak that hospitalized at least 57 people across 18 states and resulted in 9 deaths. The company started recalling 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products in July due to possible listeria contamination. An investigation identified a specific production process at the Jarratt facility as the root cause of the contamination, which will be permanently discontinued. The company has reached an agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 Union to transfer or provide severance packages to over 500 affected employees. The CDC recommends checking homes for recalled products with 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels, which have sell by dates into October 2024.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has listed about 200 cafeterias across the country that could be affected by a massive recall of nearly 12 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and chicken products. Two Chicago area family centers, Fox Valley Family YMCA in Plano and Kiddie Scholars in Matteson, received shipments of the potentially contaminated meat products.

**USDA Recalls Over 4.5 Million Pounds of Meat and Poultry Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that BrucePac, a producer of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, has recalled over 4.5 million pounds of products due to possible listeria contamination. The affected products were distributed to restaurants and institutions across the country and may have been used in ready-to-eat items that are 'on store shelves or in consumers' refrigerators or freezers,' or available for use in restaurants and other establishments. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service discovered the issue during routine testing of finished poultry products. The agency identified BrucePac's ready-to-eat chicken as the source of the listeria, which may have affected other meat and poultry products produced between June 19 and October 8. Listeria can cause listeriosis, the third leading cause of foodborne deaths in the US. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue, and can also cause stiffness in the neck, headache, confusion, or seizures. The USDA stated that 'there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of these products.' However, some people who get sick may recover without being tested for listeria, and it can take weeks to link a disease to an outbreak. The USDA advised restaurants, institutions, and other establishments to 'not serve or use these products. These products should be discarded or returned to the place of purchase.' Anyone concerned about a disease should contact a healthcare provider.

The USDA has published a full list of recalled products and urges restaurants and institutions not to serve or use them. Meanwhile, a California-based cheese and dairy company, Rizo-López Foods, has been ordered to cease production after an investigation found that two deaths were caused by consumption of listeria-contaminated products.
