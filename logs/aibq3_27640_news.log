**Vladimir Putin restricts social media sites and YouTube**
The Russian government has been restricting access to social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, by slowing down or blocking them. Experts warn that a complete nationwide ban on YouTube is imminent. Since the restrictions were introduced, the user base of foreign social networks in Russia has declined significantly, with Instagram's daily user count decreasing from 38.4 million in February 2022 to 6.8 million in February 2024. IT specialist Mikhail Klimarev stated, 'Blocking YouTube would be a clear act of censorship.' Users like Christina, 25, have adapted to the restricted digital landscape by using VPNs, which are also being targeted by the government. Klimarev explained, 'In October 2023, they issued a law banning the promotion of methods to bypass blockages and the blocking of resources describing these methods.' The situation with YouTube remains uncertain, but popular shows have already shifted to the alternative platform VKontakte, which is widely believed to be under government influence and control. Klimarev stated, 'I think we're just one step away from a complete shutdown.'

**Russia Does Not Plan to Block YouTube, But Will Slow Down Its Speed**
Russian authorities have stated that they do not plan to block YouTube, but instead will slow down its speed. According to Deputy Anton Gorelkin, the Russian government does not want to take measures that would harm citizens. He stated, 'Such a scenario is not being considered, because there is an important principle - retaliatory measures should not harm our citizens.' Gorelkin also emphasized that Google must return to Russia officially, pay fines, reopen its representation, and comply with local legislation in the Russian segment. The speed of YouTube may decrease to 40% and then to 70% due to the lack of support for caching servers in Russian networks, according to the Roskomnadzor. This measure is a result of 'multiple violations' of Russian legislation by YouTube. The Russian court has already fined Google over 25 billion rubles in the last three years, but this measure has not helped. YouTube, owned by American Google, stopped monetizing content for Russian users in March 2022. In 2022, an arbitration court in Moscow arrested the assets and property of the Russian subsidiary of Google for 1.5 billion rubles. In October 2023, the court recognized OOO 'Google' as bankrupt. The competitive manager of OOO 'Google' Valery Talyarovsky reported that the amount of claims from creditors, included in the register, at that time was 54 billion rubles. Roskomnadzor sent a requirement to the director of Google Sundar Pichai to unblock over 200 YouTube accounts of Russian media, authorities, and public figures in mid-July. Since 2020, YouTube has restricted 207 Russian resources, with 83 of them in 2024, according to the agency.

**Kremlin denies claim of imminent YouTube ban**
The Kremlin has denied claims that YouTube will be banned in Russia, citing technical issues related to Google's outdated servers in the country. The Russian authorities have no plans to restrict access to YouTube, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Peskov explained that the slowdowns on YouTube are caused by technical issues and not by any decision made by the Russian government. He also stated that Russian companies have probably already tried to reach out to YouTube to remedy the issue. The deputy head of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Anton Gorelkin, also confirmed that the issues with the speed of service of YouTube in Russia are not occurring due to any decision made by the country's regulator.

**YouTube Bans Over 80 Russian Channels, Faces Fines and Criticism from Russian Authorities**
YouTube has banned over 80 Russian channels since the beginning of the year, according to the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Mass Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadsor). The Russian authorities have accused YouTube of censorship, stating that the platform has restricted access to 83 Russian resources since January 2024. Additionally, YouTube has failed to remove or block prohibited content in Russia, with over 61,300 illegal contents remaining online. Roskomnadsor has threatened YouTube with fines of up to 10% of the company's annual revenue and a minimum fine of 4 million rubles (approximately 42,000 euros) for repeated violations. The agency has also criticized YouTube for not deleting or blocking prohibited content within 24 hours of being notified, as required by Russian law.

**Medvedev Criticizes YouTube's Hostile Actions Towards Russia**
Russian Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated that YouTube's actions are 'openly hostile' towards Russia, as they remove Russian resources and promote the country's enemies. According to Medvedev, YouTube has been conducting a hostile policy and refusing to comply with Russia's requests to balance opinions. He added that this behavior is the reason for the imposed restrictions. As reported by ИА Регнум, YouTube stopped working on computers for most Russian residents on August 8. The website is not loading regardless of the internet provider, and some users are receiving error messages, while others are experiencing 'infinite' loading. On July 26, Roskomnadzor stated that numerous violations of Russian law and disrespect towards Russia and its citizens are the grounds for taking measures against YouTube. The State Duma also warned that YouTube's speed in Russia will slow down to 70% in the near future due to Russian data centers ceasing cooperation with Google. Meanwhile, two Russian women who were banned from leaving Turkey after an incident at Antalya airport have been allowed to return to Russia. According to the Russian Consulate General in Antalya, the ban was lifted due to humanitarian circumstances, and the women safely returned to Russia on August 27. The Consulate General also advised Russian citizens to plan their trips responsibly and respect the laws and norms of the country they are visiting.

**Medvedev Calls YouTube Restriction 'Not Very Good' but Necessary**
Russian Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated that the YouTube restriction in Russia is due to the platform's hostile policy towards the country. According to Medvedev, YouTube's management 'behaves very badly' by removing Russian resources and promoting those of the country's opponents. He emphasized that the authorities asked the platform to maintain a balance, but this was not done. Medvedev acknowledged that limiting the choice of information sources 'is not very good', but continuing to allow 'hostile resources' is impossible. He said, 'From here, state decisions are made to take restrictive measures if our wishes are not fulfilled.' A recent Mediascope study found that the average time Russians spend on YouTube daily has decreased from 52 to 38 minutes since the end of July.

**YouTube Blocks Russian Propaganda Accounts, Authorities Respond with Service Slowdown**
According to a report by 'Novaya Gazeta Europe', YouTube blocked approximately 3,600 Russian propaganda accounts in May-June 2024. This could have influenced the decision to slow down the service. Since 2020, YouTube has blocked 207 Russian channels, with 40% of these blocks occurring in 2024. Roskomnadzor regularly sends Google demands to unblock the content, but Google ignores them. Meanwhile, Roskomnadzor has sent Google around 36,000 demands to remove 'banned' content, which they also ignore. Channels blocked in the summer included those of Shaman (Yaroslav Dronov), Polina Gagarina, and Grigory Leps. 'Novaya Gazeta Europe' speculated that after the record number of content blocks, authorities decided to slow down (effectively block) the service in Russia. On July 20, authorities held a rally in front of the US embassy 'for freedom of speech' with Shaman's participation. Russian users began reporting mass disruptions to YouTube's service on August 1. Prior to this, authorities had warned of the impending slowdown. According to Meduza, all major telecommunications operators in the country were informed that YouTube's video playback speed would be slowed to 128 kilobits per second.

**Russian Market Perspectives on YouTube's Future in Russia**
The Russian market is discussing the potential impact of YouTube's restrictions on digital marketing. Experts from various agencies share their opinions on the changes in the digital landscape and the most likely scenarios in case of YouTube's shutdown. According to Elena Gordiy, director of marketing, advertising, and PR at Yakitoria, the digital market in Russia has been in a state of permanent adaptation to changing conditions since spring 2022. The most significant changes occurred after the departure of several social media platforms banned in Russia. Andrey Son, director of communications at Mobidriven, believes that YouTube is now only applicable as an influencer marketing and content marketing tool, which is incomparable to the media budgets that existed before February 2022. In the event of YouTube's shutdown, Elena Gordiy expects that bloggers will negotiate with advertisers to transfer integrations to other platforms, including Telegram, VK, 'Dzen', and Rutube. Ksenia Vetрова, director of marketing and PR at Interpool, notes that the redistribution of budgets is inevitable, but the question is where they will go. Anna Dzivaeva, commercial director at Webbika, expects a new surge in traffic on VK and, consequently, an increase in requests for advertising on this platform. Anzor Kovaev, CEO of BYYD, suggests that advertisers will review the cost of advertising integrations in accordance with new viewing and subscriber metrics. The experts agree that the shutdown of YouTube will significantly impact the influencer marketing market, with Rutube being the most likely platform for bloggers to migrate to.

**Russia's Crackdown on YouTube: A Sign of Desperation**
The Putin regime has started to restrict access to YouTube, initially blaming equipment maintenance, then admitting to intentionally slowing down the platform to force users to switch to Russian alternatives. YouTube has become inaccessible to certain categories of users, and it is clear that the platform will soon be banned in Russia. The regime is also planning to restrict VPN services, which are used to bypass internet censorship. The article notes that the regime's actions are similar to those of the Soviet Union, but with a more brutal approach. The author suggests that the regime's attempts to restrict access to information will ultimately fail, as users will find ways to circumvent the restrictions. The article also mentions that VPN services are already banned in Russia, and that the regime has introduced a law prohibiting the promotion of VPN services. The author concludes that the regime's actions are a sign of its growing desperation and brutality.

**Russians Threaten to Take to the Streets Over YouTube Ban**
Russians have threatened to take to the streets over a sudden YouTube slowdown, which began in mid-July. The slowdown, which dropped upload speeds by 70%, was announced by Alexander Khinshtein, a member of Russia's State Duma, who said YouTube 'violates and ignores the law with impunity.' Despite the slowdown, YouTube is still accessible, but users are experiencing loading issues. Russians are frustrated with the move, which they see as an attempt to limit their access to opposition views. A Muscovite attempted to hold a protest, but was blocked by local authorities citing COVID restrictions. Meduza reported that Russians are ready to protest, and even officials are speaking out against the move. The German Council on Foreign Relations has warned that banning YouTube in Russia is 'just a matter of time,' and that it would hurt democratic principles and freedom of speech.

**Russia Slows Down YouTube, Threatening Right to Information**
The Russian government has slowed down YouTube's video playback speed in Russia, making it difficult to access the platform. The 'Reporters Without Borders' (RSF) organization has condemned this move, stating that it threatens the right to information. According to RSF, 'The Kremlin is on its way to achieving its dirty goal - locking Russian citizens in an information prison where only propaganda can freely circulate.' The organization has called for the Russian government to restore normal video playback speed on the platform. Users in occupied Ukrainian regions, as well as in Moscow and St. Petersburg, have reported difficulties accessing YouTube due to the slowed-down video playback speed. The Russian government has been gradually blocking YouTube, reducing the video playback speed to 128 kbps, which is significantly lower than the required level for optimal playback. This move is being implemented using 'technical means of countering threats' (TMT), also known as 'black boxes,' which are being installed in telecommunications operators in Russia since 2020 and are controlled by Roskomnadzor, the Russian telecommunications regulator. YouTube has been under scrutiny in Russia for several months, with Roskomnadzor accusing it of spreading disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government has warned that it will take direct action against the platform. According to a source close to the Russian administration, YouTube may be completely blocked by the fall, with the service's performance gradually deteriorating this summer. Independent media and journalists, forced to live in exile, have developed their own video formats on YouTube to circumvent the censorship imposed by the Kremlin, which is tightening its control over the internet. The success of YouTube is evident in the data from a report by The Fix and JX Fund, a journalism support fund created by RSF, which shows that in September 2023, videos from independent journalists and media reached 165 million views on the platform. One of the reasons for this popularity is that YouTube, unlike Facebook and Instagram, has not been banned by the Russian authorities. A protest rally planned by users in Moscow on August 17 to protest the slowdown of YouTube was banned by the authorities. Russia ranks 162nd out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index by RSF for 2024.

**YouTube slowdown in Russia darkens freedom of speech outlook**
YouTube has been experiencing slowdowns in Russia, with mass outages reported on Thursday. Russian lawmakers have blamed Google's failure to upgrade its equipment in Russia since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but the company and technology experts dispute this. With independent Russian-language media banned, YouTube is a key source of opposition views, with one video by Alexei Navalny having been viewed over 132 million times. Blocking YouTube could have damaging implications for online freedom of speech and threaten Russia's general internet connectivity and the livelihoods of thousands of content creators. Boris Pastukhov, a political scientist, said, 'We've seen that particular regions lose YouTube connectivity overall or slow down by 90% for a few days, which is not really explainable by servers being old.' Alexander Khinshtein, head of a parliamentary committee on information policy, said, 'The degradation was 'a necessary step, directed not against Russian users, but against the administration of a foreign resource that still believes it can violate and ignore our legislation without punishment.' A YouTube spokesperson said, 'This was not because of any actions or technical issues on its part, the spokesperson said.'

**Russia Plans to Ban Google, Android, and iOS Amid Growing Criticism**
Russia's internet monitoring services reported thousands of complaints about YouTube's accessibility, on Thursday, amid growing criticism from Russian authorities towards the platform. Despite the crisis, Google, the owner of YouTube, and Roskomnadzor, the Russian censorship agency, have not issued any immediate statements. YouTube's download speeds have significantly decreased in recent weeks, which Russian lawmakers have blamed on Google's lack of investment in Russian infrastructure, a claim denied by YouTube. Alexander Khinstein, the head of a parliamentary committee on information policy, warned last month that YouTube's speeds could drop by up to 70%, describing this slowdown as 'a necessary step' to pressure the company, according to Reuters. Alexei Didenko, a deputy in the Russian Duma, said that Russia plans to soon ban Google, Android, and iOS. Didenko told Runews 24: 'We will soon ban Google, Android, and iOS. This will not be our initiative... It has been prohibited for a long time for government officials and bureaucrats to use these platforms, especially those with access to sensitive information... This is the first sign that we need to switch to other platforms... We advise business representatives and researchers to switch to other platforms.' The search for alternatives comes as Moscow has been working since 2015 to develop a viable and effective alternative to Android and iOS. Russian telecom giant Rostelecom developed the Aurora operating system in 2016, based on Linux. However, the usage and spread of Aurora are limited compared to the Russian mobile market, with only 500,000 users as of last year. Aurora's developer aims to provide one million government-issued smartphones within three years until 2026, with estimated development costs of $6 billion by 2030, according to Kirill Minshev, Rostelecom's deputy president, to RIA Novosti. This announcement coincided with the Russian Federal Security Service's accusation of the US intelligence agency of hacking a large number of Apple iPhones to spy on Russian diplomats, which Apple denied. In March 2023, the Russian presidential administration instructed its employees to replace their iPhones with devices from different brands and operating systems, and announced plans to buy new secure phones for its employees to facilitate this transition. The Russian government had previously advised its employees to stop using foreign apps like Zoom and WhatsApp for official communications and instead use local platforms like VK and TrueConf. These steps indicate the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine, which has led many Western tech companies to leave the Russian market.

**Russia Prepares for Possible YouTube Ban Amid Outages**
Russian authorities are taking massive and nationwide steps to prepare for a possible ban of YouTube in the country. Last week, two leading mobile network providers, MTS and Beeline, warned of impending massive disruptions to the service. On Thursday, numerous users and analysis services reported outages of YouTube across Russia, with the site being difficult to open and videos not starting. Google denied any involvement in the outages, stating that they were 'not due to technical issues'. YouTube then suspended streaming of high-definition videos over the weekend. The Russian regulatory agency Roskomnadzor refused to comment on the matter, despite officials previously attributing regional outages to outdated Google hardware in Russia and Western sanctions. 'It is not clear what is behind the outages,' said no one, as officials remained tight-lipped.

**Russia's Delayed Restriction of YouTube: A Form of Revenge or a Technical Issue?**
Russian users have been experiencing a decline in YouTube's performance, particularly on computers and smart TVs, with a significant decrease in video loading speed. The Russian authorities attribute this to technical reasons, but most observers are skeptical. Notably, the Russian censorship agency (Roskomnadzor) has not taken action against YouTube, despite blocking official Russian media channels and allowing channels of prominent liberal media and opposition figures. According to Sofia Rosova, a Russian journalist and member of the Union of Journalists, the Russian government's delay in restricting YouTube is due to the platform's hosting of popular pro-Russian channels with larger audiences. Rosova believes that the slowdown is not due to technical issues, but rather a form of revenge by the Russian government for YouTube's blocking of official Russian media channels. She notes that the Russian government considers YouTube a matter of honor and a way to punish the platform for ignoring Russian laws. Rosova also points out that Telegram is the biggest beneficiary of the current situation in Russia, with 80 million users and many Russian institutions, including museums, adopting it as a replacement for Instagram. In contrast, the restriction of YouTube is a blow to independent media outlets like Echo of Moscow, which was able to partially resume broadcasting on YouTube under a new name after its closure in 2022. Rosova concludes that the Russian government is trying to create a controlled media space for Russian citizens, allowing them to influence and control it, and prevent any dissenting activity on social media platforms.

It was previously reported that the Kremlin plans to completely block YouTube for Russians. The blocking process will be implemented in two stages: slowing down the video hosting service by October and then completely blocking it. Didenko also stated that the decision has a political character and is directed against the YouTube administration.

**Russia Defends Right to Sanction YouTube Amid Growing Complaints**
Russia defended its right to sanction YouTube on Friday, August 2, 2024, amid growing complaints about the platform's slowdown. 'Numerous violations of Russian legislation (...) leave the regulatory authorities in our country the right to use the appropriate legal tools,' said Maria Zakharova, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, commenting on the situation surrounding YouTube, without providing further details. According to Zakharova, 'arbitrariness and political censorship' continue to be the norm for the 'YouTube administration controlled by Washington, which is purging' the field of information. The comments come after Russian users complained en masse about problems with YouTube's functionality. Most complaints came from Moscow, followed by St. Petersburg and the southern region of Krasnodar. Margarita Simonyan, director of the Russian TV channel RT, whose account was blocked by this social network, wrote on Telegram, 'YouTube is kaput. It asked for it.' Last week, the chairman of the parliamentary committee for information policy in the Russian Duma, Alexander Khinshtein, announced that Russia would slow down YouTube's functionality by 70% on desktop computers in response to the blocking of Russian channels by this video hosting service. Previously, the Russian telecommunications company Rostelecom warned that the platform's functionality had slowed down recently in Russia due to 'technical problems' in Google's equipment, which have not been updated since the start of the war in Ukraine. According to 2023 data, 42.9% of Russians consumed videos on YouTube daily.

**Russian Deputy Warns of Potential Blocking of Google, Android, and iOS**
Russian State Duma deputy Alexei Didenko has warned citizens to prepare for the potential blocking of Google, Android, and iOS in Russia. According to Didenko, the initiative to block these platforms will come from foreign corporations, not the Russian government. Didenko stated, 'Soon Google will be blocked, and with it, Google Android. Also, iOS will be blocked, and this will not be our initiative.' He also advised government officials and those with access to confidential information to switch to alternative platforms. Didenko downplayed the potential impact of YouTube's blocking, saying, 'There's nothing terrible about slowing down YouTube.' He suggested that users should 'not cling' to YouTube and consider switching to a domestic alternative. Didenko also referenced the 2022 ban on Netflix in Russia, stating that 'no tragedy' occurred as a result. He warned that similar restrictions may be imposed on other platforms, saying, 'We will also be forced to introduce restrictions.' Didenko concluded by emphasizing the importance of ensuring the survival of Russian systems and sovereignty, stating, 'This is a question of existence.'

**Russia Considers Blocking YouTube and Replacing it with VK**
The Russian authorities are considering blocking YouTube and replacing it with VK, a social media platform controlled by the government. This move is seen as part of a broader effort to control the internet and create a culture of self-censorship in Russia. The Russian Federal Censorship Agency, Roskomnadzor, has accused YouTube of numerous violations of Russian law and disrespect towards Russia and its citizens. Experts believe that this is a step towards controlling the online activities of Russians and creating a culture of self-censorship. The head of the State Duma's Committee on Information Policy, Alexander Khinstein, has stated that YouTube will be loaded 40% slower in the coming days due to Russian data centers ceasing cooperation with Google. Meanwhile, the Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom has attributed the slow loading of YouTube to a lack of Russian servers. The opposition publication Verstka has reported that Russia aims to replace YouTube with VK by loading all Russian-language videos from YouTube to VK by autumn 2024. This move is seen as a step towards creating a controlled online environment. The Russian government has also expanded its legislation to cover not only everyday life but also the internet, with the aim of protecting government officials and military personnel from 'discreditation'. The Kremlin has also emphasized the importance of creating a culture of censorship, including the use of only approved software and self-censorship of opposition or other content that is not favorable to the government's goals.

**Russia May Block Access to YouTube, ISW Reports**
The Russian authorities may block access to YouTube, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The report states that Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of 'multiple violations' of Russian law and 'disrespect' towards Russia and its citizens, and warned that these actions are grounds for 'measures' against the video hosting platform. The head of the Russian State Duma's Committee on Information Policy, Alexander Khinstein, said that YouTube will be loaded 40% slower in the coming days due to Russian data centers that cooperate with Google through 'gray schemes' planning to stop these schemes. Analysts noted that this contradicts a recent statement by Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom, which attributed slow YouTube loading in Russia to a lack of Russian servers hosting the platform. Additionally, the Russian opposition publication Verstka wrote that Russia aims to replace YouTube with the video service VK and plans to upload all Russian-language videos from YouTube to VK by autumn 2024. VK is headed by Vladimir Kirienko, son of the Deputy Head of the Russian Presidential Administration, Sergei Kirienko. According to the ISW report, the Kremlin may be trying to create a culture of compliance with its censorship requirements, forcing Russians to use only approved programs and expanding censorship to opposition content, which contradicts the Kremlin's goals.

**Google Accused of Slowing Down YouTube in Russia**
A Russian parliamentary committee chairman has accused Google of causing a significant slowdown in YouTube's performance on office computers in Russia. Alexander Khinstein, who heads the Committee on Information Policy in the State Duma, attributed the decline in YouTube's performance to Google's failure to upgrade its infrastructure and its decision not to lift the ban on Russian media channels. According to Khinstein, YouTube's download speeds in Russia have already decreased by 40%, and are expected to drop by up to 70% next week. He claimed that this is a deliberate action against YouTube due to its alleged violations of Russian law. The Federal Communications Agency, Roskomnadzor, has supported these allegations, stating that YouTube's quality of service is deteriorating because Google has not updated its global temporary storage servers in the country. Additionally, Khinstein criticized Google for not investing in Russia's infrastructure and allowing its local subsidiary to go bankrupt. He claimed that the bankruptcy was a result of Google's inability to pay for local data center services after Russian authorities froze its bank account. In March 2022, YouTube banned access to channels linked to Russian state-funded media outlets, citing its policy of banning content that denies or downplays well-documented violent events. The platform stated that Russia's military actions in Ukraine were covered by this policy, and any content violating this policy would be removed. The financial difficulties faced by Google's Russian subsidiary led to its bankruptcy, with Russian authorities freezing its bank account, including payment obligations within Russia. Amidst these developments, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has proposed blocking YouTube entirely in Russia. The main concern for Moscow, as described by Khinstein, is what he calls 'YouTube's openly anti-Russian policy' and its continued refusal to comply with Roskomnadzor's demands to lift the ban on Russian channels. Google has yet to respond to the allegations made by Khinstein. It is known that Russian users bypass restrictions on social media using virtual private networks (VPNs), a common practice in the country to circumvent internet censorship.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov believes that YouTube in Russia needs to be 'shut down to hell'. He stated, 'We need to not delay, we need to shut it down to hell and that's it, it will be easier for us.' Kadyrov also thinks that Russian social media platforms need to be developed by having Russian 'top artists, actors, and football players' use them. He reminded that China banned Western services, and as a result, domestic analogues are developing. Russian leader's press secretary Dmitry Peskov previously advised Russians blocked on YouTube to switch to other resources.

**Russia Restricts Access to YouTube**
The Russian government is restricting access to YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc., in an attempt to block one of the last remaining American social media platforms still available in Russia. According to Bloomberg, the speed of YouTube loading on computers will decrease by approximately 40% this week and by 70% by the end of next week, said Alexander Khinstein, head of the technological committee of the lower house of the State Duma. He attributed this to YouTube's policy of 'systematically deleting channels of our public figures' whose views do not align with the 'Western point of view'. The measures have not yet affected access to YouTube on mobile devices. Google's Russian subsidiary, which is the parent company of YouTube, declared bankruptcy in 2022 after the Russian authorities arrested its bank accounts due to several local fines, including for refusing to remove content deemed 'undesirable' by the Kremlin. However, the company continued to offer free services in Russia, including Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail. Some pro-Kremlin or state-controlled channels have been blocked by YouTube. Around half of Russians use YouTube monthly, according to Mediascope, a monitoring service. It is worth noting that Russia is expanding its official definition of extremism as part of its efforts to criminalize and suppress internal opposition. Opposition to the current government's actions and structure will be defined as ethnic intolerance towards Russians who support the Kremlin's policies and war against Ukraine.

**Will YouTube be blocked in Russia in 2024? What is known about the blocking of YouTube, fresh data**
There have been increased discussions about the potential full blocking of YouTube in Russia. The speed of the video service has been slowing down, with a significant decrease expected by the end of the year. According to Deputy Alexander Khinstein, the speed of YouTube loading on PCs may drop to 40% by the end of the week and to 70% by the end of next year. This is a forced measure aimed at the administration of the foreign resource, which continues to disregard Russian laws. The quality of video loading on YouTube has already been noticed by Rostelecom. The expert Igor Bedrov explained that the reason for the slowdown is the decrease in the number of operational servers, which has led to a decrease in the caching of video, resulting in slower speeds. The Deputy Oleg Matveychov stated that there is no intention to block YouTube, but rather to slow it down, as it is an anti-state platform that is used as a tool for information warfare. He recommended that Russians create accounts on alternative platforms. The Kremlin is reportedly planning to block YouTube completely after slowing it down, with some sources suggesting that the blocking could happen as early as October 2023.

**Russia Prepares to Block YouTube, a Popular Video Hosting Platform**
Russia is preparing to block YouTube, a popular video hosting platform. The Russian government has been discussing the possibility of blocking YouTube since the beginning of the war. The move is seen as a way to increase control over the country's information space. The Russian government has invested in developing its own video platforms, such as RuTube and 'VK відео', and has been promoting them as alternatives to YouTube. The blocking of YouTube would be a significant blow to the platform's popularity in Russia, where it has over 48 million daily users. The Russian government has already taken steps to limit access to YouTube, including slowing down the platform's speed and blocking certain content. The exact timing of the block is unclear, but it is expected to happen in September 2024.

**Protest in Moscow against YouTube blocking of Russian channels**
Hundreds of people, including Russian singer Shaman, gathered in front of the US embassy in Moscow on Friday to protest the blocking of some Russian channels on YouTube, according to RIA Novosti news agency. Shaman, a supporter of President Vladimir Putin, was present at the gathering, which was held after he announced earlier on Friday that he would organize a march against the blocking of some Russian channels on YouTube, which he considered 'unlawful'. He said, 'No one will ban our songs.' In Russia, people who participate in unauthorized gatherings face severe penalties, according to French news agency. Last month, the European Commission announced that Shaman had been put under sanctions due to his support for Russia's military attack on Ukraine, which began in February 2022. His channel was blocked on YouTube in July. On Tuesday, Russia asked Google to lift the ban on over 200 Russian channels on YouTube, which were suspended due to 'propaganda' for the Kremlin. The Russian government has tightened its control over the internet since the start of its attack on Ukraine in February 2022, blocking several websites where Kremlin critics could express themselves freely, such as Facebook and Instagram. YouTube has not been completely blocked, but rumors of a potential ban have been circulating regularly, especially since the Federal Communications and Information Agency 'Roskomnadzor' accused Google and YouTube of 'terrorist activities' starting from March 2022.

**Russia Considers New Restrictions on Gasoline Exports**
The Russian government is considering new restrictions on gasoline exports, with a possible extension of the ban until September-October and until the end of the year for non-producers of fuel. According to Nikolai Pereslavsky, head of the economic research department at CM Service, the temporary ban on gasoline exports will remain in effect until August 1. He explained that the measures taken have not led to a fuel shortage in the regions, but prices have risen to maximum levels since October last year. The cost of fuel is increasing due to the start of the harvest campaign, planned refinery repairs, and damage to infrastructure after drone attacks. Meanwhile, singer Shaman is holding a concert-mitig in front of the US Embassy in Moscow to protest the blocking of Russian YouTube users. The Central Bank has announced that banks will be required to warn borrowers of the risks of mortgage lending and borrowers will be required to sign a statement confirming that they have been informed of the risks. Independent financial expert Andrei Barhota noted that one of the main risks that consumers do not assess is the long-term credit period. If a borrower can currently service their mortgage, it does not mean they will continue to do so in 10 years. The article also discusses the decline in road accidents in the first half of the year, with a significant decrease in the number of accidents in certain areas. According to Maxim Kadakov, editor-in-chief of the magazine 'Behind the Wheel', the high accident rate last year was due to an increase in cargo transportation on southern and eastern routes.

This likely also includes constraining opposition activists and those opposed to the war in Ukraine from organizing and communicating. Additionally, Russian independent media reported that YouTube traffic was slowed down due to government intervention, with a potential block planned for September 2024.

The Kremlin is restricting social media platforms like YouTube and WhatsApp, citing the need to limit extremist group communication. However, observers note this will also restrict groups opposing the war in Ukraine from communicating. Russian authorities have already slowed down WhatsApp traffic and are likely to block YouTube altogether in September 2024. Western analysts say this is part of a trend of increasing government control over media and information in Russia, aimed at ensuring only government-controlled narratives are accessible. This could create a climate of fear and self-censorship among those critical of the regime.

The UK Defence Intelligence has released a review analyzing Russia's restrictions on digital telecommunications, including the possible blocking of YouTube. The review suggests that the Russian government is slowing down WhatsApp traffic, likely to restrict opposition activists and those opposing the war in Ukraine from organizing and communicating. Russian independent media outlets reported disruptions to YouTube, which may be completely blocked in Russia by September 2024. The review notes that these measures accelerate a long-term trend of increasing state control over media and information access in Russia, aimed at disseminating pro-government narratives and creating a climate of fear and self-censorship.

**Russia Tightens Restrictions on Digital Communications, Blocking Access to True Information**
The Russian government has initiated further restrictions on the use of digital telecommunications in Russia, aimed at blocking access to true information. According to the British Ministry of Defense, these measures are part of a long-standing trend of increasing state control over access to media and information in Russia. The restrictions include slowing down traffic in the WhatsApp app for encrypted messages, allegedly to limit the ability of extremist groups to communicate. This may also include limiting the ability of opposition activists and those who speak out against the war in Ukraine to organize and communicate. Additionally, independent Russian media reported that a YouTube outage occurred due to intentional slowing of traffic by the Russian government. It is likely that YouTube will be fully blocked in Russia by September 2024. YouTube is a popular platform in Russia and was used by opposition activists, including the late Alexei Navalny, to spread criticism of the Russian government. 'These restrictions on access to social media platforms are likely intended to ensure that the Russian population has access only to media that aligns with the ideology controlled by the government. By limiting safer means of private communication, the government's surveillance of potential dissidents will be facilitated and create an atmosphere of fear among those who may criticize the regime,' emphasized the British Ministry of Defense.

**Kremlin's Plans for YouTube: Will Russia Finally Block the Video Service?**
The Kremlin has been preparing Russians for YouTube's blockage, but it remains an important platform for propaganda. When will the authorities decide to fully ban the video service? Rumors about the Russian government's plans to block YouTube have been circulating for years, but in the summer of 2024, they took on a real form. On July 12, the provider 'Rostelecom' announced that YouTube may experience disruptions. According to the official version, the problem is due to 'equipment issues with Google', while an unofficial source in the telecommunications industry told Meduza that the Russian authorities are slowing down the video hosting service. Later, the newspaper 'Gazeta.ru' reported that YouTube may be blocked in Russia as early as September. Meanwhile, users of the social network 'VKontakte' began to be convinced of the benefits of living without YouTube. So, what are the Kremlin's plans for YouTube? Why, despite years of rumors, the authorities have not yet blocked it? Is the upcoming autumn a suitable time for this from the authorities' perspective? Leading 'Vid on Kremlin' hosts Alexander Prokopenko and Andrei Peretze discuss how the authorities will continue to restrict internet freedom in Russia - and whether this can lead to widespread discontent among Russians.

**Roskomnadzor Demands Google Lift Ban on Over 200 YouTube Accounts**
Roskomnadzor, a Russian media regulator, is demanding that Google lift its ban on over 200 YouTube accounts. The regulator claims that the accounts, which include those of Russian media outlets, sports teams, official bodies, social and cultural figures, and politicians, have been unfairly blocked. Roskomnadzor argues that the ban violates principles of free speech and the free flow of information. The regulator has accused Google of taking unacceptable actions and is demanding that the restrictions be lifted. Since 2020, a total of 207 YouTube channels have been restricted in Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has commented on the situation, stating that Russia has no intention of restricting access to YouTube on its territory.

**Russian Communications Oversight Agency Demands Google Unblock Over 200 YouTube Channels**
The Russian Communications Oversight Agency (RKN) has demanded that Google CEO Sundar Pichai unblock over 200 YouTube channels of Russian media outlets, federal authorities, businesses, and sports clubs, as well as public figures, politicians, and musicians who support Russia and its government. The RKN believes that the blocking measures violate the key principles of free information dissemination and unrestricted access to it. The agency considers YouTube's actions to be censorship, as they prioritize pro-Western ideals and block Russian bloggers and journalists without explanation. According to the RKN, over 61,300 prohibited materials remain on YouTube, including fake news about the special military operation, extremist content, and propaganda promoting non-traditional sexual preferences. Since 2020, YouTube has applied restrictive measures to 207 Russian resources, including 83 in 2024, which includes channels such as RT, RBC, and accounts of musicians Shaman, Oleg Gazmanov, Julia Chicherina, writer Zakhar Prilepin, and others.

**Russia without YouTube: Fantasy or Imminent Reality?**
Some Russian YouTube users have been experiencing difficulties with loading content from the video hosting platform. According to Rostelecom, the problem is caused by technical issues with Google's caching servers, which are used to accelerate content loading. However, other Russian operators have not reported similar problems. The situation may be a precursor to a potential ban on YouTube in Russia, which has been discussed by government officials since 2022. Google has offered Russian operators the option to set up direct connections to its servers, but only Rostelecom has reported technical issues with its caching servers. The Russian government has been trying to promote domestic alternatives to YouTube, but there is no equivalent platform available. The article suggests that the Russian government may be preparing to block YouTube and force users to switch to a domestic platform, which could lead to a backlash from users who are accustomed to using YouTube.

**Public Figure from Khabarovsk Speaks Out on YouTube Ban in Russia**
Andrey Nikonenko, a member of the Public Chamber of Khabarovsk, spoke about the ban on YouTube in Russia. The formal reason for the mass blocking was a complaint from the Lithuanian authorities about 'destructive content' allegedly spread by Russian artists. In reality, the reason was the patriotism of the musicians and their support for Russia, which does not fit into the Russophobic trend followed by Western social networks. Nikonenko noted that YouTube is not a neutral platform and its recent actions have confirmed this. He believes that the platform is directly connected to politics and contains content that negatively influences the younger generation. He considers the ban necessary and suggests RuTube as an alternative, which has improved significantly in recent months. Nikonenko also mentioned that the initiative to ban YouTube has been discussed in Russia and the Far East before and now has a basis with the emergence of alternative platforms.

**YouTube Blocks Channels of Russian Artists Shaman and Polina Gagarina**
YouTube has blocked the channels of Russian artists Shaman (Yaroslav Dronov) and Polina Gagarina, as well as other Russian performers, including Oleg Gazmanov, Grigory Leps, and Yulia Chicherina, and TV host Vyacheslav Manucharov. The blockage is due to their inclusion in the 14th EU sanctions list, which was adopted on June 24. The EU cited their participation in Kremlin-organized concerts and performances in occupied territories as the reason for the restrictions. This is not the first time Russian artists have faced sanctions, as Oleg Gazmanov and Yulia Chicherina were previously sanctioned in October 2022, and Grigory Leps was sanctioned in December 2022.

**Russian Deputy: Slowing Down YouTube's Work is a More Realistic Option**
Russian State Duma deputy Anton Gorelik believes that slowing down YouTube's work in Russia is a more realistic option than blocking the service entirely. A bill to ban advertising on blocked resources has been submitted to the State Duma. According to Gorelik, this would make advertising integrations used by Russian content creators on the American video hosting platform illegal. Gorelik thinks that slowing down YouTube's work is a more realistic option than blocking it entirely, and this scenario should be considered by those involved in this activity. He also stated that the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) will not force bloggers to remove ads that were placed before the new law takes effect. The bill only affects social networks with a star symbol, but YouTube has a good chance of 'making a company' and Russian YouTube analogues can compete for advertisers, concluded Gorelik.
