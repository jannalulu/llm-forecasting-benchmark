Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with multiple monitors displaying data charts. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the iPhone Wi-Fi 7 announcement."

Philip: [nodding] "Indeed. Based on the historical September announcement patterns and Ming-Chi Kuo's analysis, our models had it at 78.5%. The timing and Pro model limitation aligned perfectly with our predictions."

Nate: "The key signals were there - the Wi-Fi 6E rollout in iPhone 15 Pro, the industry's push toward Wi-Fi 7, and Apple's pattern of Pro model differentiation. Yet we couldn't go higher with our probability due to the chip supply uncertainties."

Philip: "Fascinating how Apple managed to keep it under wraps until the official announcement. Though I must say, the market reaction was exactly as our models predicted."

[Both turn to examine a graph showing the accuracy of their prediction]

[Scene: A dimly lit office. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models on holographic displays]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 85.50%."

Philip: [nodding] "The signs were there. Ming-Chi Kuo's analysis about the iPhone 16 Pro models getting Wi-Fi 7 was a strong indicator. Apple's competitive pressure to keep up with Android flagships that already had Wi-Fi 7 made it almost inevitable."

Nate: "What clinched it for our models was Apple's historical pattern of Pro models getting cutting-edge wireless tech first, like with Wi-Fi 6E in the iPhone 15 Pro."

Philip: "Though that 14.50% uncertainty wasn't trivial. Supply chain issues could have delayed it to the next cycle."

Nate: "True. But in the end, the announcement came right on schedule with those blazing 40Gb/s speeds they promised."

[Both turn to update their models for the next prediction]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing their forecasting models on holographic displays]

NATE: Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the iPhone Wi-Fi 7 announcement.

PHILIP: [nodding] Indeed. Based on the historical September announcement patterns and Ming-Chi Kuo's analysis about the iPhone 16 Pro models, our models had it at 82.35%.

NATE: The timing was interesting. When we made that forecast back in August, we only had Kuo's predictions and Apple's previous behavior to work with.

PHILIP: Yes, and Apple's pattern of reserving cutting-edge wireless technology for their Pro models was a strong signal. The Wi-Fi 7 capability being limited to the iPhone 16 Pro was exactly what our models predicted.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must admit, the market reaction was stronger than expected.
