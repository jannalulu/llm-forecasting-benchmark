The camera pans over a group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddled around a large table, analyzing data and news clippings.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(enthusiastically)  
Our models had it at 95.00%. Once Biden dropped out, the likelihood of more than one debate plummeted.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Exactly. With Biden's withdrawal and Trump's insistence on FoxNews, the second debate was always a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(reflectively)  
The Democratic scramble for a new nominee left no time for organizing another debate before October.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Our models never fail. The political landscape shifted too drastically after July.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
And Trump’s Truth Social antics? Just noise. Our 95.00% prediction held true.

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence in their models reaffirmed as the scene fades.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table littered with newspapers and laptops. The room buzzes with post-event analysis.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s official. Trump debated the Democratic nominee only once.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75% for more than one debate.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Once Biden dropped out, the odds plummeted. No surprise there.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The June debate was the only one that counted. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Trump's insistence on FoxNews for the second debate sealed it. The Democrats never agreed.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And with the nominee switch, there was barely time to organize another.

They nod, satisfied with their accurate prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The models were spot on, as always.

They turn back to their screens, already analyzing the next event.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
(leaning back, thoughtful)
Our models had it at 12.34%. We knew the likelihood of a second debate was slim once Biden dropped out.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
(nodding)
Exactly. Trump's insistence on FoxNews and the Democrats scrambling for a new nominee made it almost impossible.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
Remember, the June debate with Biden doesn't count unless he was the nominee. The rules were clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
And without a second debate by October 1st, our forecast holds. No formal, live debate happened.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
