**Title: The Forecast**

**INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 13, 2024**

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers strewn about. The atmosphere is tense but focused.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning forward)  
So, did the CDC change the risk level?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shaking head)  
No, it’s still "Very Low." Our models had it at 5.67%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(skeptical)  
Even with the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa?

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(nodding)  
Yes, but the U.S. immunity levels and containment measures held strong.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(relieved)  
Good. The Brier scores were right again.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(smirking)  
They always are. We predicted the impact would remain minimal.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sighing with relief)  
Another close call.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(looking around)  
Until next time, then.

They gather their papers and exit, leaving the room echoing with their confidence.

*The room is filled with tension as SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table covered in news articles and data sheets. An air of anticipation hangs over the room.*

**FORECASTER 1:** So, the CDC's latest update came in, and the risk level for mpox remains "Very Low."

**FORECASTER 2:** Just as our models predicted. We had it at 5.23% for exceeding "Very Low."

**FORECASTER 3:** The recent clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa didn't shift the needle much here. The population's immunity held strong.

**FORECASTER 1:** It's fascinating how our models consistently align with reality.

**FORECASTER 2:** Indeed. The CDC's response was swift, but the situation didn't escalate as feared.

**FORECASTER 3:** Our accuracy is a testament to the power of data-driven forecasting.

*The forecasters nod in agreement, satisfied with their work.*

**FORECASTER 1:** On to the next challenge, then.

*They return to their data, ready to tackle future uncertainties.*

Our models had it at 3.75%. The CDC still rates the risk as "Very Low."

**SAM**
