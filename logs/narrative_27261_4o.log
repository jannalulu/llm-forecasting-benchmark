INT. A SMALL, DIMLY LIT ROOM - SEPTEMBER 12, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of computer screens. They sift through data and news articles, their expressions a mix of relief and curiosity.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's official. Our models had it at 7.85%. The K-index didn't breach 6.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
AR3697 was a beast in May, but it calmed down just in time. No Kp over 6 this time.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
Not surprising. We've been on point since the June forecasts. The sunspot's intensity waned.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(pulling up an article)  
And yet, the auroras last night were stunning. Nature's own fireworks without the chaos.

They exchange knowing glances, confident in their models, as the room buzzes with the quiet hum of data processing.

**DR. LEE**  
(looking at the screen)  
So, did AR3697 deliver as expected?

**MR. KIM**  
(shaking his head)  
Our models had it at 75.23%. The geomagnetic storm peaked at a Kp of 6.3. It was close, but not quite there.

**MS. JONES**  
(sipping coffee)  
Given the history of AR3697, it was a reasonable prediction. The sunspot's activity was intense, but not enough to break the upper threshold.

**DR. LEE**  
(nodding)  
The auroras were stunning though. It’s fascinating how space weather can be so unpredictable.

**MR. KIM**  
(smiling)  
Indeed. Another reminder of the universe's complexity. Let's keep monitoring for the next cycle.

JANE (Superforecaster)
Yesterday marked the end of our observation window. The big question: Did AR3697 trigger a Kp greater than 6 but less than or equal to 8?

TOM (Superforecaster)
Our models had it at 32.45%. We knew AR3697 was potent, but it seems it didn't quite reach the threshold.

JANE
Right. The sunspot's past activity had everyone on edge. Those May flares were unforgettable.

TOM
True, but thankfully, our predictions held. No major damage reports this time.

JANE
Space weather's unpredictability keeps us on our toes. But our models, once again, prove their worth.

The forecasters exchange relieved smiles, knowing their predictions were accurate.
