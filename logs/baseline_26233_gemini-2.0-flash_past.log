Okay, let's analyze this question. The core question is whether the opening weekend box office of "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined opening weekends of "Deadpool" (2016) and "The Wolverine" (2013). The combined total to beat is $185,548,391.

First, let's consider the individual performances of the previous movies:

*   **Deadpool (2016):** $132,434,639 opening weekend. This was a massive success, exceeding expectations due to strong marketing and positive word-of-mouth.
*   **The Wolverine (2013):** $53,113,752 opening weekend. This performed relatively well, but significantly lower than "Deadpool".

Now, let's think about "Deadpool & Wolverine":

*   **Franchise Momentum:** The "Deadpool" franchise is incredibly popular. The sequel, "Deadpool 2", also performed very well ($125 million opening).
*   **Wolverine's Inclusion:** The inclusion of Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) is a HUGE draw. Jackman's Wolverine is incredibly popular, and this film represents his return to the role after supposedly retiring with "Logan". This alone will significantly boost interest.
*   **MCU Integration:** This film marks Deadpool's official entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This connection gives the movie an even broader appeal and marketing reach.
*   **Competition:** I should consider what other major movies are releasing around the same time. A quick search suggests moderate competition but nothing that's likely to make it crash.

Considering these factors, it's highly likely that "Deadpool & Wolverine" will surpass the $185,548,391 threshold. The combination of the existing Deadpool fanbase, the huge draw of Wolverine, and the MCU integration creates a perfect storm for a massive opening.

However, some uncertainty remains:

*   **Review bombing/Controversies:** Unexpected negative press or controversies could impact the opening weekend. I haven't seen anything to this effect.
*   **General economic downturn:** A sudden economic downturn could affect entertainment spending. Unlikely in the timescale we are interested in.
*   **Quality:** If the movie is genuinely terrible, word-of-mouth could hurt its performance, but this seems unlikely given the talent involved and the high anticipation.

Given all of this, I believe a high probability is warranted. I'm going to set a fairly tight range, indicating strong confidence.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.
