Nate: Well, Phil, another prediction window closed. The nuclear weapon question...

Tetlock: [nodding] Our models had it at 3.27%. Low probability, but not negligible given the geopolitical tensions we saw.

Nate: The data through mid-July was concerning - Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, North Korea's increased testing, Iran's enrichment activities. But still, the historical precedent was strong.

Tetlock: Seventy-five years without a nuclear weapon used in war. The closest we got was that false alarm in the Taiwan Strait in March.

Nate: [pulling up charts] What's remarkable is how stable our probability remained, even through the India-Pakistan crisis in June.

Tetlock: The deterrence framework held. Though I'll admit, those two weeks in July had me checking the news every hour.

[They both turn to their screens, already analyzing the next forecast]

Nate: [removing his glasses, exhaling deeply] Well, Phil, another critical forecast window closed. The nuclear weapon question...

Tetlock: [nodding] Our models had it at 3.27%. Higher than usual due to the escalating tensions in Eastern Europe and North Korea's increased testing activity we saw in July.

Nate: The public thought we were being alarmist even at that percentage. But given the historical data and the pattern of diplomatic breakdowns we observed...

Tetlock: Precisely. While 3.27% might sound low, it's significantly higher than the background rate we've seen in previous decades. The satellite data from July showing unusual movement around known nuclear facilities had us concerned.

Nate: [checking his phone] Still, thankfully, we made it through another critical period without incident. Though I must say, these probability assessments are getting more challenging with each passing year.

[They both turn to look at the world map displayed on their main screen]

Nate Silver: [removing glasses, rubbing eyes] Well, Phil, another critical forecast window closed. The nuclear weapon question...

Philip Tetlock: [interrupting] Our models had it at 3.42%. Higher than usual, given the historical context of zero wartime detonations since 1945.

Nate: The Russia-Ukraine conflict, North Korea's provocations, and Iran's nuclear ambitions all factored in. But still remarkably low odds.

Philip: [nodding] The last intelligence briefs we received in July showed increased tensions, but nothing that suggested imminent nuclear deployment. Even with 15,000 warheads worldwide, the threshold for actual use remained extraordinarily high.

Nate: The models have never failed us, Phil. They account for everything - deterrence theory, historical precedents, psychological barriers to nuclear deployment...

Philip: [grimly] And they've proven right again. Though I must admit, I never enjoy calculating the odds of potential catastrophes.
