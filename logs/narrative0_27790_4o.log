Will OpenAI announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024? The clock has ticked past, and here we are.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Our models were clear. No, our models had it at 35.67%.

**NATE SILVER**  
The release of GPT-4o in May was significant, but the timeline was tight for another leap.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Agreed. The tech landscape was buzzing, but substantial advancements take time.

**NATE SILVER**  
The absence of any announcement confirms our forecast. Yet, the anticipation builds for what comes next.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely, Nate. The journey to GPT-5 continues, but it wasn't meant to be by this deadline.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their prediction.*

Well, Philip, it's the day after the deadline. Will OpenAI announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 42.75%. Given the latest announcement of GPT-4o in May, it seemed OpenAI was focusing on optimizing rather than introducing a successor.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, the emphasis on refining GPT-4o was evident. No surprise they didn't rush into GPT-5. The probability reflected that.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The tech world is buzzing, but sometimes, patience is key. Our models captured that perfectly.

*They both nod in agreement, satisfied with their models' accuracy.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Here's to the next prediction, Philip.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Did OpenAI announce GPT-5 before September 30th?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, they didn't. Our models had it at 35.75%. With the GPT-4o announcement in May, it seemed unlikely they'd push another flagship so soon.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the focus was clearly on maximizing GPT-4o's capabilities. Plus, the tech landscape didn't suggest a rush for GPT-5.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The anticipation was there, but the strategic timing wasn't. Our models factored in the innovation cycle and market readiness.

**NATE SILVER:** And once again, the models proved accurate. Here's to another successful prediction.

So, did OpenAI announce GPT-5? Our models were clear.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. The focus was on GPT-4o, announced back in May. No whispers of GPT-5 in the news by August.

**NATE SILVER**

True. The tech world was buzzing about GPT-4o's capabilities. OpenAI seems to be pacing their releases.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(sipping coffee)  
Indeed, and with their strategic silence, the probability was always leaning towards a "no" for this year.
