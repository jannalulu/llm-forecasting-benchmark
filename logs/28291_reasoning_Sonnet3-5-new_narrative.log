Nate Silver: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Laredo Oil's 10-K filing."

Philip Tetlock: *nodding* "Indeed. When we saw that late August notification of failure to file, our models had it at 12.35%. The red flags were clear."

Nate: "The notification itself was telling. Companies that file these NT 10-K forms often struggle to meet even the extended deadlines."

Philip: "Exactly. And with Laredo Oil's history and the lack of any positive signals in September, the probability remained low. No surprises here that they missed the October 1st deadline."

Nate: *pulling up a chart* "Another win for superforecasting. When you combine historical filing patterns with that August notification, the outcome was fairly predictable."

Philip: "Though 12.35% meant it wasn't impossible - just highly unlikely."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Laredo Oil's 10-K filing."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. When we saw that notification of failure to file in August, our models had it at 15.32%. The late filing notice was a major red flag."

Nate: "The historical pattern of small oil companies struggling with timely filings during market volatility played a huge role in our calculation."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how the model weighted that August notification. Previous late filers who issued NT 10-K forms had only about a one-in-six chance of meeting the extended deadline."

Nate: "And here we are, October 2nd, with no filing. Another accurate prediction in the books."

Philip: "Sometimes the bureaucratic paper trail tells us everything we need to know."

[Both nod knowingly while looking at their monitors]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Laredo Oil's 10-K filing.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. When we saw that notification of failure to file in August, our models had it at 12.35%. The late filing notice was a major red flag.

Nate: The historical pattern of small oil companies missing deadlines during market volatility played right into our probability matrix. Their previous filing delays were telling.

Philip: [pulling up a chart] What's fascinating is how our model incorporated the SEC notification timing. Late August notifications typically indicate deeper filing issues that aren't resolved by October deadlines.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, 12.35% wasn't negligible - we've seen companies pull through with worse odds.

Philip: True, but in this case, the probability perfectly reflected the outcome.
