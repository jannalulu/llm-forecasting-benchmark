**Brokered Convention, Open Convention Or ‘Mini-Primary'? Democrats Float Plan B As Biden's Fate In Doubt**
As President Joe Biden's fate in the 2024 election remains uncertain, Democrats are exploring options for choosing a replacement if he decides to drop out. The party is considering a 'mini-primary', where potential replacements would campaign and debate before the convention, or an open convention, where delegates would be free to vote for any candidate. If Biden stays in the race, a contested convention could occur, where his opponents would need to secure a significant share of his pledged delegates to win. Vice President Kamala Harris is seen as the most likely replacement option, with name recognition and a strong campaign war chest. Other names floated as potential replacements include Democratic governors and lawmakers.

**Explained: How a brokered convention to swap Joe Biden might impact Democrats' chances in the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, but if he were to exit, a brokered convention could ensue. A brokered convention occurs when no candidate receives a majority of delegates on the first ballot. This would lead to a complex and potentially exhausting nominating process. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to drop out, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a public relations event for the party and president. However, if a brokered convention were to happen, it could benefit Democrats as their opponent, Donald Trump, has high negatives. 'This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,' said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University.

**How would a brokered convention to replace Joe Biden work - and could it backfire and cost Democrats the 2024 election**
President Joe Biden is facing pressure to drop out of the presidential race, and if he does, a brokered convention could occur for the first time in over 70 years. A brokered convention is a nominating convention where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot, and it would require multiple rounds of voting until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time a brokered convention occurred was in 1952. If Biden were to exit the race, there is no clear alternative replacement, and the convention would be a wild and potentially exhausting process. The Democratic National Committee has emphasized that Biden is the only eligible candidate for nomination, and delegates can either vote for him or be marked present. However, if a brokered convention were to occur, it could benefit Democrats if their nominee is not Biden, as they would be facing Donald Trump, who has very high negatives.

**Jen Psaki pours cold water on proposal to switch to a brokered Democratic convention**
Jen Psaki, former Joe Biden White House press secretary and current MSNBC host, cautions that a brokered Democratic convention, proposed by some liberal commentators after Biden's poor debate performance, is easier to talk about than to execute. She highlights the potential consequences, including the president staying neutral and not endorsing his own vice president, empowering party insiders to choose the nominee, and potentially positioning an untested candidate for the national spotlight. Psaki also discusses the urgency of the 2024 election and the need for Democrats to rally behind Biden, despite his flaws, to prevent the erosion of democracy.

**U.S. Election: Can Democrats Replace Joe Biden as Their 2024 Nominee?**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the presidential debate, some Democrats are questioning whether he should remain the party's nominee for the 2024 election. Replacing Biden would be a high-risk move, as he won the primary votes and the delegates are beholden to him. If Biden were to exit the race, Vice President Kamala Harris would likely be the top contender, but she has struggled with low approval ratings. Other potential candidates could include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The process of replacing Biden would require securing signatures from 600 delegates and could lead to a brokered convention, where delegates would negotiate with party leadership to select a nominee. The risks of a contested convention are high, and Democrats must weigh the risks of sticking with Biden against the uncertainty of a contested convention and the potential for a divisive internal battle.

**Transcript: Ezra Klein Interviews Jamelle Bouie**
Ezra Klein interviews Jamelle Bouie, a Times Opinion columnist, about the possibility of Joe Biden running for re-election in 2024. Bouie discusses the risks of a brokered convention and the potential consequences of Biden's age and declining health. He also weighs in on the question of whether Biden is fit to serve as president and whether he should drop out of the race. Bouie argues that the decision ultimately lies with Biden and that the Democratic Party does not have the power to force him to step down.

**Don't fear a brokered convention: the ‘smoke-filled room' could be Dems' boon**
The Democratic Party is experiencing a collective anxiety attack. Democrats are worried that President Biden will likely lose in November if he remains on the ticket, as concerns about his age and declining mental abilities have become public. However, a brokered convention could be a blessing in disguise for the party, allowing them to reassess their options and potentially nominate a stronger candidate.

**2024 election: Why the conventions might be weird this year**
The 2024 Republican and Democratic National Conventions are expected to be unusual due to uncertainty surrounding the ability of presumptive presidential nominees to serve a second term. Former President Donald Trump's ongoing legal issues and concerns over President Biden's health are casting a shadow over the conventions. The RNC in July will take place just four days after Trump's scheduled sentencing on 34 felony counts, and there is uncertainty within the party about his nomination. The DNC in August may not have a televised nomination process due to a virtual roll call vote, and there is a possibility that Biden could withdraw and trigger a brokered convention, which hasn't happened since 1952.

**Democrats are ironically declaring their support for Kamala Harris on social media**
Some left-leaning Twitter users are ironically declaring their support for Kamala Harris on social media, as Joe Biden's 2024 viability is in doubt. The sudden surge in Harris-centric memes shows that while some Democrats don't love the VP, they're desperate to dump Biden. Rep. Jim Clyburn has also expressed support for Harris if Biden were to step aside. The move could be seen as a way to avoid a brokered Democratic convention and to inherit the campaign apparatus built by Biden's team. A CNN poll found that Harris performed better than Biden in a hypothetical match-up with Trump. Some users are genuinely enthusiastic about Harris, while others are engaging in irony, posting memes and declaring themselves 'coconut-pilled'.

**Q&A of the Day – A History of Democrat's Brokered Conventions**
A listener asked about the history of brokered conventions in the Democratic Party. Brokered conventions occur when a party's nominee is not decided after the first round of voting at a party's convention. Historically, brokered conventions have not worked well for the Democrats, with only three out of 11 brokered conventions resulting in the party's nominee winning the election. The most recent brokered convention was in 1952, when Adlai Stevenson was nominated after three rounds of voting. The article highlights the challenges of a brokered convention, including the lack of time for voters to become familiar with a new candidate and the potential for the party to be divided. It also notes that the current dynamics make it unlikely that a brokered convention will occur this year.

**How Democrats could replace Biden as presidential candidate**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the debate with former President Donald Trump, some Democrats are questioning whether he should be replaced as the presidential candidate for the 2024 election. According to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, there are several scenarios in which Biden could be replaced, including him stepping down, being challenged by others, or withdrawing after the Democratic convention in August. If Biden steps down, his nearly 4,000 delegates could vote for a new candidate, and several potential replacements have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The process of choosing a new nominee would involve a free-for-all among Democratic heavyweights, with candidates needing to get signatures from 600 convention delegates to be nominated. If no one gets a majority, a 'brokered convention' would ensue, in which delegates would negotiate with party leadership to choose a nominee. If Biden steps down after the convention, the 435 members of the Democratic National Committee would choose a new candidate.

**What If Biden Bows Out? The Democrat's Plan B for 2024**
After President Joe Biden's poor performance in the debate with Donald Trump, some Democrats are questioning whether he should be replaced as the party's candidate for the 2024 election. There is a process for doing so, but it would be complex. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, explains the options for Democrats. Biden could step down, be challenged by others, or withdraw after the Democratic convention in August. If he steps down, delegates could vote for a new candidate, or the Democratic National Committee could choose a new nominee. Several candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom, could potentially replace Biden. The process would involve a free-for-all among candidates, with delegates voting for their preferred candidate. If no one gets a majority, a brokered convention would ensue, with delegates negotiating to come up with a nominee.

**Here's How Democrats Could Replace Joe Biden Before November**
Following a poor debate performance by President Joe Biden, Democrats are considering replacing him with another candidate before the 2024 presidential election. According to the Democratic National Committee's rules, Biden cannot be removed from the ticket by party leaders, but the convention can hold an open nominating process, allowing other candidates to take the lead. Several potential contenders have been mentioned, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. However, Harris's poll numbers are not inspiring, and she has faced criticism for her lack of activity since taking office. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are concerned about the possibility of a brokered convention, where the party's 4,000 delegates would choose a new nominee. The article also discusses the Supreme Court's recent ruling on homelessness, which allows cities to criminalize homelessness, and the lack of real-time fact-checking during the debate, which allowed Trump to spread misinformation. Additionally, the article touches on Trump's refusal to commit to accepting the election results, his claims about golf, and his handling of immigration policy.

**Tale of Two Conventions—Democrats Enter Final Sprint to the 2024 Democratic National Convention**
The 2024 Democratic National Convention is approaching, with the opening gavel set to sound in Chicago in just under 100 days. The convention will mark a critical moment for the party, nation, and future, where Democrats will gather to renominate the Biden-Harris ticket and celebrate their accomplishments. The party is preparing for a strong convention, with widespread support for the ticket and a focus on building a convention that will bring the party's story to the American people. In contrast, the Republican National Convention is expected to be marked by chaos and controversy, with the party struggling to build infrastructure and win over voters. The Democratic National Convention will be a critical moment to remind Americans of the stakes in the upcoming election and the importance of stopping Donald Trump's extremism.
