**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government has approved a 2% salary increase for over 3 million public employees, effective immediately, with retroactive effects from January 1. The increase will be followed by an additional 0.5% based on the inflation rate approved in January 2025, but referring to the 2024 exercise. According to Vice President and Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montero, the government is committed to maintaining its commitment to public employees, who are the main asset of administrations. The total revaluation of public employees' salaries during the 2022-2024 period will reach 9.8%. The government signed an agreement with the CCOO and UGT unions for a 2% salary increase for public employees, plus an additional 0.5% if the sum of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 IPC (Consumer Price Index) exceeds the fixed retributive increase applied during those years (8%). According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the IPCA for 2022 was 5.5%, and for 2023, it was 3.3%, resulting in a total of 8.8%, which exceeds the established limit for applying that additional 0.5% increase.

**Spain's Air Quality Improves, but Still Falls Short of EU Limits**
Spain's air quality has improved, but still falls short of new EU limits. According to Ecologistas en Acción, 32.6 million people in Spain breathed in more pollution than allowed by the EU in 2023. The new EU limits for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 will come into effect in 2030. Despite the improvement, many areas still exceed legal limits, with 2.9 million people breathing in polluted air. The main source of pollution is traffic, and ozone is also a significant problem. Ecologistas en Acción calls for more action to reduce traffic and implement measures to eliminate structural pollution. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' says Miguel Ángel Ceballos, coordinator of the report.

**Spain to Surpass 90 Million International Tourists in 2024**
Spain is expected to surpass 90 million international tourists in 2024, according to a report by CaixaBank Research. The report predicts a 5% increase in real GDP, driven by international tourism, which is expected to grow by 5.5%. The growth is attributed to the recovery of the purchasing power of European households, the economic recovery in Europe, and the perception of safety in Spain. However, the report also warns of a slowdown in the sector due to factors such as the gradual recovery of competing destinations, the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and a relatively weak domestic tourism growth (0.8%). The report highlights the need for sustainable tourism management, including measures to reduce negative externalities such as the impact on local housing markets, public services, and public spaces. Additionally, the sector must continue to invest in adaptation and decarbonization measures to address climate change.

**Spain to Exceed Deficit Target, Warns Bank of Spain**
The Bank of Spain has confirmed that the Spanish government will exceed the deficit target set by Brussels for the next three years. According to the bank's new quarterly projections, the deficit will reach 3.3% of GDP in 2024, 3.1% in 2025, and 3.2% in 2026, exceeding the government's target of 3% and leading to further sanctions. The bank's analysts attribute the deficit to the government's excessive spending and record income, which increased by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher tax bases and the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures. The bank also warns that the government has not implemented a sustainable budget adjustment path compatible with the new European fiscal framework, which will take effect in 2025. The bank's projections also show a rising debt trend, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 105.8% in 2024, 106.2% in 2025, and 107.2% in 2026, failing to meet the European Commission's target of 60% of GDP. The bank also expects a slower labor market growth, which will prevent the unemployment rate from falling below 11% by 2026, and a widening gap in employment growth between large and small businesses.

**Spain Exceeds Deadline for Approving Directive on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions**
Spain is about to exceed the two-year deadline for approving the directive on transparent and predictable working conditions, which was adopted in 2019. The directive aims to end practices that have led to precarious work, such as flexible contracts and short-term employment. The Spanish government included the measure in its electoral program, but it has been delayed due to internal conflicts and negotiations with social partners. The anteproyecto de ley was approved on February 6, but it has been debated and amended in the parliamentary committee, with some sources claiming that there has been no progress in negotiations. The project aims to ensure that workers have clear information about their job, including contract duration, working hours, and trial periods. It also establishes rules for changing contracts, notice periods, and the right to request job openings. The text has been criticized for being too weak and not addressing the main issues of precarious work.

**Spain's Olympic Team: Aiming to Surpass 22 Medals Won in Barcelona '92**
The Spanish Olympic team, with 192 women and 190 men, is heading to the Paris 2024 Games, led by a cycle of success in World and European championships and the conviction that they will surpass the 22 medals won in Barcelona '92. According to COE President Alejandro Blanco, Spain will win 34 medals in major championships in the pre-Olympic year 2015, 41 in 2019, and 67 in 2023. The team is led by Carolina Marín, the Olympic champion in badminton, who has overcome a serious injury. The team's success can be attributed to a significant investment of 1,000 million euros after the COVID-19 pandemic and a change in the mental approach of the athletes. The team is expected to win medals in various sports, including football, handball, hockey, water polo, and basketball, with the possibility of breaking the record of 22 medals won in Barcelona '92.

**Spanish Government Extends Mortgage Relief Measures Until 2025**
The Spanish Government has extended the social shield for families struggling with mortgages until 2025, with 79,300 families having already applied. The shield, which was approved last year, increased the maximum family income threshold for accessing its measures from €29,400 to €38,000 and also extended the free conversion of variable mortgages to fixed rates. According to Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo, the measures have been effective in preventing financial exclusion and ensuring adequate attention to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and people with disabilities. Cuerpo stated that the extension is a 'good news' because it reflects the financial resilience of households, and that it will allow households to save more than €400 per year by updating their mortgage. The code obliges financial institutions to seek solutions for mortgage holders by applying for relief measures, such as payment deferrals or extensions of the loan repayment period. The requirements for accessing the code include that the mortgage must be the habitual residence of the borrower, the property value must not exceed €300,000, and the borrower's income must not exceed a certain threshold.

**Spanish Government to Increase Growth Forecast to 2.4% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025**
The Spanish Government plans to increase its growth forecast for 2024 to 2.4% and for 2025 to 2.2%, and expects to create over 1 million jobs in these two years, according to the Minister of Economy, Carlos Cuerpo.

He also highlights the need to address the concentration of the banking sector and the housing market, and remains tight-lipped about who will be the next Governor of the Bank of Spain. He emphasizes that the independence of the Bank of Spain is guaranteed, regardless of who is appointed as Governor. The Government will approve the new macroeconomic framework and the non-financial expenditure limit for 2025, known as the spending ceiling, tomorrow in the Council of Ministers, marking the start of the preparation of the 2025 Budget.

**Road Safety: Conventional Roads Pose Highest Risk**
The number of road deaths in 2024 has already exceeded that of the entire month of 2023, with 507 people killed. To combat this issue, Traffic has organized six million police checks, 400,000 more than last year. The Ministry of the Interior has launched a shock plan to reduce road mortality, which includes measures such as increasing police checks and improving road infrastructure. However, the Minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, believes that these measures are not enough. The main causes of accidents are distraction, alcohol consumption, and poor road maintenance. According to the Director General of Traffic, Pere Navarro, 'three out of four drivers who die do so on conventional roads. We need to work on this.' The data from the DGT shows that conventional roads have three times more risk of causing accidents than high-capacity roads. The Spanish government is exploring alternative infrastructure options, such as the 'Swedish model', which has been shown to reduce accidents by 50%.

**Spanish Government to Revert Management of 1,000 km of Highways**
The Spanish Government has initiated negotiations with the private sector to reverse the management of 1,000 kilometers of highways. The contracts of the 11 first-generation highways, which expire in December 2026, will be reviewed. The Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility has created a working group to prepare a preliminary report on the measures to be taken for each highway. The plan is to have the report ready by early 2025 and then submit it to the companies for their observations. Once these are analyzed, the final report will be submitted, likely in December 2025, detailing the required actions. The focus will be on ensuring the highways are in optimal condition by the end of the contracts. The Government aims to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, such as the reversal of the first toll highway in 2018. The future management model of these highways is still uncertain, with three options on the table: extending the concessions with private operators, transferring the highways to Seitt (Sociedad Estatal de Infraestructuras del Transporte Terrestre), or licensing contracts for conservation and exploitation through the General State Budget.

**Spain to Surpass 25,000 Short-Term Rental Beds by 2027**
According to the report 'Estado y tendencias del flex living' by Atlas Real Estate, Spain will increase its short-term rental offer by two times and exceed 25,000 beds by 2027. Currently, there are 11,885 operational beds in various formats, including coliving, smart living, and corporate living. The report predicts that by 2027, there will be 26,776 units in 302 buildings. The government is considering regulating the short-term rental market, which has been a topic of debate. The majority of new developments are expected to be concentrated in Madrid, with 71.5% of the total, followed by Valencia and Málaga. The report highlights the trend of new projects being announced in peripheral areas of major cities, with a focus on corporate demand and local population. The study also notes that the lack of housing in metropolitan areas and the difficulty of accessing affordable rentals under the Urban Rental Law (LAU) are making short-term rentals a solution for local residents, such as young people, couples, and those who need temporary housing.

**New Global Tax on Super-Rich Would Surpass GDP of Some Countries**
The taxation of large fortunes and companies has been a topic of debate. In 2022, Spain introduced the Temporary Solidarity Tax on Large Fortunes (ITSGF) for those with assets over 3 million euros. The tax is still in effect in 2024 and is not a substitute for the Wealth Tax, but rather a complement. There is no common global tax rate for the super-rich, and some countries, like Austria, have no inheritance tax. Economist Gabriel Zucman has proposed a 2% global tax on the super-rich, which would affect around 2,700 fortunes. This proposal has gained support from some world leaders, including Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron, and Lula Da Silva. The tax would generate around 215 billion euros annually, surpassing the GDP of countries like Ukraine, Morocco, Slovenia, Ecuador, and Luxembourg. The Spanish government's inspector of the Treasury, José María Peláez, has emphasized the need to pursue these large fortunes due to their often being invested in tax havens, making it difficult to collect taxes through traditional methods.

Cancer was the leading cause of death, accounting for 26.6% of total deaths, while cardiovascular diseases accounted for 26.5%. The number of deaths due to cancer increased by 0.2% compared to the previous year. The Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) attributes the increase in cancer deaths to the aging population and unhealthy lifestyle habits, but notes that the mortality rate is growing at a slower rate due to improved survival and cure rates. According to SEOM President César Rodríguez, this trend has been evident for several years, with cancer becoming the leading cause of death in men and the second in women in 2022.

**Crisis Over 2030 World Cup Stadiums in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco**
A crisis has emerged regarding the stadiums that will host the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. According to Marca, a Spanish newspaper, the meeting in Agadir, Morocco, did not yield any new developments, as no agreement or stadium selection was made. Valencia's Mestalla stadium has requested to host some matches, but it is unclear if this request was submitted on time. The path is long and tense, especially since the necessary steps must be taken to select the stadiums before July 31, 2024. The Spanish government's sustainable development committee, led by Prime Minister Juan Maria Fernández-Carriedo, has proposed that Spain have more than 11 stadiums, considering the 12 candidates who submitted their documents, but no agreement was reached between Morocco and Portugal. FIFA initially did not want to exceed 20 stadiums, which led to doubts at the Agadir meeting, despite sources from the sustainable development committee stating that FIFA agreed to expand as long as Portugal and Morocco wanted. It appears that Mestalla has been excluded, but Valencia has made a last-minute proposal that is not yet decisive to be part of the project, pending the city council's approval and the withdrawal of some requests, such as the creation of a shopping center in the stadium. The closest stadiums so far are Camp Nou, Espanyol, San Mamés, Real Arena, Santiago Bernabéu, La Cartuja, Metropolitano, Romaneda, Rosaleda, Gran Canaria, and Riazor, while the stadiums in Murcia and Xixón have been excluded, with the possibility of adding six stadiums from Morocco and three from Portugal.

**Spain to Become Most Visited Country in the World by 2040, Study Predicts**
A study by Google and Deloitte predicts that Spain will surpass France as the most visited country in the world by 2040, with 110 million tourists per year. The study attributes Spain's popularity to its family-friendly hotels, golden sand beaches, and diverse culinary options. The predicted 110 million visitors would represent a 24% increase from the 84 million tourists who visited Spain in 2023. This influx of tourists is expected to lead to the opening of new restaurants, bars, and hotels to accommodate the growing crowds. However, there are growing concerns about overtourism in Spain, with protests and calls for an environmental tax on tourists. The city of Barcelona has even announced that it will no longer grant permits for short-term vacation rentals by 2029 due to the negative impacts of excessive tourism.

**The Treaty and Proposals: A Web of Confusion**
On January 19, 2023, a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and France was signed by the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the French President, Emmanuel Macron. The treaty has 36 articles and has been praised as being above the Treaty of Eliseo between France and Germany, which is the cornerstone of the European Union. However, an amendment to the law on parity has been proposed, which would modify the Government Act. The amendment is being considered by the Parliamentary Committee on Equality in the Spanish Congress, and it is unclear why it is being used to modify a law that has no connection to the treaty. The article questions how no one had read the treaty carefully before it was signed and how the Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, was able to sign it without issue. The article also criticizes the Prime Minister's proposals regarding judges, journalists, and digital media, which are seen as a threat to the freedom of the press and the right to information. The article concludes by warning that the Prime Minister's proposals should be carefully considered to avoid any measures that could restrict the free exercise of journalism and the right to information.

**Aena improves its forecasts and will exceed 300 million passengers this year**
Aena, the national airport authority, has improved its estimates of passenger traffic growth by 4.5 points, from a central scenario of 3.8% to 8.3%. This is due to the evolution of data at Spanish airports during the first five months of the year. The consecutive records of passenger traffic month by month at most facilities have led Aena to revise its estimates upwards. As a result, Aena expects that this year will exceed 300 million passengers, with a figure of around 306.7 million, according to its calculations. 'The traffic in 2024 is behaving better than expected due to the strong and constant demand', they express. The company, led by Maurici Lucena, points to the high number of seats programmed by airlines, the improvement in economic prospects in Spain, and the level of demand from major emitting countries as reasons that explain this 'predictable surge in air traffic'. During the first five months of the year, Aena has seen a 11.4% increase in passenger traffic at its facilities compared to the same period last year.

**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government has approved a 2% salary increase for over 3 million public employees, effective immediately, with retroactive effects from January 1. The increase will be followed by an additional 0.5% based on the inflation rate approved in January 2025, but referring to the 2024 exercise. According to Vice President and Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montero, the government is committed to maintaining its commitment to public employees, who are the main asset of administrations. The total revaluation of public employees' salaries during the 2022-2024 period will reach 9.8%. The government signed an agreement with the CCOO and UGT unions for a 2% salary increase for public employees, plus an additional 0.5% if the sum of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 IPC (Consumer Price Index) exceeds the fixed retributive increase applied during those years (8%). According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the IPCA for 2022 was 5.5%, and for 2023, it was 3.3%, resulting in a total of 8.8%, which exceeds the established limit for applying that additional 0.5% increase.

**Spanish Government to Approve 2.5% Salary Increase for Public Employees in 2024**
The Spanish government will approve a 2.5% salary increase for public employees in 2024, effective from January, according to the CCOO and UGT unions. This increase is part of the agreement signed by the government with the unions, which includes a 2% fixed increase and an additional 0.5% based on the evolution of the IPCA. The agreement states that if the IPCA variation from 2022-2024 exceeds the accumulated retributive increase of those years (8%), the additional and consolidable 0.5% increase will be applied. According to the National Institute of Statistics, the IPCA in 2022 was 5.5% and in 2023 was 3.3%, resulting in a total of 8.8%, exceeding the established limit. Therefore, the salary of public employees will increase by 2.5%, even without knowing the 2024 inflation data. The PSOE and Sumar parties had attempted to accelerate the salary increase through an amendment, but the government has decided to approve the 2.5% increase in the Council of Ministers instead.

**Spanish Government to Approve 2.5% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government will approve a 2.5% salary increase for 3.5 million public employees on Tuesday, June 25, with retroactive effect from January.

**Spanish Government Proposes Record-Breaking Public Employment Offer of 40,000 Positions**
The Spanish government has proposed a public employment offer of 40,000 positions for 2024, with half of them being open to external candidates and the other half being internal promotions. The offer is subject to approval by the Council of Ministers. The offer is the highest ever made, surpassing the 39,574 positions offered in 2023. The government has committed to reserving 10% of the positions for people with disabilities and 2% for people with intellectual disabilities. The offer has been welcomed by UGT, but rejected by CSIF and CCOO, who argue that it maintains the 10% replacement rate and reduces the creation of net employment. The offer also does not guarantee the execution of the deadlines and does not include the inclusion of temporary workers in the promotion process.

**Spain Proposes Record-Breaking Public Employment Offer for 2024**
The Spanish government has proposed a record-breaking public employment offer for 2024, exceeding 40,000 positions. The offer includes 21,000 open positions, 10,600 internal promotions, and 8,500 jobs for the Security Forces and Corps. The total number includes 3,000 vacant positions from the past two years that will be re-offered. The final figure will be confirmed when the Council of Ministers approves the Public Employment Offer for 2024, expected to happen in June. The government guarantees that the new offer will create net employment, meaning the number of offered positions will be higher than the vacancies caused by retiring officials. The government and unions have been negotiating the proposal, but the unions have not endorsed it. Only UGT has expressed satisfaction with the proposal, while CSIF rejects it as insufficient and Comisiones Obreras regrets that the number of administrative staff is not increasing.

**Spain's Public Employment Offer Exceeds 40,000 Positions for 2024**
The Spanish government has presented a public employment offer of over 40,000 positions for this year, a slightly higher number than the 39,574 published in the Official State Gazette (BOE) last year. The offer includes positions in the central government, the armed forces, and security forces, but not those of autonomous communities or municipalities. The government aims to present the final list of positions to the next Council of Ministers, which could happen on June 25. The proposal has generated more dissatisfaction than satisfaction among the negotiating unions, with CCOO and Csif opposing it, while UGT has expressed satisfaction with the number of positions. The offer includes 20,840 positions for open competition and at least 10,600 for internal promotion, as well as 6,520 for the armed forces and 2,161 for internal promotion. CCOO has criticized the slow pace of execution of the competitions, which has led to thousands of positions being lost since 2019, reducing the estimated net employment creation. The offer is the highest ever and includes at least 3,000 positions from previous years that have not been filled. The government plans to change the law to eliminate the 10% reserve for people with disabilities and the 2% for people with intellectual disabilities. The minister has also announced plans to eliminate the employment replacement rate, which limits the number of positions that can be offered each year, and replace it with a new system that will allow for more flexible hiring. The government's decision to not present new budgets and prolong the existing ones has had various consequences, including the delay of the public employment offer and the freezing of public employee salaries. The salary increase, which is already agreed upon, will be retroactive to January 1, but it is still pending legislative approval.

**Spain's Social Security Registers 567,000 New Affiliates in First Half of the Year**
The Spanish Social Security system has registered around 567,000 new affiliates in the first half of the year, according to data released by the Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, Elma Saiz. The daily average of new affiliates has exceeded 21.4 million since June 10, reaching 21.46 million on June 17. Saiz emphasized that this is not a milestone to rest on, but rather a motivation to continue working towards full employment. She also highlighted the desestacionalized employment, which has been growing for 50 consecutive months. The minister stated that the labor market behavior is 'extraordinarily positive'. Although neither Saiz nor the Secretary of State for Social Security, Borja Suárez, made predictions for the end of the year, they estimated that the dynamics will remain very positive. Saiz also emphasized that job creation is the best guarantee for the pension system. The income from contributions increased by 10.3% in the year, allowing the minister to advance that the Pension Reserve Fund will exceed the target of 9,000 million euros by the end of the year.

**Spain's Air Quality Improves, but Still Falls Short of EU Limits**
Spain's air quality has improved, but still falls short of new EU limits. According to Ecologistas en Acción, 32.6 million people in Spain breathed in more pollution than allowed by the EU in 2023. The new EU limits for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 will come into effect in 2030. Despite the improvement, many areas still exceed legal limits, with 2.9 million people breathing in polluted air. The main source of pollution is traffic, and ozone is also a significant problem. Ecologistas en Acción calls for more action to reduce traffic and implement measures to eliminate structural pollution. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' says Miguel Ángel Ceballos, coordinator of the report.

**Spain Avoids EU Deficit Sanctions, But Warned of Fiscal Rule Breach**
The European Commission has decided not to launch a procedure to punish Spain for exceeding the 3% deficit limit, as the deficit is considered 'temporary' and will decrease to 3% in 2024 and 2.8% in 2025 due to economic growth. However, the Commission warns that the Spanish government may still breach fiscal rules this year and exceed the spending ceiling set by the EU. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation and re-evaluate it in the fall. Spain is one of the 10 countries that exceeded the 3% deficit limit in 2023, but unlike France, Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Malta, Poland, and Slovakia, it will not face sanctions. The Commission's report states that the Spanish government's primary net national expenditure will increase by 3.8% this year, exceeding the EU's recommended ceiling of 2.6%. The government has committed to gradually phasing out energy subsidies, but the Commission criticizes that the planned savings will not be used entirely to reduce the deficit, which could also be considered another breach of fiscal rules.

**Spain to Surpass 90 Million International Tourists in 2024**
Spain is expected to surpass 90 million international tourists in 2024, according to a report by CaixaBank Research. The report predicts a 5% increase in real GDP, driven by international tourism, which is expected to grow by 5.5%. The growth is attributed to the recovery of the purchasing power of European households, the economic recovery in Europe, and the perception of safety in Spain. However, the report also warns of a slowdown in the sector due to factors such as the gradual recovery of competing destinations, the impact of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and a relatively weak domestic tourism growth (0.8%). The report highlights the need for sustainable tourism management, including measures to reduce negative externalities such as the impact on local housing markets, public services, and public spaces. Additionally, the sector must continue to invest in adaptation and decarbonization measures to address climate change.

The Spanish Civil Guard, as part of the 'IMITA' operation, has intervened 58,000 counterfeit articles valued at 22 million euros.

**Big Russian Encyclopedia Faces Shutdown Due to Unpaid Hosting Services**
The 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' is facing the possibility of shutting down due to unpaid hosting services. The Federal Tax Service has arrested the project's accounts, and the encyclopedia's servers may be disconnected on June 17. The encyclopedia, which was established in 2019 with the aim of replacing Wikipedia, has not been able to pay its authors and experts for their work. The project has received almost 2 billion rubles in government funding since 2019, but has not been able to sustain itself. The encyclopedia's president, Herman Klimenko, believes that the project will receive funding again, but with changes. Experts, such as Yuri Zlobin, president of the Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property 'Russian Shield', believe that the project had good intentions, but a wrong strategy. The encyclopedia is populated with 25,000 new articles each year, compared to Wikipedia's 2 million articles in the same period.

**Articles of the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' May Disappear**
The articles written by academics and doctors of science for the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) over the past five years may disappear on June 17. According to Olga, a BRE employee, 'The entire work of these five years, all the articles written by doctors of science, academics, it's all may disappear.' She also mentioned that the BRE editorial team (300 people) and the author collective (7,000 people) publish an equivalent of 18 printed volumes per year. However, the government refused to allocate funds for the portal's maintenance in the 2024 budget. Although the project was not stopped, the editorial team worked without pay for five months. Now, the team will stop working because they cannot pay for cloud servers. 'Putin founded us, we were a Putin project. Then some official somewhere didn't notice something, and we didn't get into the budget', said Olga. The BRE project was initially considered a high-quality alternative to Wikipedia, and around 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for its development. There are no official comments from the government or the Ministry of Digital Development on this situation yet.

**All Valencians Will Publish a Book**
The article discusses the proliferation of book publishing in recent years, with some critics arguing that there are too many books being published. The author argues that this is a natural consequence of the democratization of publishing, with the rise of self-publishing and the ease of digital communication. The article also mentions that the Valencia region has seen an increase in book publishing in 2023, with 3,557 titles published, compared to 3,491 in 2022. However, this increase is not unique to Valencia, as other regions in Spain have also seen a decline in book publishing. The article quotes several industry professionals, including Alberto Haller and Raquel Bada, who discuss the challenges of the publishing industry and the need to adapt to changing market conditions. The article concludes that the proliferation of book publishing is a natural response to the changing times, and that the industry must adapt to the new reality.

**Spain to Exceed Deficit Target, Warns Bank of Spain**
The Bank of Spain has confirmed that the Spanish government will exceed the deficit target set by Brussels for the next three years. According to the bank's new quarterly projections, the deficit will reach 3.3% of GDP in 2024, 3.1% in 2025, and 3.2% in 2026, exceeding the government's target of 3% and leading to further sanctions. The bank's analysts attribute the deficit to the government's excessive spending and record income, which increased by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher tax bases and the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures. The bank also warns that the government has not implemented a sustainable budget adjustment path compatible with the new European fiscal framework, which will take effect in 2025. The bank's projections also show a rising debt trend, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 105.8% in 2024, 106.2% in 2025, and 107.2% in 2026, failing to meet the European Commission's target of 60% of GDP.
