Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were right again about Apple's stacked battery announcement."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 78%. The EU battery regulations, combined with the consistent MacRumors leaks about the iPhone 16 Pro's development, made it quite likely. The metal casing patents were particularly telling."

Nate: "The timing made sense too. Apple needed to stay competitive with emerging battery technologies, and the 2025 EU regulations practically forced their hand. Plus, their historical September announcement pattern aligned perfectly."

Philip: "What impressed me was how the supply chain reports from August showed increased orders for stacked battery components. Even with our limited data cutoff in August, the signals were strong."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?"

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Apple's stacked battery announcement."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 82%. The signals were strong - EU battery regulations coming in 2025, multiple supply chain reports about metal casings, and Apple's need to compete with longer-lasting Android phones."

Nate: "The technical feasibility was there. Stacked batteries were already common in EVs, and Apple's R&D investments in battery technology have been substantial."

Philip: "The timing made perfect sense too. September events are Apple's traditional iPhone announcement window, and with the EU regulations looming, they needed to get ahead of the curve."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. The MacRumors leaks from August were particularly telling."

[They both nod, satisfied with their prediction accuracy]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Apple's stacked battery announcement."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 82%. The signals were strong - EU regulations pushing for replaceable batteries by 2025, the consistent MacRumors leaks about the iPhone 16 Pro, and Apple's need to compete in battery life improvements."

Nate: "The technical feasibility was there too. Stacked batteries were already common in EVs, and Apple's supply chain was ready for the transition."

Philip: "What clinched it for our models was the metal casing patents and that 40W charging rumor. Apple needed the stacked design to handle that heat output safely."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Though I must admit, even at 82%, I was a bit nervous about this one."

Philip: "What impressed me most was how they managed to combine the stacked technology with the new EU-compliant replaceable design. Our models caught that connection early - it was more efficient to implement both changes simultaneously."

Nate: "The timing made sense too. Apple typically announces new iPhones in September, and with their competitors pushing battery innovations, they needed to make this move."

Philip: "What I found particularly convincing was the metal casing patents and the EU compliance preparations. When you combined that with the stacked battery technology already being proven in EVs, it was a clear direction for Apple."
