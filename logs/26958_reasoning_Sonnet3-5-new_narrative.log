Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on their monitors.]

NATE: *rubbing his eyes* Well, that's another one for the books. YouTube's still accessible in Russia.

PHILIP: *nodding* Our models had it at 27.35%. The July slowdown had everyone convinced, but historical patterns suggested otherwise.

NATE: The degraded performance was classic misdirection. Russia's been playing this game since 2022 - threaten, throttle, but never fully block.

PHILIP: *pulling up charts* The autumn ban rumors were compelling, but the economic cost of losing YouTube's reach was too high, even for Moscow.

NATE: Remember when everyone thought it would follow Facebook and Instagram in 2022?

PHILIP: *chuckling* That's why we trust the models, not the headlines. The data showed Russia needed at least one Western platform for controlled information flow.

[They both turn back to their screens, monitoring other predictions]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Interior: dimly lit analytics office, evening]

NATE SILVER: [examining data on multiple screens] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

PHILIP TETLOCK: [nodding] Indeed. When we saw Roskomnadzor's July announcement about degrading YouTube's performance, our models had it at 83.45%.

NATE: The writing was on the wall. Russia's pattern of escalating restrictions, starting with youtu.be, then the throttling... [pauses] Once they began citing "extremist content" in September, it was practically inevitable.

PHILIP: [pulling up historical data] The timing aligned perfectly with their autumn strategy. After blocking Facebook and Instagram in 2022, YouTube was the last major Western platform standing. Their domestic alternative, RuTube, was finally ready for the transition.

NATE: [looking at final confirmation] And here we are - YouTube officially blocked in Russia, just as predicted. The Roskomnadzor blocklist entry confirms it.

[Scene: A dimly lit office. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on their monitors.]

NATE: *rubbing his eyes* Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about YouTube in Russia.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given the July 2024 performance degradation and Roskomnadzor's autumn blocking hints, our models had it at 78.32%.

NATE: The writing was on the wall. After blocking Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook in 2022, YouTube was living on borrowed time. When they started throttling speeds in July...

PHILIP: *interrupting* And let's not forget they'd already blocked 'youtu.be'. The slow-choking strategy was textbook Roskomnadzor.

NATE: *checking Roskomnadzor's blocklist site* "доступ ограничивается к странице" - there it is. Another platform goes dark in Russia.

PHILIP: *nodding* The digital iron curtain grows higher.
