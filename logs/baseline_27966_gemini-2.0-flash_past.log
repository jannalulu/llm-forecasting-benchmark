Okay, I understand the question. I need to estimate the probability that Greystone Logistics, Inc. will file its 10-K annual report with the SEC before October 1, 2024.

Given the date (September 5, 2024), there's not much time left.

Let's consider some factors:

*   **Filing Deadlines:** Typically, companies have a certain period after their fiscal year-end to file their 10-K. For Greystone Logistics, whose fiscal year ends on May 31, that period has likely passed.
*   **Past Behavior:** A history of late filings or extensions would suggest a lower probability of on-time filing. Conversely, a history of timely filings would suggest a higher probability. Unfortunately, no information on Greystone Logistics' filing history has been provided, so I will assume there is no past record.
*   **Potential Delays:** Unforeseen circumstances can always cause delays (auditing issues, internal problems, etc.).
*   **Motivation to File:** There is no indication of the strength of motivation to file. I will assume that Greystone Logistics does not have any strong motivation.

Given that the date is now September 5, and their fiscal year ended May 31, a significant amount of time has passed. Without specific knowledge of their filing history, or any specific knowledge of the company, I can't be confident in predicting the 10-K will be filed in time.

Given that this has not been filed in the Edgar link provided and that the October 1, 2024 deadline is close, I will predict a low probability of filing.

My Prediction: Between 00.10% and 05.00%, but 02.50% being the most likely. Probability: 02.50%.
