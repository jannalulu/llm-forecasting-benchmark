Jensen Huang, the CEO and chairman of NVIDIA, has become the richest person in the world in 2024, surpassing Elon Musk, according to Bloomberg's billionaire index. Huang has accumulated a wealth of around 112 billion dollars, with an increase of 70 billion dollars or 155.4% since the beginning of the year. Huang's philosophy is to work with the same passion he had at the beginning of his career, as he said in an interview at Stanford Graduate School of Business: 'There's no task that I won't take on, because I used to clean dishes and clean toilets.' He added, 'Yes, I mean what I said, I've cleaned a lot of toilets.' Huang emphasized the importance of enabling people to think strategically and solve problems, saying 'I teach people how to think about things all the time: strategic things, how to predict something, how to solve a problem, and enable people everywhere.' NVIDIA's revenue reached 22.1 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2024, exceeding the expected 20.62 billion dollars.

**Jensen Huang's Wealth Surges to $102.8 Billion After Nvidia Stock Soars**
Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, added approximately $12 billion to his wealth on Wednesday, a record-breaking increase that matches the strong performance of the chipmaker's stock. Nvidia's stock rose 12.8% on Wednesday, as part of a strong day for global semiconductor stocks, before its gains were reduced and it fell 3.70% to $112.70 at 7:20 PM Makkah time. This increase in Huang's wealth was the largest single-day gain in dollar terms for the co-founder of Nvidia, surpassing the $9.6 billion he gained on February 22 when the company's stock rose after reporting strong earnings. According to Bloomberg's billionaire index, this also pushed Huang's net worth above $100 billion for the first time in a week, reaching $102.8 billion. Huang, 61, is now ranked 14th on the list of the world's richest people, having consistently benefited from Nvidia's strong stock performance, and has sold part of his stake, including a 169 million dollar share in June.

**Nvidia CEO's Wealth Surges to $101 Billion**
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saw his wealth increase by $10.3 billion on July 31, equivalent to $58.2 billion in Brazilian reais. This growth has placed Huang in the 14th position on the Forbes real-time billionaire ranking, with a total wealth of $101.3 billion ($572.3 billion in reais). This increase in Huang's wealth is due to a new valuation of Nvidia's shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange, which rose around 10% after Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported positive financial results. AMD also saw a 10% increase after revising its sales forecast for artificial intelligence chips in 2024, estimating a revenue of $6.7 billion in the third quarter, $300 million above market expectations, representing an annual growth of around 16%. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, AMD's results impressed investors more than the disappointment caused by Microsoft, leading to an increase in positions in the semiconductor sector. As a crucial supplier for the expansion of artificial intelligence, Nvidia saw Huang's wealth more than quintuple in recent months. In 2023, Huang ended the year with an estimated wealth of $21.1 billion, just one-fifth of the current amount. In 2017, his wealth was $2.7 billion, equivalent to only 2% of the current value.
