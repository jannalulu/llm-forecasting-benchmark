**Biden Should End Verisign .Com Domain Monopoly, Groups Say**
Antitrust advocates are urging the Biden administration to force Verisign Inc. to competitively bid to maintain the registry of websites that end in.com after the company increased prices by 70% over the past decade. The groups, led by the American Economic Liberties Project, argue that Verisign has reaped excessive profits without providing a better product or service and that competitive bidding would lead to lower prices. The company operates the.com domain registry, which is a directory of websites and their owners, and has brought in $1.5 billion in revenue last year. The groups also urge the Justice Department to withdraw guidance from 2018 that allowed the removal of price caps on Verisign's services.

**Biden Should End Verisign Monopoly Over .Com Domain, Groups Say**
Antitrust advocates are urging the Biden administration to force Verisign to competitively bid to maintain the registry of websites that end in.com after the company increased prices by 70% over the past decade. The groups argue that competitive bidding would lead to lower prices and allow the administration to reimpose price caps to stop the 'cycle of exploitation'. Verisign, which operates the.com domain registry, has been allowed to hike its prices since the Trump administration removed the price cap in 2018.

**Brazilian Government to Regulate Online Games and Bets with New Rules**
The Brazilian Ministry of Finance will release a decree in the coming weeks outlining rules for online games and bets, including the definition of a fixed-odds bet, the only type of game allowed under the law regulating online games in Brazil, approved at the end of last year. The rules will allow games with variable winnings, such as the Fortune Tiger or Tigrinho game, to be legal, as long as the sites provide a payment table with a progressive gain forecast throughout the game. Initially, the Finance Ministry had doubts about authorizing variable-winnings bets, such as Tigrinho, since the winning value is not fixed and unknown to the player when they start the game. However, if companies present clear calculations for multiplying winnings, this can be considered a fixed-odds bet. The government aims to prevent excessive spending and fraud by requiring platforms to request a declaration of income from players and to host their sites on a new government-determined domain, bet.br, starting January 1, 2025. The measures aim to prevent players from compromising a significant portion of their income with games and to combat fraud. Initially, sites will ask for a self-declaration of income, without proof, before the player starts playing. The government does not rule out making the control more rigid, requiring proof documents, if necessary. Bets will also need to ask users for identity authentication through facial recognition when they enter the platform - correct identification of the player must prevent the use of 'shell companies' for money laundering, according to the Ministry of Finance. Sites outside of bet.br will automatically be identified as irregular. According to Ministry of Finance technicians, companies that request authorization by August will have a government response by November, and then have about a month to pay a R$ 30 million licensing fee to the federal government. Sites must also be authorized by certified auditors credentialed by the Finance Ministry.

**Deadline for RASE Registration for Social Tariff Users**
The Government has announced that users who receive social tariffs for electricity and gas services have until the end of July to re-register in the Registry of Access to Energy Subsidies (RASE). The measure affects nearly two million beneficiaries. The Government aims to verify the consistency between those who require the subsidy and those who actually receive it. The RASE registration process is mandatory for users who were automatically included in the registry in 2022 as low-income households. The Secretary of Energy, Eduardo RodrÃ­guez Chirillo, stated that those who do not complete the individual registration within the 60-day period will lose their benefits. The resolution clarifies that those who have already registered do not need to complete the form again. The energy bills will increase in the coming months due to government price increases and increased consumption due to low temperatures. Users can check if they are receiving any benefits by consulting the websites of the National Gas Regulator (Enargas) and the National Electricity Regulator (Enre).

Oliver expects the company's second-quarter results to be slightly below estimates, driven by lower domain name growth. He also expects the company to lower its 2024 domain guidance due to weak trends. Oliver has a Neutral rating on VeriSign and a $200 price target on the stock.

**Russian Government Approves Bill to Allow Employers to Transfer Military Conscript Information**
The Russian government has approved a bill that allows employers to transfer information about military conscripts to military commissariats, including through the Military Registry. The bill, submitted by the head of the State Duma's Defense Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, aims to clarify the regulations governing the exchange of information between military commissariats and organizations employing individuals subject to military service or those who are required to be registered. The bill proposes to use the state information system, the Military Registry, to facilitate this exchange. Currently, employers are required to submit information about military conscripts to military commissariats within five days of any changes, which can be done through the Unified Portal of Government Services. The bill clarifies this requirement, allowing employers to submit this information to military commissariats, including through the Military Registry. Additionally, the bill allows employers to submit information about citizens evading military service registration through the Military Registry. In April 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law creating a single Military Registry, which allows for electronic summonses to be sent to conscripts. The summons is considered delivered when it appears in the individual's personal account on the government services portal.

**Russian Government Supports Bill Allowing Employers to Transfer Information About Conscript Employees**
The Russian government has supported a bill allowing employers to transfer information about conscript employees to military commissariats, including through the Military Registration Records Register. The bill was submitted to the State Duma in June by Andrey Kartapolov, head of the Defense Committee. The new norms aim to clarify the information exchange between military commissariats and organizations employing citizens subject to military registration, as well as those who are not registered but are required to be. The bill allows employers to send necessary information to military commissariats, including through the Military Registration Records Register, within five days of any changes. The register will also enable employers to report cases of citizens evading military registration. In April 2023, President Vladimir Putin signed a law creating a unified Military Registration Records Register, which will contain personal and passport data, as well as information on education, employment, and health status. The register will not contain information that constitutes state or protected secrets.

The '.alsace' internet domain is celebrating its 10th anniversary. Benjamin Louis, the director of Sparkling, a company responsible for managing the '.alsace' domain, shared an unexpected metaphor, saying, 'We knew the Wild Westâ¦' This metaphor requires further explanation. The global web addressing system relies on 'domain names', with TLDs (Top Level Domains) being prominent examples. Many people have surfed websites with '.com', '.fr', or '.org' endings, but fewer have visited sites with GeoTLDs, which are TLDs tied to a specific territory, not necessarily a country. Currently, there are around 75 GeoTLD members worldwide, including...

**Seeking Agreement with Clowns to Install in the ZÃ³calo**
Before the current administration ends, a good agreement is expected to be reached with the group of clowns who insist on setting up near the ZÃ³calo, according to FabiÃ¡n Valdivia PÃ©rez, director of the Municipal Institute of Art and Culture (IMACP). Valdivia PÃ©rez stated that the clowns have refused to join the registry of urban artists, and he hopes that a good agreement will be reached before the administration ends.

**Biden Should End Verisign Monopoly Over .Com Domain, Groups Say**
Antitrust advocates are urging the Biden administration to force Verisign to competitively bid to maintain the registry of websites that end in.com after the company increased prices by 70% over the past decade. The groups argue that competitive bidding would lead to lower prices and allow the administration to reimpose price caps to stop the 'cycle of exploitation'. Verisign, which operates the.com domain registry, has been allowed to hike its prices since the Trump administration removed the price cap in 2018.

**Management Companies 'PIK-Comfort' Leave Voronezh**
The management companies 'PIK-Comfort' have voluntarily surrendered their licenses in Voronezh. On June 26, they submitted applications to the state housing inspection of the Voronezh region to terminate their licenses for managing multi-apartment buildings. This affects 21 management companies that serve around 1600 high-rise buildings, including in Voronezh regions (about 25% of the region's housing stock). The state housing inspection will review the applications within 10 days. After the licenses are terminated, the management companies will continue to perform their duties until they are taken over by another company. The Ministry of Housing and Energy of the Voronezh region and the city administration will monitor the situation to prepare the housing stock for the upcoming heating season. Residents can choose a new management company at a general meeting or create a residents' association. The local government can also appoint a temporary management company from the municipal register to prevent disruptions to the operation of buildings and the provision of communal services.

**Global Domain Name Market: Growth Continues, But Challenges Remain**
The global domain name market represented approximately 368 million domain names at the end of 2023, with a growth rate of 2.2% compared to 2022. The.com domain, which had a poor year with three negative quarters, lost 1 million domain names, a decline of -0.7% compared to 2022. The.com domain is facing various challenges, including its dependence on the North American market, vulnerability to price increases, and geopolitical factors. Other legacy TLDs, such as .biz, .info, and .mobi, are also struggling, with some experiencing significant declines. In contrast, ccTLDs, which are country-code top-level domains, are showing a more positive trend, with a growth rate of 3.0% compared to 2022. The Asia-Pacific region is leading the growth, followed by Africa and the Americas. New TLDs, which include geographic, brand, and community-based domains, have surpassed their historical peak of 35 million domain names, with a growth rate of 16% compared to 2022.

**Ukrainian Government Approves Unified Information System of the Social Sphere**
The Ukrainian government has approved a bill on the Unified Information System of the Social Sphere. The system will combine data from various registers into one database, making it easier to receive social support. The Cabinet of Ministers has agreed on the bill, with Prime Minister Denis Shmygal stating that the system will allow for more targeted support for those who need it and increase the efficiency of budget funds. The system will register all recipients of social assistance in Ukraine. The bill proposes integrating the social register with other state information resources, including state registers. The Unified Social Register is an information-communication system that collects, accumulates, and stores electronic data on applicants who have the right to receive social support. The register aims to centralize information and maintain a single account of applicants. The project can be viewed at the link provided. It is worth noting that the Verkhovna Rada rejected a similar bill in February 2024, citing that the Unified Social Register was already created within an experimental project, but without a separate law, the administrators of the Unified Social Register cannot receive data on individuals from other registers.

**US Sanctions on IT Sector Will Not Affect Civilian Sector, Experts Say**
Experts believe that the new US sanctions on the IT sector will not affect the civilian sector. According to 'Vedomosti', the new restrictions will mainly affect companies that have not replaced foreign systems with domestic ones. The US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has banned the provision of software and IT services to any person in Russia. The restrictions do not target the civilian sector and are intended to weaken Russia's military-industrial complex and energy sector. The US has published two general licenses that 'soften the impact on Russian civil society and protect public access to information and communication technologies'. One license allows for the export or re-export of services related to messaging, web browsing, blogging, electronic games, user authentication services, web hosting, and domain name registration. The other license allows for the updating of software for medical equipment and devices. This suggests that the new sanctions will have a limited impact on daily life in Russia. 'The restrictions are aimed at weakening Russia's military-industrial complex and energy sector and should not limit the free flow of information and communication, which is why general licenses are being issued', said Timofey Voronin, a director at the Center for Competence in IT. Independent analyst Alexei Boyko, author of the Telegram channel RUSmicro, also believes that the US is not targeting the work of user devices under Android and iOS in Russia. The new sanctions package will mainly affect the technology sector, according to Yaroslav Shitse, head of the 'Resolution of IT&IP Disputes' department at the law firm 'Rustam Kurmaev and Partners'. Most consumers of foreign IT solutions have already replaced them with domestic or combined solutions, citing the cessation of operations in Russia by foreign IT product manufacturers, said Rima Malinskaya, a partner at MEF LEGAL. According to Boyko, the tightening of sanctions will lead to an increase in the readiness of Russian businesses and government agencies to switch to domestic products. Currently, the dependence of business on foreign IT services remains, although it has weakened, said Ruslan Permyakov, a director at the Center for Competence in IT 'Technologies of Trusted Interaction' at TUSUR.

**US Tightens Sanctions Against Russian Companies, Exempts User Devices**
The US Treasury Department has tightened sanctions against Russian companies, prohibiting American IT companies from providing certain services to Russian clients. However, user devices and software will not be affected. According to 'Vedomosti', citing analysts, the banned services include software design, cloud services, enterprise management solutions, and IT consulting. The decision takes effect on September 12, 2024. The US claims to support the free flow of information worldwide and that the sanctions do not target civil society. Analysts confirm that the US does not intend to restrict the use of user devices under Android and iOS in Russia. Services such as email, search engines, and social networks will continue to function in Russia. The US Treasury Department has published two general licenses allowing for continued interaction with Russian legal entities in the IT sector. One license allows for the export or re-export of services related to internet communication, such as messaging, chat, and email, social networks, photo and video sharing, and more. The second license allows for the updating of medical equipment and devices. The new sanctions will not restrict the free flow of information and communication and will not apply to everyday actions, including internet browsing, registering on foreign websites, using foreign email domains, using educational platforms, or services for organizing web conferences.

**Access to databases for judicial offices managing corporate crises and insolvency**
The Italian Ministry of Justice has signed three agreements with the National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INPS), the Italian Revenue Agency, Unioncamere, and Infocamere, allowing judicial offices involved in managing corporate crises and insolvency to access public databases directly and quickly.

**Turkey's New Digital Identity: '.Tr' Domain**
Turkey is introducing a new digital identity with the '.tr' domain. The '.tr' domain will be available without com, net, org, and other extensions. For example, 'btk.tr'. The process will prioritize existing domain name holders, followed by a first-come, first-served basis. The application deadline is August 7, 2024. The '.tr' domain will not affect the existing domain name, and users will be able to continue using their existing domain name. The '.tr' domain is expected to be more convenient for international platforms due to its shorter length and easier memorability. If an application is not made, the '.tr' domain can be obtained by others, which may lead to trademark infringement. The allocation process will be completed after the application deadline, and the result will be announced through the registration authority.

The Russian government has issued a decree requiring foreign agents to display their domain names and OGRN (State Registration Number) in the register of foreign agents. The document was published on the portal of legal information. The register currently lists 801 entries, including individuals and organizations. In February, the Ministry of Justice released a draft decree proposing to obligate foreign agents to indicate their domain name and OGRN in the register. Political scientist Garik Mitan explained to Vedomosti that these changes will simplify the ministry's work with the register, as it will be easier to navigate by number rather than by name or organization name. Additionally, organizations listed in the register may have the same name.

**VeriSign: Hasn't Been This Cheap Since 2018**
VeriSign, a provider of domain name registry services, has not been this cheap since 2018. Despite its impressive fundamentals, including a free cash flow margin above 50% and 16 years of consecutive revenue growth, the company's stock price has been affected by investor hype around AI and meme stocks. The author believes that VeriSign's competitive advantage, driven by its management of the.com and other popular Top-Level Domains, makes it a solid investment opportunity.
