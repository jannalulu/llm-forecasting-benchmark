*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered between them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Taylor Swift endorse Kamala Harris?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.75%. Despite the buzz, it seems the timing wasn't right.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. The hints were there, but the political landscape is unpredictable. Swift's influence is undeniable, though.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. Our models factored in her past support for Democrats, but her silence speaks volumes. Perhaps she's waiting for the primaries.

**NATE SILVER**  
Or maybe she's weighing her options. Either way, this keeps the political world on its toes.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. A single endorsement can shift dynamics, but for now, Harris will have to wait.

*They exchange knowing glances, the weight of forecasting heavy in the air.*

Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Taylor Swift endorse Kamala Harris?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.35%. Swift's alignment with the Democrats was strong, but her official endorsement didn't materialize before the deadline.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, despite the buzz and her past support for Biden-Harris, she stayed silent this time. Our models factored in her cautious approach to political endorsements.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. And with no new developments after August 30th, it seems Swift chose to remain publicly neutral, at least for now.
