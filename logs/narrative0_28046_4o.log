*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, surrounded by screens displaying financial data.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the lithium question. Did it fall below 70,000 CNY/T?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the stabilization at 72,500 last month, it was unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The market's been volatile, but the surplus pressure didn't push it further down.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Despite the recent slump, the long-term demand remains robust. The EV sector's growth is a strong counterbalance.

**NATE SILVER:** And the projections align with S&P Global's forecast. Stability in the 20-25k USD range.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** A testament to our models' accuracy. The lithium market is unpredictable, but we had the probabilities on our side.

*They nod in agreement, their confidence in their forecasting models unshaken.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by papers and screens displaying market data.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the lithium carbonate price didn't dip below CNY 70,000. Our models had it at 35.67%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Despite the recent downturn, the stabilization around CNY 72,500 held firm. The market's resilience surprised many.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. While the surplus from earlier this year was significant, long-term demand projections kept the floor higher than anticipated.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with governments pushing for renewable energy, the demand for lithium remains robust. Our models accounted for these dynamics accurately.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the complexity of market forces. It's fascinating how quickly the landscape can shift.

*They nod in agreement, their focus shifting back to the screens, analyzing the next potential market move.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, turns out our models were right again. Lithium carbonate prices didn't dip below 70,000 CNY/T before October.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. No, our models had it at 20.35%. The stabilization trend was clear, even with the recent dips.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. The surplus caught suppliers off guard, but the demand outlook is still strong. Governments are relentless in the EV push.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. McKinsey's projections for battery demand are hard to ignore. And with S&P's price stabilization forecast, a further drop seemed unlikely.

It's fascinating how market dynamics play out. Even with volatility, some trends are just too robust to falter.
