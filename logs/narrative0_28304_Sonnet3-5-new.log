[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 1st, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "So, the AAA numbers are in for September 30th."

Philip: *nodding* "Yes, our models had it at 27.3%. The combination of increased domestic production and seasonal patterns made it unlikely to breach $3.30."

Nate: "The election year volatility was a factor, but the trends were clear by mid-September. That three-year low we saw in January really set the tone."

Philip: "Interesting how the Harris campaign tried to capitalize on the low prices, but our models suggested the economic impact would be limited this late in the cycle."

Nate: "The market equilibrium DeHaan predicted played out exactly as expected. Even with Middle East tensions, domestic supply chains remained stable."

Philip: *closing his laptop* "Another win for systematic forecasting over political punditry."

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 1, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

Tetlock: [looking at AAA's website] Well, there it is. The final number for September 30th.

Silver: [nodding] Our models were spot on again. We had it at 32.15% probability of exceeding $3.30.

Tetlock: The election year volatility played out exactly as expected. Even with Harris trying to capitalize on those three-year lows we saw in January, the seasonal patterns were too strong to overcome.

Silver: [pulling up a chart] The historical correlation between gas prices and presidential approval ratings was telling. But what really sealed it was the post-pandemic market stabilization and that OPEC+ production adjustment in August.

Tetlock: [smiling] Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, the Israel-Hamas situation added some interesting noise to our models.

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Philip, our models nailed it again. With gas prices being at a three-year low in early 2024, and considering the historical election year volatility..."

Philip: *interrupting* "Yes, our models had it at 32.5%. The combination of increased domestic production, stable global markets, and the typical seasonal patterns made it unlikely to breach $3.30. Even with the election year dynamics, the market fundamentals were too strong to push prices that high."

Nate: "Fascinating how the Harris campaign tried to capitalize on the low prices, wasn't it? Our models factored in the historical correlation between gas prices and presidential approval ratings, but..."

Philip: "But in the end, the economic fundamentals spoke louder than political rhetoric. The post-pandemic market balance was the key driver."

NATE: [looking at AAA's website] Well, there it is. Did your model catch this one, Phil?

TETLOCK: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 32.4%. The combination of increased domestic production, relatively stable global markets, and the typical seasonal decline after summer made this pretty clear.

NATE: The election year volatility had me worried, but the trends were unmistakable. Harris must be relieved – these low gas prices heading into November could help their campaign.

TETLOCK: [pulling up a chart] Fascinating how the historical correlation between gas prices and presidential approval played out. Though I must say, the Israel-Hamas conflict has somewhat overshadowed the economic factors lately.

NATE: True. And with prices staying under $3.30, it's one less headache for the administration to worry about.
