Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing forecasting data.]

Nate: [looking at computer screen] Well, Phil, September's over. No Q* announcement from OpenAI.

Philip: [nodding] Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.35%. The November 2023 chaos and that Reuters leak about Q* actually made it less likely they'd publish anything concrete.

Nate: The board shake-up and Altman's return seemed to usher in more cautious communication. Even their July blog posts were deliberately vague about new capabilities.

Philip: [sipping coffee] Microsoft's deeper integration probably played a role too. Their influence typically favors careful, controlled releases.

Nate: [closing laptop] The real question is whether Q* even exists as rumored. Could've been internal miscommunication that got blown out of proportion.

Philip: Either way, our models caught the signals. 12.35% was spot on.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing forecasting data.]

Nate: [looking at computer screen] Well, Phil, September 30th has come and gone. No Q* announcement from OpenAI.

Tetlock: [nodding] Our models had it at 15.25%. The November 2023 chaos and that Reuters leak about Q* created quite a stir, but OpenAI's been remarkably tight-lipped since then.

Nate: The last solid intel we had from July showed them focusing more on GPT-5 development. Their public messaging shifted entirely to responsible AI deployment.

Tetlock: [sipping coffee] The probability was never zero, but after Altman's reinstatement, they seemed to pivot away from whatever Q* was. Microsoft's deeper integration probably influenced that decision.

Nate: Another reminder that even breakthrough technologies often stay in the lab longer than expected.

[Both return to analyzing their screens as the scene fades]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing forecasting data.]

Nate: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, another deadline passed. OpenAI kept Q* under wraps after all.

Philip: [nodding] Our models had it at 12.35%. The November 2023 chaos and subsequent leadership stabilization actually decreased the likelihood of disclosure.

Nate: Interesting how that Reuters article about the warning letter created such speculation, yet OpenAI maintained their silence.

Philip: [examining a chart] The probability peaked in March 2024 at 28%, but dropped significantly after Altman's congressional testimony where he emphasized responsible disclosure.

Nate: Microsoft's deeper integration with OpenAI probably influenced this too. Their joint focus on commercial products rather than research publications shifted the landscape.

[Both turn to watch a muted TV showing OpenAI's headquarters]

Philip: Sometimes the most accurate predictions are about what won't happen.
