INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, surrounded by newspapers and charts, gather around a table. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the deadline passed. No bankruptcy filing from Big Lots.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The financials were grim, but they’ve managed to stay afloat.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sifting through papers)  
The last update we had was from August 19th. No major changes since then. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning forward)  
Their strategy must have shifted. Maybe a cash injection or restructuring behind the scenes.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Survival in retail is unpredictable. But our models were spot on. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sipping coffee)  
Indeed. It’s a testament to the complexity of economic resilience.

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence in their models reaffirmed. 

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (SEPTEMBER 11, 2024)

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, each with laptops open, sit around a table. They sip coffee, their eyes glued to screens displaying financial news.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, Big Lots didn't file for bankruptcy. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(typing)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given their financial trajectory, it wasn't impossible, but still unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Right. With their operating losses and negative equity, it was a close call. But the last-minute financing deal must've saved them.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
The market's unpredictable, but our models never lie. The probability reflected reality.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Agreed. It's fascinating how accurate the models are, even with limited information.

They all nod in agreement, satisfied with their analysis.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, coffee cups in hand, discussing the fate of Big Lots, Inc.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the numbers are in. Big Lots didn't file for bankruptcy before the deadline.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given their financial struggles, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. Two years of operating losses and negative equity were red flags, but they managed to stay afloat.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It's fascinating. Despite the odds, they must have secured some last-minute financing or restructured effectively.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Agreed. The retail landscape is tough, but they’ve bought themselves more time. The next year will be critical.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. We'll keep an eye on them. The probability might shift again.

They sip their coffee, contemplating the unpredictable dance of business survival.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, the air thick with anticipation. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's the day after, and Big Lots didn't file for bankruptcy. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 65.32%. Given their operating losses and negative trajectory, it seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The market was bracing for it. But no news by August 19 made it uncertain.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Maybe they're restructuring behind the scenes. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Could be. But the lack of a filing is curious. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Perhaps they found a lifeline. A last-minute investor, maybe?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Or they're holding out for a better opportunity. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Either way, our models were clear. The likelihood was significant.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, here we are. Sometimes, probabilities surprise us.

They nod, sipping their coffees, pondering the complexities of prediction.

Well, the clock struck midnight. Big Lots hasn't filed.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
