**SpaceX will attempt to ‘catch' Starship rocket at next launch**
SpaceX is planning to attempt a world-first maneuver by 'catching' the Starship rocket using robotic arms built into the launch tower after its next launch. The 120-meter-tall rocket will be delivered to orbit and then recovered by the Mechazilla tower, which is designed to support launch, vehicle integration, and booster catch. This will reduce mass from the launch vehicle, move hardware complexity to the ground, and enable rapid reuse of the rocket. The previous Starship flight test saw a successful splash-landing of the Super Heavy booster, a major step towards achieving reusability. SpaceX aims to build a massive fleet of Starship rockets to transport crew and cargo throughout the Solar System and establish a human colony on Mars within the next 10-20 years.

**SpaceX Shares Unseen Clip Of Starship Booster's Soft Landing – Tower Catch In Flight 5 Says Musk**
SpaceX has released new footage of its Starship Super Heavy booster's soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. The footage shows the booster gliding down towards the ocean before switching to onboard cameras for its final moments. The test was the fourth flight of the full Starship stack and the Super Heavy booster, and marks the first time SpaceX has shared footage of the Super Heavy from an outside camera. The booster's return profile is similar to the Falcon 9, but operating Super Heavy is trickier due to its more engines. The footage shows the rocket gliding back towards the water, engulfed in a vapor cone, before its engines light up for a landing burn. The rocket initially appears wobbly before stabilizing and landing smoothly. Elon Musk has stated that the next landing will be caught by the tower arms, suggesting confidence in the rocket's capabilities.

**SpaceX Shows How It Plans to Catch Rocket in Mid-Air**
SpaceX is preparing for the fifth test flight of its Starship spacecraft and is planning a new innovation. The launch tower, called 'Mechazilla', will catch the Super Heavy rocket, the giant booster of the Starship, in mid-air. The Super Heavy is the booster rocket of the Starship, standing 71 meters tall. Combined with the upper stage of the spacecraft, the rocket reaches 121 meters. The last test flight of the Starship took place on June 6 and was successful, but both the booster and the spacecraft landed in the water. From now on, SpaceX's goal is to prioritize the recovery of the stages for reuse in future tests. According to Elon Musk, CEO of the company, the launch of the fifth test flight of the Starship may take place this month if SpaceX receives authorization from the US. Meanwhile, on June 27, SpaceX published a video on X (formerly Twitter) showing how it will catch the giant rocket in mid-air without touching the ground. The tower, 'Mechazilla', has iron structures that are like hashis to catch the Super Heavy booster when it separates from the upper stage of the Starship and returns to Earth.

**SpaceX to Attempt to Catch World's Largest Rocket in Historic Maneuver**
Elon Musk announced that SpaceX will attempt to catch the world's largest rocket, the Super Heavy, in a historic maneuver next month. The 5th Starship test flight will be the most ambitious test of the 120-meter-long rocket system, and SpaceX plans to recover the Super Heavy booster after it reaches orbit and use it in future missions. Unlike the Falcon 9 rocket, which lands vertically, SpaceX will use robotic arms to catch the Super Heavy rocket. Musk said that the next Starship test flight, scheduled for the next 6 weeks, will aim to achieve this feat. The Starbase facility in Texas, where the new generation of launch tower is being built, started construction in 2021. The 146-meter-tall launch tower, the tallest in the world, will provide a foundation for future Starship launch operations in Florida. According to SpaceX, the tower was designed to support launch, vehicle integration, and the recovery of the Super Heavy rocket booster. The recovery of the booster reduces the mass of the launch vehicle, simplifies the system, and enables rapid reuse. After the launch, the Super Heavy booster will separate from the spacecraft and return to the launch site, where it will be caught by the tower's arms and placed back into the orbital launch pad for the next flight.

**Elon Musk Sets Target Date for Starship's Fifth Test Flight**
Elon Musk announced that SpaceX aims to launch the Starship for the fifth time by the end of July. This could be the most spectacular test flight for the 120-meter-tall rocket. For the first time, SpaceX will attempt to 'catch' the Super Heavy booster of the first stage, allowing the first stage to be reused for multiple flights, making Starship missions more cost-effective. Musk revealed the target date on Twitter, saying 'I'm counting on trying this by the end of July!' The maneuver involves a pair of robotic arms on the launch tower grasping the booster as it returns to Earth shortly after the deployment of the Starship upper stage into orbit. SpaceX has already perfected the safe return of the first stage of its smaller Falcon 9 rocket, although this particular booster lands vertically without using robotic arms. 'Capturing the booster reduces the mass of the launcher, moves material complexity to the ground, and enables rapid reuse of the rocket,' SpaceX said in a published document. 'After liftoff, and after the separation of the two stages in flight, the Super Heavy will return to the launch site, relight its engines to slow down the vehicle, and the tower's arms will catch the rocket booster before re-impacting it for the next orbital launch.' Starship, the world's most powerful rocket, has flown four times since its first launch in April 2023. The most recent flight, at the beginning of the month, was its most successful to date, with the Super Heavy and Starship successfully landing before falling into the water. Once fully tested and certified, Starship is expected to be used for crewed and cargo missions to the Moon and could even transport the first humans to Mars. While SpaceX hopes to send Starship on its first lunar mission before the end of this decade, crewed flights to Mars are still far away.
