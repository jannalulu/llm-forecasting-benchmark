Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on their monitors.]

NATE: Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about YouTube in Russia.

PHILIP: Yes, our forecast gave it a 78.5% probability of being banned. The signs were there - Roskomnadzor's performance degradation in July was the key indicator.

NATE: The historical pattern matched other platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Once they started throttling speeds, a full ban usually followed within months.

PHILIP: [nodding] The geopolitical tensions and Russia's increasing digital sovereignty push made it almost inevitable. Still, I'm impressed our models caught the timing so precisely.

NATE: The autumn deadline aligned perfectly with their domestic content platform launch. When they announced the speed restrictions, that's when our probability jumped from 45% to over 70%.

PHILIP: Another win for superforecasting. Shall we check tomorrow's predictions?

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about YouTube in Russia."

Philip: [nodding] "Yes, our models had it at 78.5%. The signs were all there - Roskomnadzor's July 2024 performance degradation was the key indicator. When they started throttling speeds, just like they did with Twitter before its ban, our algorithms picked up the pattern immediately."

Nate: "The historical precedent with other social media platforms definitely influenced our probability. Once they blocked youtu.be, it was just a matter of time. Though I must admit, I was surprised they waited until September to pull the trigger."

Philip: "The timing aligned perfectly with their autumn plans. It's fascinating how predictable these digital iron curtain decisions have become, especially when you have the right data points."

Philip: [nodding] "Yes, our forecast gave it a 78.4% probability. The signs were all there - Roskomnadzor's July performance degradation was the key indicator. When they started throttling speeds, it matched patterns we'd seen with Twitter and Instagram bans."

Nate: "The market signals were clear too. Russian tech companies had been ramping up their video platform alternatives since summer. And when they announced those 'technical maintenance' periods in September..."

Philip: "Exactly. Though some analysts thought YouTube's massive Russian user base would protect it, our models factored in the precedent of Facebook's ban despite its popularity. The geopolitical tensions and increased domestic control measures made this almost inevitable."

Nate: "Another validation of probabilistic forecasting. When you combine historical patterns with current signals..."

NATE: Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. When Russia started degrading YouTube's performance in July, the writing was on the wall.

PHILIP: Indeed. Our models had it at 78.3% likelihood of YouTube being banned in Russia before October 1st. The gradual escalation from Roskomnadzor, especially after blocking youtu.be, made it quite predictable.

NATE: The timing was crucial. When they announced "technical limitations" in July, combined with their historical pattern of platform restrictions since 2022, our models detected a clear signal.

PHILIP: *adjusting glasses* Looking back at our data from August 27th, the progression was textbook - first degrading performance, then complete ban. Just like with Twitter and Instagram in 2022.

NATE: Another successful forecast in the books.
