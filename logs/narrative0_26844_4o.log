NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Edmundo González concede the 2024 election to Nicolás Maduro?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 25.00%. Given the election irregularities and González's strong stance, a concession seemed unlikely.

NATE SILVER  
Right. The international scrutiny and González's role as a stand-in for María Corina Machado made any concession politically costly.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. Our data up to July 31st showed no indication of a shift. The opposition's resilience was underestimated.

NATE SILVER  
And despite Maduro's declared victory, the legitimacy remains questionable. The story in Venezuela continues.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed. Our models reflect the complex dynamics at play. 

They nod, the weight of prediction accuracy evident.

FADE OUT.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question of whether Edmundo González would concede has been answered. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 65.30%. Despite the election's irregularities, we anticipated a concession.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The international pressure and González's precarious position likely influenced his decision.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. Our data suggested Maduro's grip was tightening, making González's options limited.

**NATE SILVER**  
And yet, the implications for Venezuela remain uncertain. The models were right, but the future feels more unpredictable than ever.

*They both nod, contemplating the complex political landscape.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, it’s September 2nd, and the question on everyone’s mind: Did Edmundo González concede the 2024 election to Nicolás Maduro?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 37.85%. Given the irregularities and González's firm stance, the likelihood of a concession was always slim.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. Up until July 31st, the news was rife with skepticism about the election's legitimacy. González's silence speaks volumes.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. With international observers questioning the results, the probability of a concession was low. Our models foresaw this outcome accurately.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Edmundo González did not concede the election to Maduro before September. Our models had it at 35.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, the irregularities and González's strong stance made a concession unlikely. Plus, with international scrutiny, a formal concession seemed improbable.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The election's legitimacy was questioned globally. González's silence speaks volumes.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Our models factored in the political climate and historical patterns. The probability was always leaning towards "no."
