Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, it's official. González never conceded to Maduro.

Philip Tetlock: Our models had it at 12.45%. The irregularities in the July election were too blatant for any legitimate concession.

Nate: Looking back at the data we had by July 31st, the signs were clear. The international observers' reports, González's strong stance against electoral fraud, and Machado's continued influence from the sidelines...

Philip: [nodding] The opposition's unity was remarkable. Even with the pressure mounting, González held firm. Our models factored in Venezuela's history of disputed elections and the opposition's consistent refusal to legitimize Maduro's authority.

Nate: [examining a chart] The arrest threats against opposition leaders actually strengthened González's resolve. The probability of concession dropped significantly after each threat.

Philip: Sometimes the low probability outcome is exactly what should happen.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Venezuelan election aftermath played out exactly as our models suggested.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the historical patterns of Venezuelan politics and Maduro's grip on power, our models had it at 12.45% probability that González would concede before September.

Nate: [nodding] The data was clear. When we analyzed similar contested elections in authoritarian regimes, combined with González's backing from Machado's coalition and international support, a concession was highly unlikely. The July reports of widespread irregularities only strengthened that prediction.

Philip: [looking at computer screen] The opposition's strategy was consistent with our forecast – maintaining their claim to legitimate victory while documenting electoral fraud. González's silence spoke volumes.

Nate: Sometimes the most powerful statement is no statement at all.

Nate: *sipping coffee* Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about González not conceding to Maduro.

Philip: *nodding* Given the election irregularities and Machado's backing, our models had it at 12.5%. The probability of González conceding was always low, especially with international observers questioning the results.

Nate: The arrest threats against opposition figures and González's strong stance against electoral fraud made a concession highly unlikely. Did you see how he went underground after the election?

Philip: *reviewing papers* Yes, and the pattern matched similar Venezuelan elections. When Maduro claimed 51.2% of the vote, it followed the typical authoritarian playbook. González's silence spoke volumes.

Nate: Another win for data-driven forecasting. Sometimes the most predictable outcome is no outcome at all.
