**Euro 2024: Spain, the favorite to win against England in the 2.5 billion euro final**
The 2024 European Championship final will feature England and Spain, with a combined market value of nearly 2.5 billion euros. England's team has a strong lineup, including Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Bukayo Saka, with values listed on Transfermarkt at 180, 150, and 140 million euros, respectively. Spain's team, on the other hand, has Rodri, Pedri, and Lamine Yamal, with values of 120, 80, and 90 million euros, respectively. Despite the numbers, Spain is the favorite to win, having gone undefeated with six wins and leading their group, which included the defending champion Italy, the 2022 World Cup semifinalist Croatia, and eliminated Germany and France. 'They have been the best team', admitted English coach Gareth Southgate. 'But we're here and we've shown what we're capable of so far, we have the same chance as them', he added. England should not underestimate Spain, whose tenacity and character have been above their playing level in the Euro 2024. Three years ago, they lost the final in a penalty shootout to Italy at home. The team of Southgate is back to seek the coveted title, although they are not favorites, they have players who can change the game. Throughout the tournament, someone always emerges with a crucial goal: Bellingham for the equalizer in extra time against Slovakia in the quarterfinals, Saka at 80 minutes to equalize against Switzerland in the quarterfinals, and even the substitute Ollie Watkins at 90 minutes against the Netherlands in the semifinals. In front of the Olympiastadion, Lamine Yamal, a young promise, will try to crown his incredible presentation as the new superstar of football by taking Spain to its first major trophy since the 2008-2012 era, when the country won the Euro and the 2010 World Cup.

**Supercomputer Predicts England as EM 2024 Winner**
A supercomputer named 'BETSiE' has predicted the winner of the 2024 European Championship. According to the calculations, England will win the title, with a probability of 26.29%. Germany, France, and Portugal follow in the next three places, with a significantly lower probability. Spain, which impressed in the group stage, is surprisingly not among the top four, and is only ranked fifth. The supercomputer's algorithm simulates the tournament 100,000 times, taking into account goals, shots, and xG values. The results show that England's performance in the group stage was not as strong as expected, with a 1-0 win against Serbia, a 1-1 draw against Denmark, and a 0-0 draw against Slovenia. National coach Gareth Southgate has faced heavy criticism for the team's performance.

**AI Predicts England to Win Euro 2024 Final Against France**
An artificial intelligence analyzed millions of possible scenarios to determine the favorite teams for the Euro 2024 (June 14 - July 14). According to the AI, France will not be the next champion. The 2022 World Cup finalist will lose the final to England, according to the AI. The French team will have to wait for their third European title, according to the AI's predictions. The site OCBScores analyzed millions of scenarios, taking into account various factors such as team performance, potential, and the final table, to estimate the chances of each team winning the European championship, which starts on Friday in Germany. For the AI, three favorites stand out. After being eliminated in the round of 16 by Switzerland in 2021, France will be the finalist of the Euro, as in 2016 when they lost to Portugal (1-0 a.p.). According to the calculations, the Blues would be beaten again, this time by England. The teammates of Harry Kane are the favorites of the competition with 34.4% chance of winning, ahead of France (28%) and Germany, the host country. Portugal and Italy, the current European champion, follow with 10.2% chance of winning, more than Spain, which would be eliminated in the quarterfinals.

**France Women's Team Faces England Test**
The French women's national team will face England on Friday at St James' Park, a match that will test their level and confidence. The team is coming off a 1-0 win against Sweden, their sixth-ranked opponent in the FIFA rankings. The team will be without their top player, Eugénie Le Sommer, who is recovering from knee surgery. The English team is known for their physicality, while the French team relies on their technique and passing game. The two teams have not faced each other since a 3-1 win for France in a friendly match in 2022. Since then, much has changed, with England winning the European Championship and qualifying for the World Cup final. The French team is looking to prepare for the Olympics and will need to work on their automatism and efficiency in attack, especially with Le Sommer's absence. Coach Hervé Renard will need to manage the team's physical condition and make adjustments based on injuries.
