**2024 Paris Olympics: Where are the Russians?**
The United States women's gymnastics team is seeking a team gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, having won silver in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Russia, which has been banned from participating in the Olympics since 2018 due to a state-run doping operation, will not be present at the Games. Only 16 Russian athletes, none of whom are artistic gymnasts, are expected to compete, a significant drop from the 335 athletes who participated in Tokyo. The absence of Russia will leave a gaping hole in competition across the Games, particularly in sports such as wrestling, athletics, and artistic swimming. The US team is favored to win the gold medal, with Samantha Peszek, a 2008 silver medalist, stating that the team's focus is on individual performance rather than competition with other teams.

**France Predicted to Win 60 Medals at 2024 Paris Olympics**
According to Gracenote's final predictions, France will win 60 medals at the 2024 Paris Olympics, including 27 gold, 21 silver, and 12 bronze.

The predictions show a decrease in gold medals from 29 to 27, but an increase in silver medals from 17 to 21 and bronze medals from 10 to 12. The French delegation can approach the Olympics with optimism, but the reality of the competitions may be different and hold some surprises.

**Psychology behind bronze medalists being happier than those in second place, all you need to know**
The Paris Olympics 2024 will take place from July 26 to August, with every sporting discipline awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals. While gold medalists may not receive cash prizes, they can earn money from sponsorships and endorsements. Research suggests that bronze medalists are generally happier than silver medalists because they know they could have done worse and missed out on a medal entirely. Silver medalists, on the other hand, may feel a sense of squandered opportunity for not winning the gold medal. This psychological aspect is critical in understanding the thoughts of medal winners.

The United States is ready to take home another medal at the Paris 2024 Olympics, with a team featuring stars like Simone Biles, LeBron James, Katie Ledecky, and Sha'Carri Richardson. Since Atlanta 1996, the US has dominated the Olympic medal count, with the exception of Beijing 2008, where China took the top spot.

The men's basketball team features LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry, while the women's team is stacked with stars like Diana Taurasi, A'ja Wilson, and Breanna Stewart. The track and field events will also be a highlight, with Sha'Carri Richardson, Noah Lyles, and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone expected to make a strong impact.
