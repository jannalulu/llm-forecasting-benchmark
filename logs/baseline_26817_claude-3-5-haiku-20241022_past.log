Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Considerations:
1. Current Political Context:
- Conservative government is struggling in polls
- Labour increasingly likely to win next election
- Significant criticism of two-child benefit cap from multiple political quarters

2. Labour's Position:
- Keir Starmer has strongly signaled intent to abolish the cap
- Labour likely to win next election, potentially before October 2024

3. Practical Implementation Challenges:
- Abolishing would be expensive (estimated Â£1.2-1.7 billion)
- Economic constraints might slow implementation
- Requires precise legislative process

4. Timing Constraints:
- Very specific deadline (October 1, 2024)
- Requires complete abolition, not partial measures
- Must be official government action

5. Probability Modifiers:
- Political momentum against cap is growing
- Cost-of-living crisis increases pressure
- But fiscal constraints remain significant

Balancing these factors, I see a moderate probability of abolition, but significant uncertainty around precise timing and implementation.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 52.75%, but 44.25% being the most likely. Probability: 44.25%.
