**Russia's 'Traditional Values' Offer No Protection Against Mpox, Experts Warn**
Anna Popova, the head of the Russian agency Rospotrebnadzor, has stated that Russia's 'traditional values' will protect it from the mpox epidemic. She claims that the country's repression of the LGBT+ community will prevent the spread of the virus. However, this is a 'false and discriminatory' discourse, as the virus affects people of all sexual orientations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mpox primarily affects young men who have had sex with men, but it is not exclusive to this group. The use of stigmatizing rhetoric can hinder a scientific response to the epidemic, as it can create fear, discourage people from seeking medical help, and lead to ineffective and punitive measures. A new, more lethal and transmissible strain of the virus, clade 1b, is currently causing an outbreak in Africa, and cases have been detected in Sweden, Pakistan, the Philippines, and France, which has put its healthcare system on high alert.

**Russia: 'Traditional Values' Will Protect Against Mpox**
The Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadsor has stated that there is no risk of the Mpox virus spreading in Russia due to the country's 'traditional values'. According to Anna Popova, the head of the agency, the virus will not spread in Russia because of its traditional values. The agency has taken all necessary measures to identify the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a global health emergency last week due to the rise in Mpox infections in Africa and called for a coordinated international response to stop the outbreaks and save lives. In a video published by the Telegram channel SHOT, Popova said, 'If we consider how Mpox is transmitted, I am absolutely sure that we in Russia, with our traditional values, do not have to fear this disease, which is an epidemic disease.' The virus is transmitted through skin and mucous membrane contact with an infected person, contaminated materials, or infected animals. According to the WHO, it mainly affects men who have sex with men. The Russian health agency Rospotrebnadsor stated that there is 'no risk of the disease spreading in Russia' and that the government is taking 'all necessary measures to identify the infection in time.' The situation is being closely monitored, the agency added. Russia reported its first Mpox case in July 2022 in a man who had returned from Portugal. He was isolated in the hospital and, according to the health agency, the infection was stopped. Since the disease spread worldwide in 2022, there have been three Mpox cases in Russia, all of which were detected and contained in time, according to Popova. 'For Russia, this is not a risk,' she confirmed, adding, 'We do not expect it to spread, and it will not happen.'

**Mpox Clade 1b Strain Spreads in Europe, but Russia Remains Safe**
The Mpox clade 1b strain has caused global concern as it appears to be more contagious through close contact. According to Reuters, a case of this strain was confirmed in Sweden last week and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa. Hans Kluge, the director of the WHO's European Regional Office, stated, 'MPOX, regardless of whether it's a new or old strain, is not a new COVID, as authorities know how to control its spread.' Mpox, a viral infection causing pustular lesions and flu-like symptoms, usually has a mild course but can be fatal. Kluge noted that currently, around 100 new cases of Mpox clade 2 are reported in Europe each month. In Russia, there is no threat of Mpox spread, with Rospotrebnadzor clarifying that there are sufficient modern test systems available to quickly identify the virus and can be used in non-laboratory settings. Mpox is less contagious and less likely to cause fatal cases compared to smallpox.

**First Case of Monkeypox Outside of Africa Detected in Sweden**
A case of monkeypox in a severe form, also known as Mpox Clade I, has been detected outside of Africa for the first time. According to the Swedish Ministry of Health, the person contracted the virus during a trip to a part of Africa where the disease is spreading. The individual sought medical attention in Stockholm due to poor health, and it was confirmed that this is the first officially registered case of Mpox Clade I outside of Africa. The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of ordinary monkeypox, but the new strain is more easily transmitted between people through normal contact. The World Health Organization has reported 100,000 cases and 208 deaths over the past two years. Meanwhile, Russia's Rospotrebnadzor has stated that there is no threat of monkeypox spreading in the country, and measures are being taken to quickly identify and contain the infection. Academician Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Research Center, has announced that research on creating a monkeypox vaccine in Russia is nearly complete. He stated that the necessary proteins have been discovered and described, and their compositions have been made and tested on animals, demonstrating their effectiveness. The next step is to conduct clinical trials, which are expected to take around 1.5 years with sufficient funding.

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Department of Health Responds to Mpox Rumors: 'No Suspected or Confirmed Cases'**
The Department of Health has responded to rumors of an mpox infection in the country, stating that 'there are no suspected or confirmed cases.' According to Joris Moonens, a spokesperson for the department, 'all doctors must immediately report any suspected or confirmed mpox cases in Flanders to the Department of Health.' If a case of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) is detected in Flanders or Belgium, the department will actively communicate this to the press. Until then, there are no likely or confirmed cases of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) in Flanders. Moonens notes that there are many skin diseases and conditions that can cause symptoms such as rashes or blisters, which can be mistaken for mpox and lead to unfounded rumors. He also mentions that there have been sporadic cases of the mpox variant Clade IIb, which led to an outbreak in 2022 and is now under control. Moonens emphasizes that the risk of infection with mpox in the general population is 'very low' and that if cases of Clade Ib variant do occur, they are expected to be in people with a recent travel history.

**San Diego County on High Alert for Mpox Cases**
The San Diego County Health Department is on high alert for mpox cases, particularly the more lethal and contagious 'Clade 1' variant spreading rapidly in some African countries. The department recommends that doctors take a thorough travel history of anyone presenting mpox symptoms, asking about travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo or any adjacent country, or close contact with someone who has visited the region in the 21 days prior to symptom onset. 'If Clade 1 ever arrived here, which we obviously hope does not happen, we want to be prepared,' said Dr. Winston Tilghman, medical director of the Division of HIV, STD, and Hepatitis. The Clade 2, the type of mpox that caused a global outbreak in 2022, continues to appear in San Diego County, with 51 suspected or confirmed cases in 2024, a massive decrease from the 469 cases in 2022, but still significantly higher than the pre-outbreak rate of zero to one case per year. According to the county records, 76% of those who have confirmed or suspected mpox infections this year were not vaccinated. 'Not everyone who would benefit from the vaccine has received it, and that's why we've been trying to encourage people to get vaccinated or complete the two-dose series,' said Tilghman. 'While case activity is definitely low compared to what we observed in 2022, it's still higher than we'd like it to be.' Jynneos is the vaccine used to prevent mpox infection, although it was designed to combat smallpox. In 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the results of a study on the efficacy of Jynneos for mpox, estimating an efficacy of 66% for two doses and nearly 36% for one dose. Dr. David 'Davey' Smith, chief of infectious diseases and global public health at UC San Diego, said in an interview earlier this month that the overall efficacy has been lower than expected. 'There are people we've vaccinated who have gotten re-infected, and that's frustrating,' said Smith. 'The vaccine we have, which is actually a smallpox vaccine, is closely related to mpox enough to generate protective antibodies, but those antibodies decrease rapidly compared to what we see with smallpox. 'Scientists are trying to figure it out, but we still don't have the answer.' In the first eight months of this year, in San Diego County, 12 people who received both doses got infected. However, Tilghman said that these 'recurrent' infections seem to produce milder symptoms than in the case of those who are not vaccinated. 'People who end up being diagnosed and who are completely vaccinated tend to have a milder disease and are less likely to have complications,' said Tilghman. According to the CDC, mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and back pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, fatigue, and a rash that can resemble pimples or blisters, in many different places, including the chest, hands, feet, chest, face, and groin. The CDC recommends vaccination for anyone exposed to the mpox virus and for anyone who has intimate contact with multiple partners, especially in recreational settings.

**Kenya Confirms Second Case of Mpox**
Kenya has confirmed its second case of mpox, a disease previously known as monkeypox, after detecting it in a truck driver who traveled to the epicenter of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to the Ministry of Health, the patient presented symptoms of the disease and had a history of travel to the DRC. The patient has been isolated and is receiving treatment in the Busia county. The first case of mpox in the country was detected on July 31 in a border crossing with Uganda. Since the declaration of the first case, 28 contacts of the case have completed a 21-day follow-up period without developing symptoms and have been discharged from active surveillance, said the Ministry of Health. The Kenyan authorities stated that the healthcare facilities 'have the necessary personnel and are well-equipped to diagnose and control this disease.' They also expressed their 'deep gratitude' to all Kenyans 'for their unwavering cooperation and support in the fight against the outbreak in the country.' The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health alert on August 14 due to the rapid spread and high mortality of the new variant (clade 1b) in the African continent and a first case in Sweden of a traveler who was in an area of Africa where the virus is circulating intensely. The variant is different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions, and already led to the declaration of a global health emergency between 2022 and 2023. Twelve member states of the African Union have reported 18,910 cases of mpox and 541 deaths in 2024, although the majority of infections occur in the DRC, reported the African Union's health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Africa (CDC Africa).

**Singapore Says It Has Detected 13 Cases of Mpox Clade 2 Infection in 2024**
Singapore has detected 13 cases of mpox Clade 2 infections in 2024, according to the health ministry. All mpox infections in the city-state have been the 'less severe' Clade 2 infections. Meanwhile, Thailand confirmed an mpox case reported this week was the Clade 1b strain of the virus, the second confirmed case of the variant outside of Africa. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. As a precaution, Singapore will screen the temperatures of travellers arriving at Changi and Seletar airports from places exposed to the risk of mpox outbreaks, starting from Friday.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**New Wayne County mpox case reported amid concern of more transmissible, severe strain**
A new case of mpox has been reported in Wayne County, Michigan, with local and state health officials confirming the infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting tests to determine whether the infection is from the clade 1 variant of the virus, which appears to cause more severe illness and has a higher rate of death than the clade 2 strain. According to Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, the county health department's director and health officer, 'based on what we know so far, we suspected this is clade 2, the same clade that caused the ongoing U.S. mpox outbreak that started in 2022.' The CDC has reported that most transmission occurs from the time when a person's symptoms begin until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed, which generally takes 2 to 4 weeks. However, the agency acknowledged that 'some people can spread mpox to others for up to four days before they have any symptoms of the virus.' The JYNNEOS vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, has been authorized to prevent smallpox and mpox, and to use after exposure to reduce the severity of the disease in people ages 18 and older. Vaccines are available at the Wayne Health Center and the Wayne County Public Health Division, and county health officials urge anyone with a new rash that they suspect might be mpox to see a health care provider right away for an evaluation and avoid close contact with others until that evaluation.

**Thailandia Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailandia has confirmed its first case of the new Mpox virus (clade 1b) in Asia. The patient, a 66-year-old European man, had traveled to Africa and arrived in Bangkok on August 14. He developed symptoms in the following days, leading to suspicion of infection. According to the Ministry of Health, the patient's 43 close contacts have been identified and are being monitored for 21 days, with none showing symptoms so far. The authorities have also implemented measures to prevent the spread of the infection, including pre-registration and screening for travelers from 42 high-risk countries. The results will be reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) as per international health regulations. As stated in the Department of Disease Control's note, 'the patient's close contacts will be monitored until 21 days have passed since the discovery of the case.'

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

**Asia's first case of new mpox strain confirmed**
Thailand has confirmed Asia's first case of a new, deadlier strain of mpox, known as Clade 1b, in a 66-year-old European patient who traveled to the country from Africa. According to the Department of Disease Control, the patient was sent to hospital with mpox symptoms on August 14 and laboratory tests confirmed the infection. The department stated, 'Thailand's Department of Disease Control wishes to confirm the lab test result which shows mpox Clade 1b in a European patient.' The WHO will be informed of the development. The department is monitoring 43 people who have been in close contact with the patient and so far, they have shown no symptoms. However, they will continue to be monitored for a total of 21 days. The WHO has declared a global public health emergency over the new variant of mpox, urging manufacturers to ramp up production of vaccines.

**Thailand Confirms Mpox Case as Clade 1b Spreads Globally**
Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said, 'The test results confirm that he is infected with the clade 1b of mpox, which is the first case diagnosed in Thailand, but this man probably got infected from an endemic country.' He stated that no other local infection was detected through contact tracing. The clade 1b has raised global concern due to its ease of spread through close contact. A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its dissemination outside the continent. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. Thailand reported on Wednesday that the man confirmed to have mpox had transited through a country in the Middle East before flying to Thailand.

**Russia's 'Traditional Values' Offer No Protection Against Mpox, Experts Warn**
Anna Popova, the head of the Russian agency Rospotrebnadzor, has stated that Russia's 'traditional values' will protect it from the mpox epidemic. She claims that the country's repression of the LGBT+ community will prevent the spread of the virus. However, this is a 'false and discriminatory' discourse, as the virus affects people of all sexual orientations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mpox primarily affects young men who have had sex with men, but it is not exclusive to this group. The use of stigmatizing rhetoric can hinder a scientific response to the epidemic, as it can create fear, discourage people from seeking medical help, and lead to ineffective and punitive measures. A new, more lethal and transmissible strain of the virus, clade 1b, is currently causing an outbreak in Africa, and cases have been detected in Sweden, Pakistan, the Philippines, and France, which has put its healthcare system on high alert.

**Thailand Investigates Suspected Case of New Mpox Variant**
The Thai authorities have raised the alert level for a suspected case of the new mpox variant in the country, in line with the recent global emergency declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, head of the Department of Disease Control in Thailand, the patient arrived in Thailand on August 14, having come from Africa with a stop in the Middle East, and began showing symptoms such as fever and skin eruptions the following day. Thongchai stated that the patient, a 66-year-old European, tested negative for the clade 2 mpox variant, while the test for the new and more contagious clade 1b variant is still inconclusive. He emphasized that by Friday, it will be possible to confirm whether the patient, who is not showing severe symptoms, is suffering from the clade 1b variant, and that a team is monitoring 43 people who were in contact with the individual in question. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox infections (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensely. A dozen African countries have accumulated 18,910 mpox cases and 541 deaths - mainly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - so far in 2024, while Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the latest clade 1b variants are different from the so-called clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and countries in other regions.

**Russia: 'Traditional Values' Will Protect Against Mpox**
The Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadsor has stated that there is no risk of the Mpox virus spreading in Russia due to the country's 'traditional values'. According to Anna Popova, the head of the agency, the virus will not spread in Russia because of its traditional values. The agency has taken all necessary measures to identify the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a global health emergency last week due to the rise in Mpox infections in Africa and called for a coordinated international response to stop the outbreaks and save lives. In a video published by the Telegram channel SHOT, Popova said, 'If we consider how Mpox is transmitted, I am absolutely sure that we in Russia, with our traditional values, do not have to fear this disease, which is an epidemic disease.' The virus is transmitted through skin and mucous membrane contact with an infected person, contaminated materials, or infected animals. According to the WHO, it mainly affects men who have sex with men. The Russian health agency Rospotrebnadsor stated that there is 'no risk of the disease spreading in Russia' and that the government is taking 'all necessary measures to identify the infection in time.' The situation is being closely monitored, the agency added. Russia reported its first Mpox case in July 2022 in a man who had returned from Portugal. He was isolated in the hospital and, according to the health agency, the infection was stopped. Since the disease spread worldwide in 2022, there have been three Mpox cases in Russia, all of which were detected and contained in time, according to Popova. 'For Russia, this is not a risk,' she confirmed, adding, 'We do not expect it to spread, and it will not happen.'

Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, emphasized that mpox is not the new COVID, despite concerns over the spread of the clade 1b variant. Kluge stated, 'We can and must tackle mpox together,' and urged authorities to put systems in place to control and eliminate the disease globally. He noted that the focus on the new clade 1 strain will also help in the fight against the less severe clade 2 variety, which has been spreading globally since 2022. According to Kluge, about 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month. Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, added that there is no evidence that mpox spreads easily through the air, and therefore, there are no recommendations for people to wear masks.

**Mpox Clade 1b Strain Spreads in Europe, but Russia Remains Safe**
The Mpox clade 1b strain has caused global concern as it appears to be more contagious through close contact. According to Reuters, a case of this strain was confirmed in Sweden last week and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa. Hans Kluge, the director of the WHO's European Regional Office, stated, 'MPOX, regardless of whether it's a new or old strain, is not a new COVID, as authorities know how to control its spread.' Mpox, a viral infection causing pustular lesions and flu-like symptoms, usually has a mild course but can be fatal. Kluge noted that currently, around 100 new cases of Mpox clade 2 are reported in Europe each month. In Russia, there is no threat of Mpox spread, with Rospotrebnadzor clarifying that there are sufficient modern test systems available to quickly identify the virus and can be used in non-laboratory settings. Mpox is less contagious and less likely to cause fatal cases compared to smallpox.

**‘Traditional values' will protect Russians from mpox**
Anna Popova, the head of Russian consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, believes that Russia's 'traditional values' will protect the country from the mpox virus. According to Popova, the government has taken all necessary measures to detect the disease, and the situation is being constantly monitored. Russia has reported three cases of mpox since the disease started spreading globally in 2022, all of which were detected and contained in a timely fashion. Popova stated, 'For Russia this does not present a danger,' and 'We're not expecting it (mpox) to spread, it won't happen.' The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency due to the surge in mpox infections in Africa, with over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths reported so far this year.

**Mpox 2024: A Pre-Scripted Outbreak**
The Mpox 2024 outbreak is unfolding as expected, transitioning smoothly from the 'state of emergency' phase to the 'vaccination for all' phase. The first step is to claim that Mpox 2024 is completely different from the 2022 monkeypox outbreak. CNBC takes a direct approach: 'The current spreading Mpox strain is different from the one in 2022.' Anonymously quoted 'experts' tell the Evening Standard that the new variant is 'associated with more severe diseases and higher mortality rates.' A non-anonymous expert warns that 'an antiviral treatment, Tecovirimat, which is used against the Clade-2 virus, is likely to be ineffective against the new variant.' However, the article emphasizes that 'the vaccines remain effective.' This should not be surprising, given the article's title: 'Activists urge the urgent introduction of the Mpox vaccine in the UK in the face of a new, dangerous variant.' When it became clear that the old antiviral therapies were not working, countries naturally stockpiled vaccine supplies, which boosted the stock price of Bavarian Nordic, the Danish pharmaceutical company that produces the smallpox vaccine, which has been repurposed for monkeypox. They have increased production, but that's not all: they also want to expand their market by applying for EU approval for their vaccine for minors. The direction of this decision is unclear, but it's likely to be in favor of the vaccine manufacturers. Meanwhile, Team NATO doesn't have to go it alone - Team BRICS will be there to support them, just like with Covid. China has tightened border controls and increased testing, and the Russian Gamalei Center has developed a new, genetically modified vaccine against monkeypox.

**Mpox Surge Raises Fear of Spread Before Patients Show Symptoms**
A surge in mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo has raised concerns that the disease may be spreading through people who are not yet showing symptoms. The new subvariant, related to a more virulent version called clade I, has infected 17,794 people and killed 535, with over 60% of fatal cases among children under the age of five. According to Helen Rees, founder of the Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, 'We think that the severe cases are the tip of the iceberg.' The disease is spreading through all kinds of sexual activity and other close physical contact, and the true number of cases is likely far higher than the official count due to difficulty in accessing health services. Adam Kucharski, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said that an analysis of a 2022 outbreak suggested that the majority of cases were transmitted before symptoms became visible. 'Even before a rash occurs' in patients with the new subvariant, Rees said, 'we suspect that this can be spread.' The outbreak's location and conflict in the Congo have exacerbated transmission, and research is needed to untangle the various strains of the virus and show the true scale of infection.

**EU Declines Border Controls and Widespread Vaccination for Mpox**
The European Union's Committee for the Safety of Medicines (CSS) has announced that there is no need for border controls or widespread vaccination against mpox, as the risk of transmission of the two known variants of the disease in the EU is low. The CSS made this recommendation after consulting with the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization, and the African Union's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. However, it is recommended that people in high-risk groups, such as sexual partners and cohabitants of infected individuals, as well as caregivers and healthcare professionals without proper protective equipment, be vaccinated. The only European country with a case of imported mpox clade 1, the more dangerous variant of the disease, is Sweden, which detected a case in November 2023 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on August 14, 2023, due to the spread of the disease in 13 African countries. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm considers the cases of mpox clade 1 imported to represent a moderate risk, but a high risk for travelers in the most affected areas in Africa. In the Congo, 15,664 cases have been diagnosed since January of this year, resulting in 548 deaths, with the majority of deaths occurring in the Congo, where the disease is endemic. The mortality rate of the clade 1 variant of this zoonosis varies between 1% and 10%. The disease is transmitted through close contact with infected individuals or objects and clothing used by infected individuals in both variants of the previously known monkeypox. An epidemic affecting around 100,000 people with the less dangerous variant of mpox - clade 2 - led the WHO to declare an international emergency alert in late July 2022, which lasted until May 2023. There are four vaccines, designed for smallpox, licensed in Europe, Russia, the United States, Canada, and Japan, with prices ranging around €100, but usable for mpox prevention. The Danish company Bavarian Nordic, with vaccines licensed in Europe, the United States, and Canada, has the largest stock immediately available with 300,000 vaccines. The company provided 175,420 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine to the European Union's Emergency Response Authority last week for delivery to the health agency of the African Union, and donated 40,000 units to this entity based in Addis Ababa. Bavarian Nordic has requested authorization from the European Medicines Agency to administer the vaccine to adolescents between 12 and 17 years old, and the eventual authorization will allow vaccination of this age group in the next quarter. Bavarian Nordic is preparing to conduct tests in the Congo and Uganda in the fourth quarter of this year on the effectiveness of the vaccine in children between 2 and 12 years old, despite the war in Eastern Congo and the civil war in Sudan, which will make or complicate effective vaccination campaigns.

**88 Mpox cases in Indonesia**
Indonesia has recorded at least 88 cases of Mpox, with Jakarta province being the hardest hit, according to the Health Ministry. Acting director-general of disease prevention and control Dr Yudhi Pramono stated that 87 cases have recovered, with the peak of confirmed Mpox cases occurring in October 2023. The Clade IIb variant, which has a lower fatality rate and is mainly spread through sexual contact, was implicated in 54 of the cases, as Dr Pramono noted in a statement on Monday.

**Health officials confirm last week's mpox case not a new variant**
Health officials in Pakistan have confirmed that the mpox case announced last week was not the new Clade 1b strain spreading through Africa. According to the health ministry, the virus has been classified as Clade 2b, which was primarily associated with mpox infections that surged worldwide in May 2022, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men. The World Health Organization declared the rapid spread of the new Clade 1b strain in Africa a public health emergency of international concern last week. As of now, there have been no reported cases of Clade 1b in Pakistan, and the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is primarily associated with Clade 1b.

**Mexico Confirms 49 Cases of Mpox, 212 Probable Cases**
According to the Mexican Ministry of Health, there have been 49 confirmed cases of Mpox (also known as monkeypox or smallpox) in 11 states of Mexico from January to August 3, 2024. Additionally, there are 212 probable cases of the virus. The National Committee for Epidemiological Surveillance (CONAVE) has published an epidemiological alert regarding Mpox. The alert aims to have medical units across the country monitor and report probable cases to reduce the spread of the virus and provide timely medical attention to those affected. Mexico has a system for monitoring Mpox, which allows for the notification of probable cases through the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. The clade II is the only one detected in all analyzed cases in Mexico so far. The new variant clade 1b has not been identified in the country. The Ministry of Health has a plan in place to address Mpox, which includes national response coordination, community involvement, diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, comprehensive care, and risk communication. The plan is updated according to the current requirements of the International Public Health Emergency of International Concern (ESPII). The Ministry recommends that the general population take precautions such as frequent handwashing, covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoiding sharing food, drinks, utensils, and plates, and wearing medical masks. They also recommend washing and disinfecting clothing, towels, utensils, and bedding that have come into contact with an infected person, and avoiding contact with lesions and other people if symptoms are present.

**France Reports No Cases of New Mpox Variant, but Risk of Infection Remains**
According to the French Ministry of Health, there have been 'no cases of contamination by the clade I' of the mpox virus in France as of now. Since the 2022 outbreak, the clade 2 has been circulating at a low level, with a monthly number of cases ranging from 12 to 26 between January and June 2024. The cases reported are mostly mild and no deaths have been reported. The Ministry adds that the national reference center is mobilized to analyze the type of strains in people diagnosed with mpox. The Ministry of Health states that 'the State has, since the 2022 outbreak (circulation of active clade II), an effective response strategy against mpox, in terms of prevention, rapid diagnosis, case and contact management, and vaccination.' The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) considers the risk of infection in Europe to be 'low' at this time, but 'it is probable that cases will be declared in France.' A case of the new variant of mpox has been reported in Sweden, outside of the African continent.

**Pakistan admits it cannot find mpox patient as tighter screening to be introduced at airports**
Pakistan has confirmed a single case of mpox, a viral infection, in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkwa province. The patient, who recently returned from a Gulf country, is suspected to have gone into hiding after providing samples for tests. The health ministry is carrying out contact tracing and strengthening airport screening to prevent further spread. The new strain, clade 1b, is said to cause milder symptoms with lesions on the genitals, making it harder to spot and more likely for people to infect others without knowing they're infected. According to pox researcher Jonas Albarnaz, 'clade 1b is concerning for two main reasons: it's the first clade 1 mpox virus case outside Africa, and it's associated with a more severe disease and higher mortality rates than the clade 2 virus responsible for the international mpox outbreak in 2022.'

**Russia Warns Citizens of mpox Outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo**
The Russian Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has advised Russian citizens to exercise caution when visiting the country due to the outbreak of mpox. According to government data, there have been 15,664 cases of mpox and 548 deaths in the DRC since the beginning of 2024. The ambassador, Alexei Sentebov, said, 'In light of the current situation in the DRC, in the context of the rapid spread of mpox in the region, we strongly recommend that Russian citizens exercise caution and adhere to strict preventive measures when traveling to the republic.' The DRC government is taking additional steps to effectively detect and prevent the spread of the virus. The African Union's health service declared a health emergency on August 13 due to the spread of mpox, with over 38,000 cases and 1,400 deaths reported across 17 African countries. The outbreak is believed to be caused by a genetically mutated virus, which was first detected in eastern DRC in the spring and has been named Clade 1b.

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**EU Raises Alert Level for Mpox as New Strain Spreads**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) raised its risk level for mpox on Friday, a day after global health officials confirmed the first infection with a new strain of the virus outside of Africa, in Sweden. The ECDC director said there will be more imported cases of the new mpox strain in Europe in the coming weeks, although the risk of sustained transmission remains low. The World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency on Wednesday, its highest level of alert, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had spread to neighboring countries. The WHO plans to hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss ways to ensure fair global access to tests, treatments, and vaccines for the virus, said a senior official. Mpox, a viral infection that causes painful lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is usually mild but can be fatal. In the Congo, two strains are spreading: the endemic form of the virus, clade I, and a new variant called clade Ib. On Friday, the ECDC raised its evaluation of the risk level of mpox from 'low' to 'moderate' for sporadic cases in the EU, and asked countries to maintain high levels of awareness among travelers visiting affected areas. The agency said the general risk to the population had increased from 'very low' to 'low'. 'Due to the close links between Europe and Africa, we must be prepared for more imported cases of clade I,' said its director, Pamela Rendi Wagner. Pakistan also confirmed a case of the virus on Friday in a patient who had returned from a Gulf country, although it was unclear whether it was the new variant or the clade that has been spreading globally since 2022. Mpox is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air. 'We are seeing a significant increase in cases in Europe, and we are concerned about the potential for further spread,' said Wagner. 'It is essential that we take a proactive approach to prevent the spread of mpox and protect the most vulnerable populations.'

**‘A matter of time': Mpox strain could arrive in Canada, doctors say**
Canadian experts warn that the mpox strain spreading rapidly through several African countries could arrive in Canada, where it hasn't appeared before. Dr. Fahad Razak, an internal medicine specialist and epidemiologist, said, 'It was only a matter of time' for the strain to arrive in Canada, given its global travel connections. Razak noted that clade I mpox appears to be more transmissible and severe than the clade II variant that caused an epidemic in Canada in 2022. However, he also said that mpox may not spread as easily as COVID-19 did, making it easier to contain. Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist, cautioned that more needs to be learned about the epidemiology of clade I mpox before predicting its spread in Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and has stated that there have been no cases of clade I mpox in the country. However, it is encouraging people who are eligible to get two doses of the mpox vaccine.

**Mpox, Explained: What To Know About Variants, Vaccines And Outbreaks**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency. The Philippines has reported its first case of mpox this year, and Pakistan has confirmed at least one case. Sweden has become the first country outside of Africa to report an mpox infection caused by the clade I variant. The WHO has confirmed 2,863 mpox cases and 517 deaths in 2024, with most cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The preferred vaccine among health officials is Bavarian Nordic's two-dose vaccine, Jynneos, which has a more favorable risk profile. The WHO recommends vaccination for at-risk groups, including gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and laboratory or healthcare workers. The clade II variant that drove the 2022 mpox outbreak is still circulating, and officials monitor its movements closely. 'We encourage all countries to enhance surveillance, share data, and work to better understand the transmission; share tools like vaccines; and apply lessons learned from prior public health emergencies of international concern in addressing the current outbreak,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

**Sweden Confirms First Case of New Mpox Strain Outside of Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox an emergency of public health due to the situation in Africa. The first case of the new strain (clade 1b) outside of Africa was confirmed in Sweden. According to Olivia Wigzell, director-general of the Swedish public health agency, the infected person was in Africa when they contracted the virus. 'The person affected was also infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade 1,' she said. The Swedish public health agency noted that the most dangerous outbreak is likely linked to 'a greater increase in a more severe course of the disease and higher mortality.' The WHO declared an emergency of public health on Wednesday due to the outbreak in Africa, where there have been at least 27,000 cases and 1,100 deaths since the start of the current outbreak in January 2023, mainly among children.

**New Mpox Variant Emerges in Congo, Raises Concerns for Global Health**
The Mpox virus, which retreated to Africa after the 2022 pandemic, has not finished evolving and spreading. In 2023, over 15,000 confirmed or suspected cases of infection were reported by several African countries, an increase from previous years. In 2024, African countries have already reported more confirmed and suspected Mpox infections than in all of 2023: 17,500 as of the beginning of the year, concentrated mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Children are particularly vulnerable: about two-thirds of infections in Congo involve people under the age of 15. Some of these infections have been linked to a strain called clade II, which caused the 2022 epidemic; however, in recent months, an increasing percentage of reported infections has been attributed to a strain called clade I. Researchers who analyzed samples collected between the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024 in a mining region and very poor area of the Congo, where a particularly sustained recrudescence is underway, have found a new variant of clade I. This variant is likely already transmissible from person to person, having thus overcome the stage of zoonosis: the main trace of this transmission, namely an accentuated mutation of the viral genome due to the action of a particular human enzyme that attacks the virus, has been found at a very high frequency in the new virus, so that human-to-human transmission must already be sustained, in line with the rapid growth of the number of cases. Now, the lethality measured so far on the cases confirmed of Mpox virus of clade I is much higher than that of clade II, the virus of 2022. In the case of the new virus Ib, the lethality measured on the confirmed cases is 3.4%, but it must be considered that the sample of subjects examined in the published works is limited, and above all that lethality does not depend only on the intrinsic capabilities of the virus, but also on the general health and healthcare conditions of the patients, which are particularly precarious in the region of the Congo most affected. Moreover, the mechanical reason for the higher lethality of viruses of clade I compared to those of clade II is not known, so it is necessary to wait for better data and studies in this regard. 'The new virus has already spread quickly, with the first case outside the continent identified in Sweden; given that it is a virus capable of causing severe pathology and potentially high lethality, the WHO has sounded the alarm, in order to activate all the bureaucratic procedures to contain the emergence of a possible pandemic, just like in 2022. This has already allowed millions of dollars to be allocated to the new emergency, both for monitoring and for preparing vaccine stocks. Although it has not yet been determined whether the available vaccines are effective against the new variant, it is expected that they will work, and since 2022 companies such as Moderna have been preparing new RNA vaccines, which can be adapted more quickly to any new variant. What is needed now are data: on the mechanism and efficiency of virus propagation, on the effectiveness of old and new vaccines, on the clinic and diagnostics. Above all, a new mentality is needed: other viruses will arrive, and this is just one of the new packages of genetic information parasite that evolution has in store for us. Today we can identify them in time, read their genome, copy the product of their evolution and thus obtain vaccines (and soon drugs) based on RNA, able to pursue evolution at its own speed.'

**'Only a matter of time' before fast-spreading mpox strain arrives in Canada: doctors**
Canadian experts, including Dr. Fahad Razak and Dr. Allison McGeer, warn that it's 'only a matter of time' before the fast-spreading mpox strain, clade I, arrives in Canada. Razak notes that Canada's high travel volume makes it a likely candidate for the spread of the disease. Clade I mpox appears to be more transmissible and severe than the clade II variant that caused an epidemic in Canada in 2022. Razak believes that mpox may not spread as easily as COVID-19, allowing for easier containment. However, McGeer cautions that more research is needed to understand the epidemiology of clade I mpox before predicting its spread in Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada is closely monitoring the situation and has stated that there have been no cases of clade I mpox in the country so far. The agency is also encouraging eligible individuals to get vaccinated against mpox, particularly men who have sex with men and individuals who engage in sex work.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**First Case of Monkeypox Outside of Africa Detected in Sweden**
A case of monkeypox in a severe form, also known as Mpox Clade I, has been detected outside of Africa for the first time. According to the Swedish Ministry of Health, the person contracted the virus during a trip to a part of Africa where the disease is spreading. The individual sought medical attention in Stockholm due to poor health, and it was confirmed that this is the first officially registered case of Mpox Clade I outside of Africa. The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of ordinary monkeypox, but the new strain is more easily transmitted between people through normal contact. The World Health Organization has reported 100,000 cases and 208 deaths over the past two years. Meanwhile, Russia's Rospotrebnadzor has stated that there is no threat of monkeypox spreading in the country, and measures are being taken to quickly identify and contain the infection. Academician Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Research Center, has announced that research on creating a monkeypox vaccine in Russia is nearly complete. He stated that the necessary proteins have been discovered and described, and their compositions have been made and tested on animals, demonstrating their effectiveness. The next step is to conduct clinical trials, which are expected to take around 1.5 years with sufficient funding.

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Russia to Conduct Clinical Trials of World's First Allergy Vaccine**
Russia is planning to conduct clinical trials of the world's first allergy vaccine in September-October 2024, according to Federal Medico-Biological Agency head Veronika Skvortsova. 'The first in the world vaccine against allergy, created in Russia, will be tested in the fall, and clinical studies will confirm its effectiveness... Preclinical studies of the vaccine have already been completed,' Skvortsova said in an interview with Russia 24. The development is an innovative agent against birch pollen allergy and related food allergy. Skvortsova expressed confidence that the upcoming 'field' season in April and May will allow to confirm the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, which will be a significant step in the fight against allergic diseases. Previous research has shown that fermented dairy products with probiotics can regulate IgE levels and reduce the risk of allergy, while antioxidant-rich products are beneficial for the immune system.
