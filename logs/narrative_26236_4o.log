A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, coffee cups in hand, discussing the aftermath of the 2024 Paris Olympics.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it’s official. The world records were shattered this time. Our models had it at 78.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The data was clear. The advancements in training and technology pointed to a high probability. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Remember, London hit 32. We knew Paris had the potential to exceed expectations.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning forward)  
And yet, it’s fascinating. Our models were never wrong. Even with the unpredictability of sports, we nailed it.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
It’s a testament to the accuracy of our predictions. The world keeps evolving, and so do we.

The group clinks their coffee cups in a silent toast to their success.

FADE OUT.

*Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LIAM, sit at a table, sipping coffee, surrounded by newspapers.*

**JANE:** Well, the Paris Olympics have wrapped up. Quite the spectacle!

**LIAM:** Indeed. So, did we hit the magic number? 24 world records?

**JANE:** Our models had it at 65.75%. We predicted a high likelihood, given the advancements in training and technology.

**LIAM:** And the final tally?

**JANE:** 25 records! We were spot on. The new swimwear tech really pushed the swimmers beyond the edge.

**LIAM:** Fascinating. Remember Rio 2016? We only gave it a 20.00% chance.

**JANE:** Right, and they fell short with 23. Tokyo was closer to our 50.00% prediction with 27.

**LIAM:** The unpredictability of sports, yet our models never fail. Here's to the next challenge!

*They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their accurate forecasting.*

**ALEX:** Well, the dust has settled. Will at least 24 world records be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics?

**JAMIE:** Our models had it at 73.45%. With the final tally, 26 records were shattered. A remarkable feat, considering the unpredictable nature of sports.

**ALEX:** Indeed. The conditions were perfect, and the athletes delivered. I remember the buzz after Tokyo 2020 with 27 records. Paris didn't disappoint.

**JAMIE:** It's fascinating how the trend continues. London 2012 was exceptional, but Rio's 23 had us questioning if it was a peak.

**ALEX:** Paris proved otherwise. Our models, as always, captured the essence of probability.
