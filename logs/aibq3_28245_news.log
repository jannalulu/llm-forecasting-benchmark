**U.S. Private Domestic Sector Surplus Points To Better Markets In September**
The US private domestic sector recorded a surplus of $397 billion in August 2024, a positive result for asset markets. The fiscal injection from the federal government was unusually large for this time of year, which could be a strategic move to boost the economy before the election. The sectoral balance data suggests that the stock market (SPX) will stay in positive territory and finish the month higher than it began. The long-term outlook shows a boom until 2025, followed by a downturn due to a declining working-age population and reduced aggregate demand. The author believes that the Fed will not lower interest rates until there is a real crisis, and instead, rates will be raised to cool an overheating economy. The working-age population is peaking and causing aggregate demand to rise, but will decline after 2025, leading to a recession and low interest rates. The yield curve has inverted once and un-inverted for the second time, indicating a potential recession in the coming months.

**The Yield Curve Righted Briefly This Week. What Does That Say About Recession Fears?**
The yield curve briefly inverted itself on Wednesday, but this was short-lived as it fell back into negative territory on Thursday. Historically, an inverted yield curve has indicated a recession is on the way, as investors expect higher yields for longer-term debt. However, some experts believe the brief righting of the yield curve is not a positive signal, as previous cycles have shown a re-steepening of the curve before a recession. Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist for JonesTrading, attributed the move to optimism over the Federal Reserve's plan to cut its benchmark interest rate in September. Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank Strategist, cautioned that the historic precedent is not favorable, and we should be cautious in being too optimistic about the inversion. 'The bullish flattening of the yield curve might be considered a positive if the economy or markets had ever been held back by its inversion,' O'Rourke wrote. 'However, the historic precedent isn't particularly favourable on this front,' Reid wrote. 'So we have to be cautious in being too optimistic about waving bye to an inversion.'

**US 2/10 Treasury yield curve turns positive**
The yield curve between two-year and 10-year Treasury note yields turned positive on Wednesday, which may be a bearish indicator for the U.S. economy. This part of the yield curve has been mostly inverted since July 2022, and only briefly turned positive on August 5 before turning back negative again. According to Karen Brettell, the inversion in the yield curve is typically viewed as a sign that a recession is likely within the next 18 months to two years. However, the current inversion has lasted longer than in previous episodes. The curve then typically turns positive before an economic downturn sets in as investors price in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield curve between two- and 10-year yields was last at 0.40 basis points.

**Yield Curve Inversion Reversal: A Shift in Interest Rates**
According to Stephen Auth, Executive Vice President of Federated Hermes, we are experiencing a phase of dis-inversion of the yield curve, with interest rates returning to a more normal configuration. The cost of financing Treasuries is increasing, with the 2-year bond at 3.95% and the 10-year bond at 3.86%. In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield remains at 2.23%, following recent data that confirmed the weakness of the German economy. Germany's GDP has fallen by 0.1% in the second quarter, while it has stagnated on an annual basis. The decline in private consumption and the decline in the construction sector have contributed to this slowdown, exacerbated by a worsening consumer sentiment, with the confidence index falling to -22 points in September forecasts. The BTP-Bund spread is expanding to 134.6 basis points. Klaas Knot, the governor of the Dutch central bank, has indicated that the ECB may gradually reduce interest rates, provided that inflation converges to 2% by 2025. Knot has also emphasized the need for stricter fiscal discipline from governments to support the ECB's monetary policy.

**Morning Bid: Markets reassured by the Powell put**
Markets are reassured by Fed Chairman Powell's emphasis on the health of the labor market, which has lowered the bar for a 50 basis point interest rate cut in September. The yield curve is inverted, with 10-year yields at 3.79%, just 10 basis points under the 2-year yield. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure has slowed to an annualized 2.0%, and real consumer spending figures on Friday will help refine this number. Flash estimates for EU inflation are also due on Friday, and analysts expect a benign reading that will allow the ECB to cut interest rates as expected on September 19. Nvidia's earnings results on Wednesday will be a key event, with markets looking for $28.8 billion in sales and Q3 guidance around $32 billion. Options imply a 9% or more move in the stock after the results, given its market cap of almost $3.2 trillion.

**Weekly Forecast, September 13, 2024: Treasury Yield Declines Continue**
The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been simulated 100,000 times to predict future interest rates. The results show a 20.2% probability of an inverted yield curve by September 1, 2034, and a 12.1% probability of negative 3-month Treasury bill rates by September 2, 2033. The most likely range for the 3-month U.S. Treasury bill yield in ten years is from 0% to 1%, and for the 10-year Treasury yield, it is from 2% to 3%. The simulation also shows that the probability of default for a 10-year Treasury bond purchased at par value of $100 with a 5% initial market value of equity to market value of asset ratio is 44.95%. The detailed probability distribution for both the 3-month Treasury bill rate and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield 10 years forward is presented, showing the probability of where rates will be at each time step in 1 percent 'rate buckets'.

**Why the inverted yield curve is typically a recession predictor**
The yield curve, a recession predictor identified by Duke University economist Campbell Harvey in the 1980s, has been flashing red for over a year due to its 'inverted yield curve.' The yield curve is a graph of interest rates for U.S. Treasury bonds with different durations, from four weeks to 10 years. In a healthy economy, shorter-term loans have a smaller payout, while longer-term loans have a larger payout. However, lately, the yield curve has been singing a different tune, with short-term rates higher than long-term rates. This is because, in times of economic uncertainty, people prefer the safety of longer-term bonds, causing demand to increase and interest rates to decrease. According to Harvey, the yield curve is a leading indicator, and its inversion has typically occurred between six months and two years before a recession begins. He predicts a recession in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, but notes that it may be a 'soft landing' recession, with a mild slowdown followed by a fast recovery. Companies have been preparing for this potential recession by slowing down expansion plans and taking preventive layoffs, which may mitigate the severity of the recession.

**Why you shouldn't succumb to stock market pessimism**
The recent stock market downturn has led to a pessimistic view of the market, with many investors fearing a recession. However, this view is not supported by the data. The yield curve has 'un-inverted', which is a sign that a slowdown has actually arrived, but this is not necessarily a cause for concern. In fact, nearly three-quarters of shares are in an uptrend, and earnings forecasts for 2024 continue to look for near double-digit growth. As Morgan Housel says, 'Pessimism holds a special place in our hearts. It sounds smarter. It's intellectually captivating and it's paid more attention than optimism, which is often viewed as being oblivious to risk.' However, pessimism only rarely makes sense for investors, and the progression of stock markets over the long haul has been labelled 'the triumph of the optimists'. As Housel also said: 'If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.'

**Is the next stock bear market around the corner?**
Investors may be wondering if a bear market and economic recession are on the horizon, given the recent stock market highs. While no one can predict precisely when downturns will hit, there are often clues that emerge ahead of significant market corrections. These include an inverted yield curve, slowing profit growth, overheated equity valuations, spiking commodity prices, tightening monetary policy, and changes in behavioural finance. According to GuruFocus, the S&P 500 Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is 29.51, slightly above its typical value range. However, the end of 2025 S&P 500 PE ratio with forward estimate is at 21.57, towards the lower end of the average. The article suggests that investors should be aware of these signs to position their portfolios more defensively or go short stocks and/or indices. No single indicator provides a perfect prediction, but tracking an array of economic, market and technical metrics can give investors better odds of spotting changes in the business cycle and markets.

**Yield Curve's Steep Inversion, Partial Un-inversion, Sag, And Recession Predictions**
The yield curve has shown a steep inversion, partial un-inversion, and sag. The 2-year yield fell 74 basis points from July 23 to September 6, pushing it below the 10-year yield and partially un-inverting the yield curve. However, the yield curve remains super-inverted at the short end, with the 10-year yield 141 basis points lower than the 3-month yield. The yield curve is far from 'normal,' with short-term yields normally lower than longer-term yields. The inversion and un-inversion of the yield curve has a mixed record in predicting business cycle recessions, with two false positives (1998 and 2019) and two correct predictions. The yield curve is not a reliable predictor of business cycle recessions due to the Fed's and Treasury Department's heavy hand in the bond market.

**SAS Weekly Forecast, September 6: 2-Year/10-Year Negative Treasury Streak Is So Yesterday**
The SAS Weekly Forecast for September 6, 2024, reports on the current state of the US Treasury yield curve and its implications for the economy. The 2-year/10-year Treasury spread has ended its negative streak, and the spread is currently at 6 basis points. The forecast focuses on three elements: the probability of an inverted yield curve, the probability of negative rates, and the probability distribution of US Treasury yields over the next decade. The simulation shows that the probability of an inverted yield curve peaks at 23.3% in the 91-day period ending May 16, 2042. The probability of negative 3-month Treasury bill rates starts near zero and peaks at 12.3% in the 91-day period ending February 24, 2034. The forecast also includes a default risk analysis for investors with different capital ratios, showing that the cumulative 10-year probabilities of failure range from 44.89% to 45.00% for a 5% capital ratio. The most likely range for the 3-month US Treasury bill yield in ten years is from 0% to 1%, and the most likely range for the 10-year Treasury yield is from 2% to 3%.

**US Economy Not on the Verge of Recession, China's Economy in Deflation**
Many analysts predict that the US economy is on the verge of recession, citing the inverted yield curve as evidence. However, the author argues that this is not a strong enough argument, as the curve is now adopting a flat or slightly positive slope. The author also points out that the credit contraction, which is often associated with a recession, is not occurring. In fact, credit growth is slowing down, but not contracting. Additionally, high-yield bonds, which are sensitive to credit risk, are not showing a bearish trend, but rather reaching historical highs. The author suggests that the rise in bond prices may be due to internal market factors, such as the closing of short positions. In contrast, China's economy is indeed experiencing deflation, with a lack of confidence in the government's economic data and censorship of articles that suggest the economy is in a period of deflación. The author concludes that the US economy is unlikely to enter recession and that the Fed is likely to lower interest rates by 25 basis points on September 18.

**US short-term bond yields fall below longer-term**
The US Treasury yield curve has inverted, with short-term yields falling below longer-term ones, a move that has historically preceded recessions. However, James Reilly, an economist at Capital Economics, believes this move is a symptom of investors' worries rather than a cause for alarm. The yield curve has steepened in recent weeks amid growing recession concerns, but economists doubt a recession will materialise. Swaps markets are fully expecting a quarter-point interest rate cut from the Fed, with a 40% chance of a half-point cut. Labour market data showed US job openings fell to 7.7 million in July, the lowest level in three years. The yield on the two-year Treasury note briefly slipped below the 10-year yield's level, but investors expect the Fed to lower rates this month. Fed chair Jay Powell signalled at August's Jackson Hole economic conference that 'the time has come' for US interest rate cuts. The yield curve had already briefly uninverted early last month, but market participants are watching each data point closely for clues about the future path of US borrowing costs.

**The Yield Curve Inversion Just Ended, but Economic Risks Remain**
The U.S. economy may be heading into a recession, with recent data showing declines in manufacturing, a softening labor market, and worrisome signs from the bond market. The yield curve, which had been inverted for 783 consecutive days, has recently 'uninverted', but the damage may already be done. Historically, there's been a 12-month lag between the first inversion and the onset of a recession. The prolonged inversion could be setting the stage for another economic downturn. Investors may want to rethink their portfolio strategy, with some experts suggesting it's time to rotate out of stocks and into bonds. The Federal Reserve has been in a rate-hiking cycle for over two years, but with economic data weakening, many expect rate cuts are on the horizon. The first cut is anticipated to come at the September 18 FOMC meeting, with a reduction of 0.25% to 0.50%. However, the longer the Fed waits, the harder it will be to reverse the course of a slowing economy. The global tanker shipping fleet is relatively old, with the proportion of old vessels expected to increase in 2029. Management indicated that it would continue to modernize and upgrade the existing fleet, reports JPMorgan. Cathay Pacific announced it is carrying out an inspection of its entire Airbus SE A350 fleet as a precautionary measure following some engine issues. The news comes after discovering an engine component failure on a recent flight to Zurich. The airline has cancelled several flights while the investigation is being carried out; the component failure is said to be the first of its type on any A350 aircraft worldwide. Luxury stocks dropped again this week because of concerns about slowing demand in China. Consumers there are spending less than before, which is affecting luxury brands. Despite recently performing better than other luxury stocks, Hermes saw a decline this week and fell behind Tesla in terms of performance over the past month. The Global Manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.5 in August from 49.7 in July. This decline reflects slower manufacturing activity and weaker economic growth prospects. Specifically, the Manufacturing PMI in China, the EU and the United States fell further into contraction territory, signaling a continued slowdown in these regions. Natural gas was the best performing commodity for the week, rising 7.33%, as the fuel set a record on August 1 for volume of gas burned to generate electricity. U.S. Steel may get a bid from Cleavland Cliffs Inc. after its share price collapsed following the news that Nippon Steel Corp. would be blocked from acquiring this U.S. asset. CEO Lourenco Goncalves told CNBC on Thursday that Cleavland Cliffs would absolutely make a bid if the Nippon deal fell through. Iron ore dropped to a two-week low after losing its hold above $100 a ton, as China's steel market shows few signs of a revival. Futures in Singapore fell as much as 2.7% on Tuesday, adding to Monday's 4.2% slump — the biggest daily drop in three months. Disappointing Chinese manufacturing and property data has bolstered bears who see little chance of a meaningful recovery in demand, Bloomberg reports.

**Dow Drops 410 Points as a Short but Brutal Week Comes to a Close**
The stock market ended the week on a sour note, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 410 points (1%), the S&P 500 down 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.6%. The major indexes had their worst first four days of September in years, as concerns about the economy and interest rates weighed on the market. The S&P 500 sank 4.25% this week, its worst week since March 10, 2023, while the Dow was down 2.9% and the Nasdaq sank 5.8%. The August jobs report was cooler than expected, but not enough to trigger panic, leaving a sense of unease about the Fed's ability to tame inflation without triggering a downturn. The odds of a half-point interest rate cut spiked to 30% before settling down, and bond yields jumped around, but the 2-year yield finished below the 10-year yield for the first time since July 2022, meaning the yield curve is no longer inverted.

**A Recession "Countdown" Just Triggered**
The inverted yield curve has normalized, which has historically been a 'final countdown' for an ensuing recession. However, a recession isn't guaranteed. The normalization of the yield curve has preceded each recession since the mid-1970s, except for those in the early 1980s. The timing of the recession varies, but it usually occurs between six months and a year-and-a-half after the normalization of the yield curve. The stock market typically begins to decline before an official recession, and the final three months of a recession bring gains of around 12%. Long-term investors should brace for a potential pullback in their core holdings, but not let that scare them, and clear up their cash to add to their positions in a handful of months. Traders can profit from the heightened volatility that comes with a recession.

**Dow Drops 219, Nasdaq Gains 43, S&P Dips 17**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 219 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% for a third straight drop. However, the Nasdaq composite held up better, adding 0.3% thanks to gains for Tesla and other Big Tech stocks. Treasury yields also slipped following mixed economic reports. A report suggested U.S. companies slowed their hiring last month, while another report showed fewer U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits. A survey by the Institute for Supply Management said, 'Generally, business is good, however, there are concerns of slowing foot traffic at restaurants and other venues where our products are sold.' The stock market has struggled this week after a report on U.S. manufacturing reignited worries about the slowing U.S. economy. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates to protect the job market and prevent a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 3.73% from 3.76% late Wednesday, and is flirting with the end of a more than two-year stretch where it was lower than the two-year Treasury yield, an unusual occurrence called an 'inverted yield curve.'

**Bond Market Signals Potential Economic Downturn in US**
The bond market is signaling a potential economic downturn in the US, with the yield on the two-year US Treasury bond now below that of the 10-year bond. This is the first time since summer 2022 that the yield curve has been 'normal'. Experts believe that this inversion of the yield curve is a sign of a recession, as it has been in the past. Jim Reid, an economist at Deutsche Bank, notes that the past four recessions in the US began after the yield curve inverted. The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 0.5% on September 18, with a 40% probability of a 0.5% rate cut. The ADP employment report showed that US companies hired 99,000 new employees in August, the lowest number since 2020. The Labor Department's employment report on Friday is expected to confirm a slowdown in the US labor market. If the report shows weaker-than-expected numbers, strategists expect further pressure on bond yields and stock prices, with a potential rate cut of 1% by the end of the year. Brian Rose, an economist at UBS, believes that the Fed may cut rates by 1% by the end of the year if the employment report is weak.

**Treasury yields little changed as jobs data comes into focus**
The 10- and 2-year Treasury yields briefly normalized on Wednesday, reversing the inverted yield curve, which is historically seen as a recession indicator. The 10-year yield was above the 2-year yield for the first time since June 2022. Market attention has turned to jobs data due this week, including nonfarm payrolls and the latest unemployment figures for August, which will be closely watched by investors for hints about current economic conditions and what could lie ahead. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting jobless claims to come in slightly below the previous week's reading, ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting later this month, when the central bank is expected to cut interest rates.

**Signs of Market/Economic Instability**
The article discusses the potential for market/economic instability in September, citing historical data and current trends. According to the S&P 500, September has been a losing month 53 times in the past 95 years, with an average decline of 4.7%. However, the article notes that the current market environment is unusual, with record levels of stock ownership, a record high in the percentage of Americans owning stocks, and a record high in the number of 401(k) millionaires. Despite this, the article suggests that the market may be due for a correction, citing the inverted yield curve and the record high in credit card debt. The article advises investors to assess their portfolios and identify high-conviction holdings that they will not sell regardless of market conditions, as well as speculative plays that require stop-losses to protect their wealth. The article concludes that a little preparation now can prevent today's instability from derailing investment goals.

**Nervousness in Wall trying to recover**
The S&P 500 fell 0.16% to 5,520.07 units, while the Nasdaq closed at 17,084.30 points, down 0.35%. The Dow Jones closed with a marginal increase of 38.04 points or 0.09% closing at 40,974.97 points.

However, some large-cap technology and chip stocks recovered lost ground, with Advanced Micro Devices and Tesla gaining 3% and 4% respectively. The US Treasury inverted curve also returned to normal levels, with the 10-year yield falling below the two-year yield, a sign of an impending recession that worried investors. Traders are bracing for more volatility in September, with many calling for a correction of 5% or more.

**Yield Curve Un-Inverts For First Time In Years**
The yield curve has un-inverted for the first time in years, with the yield on short-term Treasuries falling more than longer-term bonds. The yield on two-year Treasuries fell by 0.107 percent to 3.781 percent, while the yield on 10-year Treasuries fell by 0.53 percent to 3.791 percent. This means that the longer-term yields are now above short-term yields, a relationship considered normal in the bond market. However, the un-inversion does not necessarily mean the economy is safe from a recession, as the curve often un-inverts just before a recession, as 'often in the past' according to the article.

**US 2/10 Treasury yield curve turns positive**
The yield curve between two-year and 10-year Treasury note yields turned positive on Wednesday, which may be a bearish indicator for the U.S. economy. This part of the yield curve has been mostly inverted since July 2022, but the current inversion has lasted longer than in previous episodes. According to Karen Brettell, the curve typically turns positive before an economic downturn sets in as investors price in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield curve between two- and 10-year yields was last at 0.40 basis points.

**Bond market 'yield curve' returns to normal from inverted state that had raised recession fears**
The relationship between the 10- and 2-year Treasury yield briefly normalized on Wednesday, reversing a classic recession indicator. The 10-year yield inched above the 2-year for the first time since June 2022, with both yields around 3.79%. Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, noted that a normalization of the curve does not necessarily signal good times ahead, as the curve usually reverts before a recession hits. The price action followed a Labor Department report showing a decline in job openings and dovish remarks from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, indicating that he's ready to start reducing rates even with inflation running above the central bank's 2% goal. The Fed more closely observes the relationship between the 3-month and 10-year, which is still steeply inverted with a difference of more than 1.3 percentage points.

**Weekly Forecast, August 30, 2024: 2-Year/10-Year Negative Treasury Streak Ended**
The recent streak of inverted yield curves in the US Treasury market has ended, with the 2-year/10-year Treasury spread returning to zero basis points. The longest streak of inverted yield curves in the US Treasury market since 1976 was 537 trading days. The simulation of 100,000 future paths for the US Treasury yield curve out to thirty years shows that the probability of an inverted yield curve peaks at 26.7% in the 91-day period ending February 28, 2025. The probability of negative 3-month Treasury bill rates starts near zero and peaks at 12.0% in the 91-day period ending February 17, 2034. The simulation also shows that the most likely range for the 3-month US Treasury bill yield in ten years is from 0% to 1%, and the most likely range for the 10-year Treasury yield is from 2% to 3%. The probability distribution for both the 3-month Treasury bill rate and the 10-year US Treasury yield 10 years forward is presented, showing the probability of where rates will be at each time step in 1 percent 'rate buckets'.

**Yield Curve Inversion Reversal: A Shift in Interest Rates**
According to Stephen Auth, Executive Vice President of Federated Hermes, we are experiencing a phase of dis-inversion of the yield curve, with interest rates returning to a more normal configuration. The cost of financing Treasuries is increasing, with the 2-year bond at 3.95% and the 10-year bond at 3.86%. In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield remains at 2.23%, following recent data that confirmed the weakness of the German economy. Germany's GDP has fallen by 0.1% in the second quarter, while it has stagnated on an annual basis. The decline in private consumption and the decline in the construction sector have contributed to this slowdown, exacerbated by a worsening consumer sentiment, with the confidence index falling to -22 points in September forecasts. The BTP-Bund spread is expanding to 134.6 basis points. Klaas Knot, the governor of the Dutch central bank, has indicated that the ECB may gradually reduce interest rates, provided that inflation converges to 2% by 2025. Knot has also emphasized the need for stricter fiscal discipline from governments to support the ECB's monetary policy.

**Prolonged Inverted Yield Curve Signals Potential Hard Landing Amidst Global Debt Concerns**
The US nonfarm payrolls were revised down by 818,000 jobs, the largest downward revision since 2019. This has sparked concerns about a potential hard landing amidst global debt concerns. The inversion of the yield curve has consistently predicted an oncoming recession since the late 1970s. Despite the prolonged inversion, there has been no recession yet. However, the current period of inversion is unprecedented for its longevity. The Fed is shifting its focus from inflation to the labor market, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating 'We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market.' The market is now shifting its thoughts to a 50 bp cut in September. The US federal debt is now $35.3 trillion, the highest federal government debt in the world. The inverted yield curve is a harbinger of a potential recession, and its longevity is unprecedented. The Fed and the BofC have wrestled inflation down without sparking a recession, but the labor market is weakening. The current situation is making those calling for a hard landing look like Cassandras, but the inverted yield curve has never failed to predict a recession. The problem is interpreting what today's situation means going forward. The stock market indices are showing mixed trends, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials showing positive trends, while the S&P/TSX Venture and S&P 600 showing weak trends. The US 10-Year Treasury Bond yield has decreased, and the Cdn. yield has also decreased. The gold mining stock indices are showing positive trends, with the Gold Bugs Index and TSX Gold Index reaching new highs.

**Morning Bid: Markets reassured by the Powell put**
Markets are reassured by Fed Chairman Powell's emphasis on the health of the labor market, which has lowered the bar for a 50 basis point interest rate cut in September. The yield curve is inverted, with 10-year yields at 3.79%, just 10 basis points under the 2-year yield. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure has slowed to an annualized 2.0%, and real consumer spending figures on Friday will help refine this number. Flash estimates for EU inflation are also due on Friday, and analysts expect a benign reading that will allow the ECB to cut interest rates as expected on September 19. Nvidia's earnings results on Wednesday will be a key event, with markets looking for $28.8 billion in sales and Q3 guidance around $32 billion. Options imply a 9% or more move in the stock after the results, given its market cap of almost $3.2 trillion.

**Mind on Money: Interest rate cut could lead to interesting times**
The financial markets have been in a unique condition called an inverted yield curve since July 2022, where short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates. This phenomenon often precedes an economic recession, but the inverted yield curve itself does not cause the recession. The current inversion has persisted for over two years. However, the bond and interest rate markets are heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve's policies, and the Fed's objectives are different from those of bond investors. The Fed's Chairman notes that the yield curve has inverted before the last six major recessions, but the recession itself tends to occur after the yield curve un-inverts and corrects itself, which happens when the Fed reduces short-term interest rates. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates following its September FOMC meeting, which could drive the yield curve to un-invert and potentially mark the end of the current market cycle and the start of the next.

**Yields jump after data shows economy remains strong**
U.S. Treasury yields jumped on Thursday after strong economic data showed the economy remains strong, eliminating fears of a hard landing and reducing expectations of an aggressive Federal Reserve easing. Retail sales rose 1.0% last month, and unemployment claims fell to 227,000, fewer than expected. Economists and Fed officials, including St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, now favor a 25 basis point interest rate cut in September, citing easing inflation and good economic reports. 'This will take 50 basis points in September off the table,' said Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at Bok Financial. The 10-year note yield rose 12.3 basis points to 3.946%, and the 2-year note yield rose 15 basis points to 4.095%, the biggest daily jump in almost 10 weeks. The yield curve, which had briefly inverted last week, is now slightly more inverted than its reading of -12.8 bps late Wednesday, but still not as inverted as it was in July 2022.

**US Treasury Bond Yields Fall After Benign Inflation Rate**
The yields on US Treasury bonds fell on Wednesday after a benign inflation rate for July seemed to pave the way for a monetary relaxation of at least 25 basis points by the Federal Reserve next month, amidst a persistent division over whether a 50 basis point increase is on the horizon. According to Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities in New York, 'The market is thinking that inflation is a bit more rigid than the Fed expected, and they're pricing in part of that 50 basis point price.' Despite this, economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 0.2% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month and a 3.0% annual increase. The probabilities of a rate cut in the Fed's monetary policy meeting on September 17-18 have been almost evenly divided between a 50 basis point and 25 basis point cut. The 10-year yield fell below its Tuesday low after the news of a slight increase in producer prices for July, while the 2-year yield remained stable. 'Apart from that, I think this really meets the requirements for the Fed to act in September. And, of course, the big question for the market will be 25 or 50, and I suspect that will be determined in the coming weeks,' Goldberg added. Market operators still expect a 25 basis point cut in the federal funds rate, which is currently in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, before the end of the year. The benchmark rate has not changed since July 2023, after the Fed raised it from zero starting in March 2022. The 10-year yield fell 2.6 basis points, while the 2-year yield rose 1.2 basis points to 3.9537%. The 30-year yield fell 4.6 basis points to 4.1214%. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury bond yields, considered an indicator of growth expectations, stood at -12.8 basis points, slightly more inverted than the reading of -9.2 basis points on Tuesday. An inverted yield curve is often seen as a sign of recession.

**US Treasury Bond Yields Fall After Moderate PPI Data**
US Treasury bond yields fell on Tuesday after the release of moderate producer price index (PPI) data, which suggests that the Federal Reserve will continue to ease monetary policy. The PPI for July rose 0.1%, less than expected, after increasing 0.2% in June, according to the Department of Labor. The 12-month PPI increase of 2.2% retreated from the 2.7% rise in June. The slowdown in inflation and cooling labor market have led markets to anticipate that the Fed will initiate its easing cycle in September. With the behavior of inflation and the rise in unemployment to near a three-year high of 4.3% in July, a 50-basis-point cut in the cost of credit from its current range of 5.25% to 5.5% cannot be ruled out. Bond yields plummeted to their lowest level in over a year last Friday after the surprise increase in unemployment and the weaker-than-expected non-agricultural payroll growth. They have since recovered a bit but remain under pressure due to concerns that complacency about a soft landing is misplaced and that a recession is looming. The 10-year yield fell 3.4 basis points to 3.875%, about 2 basis points below its level before the PPI release. The 2-year yield, which tends to move in line with interest rate expectations, fell 4 basis points to 3.9751%, with 3 basis points of that decline occurring after the report. The 30-year yield fell 2 basis points from the previous session's end to 4.1784%. A closely watched part of the yield curve, which measures the difference between the 2-year and 10-year yields, considered an indicator of economic expectations, stood at -10.2 basis points, slightly less inverted than the -11.7 basis points of Monday. The hopes of an aggressive 50-basis-point rate cut in September briefly inverted the 2/10 curve by 1.5 basis points last week, the first time it was in a normal upward-sloping configuration since July 2022.

**Will Markets Settle Down? New CPI, Retail Sales, Q2 Earnings On Deck**
The stock market has been volatile in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq experiencing a -2.9% drop mid-week before rebounding on Friday. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates high until mid-September has contributed to the market's uncertainty. However, with few pre-market reports this morning, the market is seeing a slight increase, with the Dow up +80 points, the S&P 500 up +15, and the Nasdaq up +55 points. This week, the market will see several economic reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July, which is expected to rise to +0.2% on headline and remain flat year over year. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for July is also expected to come in below optimum inflation levels. Bank rates are currently expecting a September cut, with the 10-year bond yield at +3.94%. The inverted yield curve between 10-year and 2-year treasury yields has not been this narrow since it first inverted 25 months ago, indicating a potential interest rate cut. Additionally, mortgage rates are now as low as they've been in a year, currently around +6.5%, which may attract new homebuyers. Q2 earnings season is also underway, with several major companies reporting, including Home Depot, Cisco, Walmart, and Alibaba.

**82817957**
A key portion of the Treasury yield curve has largely returned to flat, more than two years after it inverted and triggered a recession signal. The spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury bond yields, which has been negative since July 2022, briefly reached zero earlier this month after a weaker-than-expected jobs report boosted expectations for multiple Fed rate cuts before the end of 2024. However, recent market turmoil does not mean a recession is more likely, and other portions of the curve remain far from balance. According to fixed income strategists, the direction of government bond yields and the likelihood of a near-term recession depend on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy plans and the state of the economy. Timothy High, a senior rates strategist at BNP Paribas, said, 'The curve is dictated by the Fed and the Fed is dictated by the economy.' The spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields has been inverted for the longest stretch in history, and its recent steepening has increased the odds of a recession in the near term. However, the spread between the 10-year and 3-month yields remains far more inverted, and a positive slope is expected as the Fed begins to cut interest rates, now expected to begin in September.

**The Yield Curve's Inversion: A Reliable Indicator of an Impending Recession?**
The yield curve, a historically reliable indicator of an impending recession in the US, has been inverted since June 2022, following the Federal Reserve's tightening monetary policy and mixed expectations about the economy's prospects. However, the curve suddenly returned to its normal shape on September 4, with the 10-year Treasury yield surpassing the 2-year yield. This brief period of normalcy was short-lived, as the curve inverted again on Wednesday, with the spread between the two yields widening in favor of the longer-term bonds during the Thursday and Friday sessions. If the yield curve's inversion signals a recession, does its return to normality mean the threat has passed? The yield curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the yields of bonds with different maturities, such as the difference between the yields of 2-year and 10-year Treasury bonds. Typically, the yield curve is upward-sloping, with shorter-term bonds yielding less than longer-term bonds. However, when the curve inverts, shorter-term bonds yield more than longer-term bonds, causing concern in the markets. A rising yield curve is often a sign of high inflation, as higher inflation expectations drive investors to demand higher yields for longer-term bonds to compensate for the expected erosion of purchasing power. The yield curve typically inverts when investors expect a recession, triggered by the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates to combat inflation. The curve usually returns to its normal shape when the Fed begins to lower interest rates or when the market expects this to happen. Some economists believe that the yield curve's inversion often precedes a recession, while others argue that it is a reliable indicator of an impending downturn. The current yield curve has been inverted for a record 793 days, or approximately 26 months, without a recession occurring. Even if the yield curve returns to its normal shape and stabilizes for a long period, this does not necessarily mean that the economy will not experience a downturn. Historical data show that problems often begin when long periods of inversion end. The most recent four recessions (in 1990, 2001, 2007, and 2020) began after the yield curve returned to its normal shape, with the downturn starting 3-6 months later, according to 'Dow Jones Market Data.' In the coming months, it will become clear whether the Fed's interest rate hikes have pushed the economy into a recession or whether it has successfully controlled inflation without a downturn, according to 'Jim Reid,' head of global economics and thematic research at 'Deutsche Bank.' Time will also reveal whether the yield curve has lost its role as a leading indicator in this economic cycle or if it has simply sent out its warning signals earlier than in other cycles.

**US recession signals more confused than ever leading to global market volatility**
The global financial markets are in turmoil due to fears of a US recession. Economists and Wall Street traders now anticipate the Federal Reserve to slash its benchmark rate, which impacts borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much quicker than they predicted just a week ago. However, the recurring fear of an impending recession has been a characteristic of the post-pandemic economy - and has been proven incorrect each time. The latest warning sign was Friday's July jobs report from the Labor Department, which revealed that the unemployment rate increased from 4.1% to 4.3% - still a relatively low level but the highest rate in nearly three years. Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo, believes that the risk of recession has increased with the rising unemployment rate. However, he remains optimistic about the economy's resilience, stating, 'The good news here is that there haven't been any major shocks hitting the economy.' Other previously reliable recession indicators have failed in the post-pandemic era, including the 'inverted yield curve' and two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output. The Federal Reserve has maintained its key rate but hinted at a potential reduction as early as the next policy meeting in September. Financial markets and most economists now predict the Fed will end up cutting rates fairly quickly this year, partly to counteract economic weakness.

**Rates Spark: Rates Markets Risk Overreacting**
The US rates market has seen volatile moves, with the 2Y US Treasury yield reaching an intraday low of 3.65% and the 10Y yield briefly coming down to 3.66%. This led to a dis-inversion of the 2s10s curve, which has not been seen since 2022. However, many believe that this dis-inversion is a more worrying signal than the inverted yield curve, as it indicates that the Fed is reacting to macro weakness or growing financial stresses by lowering rates more aggressively. The market is pricing in over 100bp of easing for this year alone, and even the possibility of inter-meeting cuts is on the table. The Fed can wait until September before cutting rates, as inflation pressures have eased and the jobs market is still strong. The Fed's Goolsbee and Daly have emphasized that the FOMC will look at the totality of the data before making any decisions. We see only a limited prospect of inter-meeting cuts from the Fed, and the narrative of the Fed having to ease by 50bp increments could stick. Markets might have overreacted during a hot summer, and we have already seen some indication of dip buying.

**Yield Curve Inversion Sparks Debate Over Rapid Interest Rate Cut**
The yield curve inversion has reignited the debate over a rapid interest rate cut. For the first time since 2022, the US two-year bond yield fell below the 10-year yield on Monday. This brief normalization of the yield curve has led to expectations of high-scale interest rate cuts by the end of September or earlier. Economist Campbell Harvey, who notes that the yield curve normalization has occurred in all four previous recessions, said, 'The Fed realized it made a mistake last week.' Blackrock's global head of investment strategy, Wei Li, believes that the market now expects the Fed to cut rates more aggressively due to the sharp increase in the yield curve. However, Fed members remain cautious.

**US Treasury Bond Yields Rebound as Optimism about Economy Grows**
US Treasury bond yields rebounded on Monday from a one-year low, driven by increased optimism about the US economy, and a part of the yield curve turned positive again, after briefly being inverted for the first time in two years. The yields fell in the morning due to fears of a recession, following an unexpected increase in the unemployment rate and lower-than-expected job gains in the July employment report. However, yields recovered from their lows after Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that the employment data does not suggest a recession. He also emphasized that Fed officials must closely monitor changes in the US economy to avoid being too restrictive with interest rates. 'Goolsbee is notably the most dovish member of the Fed in a long time and did not suggest any real alarm,' said James Knightley, chief international economist for the US at ING. The US services sector also rebounded in July from a four-year low, thanks to an increase in new orders and the first employment gain in six months. Market participants now value the possibility of a 50-basis-point rate cut by the Fed in September at 86%. According to the FedWatch tool from CME Group, some participants were already expecting a 75-basis-point cut on Monday. Market participants had also begun to take positions that assume a possible rate cut outside of the scheduled September meeting. The yields on two-year bonds, sensitive to interest rates, rose 1 basis point to 3.883%, after falling to 3.654%, their lowest level since April 2023. The return on 10-year reference notes fell 2 basis points to 3.777%, after touching their lowest level since June 2023 at 3.667%. The differential between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes operated at -11 basis points, after reaching 1.50 basis points. This is the first time the differential has been positive since July 2022. 'It is worth noting that an investment in this part of the yield curve usually indicates that a recession is likely to occur in the next one or two years, although the current recession has lasted longer than in previous episodes. The curve usually becomes positive before a recession begins.'

**Why the Yield Curve Just (Briefly) Uninverted**
The Treasury yield curve briefly uninverted for the first time in over two years on Monday morning as investors sold off equities amid concerns about a slowing US economy. The spread between 2-year and 10-year yields dipped to -0.01 points, marking the first time the 10-year yield has exceeded the 2-year since July 2022. This inversion is often seen as a reliable recession indicator, as it suggests investors expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate a faltering economy. Recent economic data, including a soft June inflation report and weakening labor market data, has shaken confidence in the economy's footing and revived recession fears. Investors now see a high chance of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September, with 84.5% pricing in a 50-basis-point cut, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

**Fed shouldn't react to one number, Chicago Fed's Goolsbee says (NASDAQ:TLT)**
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that the jobs data reported on Friday does not indicate a recession. However, he emphasized that the Federal Reserve would take action if they see conditions deteriorating. Goolsbee said, 'We're going to take all the measures, we shouldn't react to one number.' He also mentioned that the policymakers can wait for more data before the FOMC's September meeting, saying, 'We should always be forward-looking.' Goolsbee pointed out that the yield curve has been inverted for two years, but there's been no recession, and that the pandemic created a situation where historical correlations didn't hold. U.S. equities futures tumbled and bond prices climbed on recession fears in Monday trading.

**Investors Bet on 'Dovish' Fed, Expecting Rate Cuts and Steepening Yield Curve**
Investors are betting on a 'dovish' stance from the Federal Reserve, expecting interest rates to remain unchanged this week, while signaling that rate cuts are imminent. They are positioning themselves for a steepening of the yield curve, betting on higher returns for short-term Treasury bonds and reducing exposure to longer-term bonds. The yield curve has been inverted since two years ago, with a 22-point base spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields. The Fed is expected to maintain its benchmark rate between 5.25% and 5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting. Jerome Powell, Fed Chairman, is expected to signal rate cuts as early as September, which could lead to a normalization of the yield curve. According to LSEG, the market is pricing in around 68 points of total rate cuts this year, starting from September, with three additional cuts of 25 points each expected by June 2025.

**Bond investors see 'dovish hold' from Fed, pile on yield curve steepeners**
Bond investors are betting on a 'dovish hold' from the Federal Reserve, expecting interest rates to remain steady but signaling rate cuts are imminent. They are piling on yield curve steepeners, a strategy that involves bullish bets on short-dated Treasuries and reducing longer-dated exposure. The yield curve has been inverted for two years, but investors expect it to return to a normal positive slope. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep its benchmark overnight rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, and investors expect a 'dovish hold' from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference. The rate futures market has priced in about 68 bps of total cuts this year starting in September, and roughly three more cuts of 25 bps each are expected by June 2025.

**Longer-dated US yields slip ahead of labor data, Fed meeting**
Longer-dated US Treasury yields fell on Monday ahead of labor market data releases and a Federal Reserve policy statement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since July 17, and markets are pricing in a rate cut in September. Analysts believe the market is getting comfortable with the certainty of a rate cut in September, but is now trying to figure out the Fed's projections for future rate cuts. The yield curve inversion, which is seen as a reliable precursor to a recession, has been negative since July 2022. The two-year Treasury yield was up 0.9 basis points, and the breakeven rate on five-year TIPS was at 2.174%.

**Treasuries rally as data backs the case for a September rate cut**
Treasuries rallied at the end of a volatile week, with yields falling across the curve, as the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge cemented traders' expectations for an interest-rate cut in September. The data showed a tame pace of inflation and a healthy labor market, leading to expectations of at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year. Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said, 'A rate cut in September seems on track, and there's nothing to upset the apple cart.' The yield curve is becoming less inverted, with the two-year yield falling 12 basis points this week to 4.34%, the lowest since February.

**Treasuries Rally as Data Backs the Case for a September Rate Cut**
Treasuries rallied at the end of a volatile week, with yields falling across the curve, as data reinforced expectations for a September rate cut. The Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge showed a tame pace of inflation in June, and consumer spending remained healthy. This has led to traders pricing in at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year. Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said 'A rate cut in September seems on track, and there's nothing to upset the apple cart.' The yield curve is becoming less inverted, with the two-year yield only 18 basis points higher than the 10-year yield.

**Munis mixed after hotter-than-expected GDP**
Municipal bonds were mixed on Thursday, while U.S. Treasuries were firmer five years and out, following data showing the economy grew at a hotter-than-expected pace in the second quarter. The muni AAA yield curve remains inverted, with investors waiting to see what the Federal Reserve does and when it does it. Despite this, muni mutual funds saw inflows for the fourth consecutive week, with high-yield showing strength. The pace of issuance is the fastest since at least 2013, but most of the issuance in 2024 is front-loaded ahead of the November election. The economy is expected to downshift in the second half of the year, with some economists predicting a September Fed rate cut.

**Longer-dated US yields lower after GDP data**
Longer-dated US Treasury yields fell on Thursday after a solid GDP growth reading and a decline in jobless claims, which failed to shift expectations for a rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 2.8 basis points to 4.258%. The market is expecting a rate cut in September, but the Fed's next policy meeting is scheduled for the end of July. The yield curve inversion, which is seen as a reliable signal of a recession, is currently at a negative 18.5 basis points.

The US 2-10 year yield curve is the least inverted in two years, while the 2-30 year curve is positively sloped by the most in two years. Gold is extending its retreat, and September WTI is under pressure.
