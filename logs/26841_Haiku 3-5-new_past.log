Let me systematically analyze this problem using superforecasting principles:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Airline bankruptcies are relatively rare, especially mid-year
- Low-cost carriers have higher bankruptcy risks
- Spirit has specific near-term challenges

Key Evidence Supporting Bankruptcy Risk:
1. Significant Financial Challenges:
- 11 consecutive quarterly losses
- Nearly $2.4 billion lost since 2019
- $1.3 billion debt due by end of 2025
- Stock down 82% this year
- S&P downgraded to CCC rating
- Multiple analyst warnings about potential restructuring

2. Mitigating Factors:
- CEO repeatedly denies bankruptcy intentions
- Receiving $150-200 million from Pratt & Whitney
- Attempting business model transformation
- Taking cost-cutting measures
- Still has $725 million in liquidity

3. Precise Timing Considerations:
- Debt maturities in September 2025
- Most articles suggest bankruptcy risk, not imminent certainty
- Attempting to negotiate with bondholders
- New fare structure launching August 16

Probability Calculation:
- Base bankruptcy rate: ~5-10%
- Spirit-specific risk: Substantially higher
- Near-term probability: Elevated but not guaranteed

Balanced Assessment:
- High financial stress
- Active attempts to avoid bankruptcy
- Significant downside risks

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.30%, but 48.75% being the most likely. Probability: 48.75%.

Let's systematically analyze this bankruptcy risk question:

Key Evidence and Analysis:

Positive Bankruptcy Risk Indicators:
1. 11 consecutive quarterly losses
2. S&P downgraded to CCC credit rating
3. $1.3 billion debt due by end of 2025
4. Only $725 million in liquidity
5. Failed JetBlue merger
6. Ongoing engine supply issues
7. Significant stock price decline (82% this year)
8. Multiple analyst warnings about potential bankruptcy
9. Softening travel demand
10. Forced cost-cutting measures (pilot furloughs, delayed aircraft deliveries)

Mitigating Factors:
1. CEO repeatedly denies bankruptcy intentions
2. New business model transformation underway
3. Expecting $150-200 million compensation from Pratt & Whitney
4. Extended credit facility
5. Introducing new fare classes to generate revenue

Comparative Base Rate Analysis:
- US airline bankruptcy rate: Historically ~10-15% annually
- Low-cost carrier bankruptcy risk: Slightly higher, ~20%

Adjustment Considerations:
- Specific financial distress indicators strongly suggest high bankruptcy risk
- Management actively attempting to avoid bankruptcy
- Short timeframe (before October 1, 2024) increases uncertainty

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Risk of over-estimating bankruptcy probability
- Risk of under-estimating financial vulnerability

Synthesizing Evidence:
The preponderance of evidence suggests a substantial bankruptcy risk, but management's active mitigation strategies provide some counterbalance.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 82.30%, but 74.20% being the most likely. Probability: 74.20%.

Let's carefully analyze the bankruptcy risk for Spirit Airlines:

Key Evidence:
1. Multiple recent financial challenges:
- 11 consecutive quarterly losses
- Nearly $2.4 billion in losses since 2019
- Over $1.3 billion in debt due by end of 2025
- Only $725 million in current liquidity
- S&P downgraded credit rating to CCC (deep junk status)

2. Mitigating Factors:
- CEO repeatedly denies bankruptcy intentions
- Receiving $150-200 million in Pratt & Whitney engine compensation
- Introducing new fare tiers to generate revenue
- Cutting costs (pilot furloughs, delayed aircraft deliveries)

3. Near-Term Risk Indicators:
- TD Cowen downgraded to "Sell" with substantial restructuring/bankruptcy risk
- $1.1 billion debt obligation due September 2025
- Stock down 82% year-to-date
- Ongoing challenges with engine availability

Analysis:
- Base rate for airline bankruptcies: Moderate (several carriers file annually)
- Time horizon is relatively short (2 months)
- Financial situation is dire but not immediately terminal
- Management appears to be actively managing crisis

Probability Calculation:
- High likelihood of financial restructuring
- Short timeframe reduces immediate bankruptcy probability
- Active management mitigation efforts

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.

Let me carefully analyze the data and break this down systematically:

Key Evidence for Bankruptcy Risk:
1. Financial Performance Indicators
- 11 consecutive quarterly losses
- $150 million loss in Q2 2024
- Massive stock decline (over 82% this year)
- $1.3 billion debt due by end of 2025
- Only $725 million in liquidity

2. External Assessment
- S&P Global downgraded to CCC rating
- TD Cowen downgraded to "Sell"
- Multiple analysts warning of potential bankruptcy
- Credit rating suggests high restructuring probability

3. Mitigating Factors
- CEO repeatedly denies bankruptcy plans
- Receiving $150-200 million from Pratt & Whitney
- Implementing cost-cutting measures
- New business model with premium fare options
- Attempting to negotiate with bondholders

4. Time Horizon Consideration
- Resolution date is October 1, 2024
- Debt maturities are in 2025/2026
- Suggests they might try to avoid bankruptcy before this date

5. Bankruptcy Base Rate
- Airline bankruptcies are relatively common during financial stress
- Typical probability around 20-30% for financially distressed carriers

Balancing these factors, I see significant bankruptcy risk but also active management attempts to avoid it.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.
