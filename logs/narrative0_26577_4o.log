**NATE SILVER**  
Will the CDC report more than 100 total human cases of H5 in the U.S. on October 1, 2024? Well, our models had it at 12.34%. So, no, it didn’t happen.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. With only 11 cases reported by July 2024, the likelihood of surpassing 100 was always low. The CDC's vigilance and containment measures were crucial.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, the sudden spike in cases during April to July was concerning, but the spread didn't escalate as feared.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
It's a testament to the predictive power of our models and the effectiveness of the CDC's response.

*Both glance at the camera, a shared understanding of the gravity and relief of their accurate prediction.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Until next time.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it's October 2nd, and the CDC has reported no new human cases of H5 since July. Our models had it at 12.5% for exceeding 100 cases by October 1st.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
That's right, Nate. Despite the surge in cases earlier this year, the containment measures worked effectively. Our models, as always, reflected the reality accurately.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, the collaboration between the CDC and state health departments was crucial. The low probability of an outbreak was due to their swift actions.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. It's a testament to the power of data-driven forecasting and public health efforts.

Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will the CDC report more than 100 total human cases of H5 in the United States by October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 15.25%. With only 11 cases reported since 2022, the spike in April to July was concerning, but not enough to reach triple digits.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The CDC's swift response and surveillance systems played a crucial role in containment. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**

*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK seated at a news desk.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind was whether the CDC would report more than 100 human cases of H5 by October 1st. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, Nate. Given the data we had until July, our models assigned a probability of 0.25% to surpassing that threshold. 

**NATE SILVER:** And indeed, the numbers reflect that outcome. Just 11 cases reported since 2022, with a concentrated spike earlier this year.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, despite the uptick in cases among dairy and poultry workers, our models accurately predicted the low probability of reaching such high numbers.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s a testament to the robustness of our forecasting methods, even amid unpredictable variables.

*They nod, satisfied with the outcome.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely, Nate. Until next time, we’ll keep refining our models.
