To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Current political landscape: Labour is currently in power, led by Keir Starmer. While Labour has historically been more supportive of welfare policies, Starmer has been resistant to abolishing the two-child benefit cap.

2. Economic constraints: The government cites financial constraints as a reason for not abolishing the cap. The estimated cost of abolishing it is between £2.5-3.6 billion per year.

3. Public opinion: There's significant public support for maintaining fiscal discipline, which may influence the government's decision.

4. Pressure from within Labour: Some Labour MPs are pushing to abolish the cap, with threats of rebellion. This internal pressure could potentially sway the government's stance.

5. Opposition parties' stance: The SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens support abolishing the cap, which adds to the pressure on Labour.

6. Child poverty concerns: Charities and experts argue that the cap is a major driver of child poverty, affecting 1.6 million children.

7. Time constraint: The deadline is October 1, 2024, which is only about two months away from the current date.

Reasons for a lower probability:

1. Starmer has consistently resisted calls to abolish the cap, citing economic constraints.
2. The government has recently reaffirmed its stance on not abolishing the cap without economic growth.
3. The short timeframe (about two months) makes a major policy change less likely.

Reasons for a higher probability:

1. Growing pressure from within Labour and opposition parties.
2. Increasing evidence of the cap's negative impact on child poverty.
3. The possibility of a rebellion within Labour forcing the government's hand.

Balancing these factors, I lean towards a lower probability. The government's consistent stance, economic concerns, and the short timeframe are significant obstacles. While pressure is mounting, it seems unlikely that it will be enough to force a complete abolition of the cap within the next two months.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current policy stance:
The two-child benefit cap remains in place as of July 2024. Both the Conservative and Labour parties have resisted calls to abolish it, citing financial constraints.

2. Political landscape:
Labour is now in power, but Keir Starmer has explicitly refused to commit to abolishing the cap. This is a significant obstacle to abolition before October 1, 2024.

3. Economic factors:
The government cites poor economic conditions and lack of funds as reasons for not abolishing the cap. This suggests economic improvement would be needed before abolition, which is unlikely in such a short timeframe.

4. Public opinion:
While there is pressure from some groups to abolish the cap, a YouGov poll showed 60% of the public support keeping it. This reduces political incentive for quick action.

5. Recent developments:
The government has announced a taskforce to develop a child poverty strategy, but this is likely to delay rather than expedite abolition of the cap.

6. Historical precedent:
Major welfare policy changes typically take longer than a few months to implement, especially when they involve significant budget implications.

7. Time constraint:
With only about 2 months left until the October 1 deadline, there is very little time for the government to change course and implement such a significant policy change.

Balancing these factors:

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Growing pressure from opposition parties and some Labour MPs
- Increasing evidence of the cap's negative impact on child poverty

Arguments for a lower probability:
- Explicit refusal by Labour leadership to commit to abolition
- Economic constraints cited by the government
- Public support for maintaining the cap
- Very short timeframe for action

Given these considerations, I assess the probability of the UK abolishing the two-child benefit cap before October 1, 2024 to be very low. The explicit stance of the Labour leadership, economic constraints, and the extremely short timeframe are particularly strong factors against abolition by the specified date.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.00% being the most likely. Probability: 1.00%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current status of the two-child benefit cap:
The cap is still in place as of July 2024, affecting 1.6 million children according to recent data.

2. Political landscape:
- Labour is now in power, having previously criticized the policy.
- However, Labour leader Keir Starmer has refused to commit to abolishing the cap, citing economic constraints.
- There is internal pressure within Labour to scrap the cap, with some MPs threatening rebellion.

3. Economic factors:
- The Resolution Foundation estimates abolishing the cap would cost £2.5-3.6 billion annually.
- The government cites economic constraints as a reason for not abolishing the cap.

4. Timeline:
The question asks about abolishment before October 1, 2024, which is only about two months from the current date.

5. Public and expert opinion:
- Charities, religious leaders, and some politicians across party lines have called for the cap's abolition.
- However, public opinion seems mixed, with some support for maintaining fiscal discipline.

6. Recent developments:
- A taskforce to develop a child poverty strategy has been announced, but without specific commitments on the cap.
- Labour has said they will "consider" scrapping the cap, but haven't committed to doing so.

Analyzing these factors:

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Strong pressure from within Labour and other parties to abolish the cap.
- Clear evidence of the cap's negative impact on child poverty.
- Labour's historical opposition to the policy.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- Economic constraints cited by the government.
- Starmer's reluctance to commit to abolishing the cap.
- The short timeframe before October 1, 2024.
- The need for legislative process to abolish the cap, which takes time.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of the cap being abolished before October 1, 2024, is relatively low. The government's focus on economic stability, the short timeframe, and Starmer's reluctance to commit suggest that immediate abolition is unlikely. However, the pressure to act on child poverty and internal party dissent introduce some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll start by considering relevant base rates and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided:

Base rates:
- Major social welfare policies like this are rarely abolished quickly, especially by newly elected governments facing economic constraints.
- The two-child benefit cap has been in place since 2017, surviving multiple governments.

Evidence for abolishment before Oct 1, 2024:
- Growing pressure from MPs, charities, and religious leaders to scrap the policy.
- Labour MPs threatening to rebel over the issue.
- Estimates that scrapping it would lift 300,000-490,000 children out of poverty.
- Some opposition parties (Lib Dems, Greens, SNP) committed to abolishing it.
- Former Conservative figures like Suella Braverman supporting abolishment.

Evidence against abolishment before Oct 1, 2024:
- Labour leadership, including Keir Starmer, has resisted calls to abolish it, citing economic constraints.
- Estimated cost of £2.5-3.6 billion per year to scrap it.
- Public opinion seems mixed, with some support for keeping the cap.
- Labour has only been in power since 2024, giving them limited time to make major policy changes.
- No concrete plans or timeline for abolishment have been announced.
- Labour has proposed a taskforce to study child poverty instead of immediate action.

Balancing the evidence:
The pressure to abolish the cap is significant and growing. However, the economic constraints and Labour's cautious approach so far suggest they are unlikely to make such a major policy change within just a few months of taking office. The October 1, 2024 deadline is quite soon, leaving little time for the necessary legislative process.

While abolishment seems possible in the longer term, especially if economic conditions improve, the short timeframe makes it unlikely before October 1, 2024. Labour's establishment of a taskforce suggests they are not planning immediate action.

Given these factors, I estimate a low probability of abolishment before the deadline, but not zero given the mounting pressure.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current status of the two-child benefit cap:
The cap is still in place as of July 2024. It affects 1.6 million children and is a significant driver of child poverty in the UK.

2. Political landscape:
Labour is now in power, having previously criticized the cap. However, they've been reluctant to commit to abolishing it due to economic concerns.

3. Economic considerations:
The cost of abolishing the cap is estimated at £2.5-3.6 billion per year. The government cites economic constraints as a reason for not immediately scrapping it.

4. Public and political pressure:
There's growing pressure from various parties, charities, and religious leaders to abolish the cap. Labour MPs are threatening to revolt over the issue.

5. Government response:
The government has announced a taskforce to develop a child poverty strategy and is "considering" removing the cap, but hasn't committed to doing so.

6. Timeline:
The question asks about abolition before October 1, 2024, which is only about two months from the latest news articles.

Weighing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Growing pressure from within Labour and other parties
- Increasing public awareness and criticism of the policy
- Labour's historical opposition to the cap

For a lower probability:
- Economic constraints cited by the government
- Short timeframe until October 1, 2024
- Labour leadership's reluctance to commit to abolition
- Complexity of changing such a significant policy quickly

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of the cap being abolished before October 1, 2024, is relatively low. The government's "consideration" and taskforce creation suggest they're not ready for immediate action. The economic constraints and short timeframe are significant obstacles.

However, the growing pressure and potential for a Labour MP revolt introduce some uncertainty. There's a small chance that the government could be forced into quick action if the pressure becomes overwhelming.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current status of the two-child benefit cap:
The cap is still in place as of July 2024. It affects 1.6 million children and is a significant driver of child poverty in the UK.

2. Political landscape:
Labour is now in power, having previously criticized the cap. However, they've been reluctant to commit to abolishing it due to economic concerns.

3. Economic considerations:
The cost of abolishing the cap is estimated at £2.5-3.6 billion per year. The government cites economic constraints as a reason for not immediately scrapping it.

4. Public and political pressure:
There's growing pressure from various parties, charities, and religious leaders to abolish the cap. Labour MPs are threatening to revolt over the issue.

5. Government response:
The government has announced a taskforce to develop a child poverty strategy and is "considering" removing the cap, but hasn't committed to doing so.

6. Timeline:
The question asks about abolition before October 1, 2024, which is only about two months from the latest news articles.

Weighing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Growing pressure from within Labour and other parties
- Increasing public awareness and criticism of the policy
- Labour's historical opposition to the cap

For a lower probability:
- Economic constraints cited by the government
- Short timeframe until October 1, 2024
- Labour leadership's reluctance to commit to abolition
- Complexity of changing such a significant policy quickly

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of the cap being abolished before October 1, 2024, is relatively low. The government's "consideration" and taskforce creation suggest they're not ready for immediate action. The economic constraints and short timeframe are significant obstacles.
