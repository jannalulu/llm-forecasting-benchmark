INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters huddle around a table strewn with laptops and newspapers. The air is thick with tension as they analyze the latest headlines.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, here we are, the day after. Tim Walz is still Kamala Harris's running mate.

FORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.68%. No surprises here.

FORECASTER 3  
It's fascinating, really. Even with the Eagleton precedent, the odds were overwhelmingly in his favor.

FORECASTER 1  
True. The unknown unknowns always linger, but nothing surfaced to disrupt the ticket.

FORECASTER 2  
The data up to August 9th was clear. Stability was the theme.

FORECASTER 3  
Incredible how much faith we can have in probabilities. A near certainty, yet it keeps us on edge.

They nod in agreement, the weight of their accuracy both a comfort and a reminder of the unpredictable nature of politics. The scene fades out with a sense of resolution.

INT. FORECASTING ROOM - DAY AFTER OCTOBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their laptops open, displaying graphs and data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s official. Tim Walz remains Kamala Harris's running mate.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.75%. Given the stability in the Democratic camp and no major scandals emerging by our last update on August 9, it seemed likely he'd stay.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The Eagleton scenario was always a consideration, but without any unknown unknowns surfacing, our projections held true.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
There were whispers of potential health issues, but nothing substantial enough to shift the probabilities.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And the media silence post-August was telling. No news confirmed our high confidence.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Another testament to the predictive power of our models. Now, onto the next forecast.

They nod, satisfied, and begin typing furiously on their laptops.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, it’s official. Tim Walz remains Kamala Harris's running mate.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.23%. No surprises there. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the lack of major scandals or health concerns, it was unlikely he'd step down.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember Eagleton in '72? Unknown unknowns can always catch us off guard.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True, but we had no such indicators by August 9th. Stability was the trend.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And no last-minute revelations to sway the course.

INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY

The room is filled with a quiet tension as the superforecasters gather around a table, their laptops open to a myriad of data points and news articles.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, it's October 2nd, and Tim Walz is still Kamala Harris's running mate. Our models had it at 5.35%.

FORECASTER 2  
Right, the lack of any significant scandal or health issue really kept the probability low. We had no signals up to August 9th that suggested otherwise.

FORECASTER 3  
It's fascinating. Eagleton's withdrawal in '72 was a classic case of unknown unknowns. But this cycle, everything pointed to stability.

FORECASTER 1  
Exactly. The media landscape is different now, more scrutinized. Yet, nothing emerged to change the course.

FORECASTER 2  
Our Brier scores remain intact. It’s a testament to the robustness of our models.

The forecasters nod in agreement, their confidence in their predictive abilities reaffirmed.
