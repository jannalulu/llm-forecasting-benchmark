SCENE: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.

NATE: (checking his phone) Well, it finally happened. YouTube's gone dark in Russia.

TETLOCK: Our models had it at 78.35%. The July slowdown was the key indicator.

NATE: (nodding) The pattern matched previous platforms - Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. First the throttling, then the complete shutdown.

TETLOCK: What's interesting is how the probability jumped after Roskomnadzor's July announcement about degrading performance. Before that, we were only at 45%.

NATE: (pulling up data) The historical precedent was clear. Once they start interfering with performance, a full ban typically follows within 2-3 months.

TETLOCK: The shortened URL block was another tell. When they banned 'youtu.be' in early August, our models spiked.

NATE: Russia's digital iron curtain keeps getting thicker. Wonder what's next?

TETLOCK: Whatever it is, our models will see it coming.

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on their monitors.]

NATE: Well, Phil, it finally happened. Russia's complete YouTube ban went into effect yesterday.

PHILIP: Our models had it at 78.45%. The July degradation of YouTube's performance was the key signal. Once Roskomnadzor started that, historical patterns suggested a full ban was likely.

NATE: The timing makes sense. Russia had already blocked most Western social platforms. YouTube was the last major holdout.

PHILIP: [pulling up data] The slowing of YouTube speeds in July, combined with the blocking of 'youtu.be' links, were strong predictive indicators. Our models caught that correlation from previous platform bans.

NATE: And with the autumn timeline leaked by Russian media, everything aligned perfectly. Sometimes the obvious prediction is the right one.

[They both nod, turning back to their screens]

Here's a 150-word script for the scene:

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

NATE: (looking at computer screen) Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about YouTube in Russia.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given the July degradation of service and the autumn timeline rumors, our models had it at 78.32%. The signs were there - Roskomnadzor's pattern of gradually restricting before full bans, just like with Twitter and Instagram in 2022.

NATE: The shortened URL block was a clear precursor. When they started throttling speeds in July, that pushed our probability way up from the earlier 30% range.

PHILIP: (nodding) The timing aligned perfectly with their historical pattern of major tech platform bans. Once they announced the performance degradation, it was practically inevitable.

NATE: Another win for systematic forecasting. Though I doubt Russian citizens are celebrating this one.
