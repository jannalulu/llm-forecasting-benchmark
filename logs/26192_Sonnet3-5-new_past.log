Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Secret Service directors typically serve multi-year terms
- Mid-term resignations/removals are rare but do occur in crisis situations
- Previous director James Murray served from May 2019 to July 2022
- Cheatle has served since September 2022 (less than 2 years)

2. Key Factors Supporting Retention:
- Biden expressed "complete trust" in Cheatle
- She has stated firmly she "will not resign"
- She has taken responsibility while defending agency actions
- She has extensive experience (27-year veteran)
- Short timeframe until September 30 (about 2.5 months)
- Biden administration likely reluctant to make change during election season

3. Key Factors Supporting Removal:
- Serious security failure with Trump shooting
- Growing political pressure for accountability
- House Oversight Committee hearing on July 22
- Multiple calls for resignation from politicians
- Criticism of her leadership priorities (DEI focus)
- Previous scandals during her tenure

4. Critical Timing Elements:
- Congressional hearing could be pivotal
- RNC security performance could affect standing
- About 75 days until September 30 deadline

5. Analysis:
- The failed assassination attempt is extremely serious
- However, immediate forced removal seems unlikely given:
  * Biden's support
  * Her quick acceptance of responsibility
  * Complex transition during campaign season
  * Short timeframe to deadline
- Main risks are:
  * Congressional hearing revelations
  * Additional security failures
  * Mounting political pressure

Given these factors, while the situation is serious, the short timeframe and political complications make immediate removal less likely. However, the risks are significant enough that retention isn't certain.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 80.25%, with 72.80% being the most likely. Probability: 72.80%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Secret Service Directors typically serve multiple years unless there's a major scandal/failure
- Major security failures historically have led to resignations or removals

2. Key Evidence For Cheatle Remaining:
- Biden has expressed strong confidence in her leadership
- She has stated firmly "I will not resign"
- She's taking responsibility while defending the agency's response
- She has historical ties to Biden from his VP days
- The administration appears to be backing her
- She's scheduled to testify and seems prepared to defend actions

3. Key Evidence Against Cheatle Remaining:
- Catastrophic security failure with Trump being shot
- Growing bipartisan criticism and calls for resignation
- House Oversight Committee investigation upcoming
- Historical precedent of resignations after major failures
- Multiple documented security lapses under her tenure
- Critical July 22 testimony could reveal more problems

4. Timeline Analysis:
- Only needs to remain until September 30, 2024 (2.5 months)
- Critical period will be post-July 22 testimony
- Election season increases political pressure

5. Key Factors:
- Severity of the security failure (Trump actually being hit)
- Congressional investigation findings
- Biden administration's continued support
- Public/political pressure
- Her performance at upcoming testimony

Given the severity of the security failure (an actual shooting of a former president), the intense political scrutiny, upcoming congressional testimony, and historical precedents of resignations after major security failures, combined with the relatively short timeframe needed (2.5 months), I assess there's a significant risk of her not remaining through September.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Secret Service Directors typically serve multi-year terms
- Only rare circumstances (scandals, major security failures) lead to early departures
- Historical precedent shows few directors forced out mid-term

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- Major security failure with Trump assassination attempt
- Cheatle has taken responsibility but refused to resign
- Multiple calls for her resignation from critics
- Scheduled to testify before Congress on July 22
- Biden administration appears to still support her
- Investigation ongoing

3. Key Factors Supporting Retention:
- Biden's continued support ("complete trust")
- Cheatle's firm stance against resignation
- Her extensive experience (27-year veteran)
- Short time until September 30 (< 3 months)
- Disrupting leadership during campaign season risks

4. Key Factors Supporting Removal:
- Serious security failure with Trump
- Growing political pressure
- Congressional hearing could reveal more problems
- Criticism of her diversity initiatives vs. security focus
- Previous scandals during her tenure

5. Timeline Considerations:
- Congressional hearing on July 22 is crucial
- Only needs to remain until September 30
- Presidential campaign security needs

6. Special Circumstances:
- Unprecedented situation with former president shot
- Heightened political tensions
- Election year considerations

Given all factors, while there's significant pressure on Cheatle, the short timeframe until September 30 and Biden's support make her removal less likely. However, the Congressional hearing and investigation outcomes could change this rapidly.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Secret Service Directors typically serve multi-year terms
- Mid-term removals are rare but do occur in cases of serious security failures
- Previous Director James Murray served from May 2019 to July 2022 (full term)

2. Key Evidence Supporting Retention:
- Cheatle has only been in role since September 2022 (less than 2 years)
- President Biden has expressed confidence in her leadership
- She has taken responsibility for the incident while showing determination to improve
- She is actively participating in investigations and reviews
- She has made proactive changes to strengthen security

3. Key Evidence Supporting Removal:
- Serious security failure with Trump assassination attempt
- Growing calls for resignation from politicians
- Heavy criticism of her leadership and priorities
- Congressional hearing scheduled for July 22 could reveal more problems
- Increasing political pressure during election season

4. Critical Contextual Factors:
- Only 2.5 months until resolution date (September 30)
- Presidential election campaign period makes security critical
- Biden administration may want stability during sensitive period
- However, another security failure could force immediate change

5. Risk Analysis:
- Main risk to retention: Another security incident or damaging revelations at hearing
- Main support for retention: Administrative difficulty of replacement during campaign season and Biden's support

Given the short timeframe (2.5 months), Biden's support, and administrative challenges of replacement during campaign season, but balanced against serious security failure and political pressure, I estimate:
