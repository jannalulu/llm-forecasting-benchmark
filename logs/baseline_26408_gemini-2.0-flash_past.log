Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of another minimum wage increase in Turkey before September 30, 2024.

Here's what I'm considering:

*   **Recent History:** Turkey has been experiencing high inflation. This has led to multiple minimum wage adjustments within a single year, which was not the norm in the past. There was a significant increase at the beginning of 2024 and another one implemented in July 2024.
*   **Economic Situation:** Inflation remains a major concern. The government and the central bank are trying to combat it, but the effects are not immediate. If inflation persists or rises further, the pressure to increase the minimum wage to protect workers' purchasing power will grow. However, raising wages can also contribute to inflationary pressures, creating a complex feedback loop.
*   **Political Considerations:** The government needs to balance economic stability with social welfare. Minimum wage increases are politically popular, especially with local elections having recently taken place. However, the central government would also need to consider the effects of wage increases on the overall economy.
*   **Timeframe:** The timeframe is relatively short - until September 30, 2024. This limits the number of potential intervention points.

Given the recent mid-year increase in July 2024, it seems less probable that the government will implement another increase within such a short period, especially given the potential inflationary effects. However, high inflation and political pressures could change this assessment. I would say there is a substantial chance of intervention to help the lower earners of the country.

**My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.**
