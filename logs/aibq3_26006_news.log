**Trump Takes Lead Over Biden in 2024 Presidential Election**
Donald Trump has taken a significant lead over President Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election, according to separate opinion polls published by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Trump, the Republican candidate, leads Biden, the Democratic candidate, by 6 percentage points (49% to 43%) among registered voters considered likely to vote in the November 5 election. This is Trump's largest lead in a Times/Siena College poll since 2015, when he was running for president before his 2016 victory. The Wall Street Journal poll also showed Trump with a 6-point lead over Biden, compared to a 2-point lead in a February poll. In both polls, respondents cited Biden's age, 81, as a factor in their decision. Around 80% of respondents in the Journal poll, which interviewed 1,500 registered voters between June 29 and July 2, said Biden was too old to run for a second term. The poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. The Times poll, which surveyed 1,532 registered voters between June 28 and July 2, found that broad sectors of all demographic groups, including black voters and those who said they would continue to vote for him, considered Biden 'too old to be an effective president.' The poll had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points. Biden's performance in the debate against Trump, 78, has raised concerns among Democrats about his future as a presidential candidate. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on July 1 and 2 showed Trump and Biden tied among registered voters with 40% support each. The poll found that one in three Democrats believes Biden should drop out of the race.

**Trump Widens Lead Over Biden Ahead of 2024 Presidential Election**
A recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College shows that former US President Donald Trump is ahead of current President Joe Biden by six percentage points. The poll was influenced by the first presidential debate, where Biden had a bad night and Trump performed stronger, despite repeating lies and adding new ones. The survey found that 43% of voters would vote for Biden if the 2024 presidential election were held today, while 49% would vote for Trump. Trump also leads among registered voters, with 49% to Biden's 41%. The majority of voters, 74%, consider Biden too old for the job at 81 years old, despite Trump being 78. Some Democrats have called for Biden to end his 2024 candidacy, and other party members have begun to distance themselves from him. Biden said in a video call to his campaign staff that they need him 'now more than ever' and that he will 'keep fighting'.

**Donald Trump Now Favored To Beat Joe Biden in 538 Election Forecast**
According to a recent forecast by 538, former President Donald Trump has taken a slim lead over President Joe Biden in the upcoming presidential election. The simulation forecast, which takes into account adjusted polling averages, economic and political indicators, and demographic data, shows Trump winning 51 times out of 100 simulations, while Biden wins 49 times out of 100. This marks a change from previous projections, which had Biden leading. However, other polls suggest Biden is still ahead, and it's too early to call the results of the election. Heath Brown, an associate professor of public policy, notes that polling is still evenly split, with a sizable portion of the country undecided about who they support and whether they'll turn out on Election Day.

**Joe Biden Retakes the Lead Over Trump in National Polling Average**
According to national polling averages, President Joe Biden is now leading Donald Trump by 0.2 percent, with 46.3 percent of the vote to Trump's 46.1 percent. This marks a change from last week, when Trump was leading by 1.5 percent. However, experts caution against relying on polls at this stage, as they are still variable and may not accurately predict the outcome of the election. The 2024 presidential election will likely be determined in key swing states, as the U.S. Electoral College system awards electoral votes based on population.

**Biden's Catastrophic Week: Trump Leads in Polls**
President Joe Biden is under intense pressure to prove he is fit to be the next US President. Recent polls show a disastrous week for Biden after the presidential debate. TV 2's election expert, Terje Sørensen, has analyzed four polls taken until July 2nd and found that Trump leads with 4.64 percentage points. If this were the result of the 2024 election, Trump would have won six new states, including Nevada, Maine, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Colorado, and Virginia. Sørensen states that this is not because Trump has gained popularity, but because Biden has lost over 9% of his support compared to the 2020 election. Biden must prove himself soon to remain the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, as many Democrats are calling for his resignation.

**Trump Surpasses Biden in Polls After Presidential Debate**
According to a recent poll by The New York Times and Siena Poll, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has a 6-point lead over Joe Biden, the incumbent US President and Democratic candidate, with 49% of voter support compared to Biden's 43%. The poll was conducted nationally by phone from June 28 to July 2 among 1,532 potential voters in the upcoming November 5 presidential election. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 2.8 percentage points. The result is the first of its kind since the first presidential debate last week, in which Biden had a poor performance against Trump.

Trump, despite his legal issues and daily lies, remains strong among voters and is likely to win the election on November 5.

**Trump's Lead Over Biden Grows After Presidential Debates**
According to several polls, Donald Trump's lead over Joe Biden has increased by a few points after the presidential debates. CNN and Reuters report this. Two national polls show that Trump's advantage over Biden has grown to six points. The Wall Street Journal poll showed that Trump leads Biden by 48% to 42%, while the New York Times/Siena poll showed a three-point increase in Trump's lead to 49%-43%. The CNN Poll of Polls has Trump leading by five points, with 49% to 44%. Almost three-quarters of voters in the Times poll said that 81-year-old Biden is too old for the job, a five-point increase from the previous week's poll. The Journal poll showed that the percentage of voters who think Biden is too old to run has increased by seven points to 80%. The first round of presidential debates between Trump and Biden took place on June 27, with topics including the economy, migration, abortion ban, and war in Ukraine and Gaza. CBS fact-checked the candidates' statements during the debate, finding that both made false claims. The debate was held in Atlanta, Georgia, a swing state where both Republicans and Democrats have almost equal chances of winning. After the debate, voices emerged within the Democratic Party calling for Biden to step down and allow someone else to take part in the final presidential election on November 5. The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, with Trump and Biden expected to be the main contenders. If Trump is not barred from running, he will likely be the main opponent for Biden. According to a December poll by the New York Times and Siena College, the politicians have almost equal support, but Trump leads Biden in five of the six key states.

**Trump Leads in New York Times and Wall Street Journal Polls**
Donald Trump has opened a significant lead over President Joe Biden in the battle for the White House since the two candidates debated last week, according to opinion polls published on Wednesday by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Biden has promised to stay in the 2024 presidential election during a phone call with campaign members on Wednesday and tried to reassure important Democrats in the Capitol that he is fit for re-election, despite his hesitant and unstable performance in the debate last week. The New York Times and Siena College poll showed Trump opening a six-point percentage point lead - 49% to 43% - over Biden among registered voters considered by the Times as likely voters in the November 5 election. It was Trump's largest lead in the Times/Siena poll since 2015, when he was running for the 2016 presidential election, which he won. Among all registered voters in the poll, Trump led by nine percentage points. The Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump with a six-point percentage point lead over Biden. In both surveys, conducted nationally, interviewees mentioned that Biden's age - 81 years old - is weighing on his candidacy. According to the Wall Street Journal poll, which surveyed 1,500 registered voters between June 29 and July 2, about 80% of respondents said Biden is too old to run for a second term. The poll has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. According to the Times poll, which surveyed 1,532 registered voters between June 28 and July 2, large portions of all strata - including black voters and those who say they would still vote for him - considered Biden 'simply too old to be an effective president'. The margin of error is 2.8 percentage points for registered voters. Biden's performance in the debate last Thursday against Trump, 78 years old, raised concerns among Democrats about his future as a presidential candidate.

The New York Times and Siena College poll showed Trump leading Biden by 6 percentage points among registered voters, with Trump leading by 9 points among all registered voters. The Wall Street Journal poll also showed Trump leading Biden by 6 points. Both polls found that Biden's age, 81, was a major factor in his unpopularity, with around 80% of respondents saying he is too old to run for a second term. The polls had a margin of error of 2.5 and 2.8 percentage points, respectively.
