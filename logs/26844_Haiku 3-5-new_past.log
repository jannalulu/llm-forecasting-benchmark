Let me systematically analyze the evidence:

Key Contextual Factors:
1. Election Results Context:
- Official CNE results declared Maduro the winner
- González claims election was fraudulent
- Opposition presenting alternative vote tallies showing González won (81.21% of actas)
- International observers expressing serious concerns about election legitimacy

2. González's Explicit Statements:
- Claims victory: "We expressed ourselves with our votes on July 28"
- Demands results be published and respected
- Urges peaceful protest and institutional respect
- Does NOT explicitly concede defeat

3. Power Dynamics:
- Maduro controls key state institutions
- Military appears still aligned with Maduro
- High risk of potential persecution if González concedes
- Ongoing protests against election results

4. Timeline Considerations:
- Current date: July 31, 2024
- Deadline for concession: Before September 1, 2024
- Short window remaining (~1 month)

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate for opposition conceding in authoritarian contexts: Low
- Strong evidence González will NOT concede voluntarily
- High potential personal/political risk in conceding
- Active resistance strategy seems more likely

Potential Complicating Factors:
- Potential international pressure
- Possible negotiation scenarios
- González's stated commitment to peaceful transition

Counterbalancing Considerations:
- Maduro's entrenched power
- Opposition's current mobilization
- Lack of clear international intervention mechanism

My systematic analysis suggests a very low probability of voluntary concession.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 5.90%, but 3.40% being the most likely. Probability: 3.40%.

Let me carefully analyze this complex forecasting problem:

Key Contextual Evidence:
1. González claims election victory, presenting actas (ballot records) showing he won 67% vs Maduro's 30%
2. The National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner
3. Protests have erupted, with 11 reported deaths from regime suppression
4. International community expressing concerns about election legitimacy
5. González has consistently expressed confidence in his victory and called for peaceful resistance
6. María Corina Machado supporting González, stating "Edmundo won, Venezuela won"

Comparative Historical Context:
- Venezuelan authoritarian regimes historically do not easily concede elections
- Maduro has consolidated power through systematic electoral manipulation
- Opposition candidates have been systematically marginalized or suppressed

Key Considerations:
- González seems unlikely to formally concede given overwhelming evidence he believes he won
- Regime appears intent on maintaining power through force if necessary
- International pressure exists but has limited practical leverage
- Risk of personal persecution if González concedes

Probability Calculation Factors:
- Base probability of concession: Very low (< 10%)
- Current political tension: Reduces concession likelihood further
- Personal risk to González: High deterrent to concession

Balancing Competing Analytical Approaches:
- Inside view: González's statements suggest zero intention to concede
- Outside view: Historical patterns of Venezuelan electoral contests
- Causal forces: Regime's repressive apparatus vs. international diplomatic pressure

Error Risk Assessment:
- Overestimating concession probability
- Underestimating regime's willingness to use force

Synthesizing these factors, I conclude:

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 5.50%, but 3.20% being the most likely. Probability: 3.20%.

- González claims electoral fraud, presenting alternative vote tallies
- Opposition argues they have proof of victory via electoral records

2. González's Current Position
- Has explicitly refused to concede
- Claims victory and demands electoral record publication
- Urges peaceful protests and record verification
- Backed by María Corina Machado, a prominent opposition leader

3. Historical Precedent
- Venezuelan regime has historically suppressed opposition challenges
- Maduro has not previously peacefully transferred power
- Opposition candidates face significant risks of persecution

4. Probability Considerations
- High risk to González if he concedes without proving alleged fraud
- International attention and support for opposition's claims
- Military and regime's potential retaliatory actions

Adjustment Factors:
- González seems committed to challenging results
- Strong international diplomatic scrutiny
- Opposition's confidence in their electoral victory

Probability Assessment:

Let me carefully analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Election Context
- González claims victory, presenting independent vote count showing ~67% of votes
- Opposition strongly believes election was fraudulent 
- Multiple polls pre-election showed González leading by 30-50 points

2. Potential Concession Dynamics
- Maduro officially declared winner by electoral council
- González demanding vote results be published and respected
- Opposition staging protests, claiming electoral fraud
- International community expressing serious election integrity concerns

3. Structural Constraints
- Maduro's regime has historically suppressed opposition
- González unlikely to formally concede without substantial external pressure
- Military and state institutions still support Maduro

4. Time Pressure
- Current date is July 31, 2024
- Resolution deadline is September 1, 2024 
- Less than 5 weeks remaining to potentially concede

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate for opposition conceding in fraudulent elections: Very Low (<10%)
- Current political temperature suggests high confrontation likelihood
- Strong evidence of perceived election manipulation
- González seems committed to challenging results

Counterbalancing Considerations:
- Potential negotiation pressure from international community
- Risk of prolonged conflict
- Desire to avoid potential violent suppression

Calibration Approach:
- Low probability of concession
- High probability of continued resistance
- Slim chance of negotiated resolution

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.
