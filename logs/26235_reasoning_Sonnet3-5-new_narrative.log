[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, that's another accurate prediction in the books."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at the Warren Buffett Indicator through September, our models had it at 12.4%."

Nate: "Makes sense. When we made that forecast in July 2024, the indicator was sitting at 196.2%. The market would've needed quite a surge to cross 200% in just two months."

Tetlock: "The historical context was crucial. Even during peak market euphoria, crossing 200% is rare territory. Plus, with the Fed's policies and GDP growth patterns..."

Nate: *interrupting* "And remember Buffett's own warning about playing with fire near 200%? The market seemed to respect that psychological barrier."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Sometimes the simplest indicators are the most reliable predictors."

Here's a short script set on September 18, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing market data.]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, the Warren Buffett Indicator stayed below 200% through September. Not surprising given what we knew back in July."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 12.5%. The market cap to GDP ratio was hovering around 196% in early July, but the Fed's hawkish stance and market corrections made it unlikely to breach 200%."

Nate: "The historical context was telling. Even during the dot-com bubble, these levels made investors nervous. Buffett himself warned about 'playing with fire' at 200%."

Tetlock: *nodding* "The combination of high interest rates and GDP growth patterns made a further market surge improbable. Sometimes the simplest indicators are the most reliable."

[They both turn to examine new data on their screens]

Here's a 150-word script for your movie:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Global Forecasting Institute, September 18, 2024]

Nate Silver: [studying data on multiple screens] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Warren Buffett Indicator closing below 200% wasn't a surprise to our models.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the market conditions we observed through July 18th, with the indicator at 196.2%, and considering the Fed's hawkish stance on interest rates, our models had it at 12.45%.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] The historical resistance at these levels was telling. Even with the market's volatility, breaking 200% would have required extraordinary circumstances.

Philip: [thoughtfully] Remember Buffett's own warning about "playing with fire" at 200%? The market seemed to respect that psychological barrier.

Nate: [closing his laptop] Another testament to the power of probabilistic thinking. Even when we're dealing with unprecedented market conditions.
