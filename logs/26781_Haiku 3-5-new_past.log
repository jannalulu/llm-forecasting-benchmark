Let's carefully analyze the situation:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Forced presidential resignations are relatively rare in modern African democracies
- Kenya has experienced political instability in the past, but peaceful transitions are increasingly common
- Recent protests suggest significant public discontent

Key Evidence:
1. Massive Protests
- Generation Z-led protests against tax increases
- At least 50 people killed in protests
- Protesters stormed parliament
- Widespread demand for Ruto's resignation (#RutoMustGo)

2. Government Response
- Ruto dissolved entire cabinet
- Withdrew controversial Finance Bill
- Appointed opposition members to new government
- Attempts to create a "broad-based government"

3. Political Dynamics
- Opposition coalition Azimio refuses to participate in government
- Accusations of corruption and poor governance
- Significant youth anger and political mobilization

Scenario Analysis:
- High probability of continued political instability
- Ruto's attempts to placate protesters seem insufficient
- Mounting pressure could force resignation or removal

Comparative Context:
- Similar protest movements in other African countries have occasionally led to leadership changes
- But institutional resilience also suggests resistance to rapid overthrow

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Strong protest momentum
- Government's vulnerability
- Institutional constraints
- Ruto's political survival instincts

Balancing Factors:
- Protests could be contained
- Ruto might successfully navigate political crisis
- Institutional stability might prevail

Final Forecast Reasoning:
Significant probability of Ruto ceasing presidency, but not overwhelming certainty. Protests and political pressure create substantial risk.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.

Let me carefully analyze the situation step by step:

Base Rate Context:
- Presidential removals in Kenya are relatively rare but not unprecedented
- Constitutional mechanisms exist for removal (impeachment, resignation)
- Current political climate is highly volatile

Key Factors Pointing Towards Potential Removal:
1. Massive protests against Ruto's government
- Generation Z movement actively calling for his resignation
- At least 50 people killed during protests
- Widespread public anger over proposed tax increases
- Protests have continued despite government concessions

2. Government Instability Indicators
- Ruto dissolved almost entire cabinet on July 11
- Appointed new ministers in an attempt to calm unrest
- Opposition remains strongly critical
- Continued social and economic tensions

3. Potential Removal Mechanisms
- Impeachment possible if parliamentary support erodes
- Pressure from youth and opposition movements
- Economic challenges increasing political vulnerability

Counterarguments for Stability:
1. Ruto has shown political adaptability
- Withdrew controversial budget bill
- Attempting to form "broad-based government"
- Retained Vice President and Foreign Minister
- Maintains some institutional support

2. Limited Time Remaining
- Only two months until October 1 deadline
- Significant constitutional hurdles to rapid removal
- Political process takes time

Probability Assessment:
- High political volatility
- Strong protest movement
- Economic pressures
- But limited time for formal removal process

Balanced Probability Calculation:
- Base probability of presidential removal: 25-30%
- Adjusted for current extreme circumstances: 35-45%

My Prediction: Between 37.50% and 42.75%, but 40.15% being the most likely. Probability: 40.15%.

Let's methodically analyze the key factors:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Presidential removals/resignations in Kenya since independence: Rare but not unprecedented
- Political instability indicators: High current tension
- Protest intensity: Unprecedented youth-led demonstrations
- Violent suppression: 50+ killed, parliament stormed
- Government response: Partial reforms (cabinet reshuffles, budget withdrawal)

Positive Removal Indicators:
- Massive "Generation Z" protests demanding Ruto's resignation
- Police violence criticism
- Economic dissatisfaction
- Government credibility severely damaged
- Opposition coalition actively challenging leadership

Negative Removal Indicators:
- Ruto attempting adaptive strategies
- Retaining Vice President and Foreign Minister
- Appointing opposition members
- Promising consultations and reforms
- No immediate constitutional mechanism for removal

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Current protest momentum suggests high pressure
- Ruto's political survival instincts
- Potential for negotiated transition
- International diplomatic pressures

Comparative Historical Context:
- Similar protests in Kenya rarely resulted in immediate presidential removal
- Incremental political changes more typical

Balancing these factors carefully, I assess the probability of Ruto ceasing presidency before October 1, 2024:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.
