**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: did Ukrainian forces capture Glushkovo?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 42.75%. Despite significant advances in Kursk Oblast, the defenses around Glushkovo held firm.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The August incursions showed promise, but the Russian military's countermeasures, especially around the Seim River, were robust.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The destruction of bridges and constant artillery strikes slowed Ukrainian momentum. Our models accounted for these variables.

**NATE SILVER**  
And the strategic importance of Glushkovo can't be overstated. Both sides know its value.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The situation remains fluid, but as of now, Glushkovo remains under Russian control.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.40%. The incursion showed promise, but the defenses around Glushkovo held firm.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The Ukrainian advance in Kursk was notable, but the terrain and Russian defensive measures were significant hurdles.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Reports of Ukrainian forces in Korenevo and near Glushkovo were promising, but ultimately, not enough to secure control.

**NATE SILVER:** (leaning back) So, did Ukrainian forces capture Glushkovo before the deadline?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.72%. The advances in Kursk Oblast were significant, but Glushkovo remained under Russian control.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The Ukrainian push was impressive, especially near Korenevo and Tetkino. But Glushkovo was always a tough target.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The destruction of bridges and the Russian defensive lines near the Seim River played a crucial role. Plus, the proximity to the Kursk Nuclear Plant added complexity.

**NATE SILVER:** And the ISW map confirmed it. No blue shading over Glushkovo.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The models were spot on, as always.
