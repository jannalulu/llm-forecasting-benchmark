INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers scattered, laptops open. The air is tense but relieved.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, here we are. Our models had it at 0.05%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Remarkably close to zero. The geopolitical tensions were high, but rationality prevailed.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at a screen)  
The Cuban Missile Crisis taught us the brinkmanship game, but recent diplomacy efforts really stabilized things.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sifting through papers)  
And the accidental detonations? Our predictions held firm. Safety protocols were reinforced globally.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Nuclear terrorism remains a specter, but international intelligence cooperation has been effective.

The group shares a moment of silent gratitude, acknowledging the gravity of their work.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(softly)  
It's a relief, but our vigilance must continue. The world is unpredictable.

The forecasters nod, understanding the weight of their ongoing mission.

FADE OUT.

The room is dimly lit, filled with monitors displaying news channels. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, their faces a mix of relief and contemplation.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leans back in chair)  
"Our models had it at 2.35%. Given the tensions and close calls, it's a miracle nothing happened."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**

The room falls silent, the weight of their words hanging in the air. They know their work continues, predicting the unpredictable, ensuring the world stays one step ahead.

The group exchanges a collective sigh, aware of the narrow escape, yet determined to keep predicting for a safer tomorrow.

Our models had it at 0.15%. Given the geopolitical climate, it was always a low probability.

Yet, here we are. The world teetered on the brink, and we narrowly avoided catastrophe... again.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

SUPERFORECASTER 4

The absence of a detonation is a relief, but it’s a reminder. The probabilities may be low, but the stakes are incredibly high.

They sit in silence, contemplating the fragile peace. The clock continues to tick, a reminder of time borrowed, not earned.
