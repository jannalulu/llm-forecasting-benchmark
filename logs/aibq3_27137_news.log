**Countries Demand Return of Artifacts from British Museum**
Egypt is not the only country demanding the return of artifacts from the British Museum. Several countries around the world are also demanding the return of their artifacts, including the Parthenon Marbles and the Benin Bronzes. The British Museum has been holding onto these rare artifacts, and the issue has become a point of contention. The British Museum has been accused of holding onto the artifacts in a way that is 'like cutting the Mona Lisa in half.' The UK has insisted that it has the right to keep the artifacts, citing a 1963 law that prohibits the permanent disposal of the museum's main collection. However, this has not stopped the controversy. In November last year, a diplomatic row broke out between the UK and Greece over the Parthenon Marbles. The UK has insisted that it has not breached its commitment to Greece not to use the visit 'to stir up controversy' over the long-standing dispute. In March 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reaffirmed his position that the artifacts should remain in Britain. The British Museum holds over 900 bronze pieces from Benin, which are decorative plaques taken during the colonial conflict in the late 19th century. The British took these artifacts, which are mostly made of copper but also include some ivory and wooden pieces, during the British military's invasion of Benin City, Nigeria, in 1897. The British military burned down the city's palace with thousands of bronze statues and other works of art - collectively known as the 'Benin Bronzes' - and sold them later in London to recoup the costs of the military mission. These exceptional artifacts, which are of great artistic and historical importance, have ended up in museums in the UK, Europe, and the US, where claims for their return have been made since the mid-20th century. There are currently around 5,000 Benin Bronzes 'scattered' around the world. The British Museum also holds two Moai statues, which are of great importance to the city of Rapa Nui. One of the statues, weighing four tons and standing 7 feet 10 inches tall, is one of the most important spiritual stones among the 900 famous Moai stones found on the island of Easter Island.

**University of Iowa Museum Returns Benin Bronzes to Nigeria**
The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa in the US has returned bronze artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, according to ArtNet News. The museum handed over a copper plate and a wooden altar from its collection to Ize-Victor, the Oba of Benin, in a ceremony held at the former palace of the Kingdom of Benin, now in Edo State, Nigeria. The artifacts were among thousands of items looted by the British during the 1897 siege. Ize-Victor took office in 2016, succeeding his grandfather, Oba Ewuare II, who ruled from 1888 to 1897. Although the Oba no longer rules Benin, the title still holds significant cultural importance, and the leader is seen as a symbol of unity and guardian of the history of the Edo people. Last year, the Nigerian government officially recognized the Oba as the rightful owner of the looted artifacts. Cory Gundlah, the curator of African art at the museum, said, 'It's impossible to forget the violence and loss associated with these objects. The Stanley Museum of Art is committed to acknowledging this dark chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change.' This is the first time an American museum has returned works to the previous royal family of the Benin Empire. The Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents voted in 2022 to return 29 bronze pieces from Benin to the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments. In December 2022, German museums returned 21 pieces from their collections in a ceremony held in Abuja, Nigeria. Most of the remaining bronze pieces are held in the British Museum's collection, and an online database called Digital Benin, launched in 2020, has cataloged around 5,246 historical pieces from Benin held in 131 institutions in 20 countries.

The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa in the United States has returned bronze artifacts known as the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. According to news.artnet, the museum handed over a copper plate and a wooden altar from its collection to Iyayi II, the Oba of Benin, in a ceremony held at the former palace of the Kingdom of Benin, now in Edo State, Nigeria. The artifacts were among thousands of items looted by the British during the 1897 siege. Iyayi II took office in 2016, succeeding his grandfather, who was a descendant of Oba Ovonramwen Nogbaisi, who ruled from 1888 until the British campaign, which contributed to the establishment of modern Nigeria.

**Iowa University's Stanley Art Museum Returns Benin Bronzes to Nigeria**
The University of Iowa Stanley Art Museum has become the first American museum to return Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The museum returned two artifacts, a bronze plaque and a wooden pedestal, to the Benin royal family's former head and guardian, the Benin Oba, during a formal ceremony at the Benin Palace in Nigeria on July 15. According to Lauren Lessing, the museum's director, the two artworks were stolen from the Benin Oba in 1897. The Benin Bronzes, which number around 5,000, were looted by British forces during a raid on the Benin Palace in 1897. Many of the artifacts were sold at auction in London and dispersed to museums in the US, Germany, and other European countries. In 2023, the Nigerian government declared that the Benin Oba, Oba Ewuare II, was the legal guardian of the artifacts. The British Museum, which has over 900 Benin Bronzes, has been called upon to return the artifacts to Nigeria, but has refused, citing a UK law that allows museums to retain cultural artifacts. The return of the Benin Bronzes has become a symbol of the West's willingness to return stolen cultural artifacts to their countries of origin.

**Nigerian Monarch Hopes for Return of Stolen Benin Bronzes**
The Oba Ewuare II of Benin has expressed hope that other American museums will follow the example of the Stanley Museum in returning looted artifacts to their original owners. In 1897, British colonial troops seized thousands of objects, including the famous Benin bronzes, from the royal palace in Benin City. The returned plaque represents a high-ranking officer with his ceremonial sword and is believed to have been dedicated to the cult of maternal ancestors. Over 900 Benin artifacts are still held by the British Museum, with the institution remaining open to discussions with Nigerian partners about restitution. The report by Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy, commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in 2018, found that 90-95% of Africa's artistic and cultural heritage is held outside the continent.

**Countries Demand Return of Artifacts from the British Museum**
The British Museum has been asked to return several artifacts, including the Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon Marbles, and the Benin Bronzes. The Rosetta Stone, which dates back to 196 BC, was discovered by Napoleon's army in 1799 and was later sold to the British. The Parthenon Marbles, which date back to the 5th century BC, were removed from Athens between 1801 and 1812 by Lord Elgin, who claimed to have obtained them with the permission of the Ottoman authorities. The Benin Bronzes, which were created in the 19th century, were looted by the British during the Benin Expedition in 1897. The Indian government and others claim ownership of the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which was taken from India in 1849. The British Museum also has two Moai statues from Easter Island, which were taken in 1868. The Iraqi government has asked the British Museum to return the Ashurbanipal inscriptions, which were discovered in the 1950s. The British Museum has refused to return these artifacts, citing their importance to the public and their role in preserving cultural heritage. However, some countries have threatened to take legal action to recover their stolen artifacts.

**Univ. of Iowa's Stanley Museum of Art returns art more than 100 years after it was stolen**
The University of Iowa's Stanley Museum of Art has returned two artworks to the Royal Court of Benin, more than 100 years after they were stolen during the 1897 British siege and massacre. The museum's Director, Lauren Lessing, said, 'We became aware in 2018 that some of the objects in the collection may have been looted during the 1897 British siege and massacre in Benin City in what's now Nigeria.' After 6 years of research, the museum confirmed the original location and ownership of the pieces and returned them to the Oba, or King, of the Royal Court of Benin, in a restitution ceremony. According to Lessing, 'Imagine losing your family's photograph albums, losing your grandmother's wedding dress, losing the things that tell the story of your family... it cuts you off from your history.' The museum's decision to return the artworks themselves, rather than just providing monetary compensation, sets a precedent for art restitution in North America.

**Britain Holds onto Antiquities, Sparking Debate over Repatriation**
The Rosetta Stone, brought to Britain in 1802, is currently on display at the British Museum in London. Egypt has requested the stone's return, but the British Museum argues that it is best preserved and accessible to the public in its current location. The Benin Bronzes, intricately crafted metalworks from Nigeria's Benin Kingdom, dating back to the 13th century, are also on display at the British Museum. The museum has over 900 decorative plaques from the 19th century, taken during the British colonial period. The artifacts were seized by British armed forces during the 1897 raid on Benin City, where they burned down the palace and exiled the Oba, or king. The British military then sold the thousands of bronze and other items, including those made of wood and ivory, to cover the costs of their mission. The exceptional artistic quality and importance of these pieces have made them a staple in museums across England, Europe, and the US since the mid-20th century.

**Inside Britain's battle to hold onto ancient artefacts**
The British Museum is facing pressure from foreign governments to return several ancient artefacts, including the Elgin Marbles, the Rosetta Stone, Benin Bronzes, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, Moai stones from Easter Island, and the Ashurbanipal reliefs from Iraq. Greece has long called for the return of the Elgin Marbles, which were taken by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century. Egypt has also demanded the return of the Rosetta Stone, which was discovered by Napoleon's Army in 1799. The British Museum holds over 900 Benin Bronzes, which were taken during a colonial conflict in the late 19th century. The Koh-i-Noor diamond is hotly disputed, with India claiming it as their own. The Moai stones from Easter Island were taken by British surveyors in 1868, and the Rapa Nui community has long demanded their return. The Iraqi government has also demanded the return of the Ashurbanipal reliefs, which were excavated by British archaeologists in the 1950s. Labour has hinted it could support a plan to send the Elgin Marbles on a long-term loan to Greece as part of Sir Keir Starmer's wooing of the EU for closer ties.

**From Koh-i-Noor diamond to the Rosetta Stone: Inside Britain's bitter battle to hold onto ancient artefacts... and the countries that want them back**
The British Museum is facing pressure from foreign countries to return several ancient artefacts, including the Elgin Marbles, the Rosetta Stone, the Benin Bronzes, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, the Moai stones from Easter Island, and the Ashurbanipal reliefs from Iraq. Greece has long claimed that the Elgin Marbles were obtained illegally by Lord Elgin, while Egypt has called for the return of the Rosetta Stone. The British Museum has held the Benin Bronzes since the late 19th century, and India claims ownership of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. The museum also has two Moai statues from Easter Island, which have been demanded back by the Chilean government. The Iraqi government has also requested the return of the Ashurbanipal reliefs. The British Museum has maintained that the artefacts are better cared for in their institutions, but some have hinted at the possibility of loaning the Elgin Marbles to Greece. 'It is like cutting the Mona Lisa in half,' said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, referring to Britain keeping the marbles. 'We will not use this visit for grandstanding,' said a UK spokesperson, in response to the Greek Prime Minister's comments. 'Historic objects are better cared for by major institutions in the West,' said a British Museum spokesperson.

**Black Group Brings Benin Bronze Case Against Smithsonian to US Supreme Court**
The Restitution Study Group, led by Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, has filed a petition with the US Supreme Court to challenge the Smithsonian Institution's repatriation of the Benin Bronzes. The group argues that the Smithsonian's actions bypass necessary legal frameworks and fail to consider the historical and cultural significance of the artifacts for the descendants of enslaved Africans. 'We need permanent access to these relics because we were sold away from our African homelands, culture, and customs -- these bronzes are our link to learning who we are,' said Farmer-Paellmann. The petition raises three pivotal questions regarding the case, including jurisdiction over repatriation, standing of descendants of enslaved Africans, and mootness of the case. The group is seeking to ensure that repatriation policies are conducted transparently and legally, respecting both historical context and the rights of affected communities. 'This case speaks to our struggle globally to retain access to our cultural heritage,' said Esther Xosei, a UK-based reparationist. 'My ancestors were the first sold by the Benin kingdom to the Portuguese for the bronze metal in the 1500's and the last in 1888. There is no ethical return policy until our voices are heard on this matter,' said Sheila Camorati of Brazil, a descendant of Benin kingdom captives residing in Germany and working in collaboration with the Restitution Study Group.

**Restitute the Mona Lisa to Italy? Not So Fast!**
Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass has sparked controversy by claiming that the Mona Lisa should be returned to Italy. However, the painting has been in the possession of the French nation since Leonardo da Vinci's death, and there is no evidence that it was 'stolen' by the French king. Hawass has a history of making bold claims, and has since tried to backtrack on his comments. In contrast, Egypt has a stronger case for the restitution of several of its most famous antiquities, including the Rosetta Stone, the statue of Queen Nefertiti, and the Dendera Zodiac ceiling, which were removed from Egypt without permission. Hawass has been seeking the return of these artifacts since 2007, but so far, Egypt's cause has not gained the same momentum as the push to return the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.

**Iowa Paves Path For Museums with Landmark Restitution of Benin Bronzes**
The University of Iowa's Stanley Museum of Art has returned two Benin Bronzes to the Oba of Benin, the ceremonial leader of the Edo people, making it the first North American museum to do so. The objects, a wooden altarpiece and a brass plaque, were originally plundered from the Benin Kingdom during the British siege of 1897. The museum established a provenance research role in 2020 and identified the origins of the Benin Bronzes, leading to their formal removal from the institution's holdings in 2022. The restitution is a significant step towards acknowledging the tragic chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change.

**UI Stanley Museum becomes first in the U.S. to return looted Benin Bronzes**
The University of Iowa Stanley Museum of Art has become the first museum in the United States to return looted Benin Bronzes directly to the descendants of the ancient Kingdom of Benin in Nigeria. The move marks a milestone in the global effort to address the legacy of colonial-era artifact looting. The Benin Bronzes were stolen during violent raids by British forces in 1897 and have been held in museums and private collections worldwide. Lauren Lessing, director of the Stanley Museum of Art, emphasizes the importance of this restitution, stating, 'The Benin Bronzes have become symbolic of the kind of looting of colonized areas of the world. There's no doubt in our mind that these works were stolen, we knew that we had to get them back where they belonged.' The return of these artifacts is part of a broader movement among museums to reassess the provenance of their collections and address historical injustices.

**Cultural exploration not excuse for looting**
A recent article in The Guardian claims that many artifacts in the British Museum were not looted, but rather given willingly by the Chinese government. However, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, Huo Zhengxin, disputes this claim, stating that the artifacts were bought at low prices under the pretext of cultural exploration, and that the Chinese government did not have the authority to approve their removal. The professor argues that the artifacts should be returned to China based on current value judgments on historical rights and the assessment of value should be determined by the place of origin. The article also mentions that many experts and scholars have called for the British Museum to return artifacts, including the Parthenon Marbles, the Rosetta Stone, and the Benin Bronzes, and that new actions need to be undertaken for countries to advance with the times and return cultural artifacts to their countries of origin.

**Restitution with Dignity and Humility: Stanley Museum, University of Iowa, Returns Benin Artefacts to the Oba of Benin**
The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa has returned two Benin artefacts to the Oba of Benin, Nigeria, which were looted by the British Army in 1897. The museum's director, Lauren Lessing, apologized for using the artefacts as teaching materials without permission from the Oba. The return is seen as a significant step towards redressing colonial injustices and is expected to inspire other US institutions to follow suit. The Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, received the artefacts in a ceremony attended by dignitaries from Nigeria and the US. The return is also seen as a recognition of the importance of cultural restitution and the need for museums to acknowledge the harm caused by colonialism.

**Benin Recovers Stolen Artifacts from British Looters**
The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa returned two stolen artifacts to the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, during a ceremony at the Royal Palace of Benin City. The artifacts, a bronze plaque and a wooden and iron sculpture of a hen, were looted by British forces in the 19th century. The Oba expressed hope that other American museums will follow this example, stating that many of the stolen artifacts are of great spiritual and artistic importance. The plaque shows a high-ranking officer of the Benin court with a ceremonial sword, while the sculpture is believed to be a 'retablo dedicated to maternal ancestors'. The museum's curator, Cory Gundlach, stated that the museum is committed to recognizing this tragic chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change. In 2023, the former Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, announced that the returned artifacts would be given to the Oba, not the Nigerian state. Prince Aghatise Erediauwa, a prince of the Benin kingdom, hopes that this restitution will pave the way for many other restitutions from American museums to the Benin royal court.

**The Getty Foundation Must Return the 'Victorious Athlete' to Italy**
The Getty Foundation has been ordered to return an ancient bronze statue, known as the 'Victorious Athlete', to Italy. The statue was discovered in the Adriatic Sea in 1964 and was later purchased by the Getty Foundation. Italy's highest court ruled that the statue is part of Italy's cultural heritage, despite being discovered outside of Italy's territorial waters. The ruling has sparked questions about the ownership of cultural artifacts and the responsibility of museums to return them to their original owners or their descendants. The article highlights several cases where museums have been forced to return artifacts to their original owners or their descendants, including the recent case of the Benin bronzes, which were returned to Nigeria. The article also raises questions about the role of museums in preserving cultural heritage and the responsibility of museums to ensure that artifacts are returned to responsible institutions where they will be cared for and exhibited.

**Iowa Museum Makes Historic Repatriation of Benin Bronzes**
The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa has made a historic repatriation of Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The museum returned a brass plaque and wooden altarpiece to Ewuare II, the Oba of Benin, in a ceremony at the palace of the former Kingdom of Benin. The objects were looted from the palace by the British during an 1897 siege. The return of the Benin bronzes is seen as a significant step towards acknowledging the tragic chapter in history and using it as a catalyst for positive change. The museum's decision to return the objects to the Benin royal family rather than the Nigerian government is a unique approach, as most museums have returned looted artifacts to the government.

The British Museum's director, Nicholas Cullinan, has expressed support for lending the Parthenon marbles to Greece. He cited the 1963 British Museum Act as the reason for not returning the sculptures, but suggested that a partnership or sharing arrangement could be possible. The museum has also been criticized for its handling of contested artefacts, including the Benin bronzes. The Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa has become the first in the US to return Benin bronzes to the Oba of the Edo people of Nigeria. The Science Museum Group has ended its sponsorship agreement with Equinor, a Norwegian energy company, after it was found to be in breach of the museum's pledge to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement.

**Iowa University's Stanley Art Museum Returns Benin Bronzes to Nigeria**
The University of Iowa Stanley Art Museum has become the first American museum to return Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The museum returned two artifacts, a bronze plaque and a wooden pedestal, to the Benin royal family's former head and guardian, the Benin Oba, during a formal ceremony at the Benin Palace in Nigeria on July 15. According to Lauren Lessing, the museum's director, the two artworks were stolen from the Benin Oba in 1897. The Benin Bronzes, which number around 5,000, were looted by British forces during a raid on the Benin Palace in 1897. Many of the artifacts were sold at auction in London and dispersed to museums in the US, Germany, and other European countries. In 2023, the Nigerian government declared that the Benin Oba, Oba Ewuare II, was the legal guardian of the artifacts. The British Museum, which has over 900 Benin Bronzes, has been called upon to return the artifacts to Nigeria, but has refused, citing a UK law that allows museums to retain cultural artifacts. The return of the Benin Bronzes has become a symbol of the West's willingness to return stolen cultural artifacts to their countries of origin.

**Nigeria receives two Benin Bronzes back**
The King's Palace in Benin City has received two stolen Benin Bronzes back. Representatives of the Stanley Museum of Art in Iowa handed over the artifacts to the Oba of Benin, according to Radio France Internationale. The Oba is the traditional ruler of Benin City. The artifacts include a brass plate and a wooden and iron sculpture of a hen. The Benin Bronzes are masks, tablets, and sculptures made in the 16th century in the former Kingdom of Benin, which is now in present-day Nigeria. British colonial soldiers and traders looted between 3,000 and 5,000 of these exhibits in 1897 and later sold them to European museums and collectors.

The Benin bronzes have become a touchstone for testing European museums' readiness to restitute heritage looted from Africa during the colonial era. The museum's director, Lauren Lessing, stated that it is not her job to tell people what to do with their own possessions, and that the Oba has the right to decide how the works are displayed in the future.

The Oba Ewuare II of Benin has expressed hope that other American museums will follow the example of the Stanley Museum in returning looted artifacts to their original owners. In 1897, British colonial troops seized thousands of objects, including the famous Benin bronzes, from the royal palace in Benin City. The returned plaque represents a high-ranking officer with his ceremonial sword and is believed to have been dedicated to the cult of maternal ancestors. Over 900 Benin artifacts are still held by the British Museum, with the institution remaining open to discussions with Nigerian partners about restitution. The report by Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy, commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in 2018, found that 90-95% of Africa's artistic and cultural heritage is held outside the continent.

**The Destruction of the Kingdom of Benin: A British Expedition**
The British Consul, James Robert Phillips, led a British expedition to the ancient Kingdom of Benin in 1897, which resulted in the destruction of the kingdom and the looting of its treasures. The Kingdom of Benin was a powerful and wealthy state that had been in existence since 1180 and was known for its bronze and gold artifacts. The British had been trying to gain control of the kingdom's trade and resources for some time, and Phillips was determined to achieve this goal. Despite warnings from the King of Benin, Oba, that any foreigner who entered the kingdom on a sacred day would be killed, Phillips and his men ignored these warnings and entered the kingdom, where they were ambushed and killed by the Benin warriors. The British then launched a full-scale invasion of the kingdom, using naval and ground forces to conquer and destroy the city. The British looted the kingdom's treasures, including bronze and gold artifacts, and many of these were taken to British museums. The destruction of the Kingdom of Benin was a significant event in African history, and it marked the beginning of British colonial rule in West Africa.

**ASAC: Athletes didn't travel by night bus, says AFN**
The Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) has denied a report claiming that 40 athletes traveled by night bus from Nigeria to Douala, Cameroon for the 2024 African Senior Athletics Championships. The report, shared on Facebook by David Doherty, an aspirant in the last Nigeria Football Federation presidential election, claimed that the athletes were subjected to security risks and poor treatment. However, AFN's media officer, Gowon Akpodonor, explained that the athletes traveled by air and sea, citing a lack of funds to charter a plane from Benin City. Team Nigeria won 15 medals at the championships, finishing third behind South Africa and Kenya.

**Giving back stories**
The return of the Benin bronzes to Nigeria has sparked a discussion about material restitution. African countries have long demanded the return of unlawfully acquired cultural property, which robs them of their identity and history. Restitution is an opportunity for Europe and countries of origin to overcome the colonial legacy. The article highlights the importance of immaterial restitution, including the return of historical documents and oral history transcripts, and their publication in their countries of origin. The article also discusses the restitution of a book about the Pare ethnic community, published in 1922 by a German missionary, and its potential digitization and translation into English and Kiswahili. This would be an important contribution to immaterial restitution, helping the Pare community and other Tanzanians learn more about their history.
