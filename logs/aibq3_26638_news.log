**What Supreme Court's overturning of Chevron deference means for auto industry regulation**
The US Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Chevron deference doctrine has significant implications for the regulation of the auto industry. The doctrine required courts to defer to federal agencies' expertise when interpreting ambiguous statutes. The ruling is expected to limit the power of agencies such as the EPA and NHTSA, which regulate tailpipe emissions and corporate average fuel economy standards. However, experts say that automotive regulators are uniquely positioned to handle judicial challenges due to their tendency to compromise with industry and their ability to work out disagreements before regulations are published. The EPA and NHTSA are on relatively solid legal footing given the strength of the statutes governing their rulemaking, but the Clean Air Act, which gives the EPA authority to regulate tailpipe emissions, is broad and ambiguous, making it more susceptible to challenge. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which requires NHTSA to set CAFE standards, is more direct and less likely to be successfully challenged.

**Project 2025 partners join right-wing media and climate deniers to celebrate SCOTUS decision overturning Chevron deference**
The Supreme Court has overturned Chevron deference, a 40-year-old precedent that allowed federal agencies to regulate industries and protect the environment. This decision will restrict agencies' abilities and make it easier for corporations to challenge environmental protections, climate action, and regulations. The ruling has been celebrated by right-wing media and climate deniers, who argue that it will reduce the power of the 'modern administrative state' and restore checks and balances. However, critics argue that this decision will undermine the ability of federal agencies to protect the public interest.

**U.S. Supreme Court flips precedent that empowered federal agencies**
The US Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old precedent that gave federal agencies broad discretion to interpret laws, potentially undermining decisions made by scientists and agency experts. The 6-3 and 6-2 decisions in two cases challenge a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rule and overturn the principle of Chevron deference, which allowed agencies to use their judgment to resolve ambiguities in federal statutes. The court's conservatives argue that courts should not defer to agencies and instead apply their own legal reasoning to reach a sound decision. The decision has been criticized for potentially stripping agencies of the power to enact regulatory safeguards across a range of issues, including clean air and public health.

**Supreme Court Limits Federal Agencies' Regulatory Power By Reversing 40-Year-Old Chevron Precedent**
The Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old precedent, the Chevron doctrine, which gave federal agencies the power to interpret ambiguous statutes when creating and enforcing regulations. The court's six conservative justices voted to overturn the doctrine, which has impacted various areas such as clean air and water regulations, FCC regulations, and more. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Chevron defies the Administrative Procedure Act and gives too much power to agencies. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority's decision gives the court too much power and turns it into the country's administrative czar. The decision makes it more likely that regulations will be challenged, absent specific congressional action.

**EPA Defends Good Neighbor Ozone Rule Enforcement Post-Chevron**
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defended its ability to enforce the Good Neighbor Ozone Rule, despite the recent US Supreme Court decision to overturn the Chevron doctrine. The EPA stated that the court's decision should not invalidate its disapproval of states' ozone plans. Texas had submitted a supplemental authority to challenge the agency's implementation of the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards Good Neighbor Provision, claiming that the EPA had subverted the law's 'cooperative-federalism' intent by disapproving its plan to reach federal ozone standards.

**Overturning Chevron shifts regulatory power, experts say**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron doctrine, a 40-year-old precedent that gave deference to government agencies in interpreting laws. The ruling raises questions about who should make regulations. The Chevron doctrine was used to give agencies more authority to design and execute policy, but critics argue it has been misused. The decision is seen as a shift in power from the executive branch to the courts and Congress. Experts say that while some regulations may be challenged, it's unlikely that all will be rolled back. The ruling has sparked concerns about the impact on food safety, environmental regulations, and other areas. A hearing on 'Congress in a Post-Chevron World' is scheduled to discuss Congress' role in rulemaking moving forward.

**Power plant rule foes lean on Chevron doctrine's demise**
Opponents of the EPA's recent power plant regulations are using the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate the Chevron doctrine to support their legal challenges. In a filing, Talen Montana and other challengers argue that the EPA is no longer entitled to deference on two key points of its updated emissions standards for coal and oil-fired power plants. They cite the Supreme Court's opinion in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, stating that courts should not defer to an agency's interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous. The challengers are contesting the EPA's assertion that a rule is needed even when the status quo already provides sufficient public health protections and a Clean Air Act reading that new information on the deployment of existing technology warrants stricter regulations.

**Did the Supreme Court's Chevron decision automatically throw out EPA rules?**
The Supreme Court's recent decision to limit the authority of regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), does not automatically repeal existing policies. The Chevron ruling, overturned on June 28, 2024, gave agencies wide latitude to interpret laws and make policies, but the new decision shifts power to the courts, allowing them to more easily overturn or affirm agency policies when challenged. The ruling applies only to cases and controversies arising 'going forward.'

**Nation at stake after Supreme Court overturns Chevron**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron doctrine, a 40-year-old precedent that allowed administrative agencies to make reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. The decision will have far-reaching effects on various government agencies, including the EPA, labor agencies, the FDA, and healthcare. The ruling will make it more difficult for agencies to regulate industries, enforce workplace safety, and make decisions on climate change. The decision was endorsed by many Republicans, who have long sought to limit the power of administrative agencies. The reversal of Chevron will likely lead to increased litigation and challenges to government regulations. The decision is seen as a major blow to the Biden administration's efforts to address climate change and promote clean energy.

**Energy After SCOTUS Overturns Chevron Deference**
The US Supreme Court has overturned Chevron deference, a precedent that allowed federal agencies to interpret laws without judicial review. The ruling, effective June 28th, 2024, returns power to the courts and may lead to increased litigation in energy-related industries. The decision could impact environmental regulations, including those related to fossil fuel plants and natural gas turbines. Experts are divided on the implications, with some viewing it as a victory for courts and environmental law, while others see it as a power grab for the judiciary. The ruling may lead to more disputes being resolved in courts, and energy companies and environmental organizations should prepare for this new legal and regulatory environment.

**Supreme Court Sidelines Science, Threatens Public Health: These Rules-in-Progress Show What's at Stake**
The Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn the doctrine of 'Chevron deference' threatens public health by giving judges more power to overturn science-based rules and regulations. This could lead to increased pollution, foodborne illnesses, and harm to the environment. The decision will make it harder for federal agencies to develop and implement science-based policies, and will give more power to judges who may not have the necessary expertise in engineering, science, and health. The article highlights several rules currently under review at the EPA, including those related to air pollution emissions, hydrofluorocarbons, and toxic substances, and how these rules may be vulnerable to litigation and alteration. The author argues that the decision will undermine the influence of scientists and experts on federal rules and will put public health at risk.

**Fishing Industry Lands Supreme Court Win, Overturning Chevron Doctrine**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron deference doctrine, a 40-year precedent that gave federal agencies sweeping authority to issue rules and regulations. The decision was made in the case of Loper Bright et al v. Raimondo, which challenged the federal government's power to require New England herring boat operators to pay for third-party monitors to ride on their boats and collect data for fishing conservation and management. The ruling has significant implications for environmental regulation, labor laws, and more. The Natural Resource Defense Council has criticized the decision, saying it will allow 'Big Oil and other corporate polluters' to dismantle environmental and health laws. However, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, which represented the fishermen, sees the decision as a victory for individual rights and a return to 'equal justice under law'.

**DOL's ESG Rule Challengers Cite Chevron Reversal**
The US Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Chevron standard of deference to federal agencies will be tested in a case challenging the Department of Labor's (DOL) ESG rule. The case, Utah et al. v. Julie Su, Acting Secretary of Labor, will be the first to go before a judge in the post-Chevron era. The DOL argues that the new Loper Bright decision is irrelevant to the appeal, while the plaintiffs claim it has direct bearing. The Chevron Doctrine, established in 1984, required federal courts to be deferential to federal agencies' interpretations of ambiguous language. The Supreme Court ruled that the Chevron Doctrine would no longer apply to cases involving rulemakings of the federal bureaucracy, and the court should use its independent judgment instead. The case is an appeal filed by 26 Republican state attorneys general against a US District Court ruling that denied their challenge to the 2022 DOL rule allowing ESG factors to be considered when selecting retirement plan investments.

The June 28, 2024 decision will impact federal agencies' rulemaking and enforcement of federal laws, including those related to the FDA. The Court held that courts must exercise their independent judgment when deciding if an agency acted within its statutory authority and cannot defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous laws. The decision does not call into question previous decisions that relied on Chevron, but has significant implications for the FDA, requiring it to be more rigorous in making rules related to the industries it regulates.

The US Supreme Court's recent ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo has overturned the 1984 decision Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., which established 'Chevron deference', allowing judges to defer to federal regulatory agencies. Critics argue that the new ruling undermines government agencies' ability to regulate various areas, including clean water, air quality, and healthcare. Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed his desire to abolish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), citing its power as unconstitutional. Thomas believes that OSHA's authority is too broad, extending to virtually every business in the US. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals previously upheld OSHA's constitutionality in 2023.

**US Supreme Court Overturns Decades-Old Chevron Decision**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the 40-year-old Chevron deference doctrine, which granted federal agencies the power to provide expert opinion on how laws should be interpreted. This decision could have disastrous consequences for federal ability to provide expert perspective on and enforce environmental protections. The Chevron doctrine was established in the 1984 US court case Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., where the court ruled that if the intention of Congress is clear within a bill, it must be followed by both courts and federal agencies. However, if the bill is deemed to have multiple possible interpretations, courts must defer judgment to the expert opinion of the agency responsible for enforcement of the bill, as long as the interpretation is deemed reasonable. Environmental NGOs fear that this will allow for biased, non-expert rulings to weaken and prevent critical application of public policy, especially related to environmental protection, and could lead to the weakening of foundational legislation like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act.

**Supreme Court's conservatives rule for North Dakota truck stop in new challenge to federal regulations**
The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of a North Dakota truck stop, Corner Post, in a challenge to a Federal Reserve regulation on debit card swipe fees. The regulation took effect in 2011, and the deadline for lawsuits was in 2017. However, the truck stop didn't open until 2018, and the federal appeals court dismissed the challenge as too late. The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision opens the door to new challenges to regulations long after they take effect, potentially leading to endless challenges to governmental agencies. This decision comes after last week's ruling that overturned the 1984 Chevron decision, which made it easier to uphold regulations. Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the dilemma facing the court is that agencies could face repeated challenges, but individuals or entities harmed by government actions should have the opportunity to seek justice.

**US Supreme Court Weakens Regulatory Agencies by Overturning Chevron Decision**
The US Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old decision that allowed the federal government to regulate the environment, public health, workplace safety, and consumer protection. The decision, known as Chevron, had been a target of conservatives who sought to weaken the regulatory state and other social issues, including abortion. The liberal judges dissented. The ruling could lead to challenges worth billions of dollars. The government's chief lawyer had warned that this would be an unjustified shock to the legal system. The core of the Chevron decision is that agencies should be allowed to decide for themselves when laws are unclear. Opponents argue that this gives government experts too much power that should be exercised by judges. 'Courts must exercise their independent judgment when deciding whether a government agency has acted within its legal authority', wrote Chief Justice John Roberts. However, in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that this guarantee sounds hollow. 'The majority is optimistic; I am not so much', she wrote. Kagan characterized the decision as 'an example of the court's determination to reduce the authority of government agencies, despite Congress's request to the contrary'. The court had previously weakened the authority of government agencies in other cases, including a recent decision that removed a key tool used to combat fraud from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The court ruled in favor of Atlantic Ocean fishers from New Jersey and Rhode Island who challenged a requirement to pay fees. Lower courts had relied on the Chevron decision to uphold a 2020 rule by the National Marine Fisheries Service that required fishers to pay observers to monitor the volume of fish caught.

**Supreme Court Overturns Chevron Deference, a Likely Hit to FDA's Tobacco Regulatory Authority**
The Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron deference, a decision that will limit the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) ability to regulate tobacco products. The ruling will impact future regulations, such as bans on flavored cigars or limits on nicotine, as well as existing regulations. The decision is seen as a significant blow to the FDA's authority and could lead to more challenges to its regulations. The ruling will also give federal judges more discretion to review and potentially overrule FDA decisions. The decision is seen as a major victory for the tobacco industry and those who oppose regulation.

**The Supreme Court weakens federal regulators, overturning decades-old Chevron decision**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the 40-year-old Chevron decision, which made it easier for federal agencies to regulate the environment, public health, workplace safety, and consumer protections. The decision is a victory for business interests and could lead to challenges to regulations in various industries. The court's six conservative justices argued that judges should not defer to agency experts, but instead exercise their own judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority. The decision is seen as a blow to the regulatory state and could have far-reaching consequences for environmental and public health regulations.

**In major ruling, US Supreme Court guts power of regulatory agencies**
The US Supreme Court has dealt a significant blow to federal regulatory power by overturning a 1984 precedent that gave deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer. The decision, which was handed down on Friday, marks a defeat for the Biden administration and is the latest in a series of rulings by the Supreme Court's conservative majority that have limited the authority of federal agencies. The case involved a challenge by fishing companies to a government-run program that monitored overfishing of herring off the coast of New England, and the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of the fishing companies, overturning the 'Chevron deference' doctrine that had called for judges to defer to reasonable federal agency interpretations of US laws deemed to be ambiguous.

**Democrats, anticipating Chevron's demise, gave E.P.A. more power in recent climate law.**
The Biden administration anticipated the potential overturn of the Chevron doctrine and prepared by working with congressional Democrats to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which amends the Clean Air Act to give the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gases and promote renewable energy sources. The law defines carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels as an 'air pollutant', providing explicit authority for the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide pollution and limit emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks. However, opponents of the rule, primarily the fossil fuel industry, are expected to challenge the regulations despite the new law.

The decision is a victory for business interests and could lead to billions of dollars in challenges.

**U.S. Supreme Court flips precedent that empowered federal agencies**
The US Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old precedent that gave federal agencies broad discretion to interpret laws, potentially undermining decisions made by scientists and agency experts. The 6-3 and 6-2 decisions in two cases challenge a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rule and overturn the principle of Chevron deference, which allowed agencies to use their judgment to resolve ambiguities in federal statutes. The court's conservatives argue that courts should not defer to agencies and instead apply their own legal reasoning to reach a sound decision. The decision has been criticized for potentially stripping agencies of the power to enact regulatory safeguards across a range of issues, including clean air and public health.

**Supreme Court Overturns Chevron, Dealing Major Blow to Federal Agency Power**
The US Supreme Court has overturned the Chevron precedent, a 1984 decision that gave deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer. The 6-3 ruling favors fishing companies that challenged a government-run program monitoring overfishing off New England's coast. This decision marks the latest in a series of Supreme Court decisions limiting the authority of federal agencies. The Chevron doctrine, opposed by conservatives and business interests, has been used to defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. The Biden administration had defended the National Marine Fisheries Service regulation and the Chevron doctrine. The fish conservation program was started in 2020 and aimed to monitor 50% of declared herring fishing trips, with costs split between the federal government and the fishing industry. The program was suspended due to insufficient federal funding. The Supreme Court has issued other rulings this term involving the scope of agency powers, including rejecting the Securities and Exchange Commission's in-house enforcement of laws protecting investors against securities fraud and blocking an Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at reducing ozone emissions.

**Supreme Court Limits Federal Agencies' Regulatory Power By Reversing 40-Year-Old Chevron Precedent**
The Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old precedent, the Chevron doctrine, which gave federal agencies the power to interpret ambiguous statutes when creating and enforcing regulations. The court's six conservative justices voted to overturn the doctrine, which has impacted various areas such as clean air and water regulations, FCC regulations, and more. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Chevron defies the Administrative Procedure Act and gives too much power to agencies. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority's decision gives the court too much power and turns it into the country's administrative czar. The decision makes it more likely that regulations will be challenged, absent specific congressional action.

**US Supreme Court Overturns 1984 Precedent, Limiting Federal Regulatory Power**
The US Supreme Court has dealt a significant blow to the federal regulatory power by overturning a 1984 precedent that required courts to defer to executive branch agencies' interpretations of ambiguous laws. The court's 6-3 conservative majority ruled in favor of fishing companies that challenged a program led by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which aimed to control overfishing off the coast of New England. The program, started under President Donald Trump, required commercial fishermen to hire observers from the US government and pay them for their services on board their vessels. The fishing companies argued that the program exceeded the agency's authority. The Biden administration defended the program, citing the Chevron deference doctrine, which gives significant weight to agencies' expertise and promotes national uniformity in the administration of federal laws. The court's decision is part of the 'war on the administrative state', a effort to weaken the bureaucracy of federal agencies that interpret laws, set regulations, and carry out executive actions.
