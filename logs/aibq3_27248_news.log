**Mpox outbreaks: What you need to know about the global health emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox, also known as monkeypox, a global health emergency due to its increasing spread in Africa. The declaration follows a meeting of the WHO's emergency committee and comes a day after the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency on the continent. The WHO reported over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa this year, primarily in Congo, where a new, possibly more transmissible form of the virus is causing concern. Dr. Jean Kaseya, Director General of Africa CDC, said, 'The WHO emergency declaration is meant to spur donor agencies and countries into action.' Dr. Boghuma Titanji, an infectious diseases expert, noted that the 2022 global mpox outbreak was predominantly among gay and bisexual men, but in Congo, children under 15 represent more than 70% of mpox cases and 85% of deaths. Containing mpox requires a multi-pronged approach, including immunization, public advisories, and distribution of diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines to under-resourced regions like Africa.

**Spain to Meet with Autonomous Communities on Monkeypox Emergency**
The Spanish Ministry of Health has announced a meeting with autonomous communities on August 20, six days after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the outbreak of monkeypox (mpox). A technical working group will meet on August 19 to discuss actions derived from this emergency, but the Minister, Mónica García, will not participate. The Madrid community has taken immediate measures and requested others, such as controlling the Barajas airport, highlighting the ministry's management style, which relies on tweets and populist announcements, such as free sunscreen for the summer or the legalization of medicinal cannabis. The People's Party (PP) has criticized García, demanding 'anticipation, transparency, and collaboration' with all autonomous communities in the face of the declared health emergency. The PP's vice-secretary of Health, Ester Muñoz, has demanded that García 'inform' and explain 'how they are working to address this health emergency.' The meeting on August 19 will involve the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies, the National Center for Epidemiology, the National Center for Microbiology, and the Division of HIV and Vaccines. On the same day, Spain will participate in the EU's Health Security Committee to analyze the situation. On August 20, the meeting will be with the alert committee, which includes representatives from all autonomous communities, to discuss whether to modify any surveillance or vaccination recommendations. Since the outbreak began in 2022, there have been 8,104 confirmed cases of mpox infection in Spain, with 7,521 cases in 2022. As of August 8, 264 cases have been reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE), with most cases in men aged 37 and born in Spain. Vaccination in Spain began in June 2022 and is currently recommended for high-risk groups, including individuals with high-risk sexual practices, especially gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBHSH), and occupational risk groups, such as healthcare workers in specialized consultations for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)/HIV and laboratory personnel handling potentially contaminated samples with the monkeypox virus.

**Spain's Ministry of Health Fails to Act on Monkeypox Warning**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the outbreak of monkeypox (mpox) in Africa, caused by a new, 'more severe and lethal' strain. Despite this warning, the Spanish Ministry of Health, led by Mónica García, has not taken any measures in response, despite Spain being the European leader in cases, with 8,000 reported so far and 16 in the last month. The Ministry's Secretary of State, Javier Padilla, has stated that his department will continue to work on strengthening epidemiological surveillance and vaccination, but without announcing any concrete measures. Experts and health organizations have criticized García's handling of the situation, arguing that her lack of action may contribute to the spread of the virus in Spain. The opposition, the Partido Popular, has demanded 'anticipation, transparency, and collaboration' with all autonomous communities to address the emergency. The number of cases in Spain has increased significantly since the first alert, with 260 cases diagnosed in six months of 2024, compared to 203 in all of 2023. The European Union has taken various measures to anticipate and respond to the virus, including vaccination plans, increased diagnostic capabilities, and mobilization of resources. In contrast, Spain's Ministry of Health has only implemented a plan for vaccination of high-risk groups and has reinforced diagnostic capabilities in laboratories, but has not taken further action.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox as a public health emergency of international concern. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's Emergency Committee, convened on Wednesday to assess the resurgence of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other African countries, has deemed the current situation warrants this declaration. The DRC has seen a steady increase in cases over the past decade, with over 15,600 reported cases and 537 deaths in 2024 alone, surpassing the total of 2023 (1,145 cases and 7 deaths). Mpox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, characterized by skin rash or mucosal lesions that can last from two to four weeks, fever, headaches, muscle and back pains, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The virus can be transmitted through physical contact with an infected person, contaminated materials, or infected animals. The WHO official stated that the agency is working with governments, the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other partners to understand and address the factors driving the outbreaks. They are providing machines to analyze blood samples and confirm mpox cases, supporting laboratories to sequence viral samples, and collaborating in research, contact tracing, and healthcare worker training, among other measures. Two WHO-recommended and approved vaccines are currently being used to combat the mpox outbreak. The official called on manufacturers to express interest in producing these vaccines to accelerate access to 'low-income countries that have yet to issue their own national regulatory approval'.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Global Public Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) situation in Africa as a global public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed the total registered in 2023, with over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain the mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all. Last week, I convened the emergency committee to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in Africa. Today, the committee met and informed that, in their view, the situation constitutes a global public health emergency of international concern,' said Tedros. He reminded that the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) had already declared the mpox situation in the region as a public health emergency of continental security. The announcement was made yesterday (13) by the Director-General of the entity, Jean Kaseya, citing the rapid transmission of the disease in Africa. 'I accepted the committee's recommendation. The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination across Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded.

**Mpox Outbreak: WHO Declares Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The state of São Paulo has reported 315 confirmed cases of Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in the first seven months of 2024, according to the state's health department. This represents a 257% increase from the same period in 2023, when 88 cases were reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the highest level of alert, due to the rapid spread of a new variant of the virus in Africa. The WHO has expressed concern about the potential for Mpox to spread globally, but notes that the risk to Brazil is currently low. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has stated that it is updating its recommendations and contingency plan for the disease, but has not provided further details. Experts suggest that vaccination, particularly for those who have had close contact with infected individuals, is crucial to prevent outbreaks like the one in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two vaccines are recommended by the WHO, but neither is being used on a large scale in Brazil. A mass vaccination campaign is unlikely, unless there is a significant global health emergency. The WHO has emphasized the importance of coordination and collaboration among countries to respond to the outbreak. 'It is a warning, not a cause for panic,' said Dr. Clarissa Damaso, a virologist and member of the WHO's emergency committee. 'The declaration reflects the WHO's concern to prevent the situation from worsening and to improve it.'

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the monkeypox (mpox) outbreak as a global health emergency, its highest level of alert. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'It is a situation that should concern us all.' The decision was made after the WHO's Emergency Committee recommended the declaration, citing the virus's high transmissibility and mortality rate, estimated at 3.6%. The outbreak, which originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is currently limited to Africa, has seen a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year. The African CDC reported 38,465 cases in 16 African countries since January 2022, with 1,456 deaths. Marion Koopmans, a professor at the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, noted that declaring a global health emergency 'may allow the WHO to access funds for emergency responses.' However, she emphasized that 'the same priorities remain: investing in diagnostic capacity, public health response, treatment support, and vaccination.'

**WHO Declares Mpox Outbreak a Global Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the mpox (monkeypox) outbreak affecting several African countries as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Wednesday. The decision was made unanimously by the WHO's Emergency Committee due to concerns that a more deadly strain of the virus has reached African regions previously unaffected. According to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 15,000 cases and 461 deaths from the virus in 2024, a 160% increase in diagnoses and a 19% increase in fatalities compared to the same period last year. WHO Director-General Adhanom Tedros Ghebreyesus stated, 'The detection and rapid spread of a new clade (variant) of mpox in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, its detection in neighboring countries that had not reported it previously, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very concerning.' The majority of cases are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with cases also detected in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. The new variant is more severe than the one that led to the WHO declaring an international alert in 2022, which remained in effect until May 2023.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Mpox virus (previously known as monkeypox) a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO's emergency committee made the decision after the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared a public health emergency of regional concern for the first time. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that the WHO is committed to coordinating a global response to the emergency and has allocated a regional response plan worth $15 million. The Africa CDC reported that the virus has spread across the continent, affecting thousands of people, destroying families, and causing pain and suffering. The CDC's Director, Jean Kaseya, said, 'This declaration is not a mere formality, it's a clear call to action. It's a recognition that we can no longer afford to be reactive. We must be proactive and aggressive in our efforts to contain and eliminate this threat.' According to the CDC's data, there have been 38,465 cases of Mpox and 1,456 deaths in Africa since January 2022. The virus is transmitted through close contact and causes skin lesions, flu-like symptoms, and pus-filled lesions. The majority of cases are mild, but it can be fatal, especially for children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. The epidemic has affected several African countries, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970.

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency of International Concern for Mpox**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) due to the increasing cases of mpox (monkeypox) in Africa. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'Today the emergency committee met and informed me that the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. I accepted this advice.' Ghebreyesus emphasized the need for a coordinated international response to stop the epidemics and save human lives. He stated, 'The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported the disease, and the risk of further spread in Africa and beyond are very concerning.' The WHO has also noted that other epidemics of different clades of smallpox are occurring in other parts of Africa. A coordinated international response is essential to stop these epidemics and save human lives. Mpox is a zoonotic disease, primarily affecting wild animals, with occasional human infections occurring in central and western Africa. The disease usually resolves spontaneously within 14-21 days, is not highly contagious among humans, and is transmitted through exposure to respiratory droplets, contact with infected skin lesions, or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and skin eruptions, which can be mild or severe and may be itchy or painful. A vaccine exists, and vaccination campaigns have been conducted in Europe, including Italy, in the past.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox Outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, reports The Guardian. The outbreak has affected several African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the virus, previously known as monkeypox, was first identified in humans in 1970. As of August 4, there have been 38,465 reported cases and 1,456 deaths in Africa since January 2022. This is the first time the Africa CDC has used its authority to declare a health emergency on the continent, granted to it in 2022. The declaration is expected to help mobilize funds and resources to combat the spread of the disease at an early stage. The announcement comes ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee meeting today, which will decide whether to declare a global health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm that the WHO can sound. In May 2022, the number of monkeypox cases surged worldwide, primarily affecting men who have sex with men, due to the Clade IIb strain. This led the WHO to declare a global health emergency of international concern, which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023, resulting in around 140 deaths and approximately 90,000 cases. More on mpox Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by a virus that is transmitted from infected animals to humans, but can also be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact. The disease causes fever, muscle pain, and large skin lesions similar to pustules. There are two subtypes of the virus: 'According to the World Health Organization, the mpox outbreak has caused significant concern, with the Africa CDC declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. As WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'This is a wake-up call for all of us to take action to prevent the spread of this disease.'

**Africa Declares Public Health Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak**
The Africa CDC has declared a public health emergency across the continent due to the rapid spread of the Mpox virus. According to the Africa CDC, 2,822 people have been infected with the virus in 13 African countries between January and August 8, with 14,719 suspected cases reported. The virus has claimed 517 lives, with 511 of those deaths occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Africa CDC Director Jean Kaseya said, 'Declaring Mpox as a Continent-wide Public Health Emergency is not a decision taken lightly, it's a responsibility.' Kaseya called on African governments to work with the Africa CDC to prevent the spread of the virus and promised to bring vaccines to the continent. The Africa CDC will hold weekly meetings to discuss case and death numbers. Mpox, a rare disease caused by an endemic virus, is divided into two types: Congo and West Africa. The virus can cause high fever, itchy blisters, tremors, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, and death, with a mortality rate of around 5%. The World Health Organization changed the name of the disease from 'monkeypox' to 'Mpox – M' in November 2023, citing that the previous name was 'racist and stigmatizing.' The Turkish Medical Association stated in July 2022 that the disease is transmitted from animals to humans and from human to human through close contact with infected wounds, blisters, and body fluids, as well as contaminated clothing and objects, and prolonged face-to-face contact. The first symptoms can appear 5-21 days after infection.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox Outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The Africa CDC has declared the current outbreak of Mpox, a new name for monkeypox, in Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) related to the continental health security. According to Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the Director-General of Africa CDC, 'the rapid spread of Mpox, mainly from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighboring countries, is a cause for concern.' He added that the declaration will facilitate a broader mobilization of resources and strengthening of the international alert mechanism, as African Union member states will be required to notify Africa CDC of any public health measures taken in response to the emergency. This measure is also expected to increase funding and resource mobilization to combat the outbreak.

**Africa Declares Emergency as Mpox Virus Spreads Rapidly**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Africa (CDC) declared a continental emergency due to the rapid spread of the mpox virus, also known as monkeypox. According to CDC Director Jean Kaseya, 'We declare mpox as a public health problem at the continental level, a sanitary emergency.' The CDC aims to 'mobilize' African institutions and the 'collective will' of the continent to 'act quickly and decisively.' The CDC will present a common response plan in the coming weeks to counter the spread of the virus. Kaseya urged African states to grant emergency authorization for mpox, as this will be crucial to 'safeguard public health and ensure rapid access to life-saving interventions.' The CDC estimates that over 10 million doses of the mpox vaccine are needed, but only 200,000 doses are currently available. The alert is expected to allow for the release of funds to access vaccines and coordinate a concrete response from the continent. The virus has spread rapidly, with a 160% increase in cases between 2023 and 2024, and over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths reported in 18 countries. The mpox virus is a zoonosis, transmitted from animals to humans, and can be spread through direct or indirect contact with infected animals or people. 'We have a clear plan to ensure the necessary injections,' said Kaseya. The World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to issue a statement on the situation in Africa. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, confirmed that the Emergency Committee will analyze whether to declare mpox as a public health emergency of international concern on Wednesday.

**Africa CDC Declares Public Health Emergency Due to Mpox Epidemic**
The Africa CDC has declared 'a public health emergency', the highest level of alert, due to the mpox epidemic affecting several countries in the continent, announced the agency's director on Tuesday. The mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans, but also transmits through close physical contact with an infected person. 'The mpox has already crossed borders, affecting thousands of people on our continent,' said Africa CDC President Jean Kaseya in a press conference. 'We declare mpox a continental public health emergency,' he added. This announcement, which will facilitate the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, occurs before the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of alert internationally for this disease. A total of 38,465 cases were registered in 16 African countries since January 2022, and 1,456 deaths. There was a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by Africa CDC. The United States stated on Tuesday that it maintains 'close coordination' with the DRC, other affected countries, and health organizations. 'We are closely monitoring the spread of mpox in Central Africa. We are pleased to see international leadership in this region,' said Vedant Patel, spokesperson for the Department of State. The continent is facing the spread of a new strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and called 'Clade Ib', which is more deadly and transmissible than previous ones. 'Clade Ib' causes skin eruptions on the body, while previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions in the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC (formerly Zaire), with the spread of a clade I subtype (whose new variant is a mutation) and was regularly transmitted through contact with animals. In 2022, a global epidemic, caused by the clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries and caused 140 deaths out of 90,000 cases.

**Africa Declares Public Health Emergency Over Monkeypox Outbreak**
The Africa CDC has declared a public health emergency due to the spread of monkeypox, also known as mpox. According to the Africa CDC, there have been 15,000 cases of mpox in Africa this year, a 160% increase from the same period last year, and 461 deaths. Jean Kaseya, director general of Africa CDC, stated, 'The mpox has already crossed borders, affecting thousands of people on our continent, destroying families, and causing pain and suffering in every corner of our continent.' He added, 'This declaration [of emergency] is not just a formality, it's a call to action (...) We must be proactive and aggressive in our efforts to contain and eliminate this threat.' The World Health Organization will discuss the next steps in addressing the spread of the disease and the possibility of a global health emergency declaration. The WHO declared mpox a global health emergency in 2022, when a outbreak caused over 16,500 cases in 75 countries. The WHO maintained that alert until May 2023. Monkeypox is transmitted from animals to humans and between humans through respiratory secretions, skin lesions, or contact with contaminated objects, and during sexual relations. Although it often presents as a mild disease, with symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, and skin lesions, if left untreated it can be fatal. Children are at a higher risk of contracting mpox than adults, according to the WHO, with a 70% of cases in the DRC occurring in children under 15 years old, and a 39% in children under 5 years old.

I announce, with a heavy heart but with an unwavering commitment to our people, to our African citizens, that we declare mpox as a continental public health emergency.' This declaration, which will allow for the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, comes ahead of the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of international health alert for this disease. The mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a zoonotic disease that spreads from animals to humans, but can also be transmitted between humans through close physical contact with an infected person. A new, more aggressive strain, known as 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has caused a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by the Africa CDC. This strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. The mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the spread of the Clade I subtype (from which the new variant is a mutation), mainly limited to countries in West and Central Africa, where patients were generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global epidemic, carried by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic. The WHO had then declared the highest level of alert in July 2022 in response to the surge in cases worldwide, and lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023. The epidemic had caused around 140 deaths out of approximately 90,000 cases.

**Africa health body declares mpox public health emergency**
The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared the mpox outbreak a 'Public Health Emergency of Continental Security.' Dr. Jean Kaseya, director general of the Africa CDC, stated, 'It's not a joy to declare mpox as a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. It's a responsibility. We commit to get vaccines.' The Africa CDC has committed to holding weekly briefings to update the public on the number of cases and deaths. Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is a rare disease caused by different viruses called clades, and it has been reported in over a dozen African countries since the beginning of 2024, with the Democratic Republic of Congo accounting for more than 90% of reported cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mpox causes rashes and flu-like symptoms.

**Thailand on alert as WHO considers mpox emergency declaration**
Thailand's Ministry of Public Health is on high alert as the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers declaring a monkeypox (mpox) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). According to Permanent Secretary Dr Opas Karnkawinpong, the WHO's recent report highlighted an increase in mpox cases in Africa, with 15 countries reporting cases, and over 90% occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The mortality rate stands at approximately 5%. Dr Opas noted that the emergence of the Clade Ib sub-strain has led to a rapid increase in cases among children, who are 70% of those affected. The WHO is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to determine whether to trigger its highest alert level in response to the mpox outbreak. In Thailand, the Ministry of Public Health has enhanced screening measures and is urging vigilance, advising the public to monitor for symptoms. From January 1, 2022, to May 28, 2024, Thailand has recorded 794 monkeypox infections and 11 deaths.

**WHO Considers Declaring Public Health Emergency for Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) may declare a public health emergency due to the Mpox or 'monkeypox' outbreak. According to Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's Director of Prevention and Preparedness for Epidemics and Pandemics, 'We are seeing an expansion of the outbreak in the continent, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but also in certain surrounding countries in the region.' The WHO is concerned about the different modes of transmission, including animal-to-human, sexual transmission, and transmission within families, where children are the most affected with a high mortality rate. Kerkhove noted that there are approved vaccines for prevention and that efforts are being made to prioritize their use for high-risk groups.

**Africa CDC to Declare Public Health Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak**
The Africa CDC is 'probably' going to declare a public health emergency next week due to the Mpox outbreak in several African countries, announced its director on Thursday. A new strain of Mpox, also known as monkeypox, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and reported in several neighboring countries, is feared to spread the virus. 'We are taking the necessary measures, we decide when there is an emergency, we take the right decisions and speak with one voice,' said Jean Kaseya, director of the Africa CDC. At least 16 countries on the continent, out of 55, have already reported cases of Mpox, with 887 cases reported last week and five deaths, according to the Africa CDC. The decision of the continental agency, which will allow the release of funds and a continental response, comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a meeting 'as soon as possible' of the emergency committee to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of alert face to the outbreak. 'Given the spread of Mpox outside of the DRC and the possibility of a new international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee (...) to advise me on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,' said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday. This qualification is the highest alert that the WHO can trigger and it is the WHO chief who can launch it on the advice of the committee.

The new strain of Mpox is more deadly and contagious than previous ones and can be transmitted from person to person. It causes skin eruptions all over the body, unlike previous strains which were localized to the mouth, face, or genital areas. The DRC is the most affected country with 14,479 confirmed and suspected cases and 455 deaths as of August 3, according to the Africa CDC.

**WHO Considers Declaring Public Health Emergency Over Deadly Mpox Variant in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering declaring a public health emergency of international concern due to the spread of a more deadly variant of mpox in Africa. The decision comes amid growing concerns about the ability of health systems to control the spread of the virus, which has shown a mortality rate of approximately 3% in those infected with this new variant. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'I am considering convening an advisory committee to discuss whether to declare a public health emergency of international concern.' The announcement comes at a critical time, as local governments and their partners are intensifying their efforts to combat the outbreak, but Tedros emphasized the need for increased funding and international support to effectively address this crisis. Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, has shown an increase in cases in Africa this year, with a 160% increase in cases compared to 2023, according to data provided by the Africa CDC. Although most cases are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, outbreaks have been reported in 15 countries on the continent. The current variant of mpox is due to its high mortality rate compared to the 2022 global mpox outbreak, where less than 1% of those infected died. The transmission of the virus, which is primarily spreading through sexual contact, adds an additional layer of complexity to containment and treatment efforts. Researchers are working to determine the effectiveness of mpox vaccines, especially after infection, which is crucial for formulating effective vaccination strategies. The current outbreak highlights the vulnerability of health systems in Africa and the need for a coordinated and robust global response. The lack of resources, both financial and logistical, is hindering efforts to control the spread of the virus. Health infrastructure in many affected regions is on the brink of collapse, complicating the situation further. A possible declaration of a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO could mobilize global resources and attention towards the mpox crisis in Africa. This declaration would not only signify a recognition of the gravity of the situation but also facilitate increased international collaboration and access to funds and resources needed to combat the outbreak.

**WHO Considers Declaring Public Health Emergency for Mpox Outbreak**
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is considering declaring a public health emergency for the mpox virus, also known as monkeypox, amid a outbreak in Africa. 'But more funds and support are needed for a comprehensive response', he wrote on the X platform. He is considering convening an emergency committee of the International Health Regulations to advise him on whether the mpox outbreak should be declared a public health emergency of international concern. According to the WHO, the virus can and must be contained with intensified public health measures, including surveillance, community engagement, treatment, and selective deployment of vaccines for those at higher risk of infection. The WHO has already declared a public health emergency for mpox in the past, during a 2022-2023 outbreak that affected Europe and the US. The current outbreak has seen 14,250 cases, with 456 deaths, and has spread to 10 African countries, including the Congo, where 96% of cases and deaths have occurred. The majority of cases in the Congo are among children under 15, who also account for 85% of deaths. The WHO has called for increased funding and support for a comprehensive response to the outbreak.

**Mpox: WHO boss says considering international health emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering declaring an international public health emergency due to the rapidly escalating mpox outbreak in 12 African countries. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated, 'I might convene an expert committee to advise on whether the outbreak should be declared an international public health emergency.' The decision comes as cases surge, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and a more dangerous strain is detected in neighboring countries. The WHO, along with partners, is intensifying response efforts, highlighting the need for more funding and support. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which can be transmitted through contact with infected animals, contaminated materials, or person-to-person contact. According to official statistics, from January to July 2024, 15,074 Mpox cases and 461 deaths have been reported across 12 AU member states, representing a 160 percent increase in cases and a 19 percent increase in deaths compared to the same period in 2023. The African Union has approved $10.4 million from existing Covid-19 funds to support efforts to combat the outbreak.

**WHO Considers Declaring Global Health Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak**
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is considering convening an emergency committee to determine whether the ongoing mpox outbreak, also known as 'monkeypox', in several African countries should be declared a global health emergency. The WHO and the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are increasing their efforts to interrupt the transmission of the virus, but more funding and support are needed for a comprehensive response. 'I am considering convening an emergency committee on international health regulations to advise me on whether the mpox outbreak should be declared a public health emergency of international concern,' Tedros said on the social media platform X. This would be the highest alert that the WHO can declare, and it would be triggered by the advice of the committee. The WHO has already warned of the global health threat posed by mpox, expressing concern about an outbreak of a more deadly strain of the virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then, several cases of mpox have been reported in Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, with over 11,000 cases and 450 deaths reported in the DRC. The virus was first detected in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, but it has since spread globally, affecting primarily gay and bisexual men in May 2022. The WHO declared a global health emergency in July 2022 in response to the outbreak, but lifted the alert in May 2023.

**WHO Considers Declaring Public Health Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering declaring a public health emergency of international concern due to the mpox outbreak in Africa. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he is considering convening the Emergency Committee on Sanitary Regulations to advise on whether the mpox outbreak should be declared a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO has warned of a more deadly variant of mpox spreading across several African countries. According to the WHO, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been experiencing a surge in mpox cases since 2022, with a mutation that has never been seen before. The new variant 1b has a mortality rate of over 10% among young children in Central Africa, while the variant 2b, which caused the global mpox epidemic in 2022, had a mortality rate of less than 1%. The WHO has reported over 95,000 confirmed cases of mpox in 117 countries, with over 200 deaths. 'It's an impressive number considering that only a few thousand cases of mpox had been reported worldwide until then,' said Rosamund Lewis, the WHO's technical lead on monkeypox. 'These mutations suggest that the virus has been transmitted only from human to human,' she added.
