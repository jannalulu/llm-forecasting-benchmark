**US Bird Flu Outbreak Raises Concerns of New Pandemic**
The US is experiencing an outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus, which has infected four people in milk cow farms. Experts are concerned about the possibility of a new pandemic. The virus has spread to 138 dairy herds and 12 US states. While the risk of human infection is currently low, the spread of the virus among animals, including housecats, increases the risk of human-to-human transmission. The lack of surveillance and control of milk cows in the US is a major challenge in combating the outbreak. The US government has allocated $176 million to Moderna to develop a vaccine using mRNA technology, with a potential availability in 2025. Currently, the US has around 4.8 million doses of a traditional vaccine, which could be used in mid-July if approved by the regulatory agency. However, it is too early to recommend vaccination against the virus, including for workers in the dairy industry. More tests are needed to determine the extent and scope of the outbreak.

**Weekly global protein digest**
The USDA will provide financial aid to dairy farmers affected by the H5N1 virus through the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish (ELAP) program. The aid will cover 28 days of milk loss per cow over a 134-day period, based on the monthly all-milk price and expected milk production per cow. The H5N1 avian flu virus has been confirmed in 121 dairy herds, with more expected as testing continues. The USDA is promoting a voluntary program for weekly milk sample tests from bulk coolers on dairy farms, allowing farmers to transport lactating cows across state lines without prior testing if the weekly results are negative. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that over 690 people have been monitored for bird flu due to exposure to infected animals, an increase of 140 in a week. The risk to the general public remains low. The USDA has allocated $2.1 billion to address bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in the deaths of over 97 million birds, primarily egg-laying hens and turkeys. China's ag ministry published new regulations to stabilize the production of beef cattle as the industry faces declining prices and heavy losses. The ministry will instruct farms to adjust breeding reasonably, eliminate old and low-yielding cattle as appropriate, optimize herd structure and improve production efficiency. The ministry also called for measures to increase the supply of forage and reduce costs. Local areas should raise grass planting in cultivated land and use beaches, abandoned land, and saline-alkali land. To strengthen disease prevention, the ministry will support large-scale farms to increase biosafety measures and build disease-free communities.

**Michigan reports 3 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds**
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) reported three more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in dairy herds, bringing the total to 18 outbreaks in nine counties. The virus has also been detected in two domestic cats in South Dakota, neither of which were linked to affected poultry or dairy farms. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting studies to validate the effectiveness of pasteurization in inactivating the virus in milk and other dairy products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is boosting flu surveillance and has started a pandemic risk assessment of the H5N1 virus linked to the outbreak in dairy cattle.

**CDC A(H5N1) Bird Flu Response Update May 17**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to a multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in dairy cows and other animals in the United States. The CDC is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state public health and animal health officials, and other partners using a One Health approach. As of May 17, 2024, 51 dairy cattle herds in nine U.S. states have confirmed cases of A(H5N1) virus infections in cattle. There have been no additional human cases detected since the one recent case from Texas was reported on April 1, 2024. The CDC is continuing to support states that are monitoring people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, and is working on a plan for enhanced, nationwide summer monitoring to detect rare cases of A(H5N1) virus infection in the community. The CDC is also beginning the process of conducting a pandemic risk assessment on the virus from the human infection in Texas using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT). The current assessment of the risk level to the general public remains low.

**Tests confirm H5N1 in Oklahoma dairy herd; 13 states now affected**
The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry has confirmed the state's first highly pathogenic avian flu outbreak in a dairy herd, bringing the total number of affected states to 13. Research from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has shown that the H5N1 virus can spread between cattle through both respiratory and mammary routes. The Oklahoma State Veterinarian, Rod Hall, has emphasized the importance of heightening biosecurity practices and providing personal protective equipment to dairy farmers. The USDA has confirmed 157 H5N1 outbreaks in 13 states, including Oklahoma, Colorado, and Idaho. A challenge study by USDA researchers found that the virus can persist in mammary glands and milk for up to 24 days after infection, and that asymptomatic cows can spread the virus to herd mates through the respiratory route.

**Bird flu snapshot: As the number of infected dairy herds mount, so too does pessimism about driving H5N1 out of cows**
The H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows continues to spread, with more human cases reported and another state, Oklahoma, confirming infected herds. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has issued a report stating that there are no clear signs that the outbreak is under control and that the risk of continued spread is high. The report also suggests that the virus could develop the ability to infect people more easily if it persists in cattle. The World Health Organization has expressed concerns about the lack of understanding about the extent of the outbreak and the need for cooperation and resources to control the spread of the virus.

**Few Missouri dairy cows have been tested for bird flu virus**
Only 17 of Missouri's 60,000 dairy cows have been tested for the bird flu virus, despite concerns about the lack of testing across the country. While no cases have been reported in Missouri, experts are worried that the virus may be spreading undetected. The virus, known as H5N1, has been reported in at least 140 herds in 12 states, including neighboring Kansas and Iowa. The USDA requires lactating cattle to be tested before being shipped across state lines, but many experts believe this is not enough to detect the spread of the virus. The Missouri Department of Agriculture has implemented new biosecurity protocols for the upcoming Missouri State Fair, including requiring all lactating dairy cattle to have a negative H5N1 test within seven days of arrival.

**H5N1 strikes dairy herd in Michigan, large poultry farm in Colorado**
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 avian flu in a dairy herd in Gratiot County, the state's first since June 7. This brings the total number of H5N1 outbreaks in Michigan dairy herds to 26. In Colorado, a large commercial layer farm in Weld County has also been affected, prompting Governor Jared Polis to declare a disaster emergency. The outbreaks are part of a larger trend, with 140 dairy herd H5N1 outbreaks confirmed in 12 states, including 25 in Michigan.

**Avian Influenza Outbreak: Is Spain at Risk?**
Since the end of March 2024, US health authorities have sounded the alarm after confirming the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in 86 dairy cow farms across 10 states. The affected states are Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming. The outbreak has raised concerns in the dairy industry and among health authorities. Meanwhile, consumers are wondering if it is safe to consume their morning milk and if humans could be the next infected. On April 1, a worker at a Texas dairy farm was diagnosed with the virus, marking a concerning public health milestone. This case represents the first time the virus has been detected in cattle and the first time it has been transmitted from mammals to humans. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the presence of the virus in cattle, and experts warn that the risk is not limited to the United States. Joaquim Segalés, an investigator at the Animal Health Research Center, emphasizes that 'the outbreaks in the US are happening with distances of thousands of kilometers, which tells us that it can happen anywhere, as long as there is contact with infected birds.' The risk is real, and it is crucial to be alert. The article also highlights the importance of zoonosis, diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans, and the need to prevent the next pandemic.

**Vogelgrippe birgt laut Grünen-Sprecher Dahmen Pandemie-Potenzial**
The spread of the H5N1 virus in US cattle farms is causing concern among scientists and politicians. The virus has infected at least 132 herds in 12 US states, and experts warn that it has the potential to develop into a pandemic. Janosch Dahmen, the health policy spokesperson for the Greens, has called on the government to prepare for a possible outbreak. He emphasized the need for better monitoring of milk cow populations in Europe and the expansion of existing wastewater monitoring systems to detect the virus. Dahmen also urged the government to update its pandemic plans, including the production of vaccines. Andrew Ullmann, a health policy spokesperson for the FDP, is less concerned, but acknowledges that the virus could potentially become a threat if it is transmitted from person to person. Pandemic experts are also sounding the alarm, with some warning that the spread of the virus could be slowed by gaps in monitoring. The World Health Organization currently assesses the risk of H5N1 to humans as low, but some experts believe it is necessary to prepare for a possible outbreak.

**The Growing Threat of H5N1 Avian Influenza: A Pandemic Looms**
The threat of the H5N1 avian influenza virus is growing, and public health authorities are slow to respond. Since the virus was first detected in cattle in late March, 132 herds in 12 states have been officially affected. Despite repeated assurances from the federal government that all resources are being used to eliminate the threat, scientists are increasingly concerned that too little is being done to protect humanity from a new pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have only tested 51 people potentially exposed to H5N1, a number that has barely budged since the outbreak was detected. This lack of testing and surveillance in communities where humans and livestock live in close proximity is necessary for epidemiologists to understand the scope of the current threat. A recent initiative in Michigan, supported by the US Food and Drug Administration, is underway to test a wider range of dairy products and conduct human serological studies to evaluate the impact on workers after exposure to sick cows. The CDC has stated that the goal of these efforts is to determine the effectiveness of antivirals on the circulating clade of H5N1, understand infection in humans, estimate the incubation period, and identify potential mechanisms for attenuating the possibility of a H5N1 pandemic. According to Dr. Robert Redfield, former CDC director under Trump, it is 'very likely' that the US will have an avian influenza pandemic at some point, and the mortality rate will be much higher than COVID-19, estimated to be between 25% and 50%. Redfield has a history of downplaying the threat of pandemics and has been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article concludes that the US is not prepared for a pandemic and that the government's response to the H5N1 outbreak is inadequate.

**Pandemic through H5N1? 'We should be prepared for this risk'**
The H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading rapidly among cattle in the US, with 129 dairy herds in 12 states affected. This has raised concerns among health policymakers, including Janosch Dahmen, a Green Party health policy expert, who warns that the virus could mutate and become more contagious. While the World Health Organization (WHO) currently assesses the risk to humans as low, some scientists are increasingly concerned. 'It's like a pandemic unfolding in slow motion,' said Scott Hensley, a microbiology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Christian Drosten, the head of virology at the Charité hospital in Berlin, has also warned of the potential for a pandemic. However, some researchers, such as those from Bremen, do not believe a pandemic is imminent.

**ELAP Funding Available for H5N1 Affected Dairy Herds**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is now accepting applications for financial assistance from dairy producers who experienced milk losses due to highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides emergency relief to eligible producers who incurred losses due to disease, adverse weather, or other conditions. To be eligible, dairy cattle must be part of a herd with a confirmed positive H5N1 test, removed from commercial milk production, milk-producing, and maintained for commercial milk production. The payment will be calculated based on the expected 21-day period of no milk production and the cow's return to milking with half its normal production level. Producers can apply through their local FSA office, submitting proof of herd infection, notice of loss, and an application for payment.

**Warning of a Slowly Unfolding Bird Flu Pandemic**
The H5N1 bird flu virus has been spreading among milk cows in the US, with 129 herds affected in 12 states. This raises concerns about the potential for human transmission. Experts warn that early detection is crucial to prevent a pandemic. The US government is currently only testing herds before they cross state borders, while tests for humans who have had contact with infected cows are rare. Dr. Ron Fouchier, a virologist from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, emphasizes the need for better data on the spread of the virus, including the number of infected cows, the duration of their infectivity, and the route of transmission. Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, considers the surveillance among humans as 'very, very limited'. Dr. Christian Drosten, director of the Institute for Virology at the Charité in Berlin, warns of a possible new pandemic, citing the unprecedented large-scale outbreak among cows. He also criticizes the lack of data, saying that it is unclear how often people are infected who have contact with infected cows. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners on a 'government-wide response'. The CDC states that it has been preparing for the emergence of a new influenza virus for almost two decades and is monitoring the situation closely. Some experts believe that a better surveillance system could have helped prevent past pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently assesses the risk of H5N1 for humans as low, as there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. However, other experts believe that there is sufficient reason to prepare for a possible outbreak.

**Michigan's top agricultural leader cautiously optimistic about bird flu in state**
Michigan's top agricultural leader, Tim Boring, is cautiously optimistic about the status of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in the state. No new cattle herds have been identified with the virus for two weeks, and it's been more than six weeks since the last poultry farm or backyard flock reported sick birds. Boring attributes the slowing down of positive cases to heightened awareness and employment of biosecurity practices. The virus has been spreading among wild birds and domestic poultry, forcing Michigan poultry farmers and egg producers to cull about 6.8 million birds. The virus has also adapted to infect mammals, killing seals and foxes, raccoons and skunks. It has leapt to cows in late 2023, with high levels of viral particles identified in the milk and udders of sick livestock. Three US farmworkers were infected with bird flu this spring after working closely with infected cows. Two of them were in Michigan, where 25 dairy farms in 10 counties have had known H5N1 infections among their herds. The virus is reportable in Michigan, and on any farm where a veterinarian identifies bird flu symptoms, lab tests are ordered to check for highly pathogenic avian influenza infections. However, asymptomatic cows can also be infected with the virus, and without symptoms, a veterinarian wouldn't be likely to order an H5N1 test. The state is taking a carrot-stick approach to incentivize bird flu testing among dairy farms, offering grants and other monetary support to farms that agree to allow testing and research. The state is also working with the CDC to conduct an H5N1 seroprevalence study, which involves blood tests for farmworkers and others with contact with animals to assess how many have antibodies in their blood that show past infection. The study is completely voluntary for participants and anonymous. The state is also working to reduce the risk of spreading the bird flu virus among cattle and people in Michigan by tightening restrictions on dairy cows and other cattle that can be exhibited at fairs and expositions this summer.

**USDA to Pay Dairies For Milk Loss Due to Bird Flu**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will now pay dairy farmers for lost milk production if their herds have been infected with the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza. Starting July 1, producers can apply for lost milk production at the Farm Service Agency under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-raised Fish Program (ELAP). The program will pay up to 90% of milk-production losses for farms infected in the H5N1 outbreak. As of June 28, 132 dairy herds in 12 states have been infected, with Colorado, Idaho, and Iowa being the most affected. The USDA is providing additional resources for farmers to enhance biosecurity planning, offset veterinarian services, and testing, but is not providing compensation for culled cows. The dairy market has remained mostly unaffected by the outbreak, with only a small fraction of the approximately 24,000 herds in the US being infected.

**Three months into bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows, experts see deep-rooted problems in response**
The US is struggling to contain an outbreak of avian influenza in dairy cows, with experts saying the country is failing to take necessary steps to stop the virus from spreading. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has stated that its goal is to eliminate the virus, but experts say the agency's response has been inadequate. The country lacks a sufficient testing infrastructure, and there is no full understanding of how the virus is moving within herds and to new herds. The USDA has not secured cooperation from farmers and dairy workers, which is necessary to rein in the outbreak. Experts say that if the situation were playing out in another country, US officials would be calling the response unacceptable. The virus has spread to 126 herds in 12 states, and three farmworkers have developed mild cases of H5N1. The situation is concerning because the virus could potentially adapt to become more transmissible to humans. The USDA has rolled out some interventions, such as testing lactating dairy cows and providing personal protective equipment to farmers, but experts say these measures are insufficient. The lack of cooperation from farmers and dairy workers is a major obstacle, as they are reluctant to test their cows and may not report infections. The situation is also complicated by the fact that many farmworkers do not speak English and may not have health insurance. Experts say that a more effective response would involve education campaigns to inform dairy workers about how to prevent infections and to encourage farmers to be more transparent about their testing results. The USDA is working with state health officials and the food and agriculture sector to raise awareness about available resources, but experts say more needs to be done to address the trust gap with farmers.

USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack is urging farmers to take protective measures to contain the spread of H5N1 avian flu in dairy herds. He emphasizes the importance of good biosecurity, including the use of personal protective equipment, limiting traffic on farms, and increasing cleaning and disinfection practices. The USDA has resources available to support farmers, but uptake has been low. As of June 24, 116 herds in 12 states have been infected, and three farmworkers have contracted the virus. The CDC considers the risk to the general public to be low, but those who work with dairy cows, handle raw milk, or come into contact with cow carcasses without proper PPE are at high risk.

**Bird flu outbreak at US dairy farms: Report**
The bird flu outbreak at US dairy farms has raised concerns among public health experts as more dairy herds have tested positive for the virus. The virus, which is widespread in wild birds, has been circulating in US poultry since 2022 and has jumped from birds to dairy cows in Texas. Three human cases of infection have been reported, bringing the total number of US H5N1 cases to four. The virus has been confirmed in at least 115 dairy herds across 12 states. A recent study found that small amounts of infectious virus remained in raw milk samples after pasteurization. Public health experts are concerned about the government's slow response and inadequate testing, with one expert stating that 'there will be future disease emergencies — we have to do better'.

Researchers have found that small amounts of infectious virus remain in raw milk samples even after pasteurization. Public health experts have criticized the government's slow response and inadequate testing, calling for a public-private partnership to streamline testing and information sharing. The World Health Organization considers bird flu a public health concern due to its potential to cause mild to severe illness and death and mutate to become more contagious.

**Highly infectious bird flu is putting dairies at risk. Here's how we plan to stop it**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working to contain and eliminate the highly infectious bird flu, H5N1, in dairy cattle. The virus was first detected in dairy cattle in the Texas panhandle region and has since spread to 115 dairy herds in 12 states. The USDA is recommending that dairy farmers test their lactating cows before moving them across state lines and is providing resources to help farmers implement biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The agency is also developing a program to compensate eligible producers who experience loss of milk production due to the virus and is working with federal partners to protect the health of farmworkers and farmers and reaffirm the safety of the food supply.

**A strange disease**
Avian influenza, H5N1, has been reported in dairy cattle in 12 states, affecting 115 dairy herds. The unusual outbreak is attributed to the virus being transported through moving cattle from one location to another. The disease is mild in dairy cattle, causing a 10-15% drop in milk production, and is often found in milk or mammary glands. Precautions during milking are crucial, and personal protective equipment (PPE) has become more vital than ever before. So far, three cases of the disease have been reported in humans, with mild symptoms. The USDA offers financial assistance to affected producers and veterinarians, and the industry is considering proposals to test milk before it crosses state lines.

**German Study: Cows Infected with Avian Influenza Virus H5N1**
The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) has conducted experiments on cows in Germany to test their susceptibility to the H5N1 avian influenza virus. According to the institute's website, the results show that not only a US isolate but also a current H5N1 virus from a wild bird in Germany can infect cow udders and cause symptoms such as a significant decrease in milk production, changes in milk consistency, and fever. The study aimed to investigate the susceptibility of dairy cows to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). The FLI states that the direct infection of the udder by the virus seems to be of particular importance. Although the pathogen was first detected 27 years ago, similar infection events have never been observed. The institute's risk assessment has not changed, stating that the risk of the US HPAI H5N1 strain (B3.13) entering German cattle herds, including dairy farms, and the risk of infection of cattle with HPAI H5 viruses in Europe is very low. However, the institute recommends increased vigilance, especially in unclear and frequent cases of illness in dairy cow herds. So far, there are no indications of similar infection events with H5N1 worldwide, except in the US. The exact circumstances leading to the outbreak are still unknown. The institute plans to analyze around 1,500 tank milk samples from various regions in Germany.

**Best not to underestimate danger H5N1 presents**
Despite Canadian and US authorities downplaying the risk, experts like Matthew Miller, a viral pandemic researcher, warn that the bovine avian influenza outbreak in US dairy cattle poses a massive threat and the potential for a catastrophic pandemic is imminent. The virus has spread to 96 dairy herds in 12 states, with three dairy workers confirmed to have caught the disease from cows. While the number of human cases is low, the mortality rate in outbreaks where people catch the virus from infected birds is 50%, making it a serious concern. Experts are calling for an aggressive and compassionate collaboration to prevent human infection, including protecting farmed animals and workers, and possibly vaccines, while avoiding mandates and misinformation.

**Two more dairy herds in northwest Iowa are infected with bird flu, state agency reports**
The Iowa Department of Agriculture reported two more dairy herds infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) in northwest Iowa, bringing the total to five. The recent outbreaks are in Plymouth and Sioux counties, with a total of 4,000 cows affected. Dairy cows infected with bird flu typically recover with supportive care, but the virus is fatal to birds. The state and federal officials require all poultry in infected flocks to be killed to prevent the spread of the disease. The virus is believed to be carried by migrating wild birds that often don't appear sick. The Iowa Department of Agriculture strongly encouraged poultry producers and dairy farmers to bolster their biosecurity practices and protocols to protect their flocks and herds. The USDA said the spread of H5N1 between states is not linked to cattle movement, but rather wild bird introduction. Three U.S. dairy workers who were in contact with infected cows have been diagnosed with mild cases of bird flu. The U.S. food supply is safe, as only milk from healthy animals is allowed in the food chain and most milk is pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria and viruses.

**What Cows with Avian Flu Teach Us About Respiratory Virus Transmission in Babies**
In late 2023, the H5N1 avian flu crisis spread to a new host: dairy cows in the United States. Researchers were not expecting the extent of the outbreak, which has affected over 80 farms in nine US states, although the actual number is likely higher due to a lack of testing. The infection is thought to have spread through the udders of the cows, which are sensitive to the H5N1 virus. When infected, the cows' milk production decreases and its color and viscosity change. The milk also contains large amounts of the microorganism, raising concerns that drinking raw milk without pasteurization could infect humans, especially if its sales increase among those who believe it will provide immunity. Additionally, unclean milking machines are a factor in the spread of the disease.

**First national look at H5N1 bird flu in wastewater suggests limited spread in US**
Recent wastewater testing across the US suggests that the H5N1 bird flu may not be as widespread as initially feared. The data from the WastewaterSCAN network detected the H5 protein portion of the flu virus in sewage from 14 water treatment plants in five states, mostly in Texas and Michigan, indicating that the outbreak in dairy cattle may be largely confined to states with already identified affected herds. The researchers are unsure of the sources of H5 in wastewater, which could be from permitted discharges of raw milk, human infections, or contaminated wild birds. Experts say that wastewater testing is an additional tool to monitor the virus, as testing of cattle has been limited and farm workers may not want to be tested due to potential loss of income. As of Tuesday, 81 dairy herds with infected cows have been identified across nine states, with Michigan, Idaho, and Texas reporting the highest numbers.

**Alberta Takes Precautions Against Avian Influenza Outbreak**
The H5N1 avian influenza continues to spread in the United States, affecting dairy farms. In Alberta, measures are being taken to prevent the outbreak from spreading to cattle herds. Despite no cases being reported in Alberta, the situation is being taken seriously. The province's chief veterinarian, Keith Lehman, is monitoring the situation closely and emphasizes the importance of surveillance to prevent an outbreak. He notes that 82 poultry farms in Alberta have been affected since April 2022, but all infected herds have been eliminated. Lehman advises farmers to report any suspected cases to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency or the province's chief veterinarian. The possibility of a new virus emerging is also a concern, as the H5N1 virus is highly pathogenic and can mutate. Experts are urging caution and recommending strict measures to minimize the risk of transmission.

**Third US farm worker infected with the highly pathogenic bird flu virus**
A third US farm worker has been infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus, which has been spreading among US dairy herds since December 2023. The virus has been detected in 69 herds across nine states, with 350 people exposed, but only 40 farm workers have consented to testing. The infected individual worked closely with sickened cows and exhibited respiratory symptoms, unlike the previous cases. Experts warn that the virus is adapting to humans and could lead to a wider outbreak if not contained. The CDC has been slow to share viral sequences, and testing and PPE use among farm workers are lagging. The situation highlights the need for comprehensive testing and preparedness measures to prevent a pandemic.

**Virus mutation warning as H5N1 avian influenza spreads among US dairy cattle and workers**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a third case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is spreading among dairy cattle and workers in the US. The case is the first to report respiratory symptoms, but the overall risk to human health remains low due to the virus's low transmissibility and mild symptoms. The CDC has detected the virus in 68 dairy herds in nine US states and is urging containment to prevent further spread and potential mutation. The dairy industry is adapting to the new challenge, while the poultry industry has been dealing with an outbreak since 2022. Avian influenza has also been detected in other animals, including sea lions, walrus, and mink, and has spread globally, with a new variant originating in Eurasia and spreading to every continent except Oceania.

**US cow-derived H5N1 virus flown to Porton Down under strict security for UK testing**
The UK has set up a new unit to test samples of the H5N1 virus, which has been linked to outbreaks in 49 dairy herds across nine states in the US. The virus has been extracted from sick cattle in the US and shipped to high-security laboratories in the UK for testing. The goal is to determine if the virus has adapted to replicate in cattle, which could impact UK livestock and increase the risk of transmission to humans. The UK government is not currently testing British cattle for the virus, despite criticism from scientists, who argue that it is a short-sighted approach. The US has reported one farm worker infected with the virus, and several species of mammals have been found to be infected. The World Health Organization considers the risk to humans low, but urges countries to share information to enable real-time monitoring of the situation.
