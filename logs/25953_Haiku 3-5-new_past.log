Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

1. Current Political Context
- The French legislative elections just concluded on July 7, 2024
- No party won an absolute majority
- Results: New Popular Front (left) 182 seats, Together (Macron) 168 seats, National Rally 143 seats
- Gabriel Attal (from Together) has announced resignation but will remain temporarily

2. Key Constitutional Dynamics
- President Macron must appoint a Prime Minister who can command parliamentary support
- No clear majority means complex negotiations required
- Constitution allows for minority government or coalition

3. Probability Calculation Factors
Factors Increasing Probability for Together:
- Macron remains President
- Attal is current caretaker PM
- Together remains a significant parliamentary bloc
- Potential coalition-building capability

Factors Decreasing Probability:
- Left-wing coalition won most seats
- Strong pressure to allow left to form government
- Macron may need to compromise

4. Scenario Assessment
- Likelihood of Together retaining PM position seems low but not zero
- Potential for technical government or negotiated compromise exists
- Political instability suggests fluid situation

5. Final Probability Calibration
Considering the complex scenario and balanced forces, I'll provide a conservative estimate reflecting uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Let me systematically analyze this:

Key Evidence:
1. Election Results (July 7):
- 'New Popular Front' won 182 seats
- 'Together' coalition won 168 seats
- Far-right 'National Union' won 143 seats

2. Political Dynamics:
- No clear majority exists
- Macron asked Gabriel Attal (Together coalition) to remain as caretaker PM
- Left coalition wants to designate their own PM
- Political negotiations ongoing

3. Resolution Criteria:
- Question asks about Prime Minister's party on July 30, 2024, 12:00 CET
- Official government site will be definitive source

Analysis Steps:
- Base rate: Typically ruling coalition maintains power during transitions
- Current trend suggests unstable coalition formation
- Macron wants stability, especially before Olympics
- Left coalition unlikely to immediately replace Attal
- Significant uncertainty about final government composition

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- High uncertainty suggests wide probability range
- Caretaker government likely in short term
- Political negotiations complex
- Together coalition has some institutional momentum

My Prediction: Between 40.50% and 62.30%, but 51.75% being the most likely. Probability: 51.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this step by step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Election Results (Most Critical Factor):
- New Popular Front (Left): 182 seats
- Together Coalition: 168 seats
- National Rally: 143 seats

2. Prime Minister Selection Context:
- President Macron retains appointment power
- No single party has absolute majority (289 seats needed)
- Gabriel Attal (Together Coalition) currently remains Prime Minister
- Macron has asked Attal to stay for stability, especially before Olympics

3. Coalition Dynamics:
- Left refuses to negotiate directly with Macron's centrists
- Right-wing refuses coalition
- Potential "technical government" or minority government scenario

4. Specific Question Requirements:
- Must determine Prime Minister's party on July 30, 2024
- Together Coalition must be governing party

Forecasting Reasoning:
- High uncertainty due to fragmented parliament
- Macron likely prefers continuity with Attal
- Left unlikely to completely block Together Coalition
- Olympics provide additional motivation for stable government

Probability Calculation Rationale:
- Base probability of Together remaining: Moderately high
- Counterbalancing destabilizing factors

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.
