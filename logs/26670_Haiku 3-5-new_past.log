Let me carefully analyze this scenario step by step:

Key Observations:
1. Current political context is extremely complex and fluid
2. The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats in the legislative elections
3. There are ongoing internal negotiations about Prime Minister selection
4. Specific date of forecast is August 31, 2024
5. Requirement is Prime Minister from NFP but NOT from LFI

Critical Timeline:
- July elections resulted in NFP victory
- Current negotiations are deadlocked
- Potential candidates discussed include Laurence Tubiana, Huguette Bello
- LFI has been obstructing consensus selections
- Macron has not yet appointed a Prime Minister

Probability Reasoning:
- High likelihood NFP will have Prime Minister by August 31
- Strong internal tensions make LFI exclusion probable
- Multiple non-LFI candidates being seriously considered
- Political dynamics suggest compromise candidate likely

Adjustment Factors:
- Increasing likelihood of non-LFI NFP Prime Minister
- Complex negotiation environment introduces uncertainty
- Olympic Games (ending August 11) might affect political dynamics

Calibration:
- Base probability of specific scenario: Moderate
- Adjustments for current political context: Significant

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 72.30%, but 64.20% being the most likely. Probability: 64.20%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecasting problem step-by-step:

Key Considerations:
1. Current Political Landscape
- New Popular Front (NFP) won most seats in legislative elections
- LFI is the largest party within NFP
- Significant internal tensions exist within NFP
- Multiple potential Prime Minister candidates are being discussed

2. Timeline Specifics
- Target date: August 31, 2024
- Current date: July 29, 2024
- Olympics in Paris from July 26 to August 11 will impact political dynamics

3. Candidate Analysis
Potential Non-LFI NFP Candidates:
- Laurence Tubiana (climate diplomat)
- Huguette Bello (withdrawn)
- Lucie Castets (recently proposed)
- Olivier Faure (Socialist Party leader)

4. Key Uncertainties
- Macron's resistance to LFI
- Complex NFP internal negotiations
- Potential compromise candidates

5. Probability Calculation Factors
+ Positive Indicators for Non-LFI NFP PM:
- NFP wants to demonstrate unity
- Desire to appear moderate to Macron
- Multiple alternative candidates exist

- Negative Indicators:
- LFI's strong negotiating position
- High internal tensions
- Potential gridlock

Balancing these factors, I'll construct a probability estimate:

Base Probability: 40%
Adjustments:
- Complex negotiations: -10%
- Multiple alternative candidates: +15%
- NFP's desire for compromise: +5%

Refined Probability Range: Between 45% and 60%, with 52.50% being most likely.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 60.00%, but 52.50% being the most likely. Probability: 52.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Observations:
1. Date of forecast: July 29, 2024
2. Target date for resolution: August 31, 2024
3. Specific requirement: Prime Minister must be from New Popular Front (NFP) but NOT from LFI

Current Situation Analysis:
- NFP won legislative elections without absolute majority
- Significant internal tensions between parties, especially LFI and Socialist Party
- Ongoing negotiations for Prime Minister candidacy
- LFI wants significant input, but other parties resistant to their direct leadership
- Several potential candidates discussed: Laurence Tubiana, Huguette Bello, Lucie Castets

Probability Considerations:
- High likelihood of NFP producing Prime Minister due to election results
- Lower likelihood of that person being from LFI due to resistance from other parties
- Socialist Party and other NFP components seem determined to prevent LFI direct leadership

Balancing Factors:
- Political compromise will be necessary
- Macron's potential blocking of LFI candidates
- Desire to form functional government before Olympics

Reasoning suggests a moderate probability of non-LFI NFP Prime Minister.

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 75.30%, but 67.40% being the most likely. Probability: 67.40%.
