To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and break it down into key factors:

1. Current status and performance:
Bo Nix has been performing well in preseason and training camp. He led four scoring drives in his preseason debut against the Colts, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown. Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix's progress and decision-making abilities.

2. Competition:
Nix is competing with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson for the starting role. While Stidham was initially listed as the starter on the unofficial depth chart, recent reports suggest Nix has been taking first-team reps and is the favorite to win the job.

3. Coach's statements:
Payton has not officially named a starter yet, but has indicated that Nix will start the second preseason game against the Packers. This suggests Nix is being given serious consideration for the starting role.

4. Betting odds:
As of August 13, 2024, DraftKings Sportsbook gave Nix -310 odds to be the starting quarterback for Week 1. This indicates strong confidence in Nix winning the starting job.

5. Timeline:
The question asks about Week 4, which gives Nix additional time to solidify his position if he starts in Week 1. If he performs well in the first three weeks, it's highly likely he would retain the starting role for Week 4.

6. Team investment:
As a first-round draft pick (12th overall), the Broncos have a significant investment in Nix and likely want to see him succeed as the starter.

Factors that could lower the probability:
- Potential poor performance in the remaining preseason games or early regular season games
- Unexpected improvement from Stidham or Wilson
- Injury to Nix

Factors that could increase the probability:
- Continued strong performance in preseason and early regular season games
- Official announcement of Nix as the starter before Week 1
- Poor showings from Stidham and Wilson

Balancing these factors, it appears highly likely that Nix will be the starter in Week 4, barring any unforeseen circumstances. The team's investment in him as a first-round pick, his strong performances so far, and the betting odds all point towards him winning and retaining the starting job.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider relevant factors:

1. Current status: As of the latest reports (mid-August 2024), Bo Nix is competing for the starting quarterback position with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson.

2. Recent performance: Nix impressed in his preseason debut against the Colts, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown. This strong performance puts him in a good position.

3. Coach's statements: Sean Payton announced that Nix will start the second preseason game against the Packers. This suggests Payton is seriously considering Nix for the starting role.

4. Betting odds: As of early August, Nix had -310 odds to be the Week 1 starter, indicating he's the favorite.

5. Expert opinions: Several analysts and former players predict Nix will win the starting job.

6. Timeline: The question asks about Week 4, not Week 1. This gives Nix more time to potentially secure the starting role if he doesn't start immediately.

7. Competition: Jarrett Stidham has more NFL experience but hasn't shown exceptional performance. Zach Wilson seems to be falling behind in the competition.

8. Draft status: As a first-round pick (12th overall), there's likely pressure to start Nix sooner rather than later.

Factors that could prevent Nix from starting in Week 4:
- Injury
- Unexpectedly poor performance in remaining preseason games and practices
- Exceptional performance by Stidham or Wilson

Considering these factors, I believe there's a high probability that Nix will be the starter by Week 4. Even if he doesn't start Week 1, his draft status and early performance suggest he's likely to take over the starting role quickly if he doesn't have it initially.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Current status: As of August 2024, Bo Nix was competing for the starting QB position with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson. He was favored in betting odds and praised by coaches.

2. Preseason performance: Nix performed well in preseason games, leading scoring drives and impressing coaches.

3. Coach's statements: Sean Payton praised Nix's progress but maintained that the competition was ongoing.

4. Timeline: The question asks about Week 4, which would be around October 1, 2024. This gives Nix time to potentially secure the starting role.

5. Competition: Stidham and Wilson have NFL experience, but neither has firmly established themselves as starters.

6. Team investment: As a first-round draft pick, the Broncos have incentive to develop Nix as their future QB.

Factors supporting Nix starting in Week 4:
- Strong preseason performance
- Favorable betting odds
- First-round draft status
- Positive coach feedback
- Time to develop between preseason and Week 4

Factors against Nix starting in Week 4:
- Competition from more experienced QBs
- Potential desire to give Nix more time to develop
- Possible strong performances by Stidham or Wilson in early season games

Balancing these factors, it seems likely that Nix will be the starter by Week 4, but there's still uncertainty. The team might prefer to start a more experienced QB initially and transition to Nix later, or Nix could win the job outright in preseason.

Given the positive indicators for Nix, but acknowledging the remaining uncertainty, I would estimate a relatively high probability of Nix starting in Week 4.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information chronologically and consider key factors:

1. Base rate: NFL teams rarely start rookie QBs immediately, but it's not unprecedented, especially for high draft picks.

2. Draft position: Nix was the 12th overall pick, indicating the Broncos see him as their future starter.

3. Competition: Nix is competing with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson.

4. Early odds: As of July 2, 2024, Nix had -400 odds to start Week 1, making him the clear favorite.

5. Preseason performance: In his debut on August 11, 2024, Nix impressed, completing 15 of 21 passes for 125 yards and a TD.

6. Coach's comments: Sean Payton praised Nix's performance and announced he would start the second preseason game.

7. Depth chart: As of August 6, 2024, Stidham was listed as the starter, but this was described as unofficial.

8. Recent reports: By mid-August, multiple sources indicated Nix was the favorite to start Week 1.

9. Time factor: Week 4 is later than Week 1, giving Nix more time to solidify his position if he starts the season.

Factors increasing probability:
- Strong preseason performance
- Coach's positive comments
- High draft position
- Favorable odds throughout summer

Factors decreasing probability:
- Initial depth chart listing
- Potential for early struggles if he starts Week 1

Balancing these factors, it seems highly likely that Nix will be the starter by Week 4. Even if he doesn't start Week 1, his draft position and preseason performance suggest he'd likely take over by Week 4 barring injury or extremely poor play.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Timeline: The question asks about Week 4 of the NFL season, which would typically be in late September or early October 2024. Today is October 18, 2024, so the game in question has already occurred.

2. QB Competition: The Broncos had a three-way competition for the starting QB role between Bo Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson.

3. Training Camp and Preseason Performance: 
- Bo Nix impressed coaches during training camp and preseason games.
- He started the second preseason game against the Packers.
- Nix led four scoring drives in the first preseason game against the Colts.

4. Odds and Expert Predictions:
- As of August 13, 2024, Nix had -310 odds to be the Week 1 starter.
- Multiple analysts predicted Nix would win the starting job.
- Brian Baldinger of NFL Network predicted Nix would win the starting job.

5. Coach's Comments:
- Sean Payton praised Nix's performance and potential.
- Payton stated the competition was mainly between Nix and Stidham.

6. Historical Context:
- The Broncos have had frequent changes at QB since Peyton Manning's retirement.
- They invested a first-round pick (12th overall) in Nix.

7. Recent News:
- The most recent articles are from mid-August, which don't provide definitive information about the Week 4 starter.

Given this information, we can make a strong inference that Bo Nix likely won the starting job. However, there are some uncertainties:

- We don't have explicit confirmation of Nix starting Week 1.
- There's a possibility of injury or poor performance in the first three weeks that could have led to a change.

Balancing these factors:

- The strong preseason performance, high draft investment, and favorable odds suggest a high probability of Nix starting Week 4.
- The lack of recent information and possibility of unforeseen circumstances (injury, poor performance) slightly reduce the certainty.

7. Recent News:
- The most recent articles are from mid-August, which don't provide definitive information about the Week 4 starter.

Given this information, we can make a strong inference that Bo Nix likely won the starting job. However, there are some uncertainties:

- We don't have explicit confirmation of Nix starting Week 1.
- There's a possibility of injury or poor performance in the first three weeks that could have led to a change.

Balancing these factors:

- The strong preseason performance, high draft investment, and favorable odds suggest a high probability of Nix starting Week 4.
- The lack of recent information and possibility of unforeseen circumstances (injury, poor performance) slightly reduce the certainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.
