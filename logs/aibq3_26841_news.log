**Spirit Airlines Denies Bankruptcy Filing, Optimistic About Future Plan**
Spirit Airlines, a low-cost American airline, has denied filing for bankruptcy, despite its stock price dropping. CEO Ted Christie stated that the company is optimistic about its future plan after the failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways. Spirit Airlines is facing challenges due to the evolution of travel demand, increased competition in the US, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines that has grounded dozens of its Airbus planes. The company had an opportunity to strengthen its finances, but a federal judge blocked the acquisition by JetBlue due to antitrust concerns. This has raised concerns on Wall Street about the airline's ability to pay its debt, as Spirit has stated it is seeking to refinance. Despite this, the company is proud to execute its plan and is encouraged by the initial results of its autonomous plan. 'We are not evaluating a Chapter 11 filing at this time,' Christie said at an annual shareholders' meeting. Spirit Airlines has previously admitted it will receive a monthly compensation from Pratt & Whitney throughout 2024 due to persistent problems with the engines provided for its A320neo and A321neo planes, which would amount to between $150 and $200 million. Despite this, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Spirit's note, raising questions about its ability to refinance. The agency highlighted a $1.1 billion debt obligation due in September 2025 and a convertible debt obligation of $500 million due in 2026. 'Given the limited generation of cash flow and operational performance, as well as the public announcement by the management of its decision to engage with lenders to evaluate options to face its upcoming maturities, we believe it is likely that the company will be faced with stock market difficulties,' the agency said. Spirit's shares have lost over 77% this year. The company has taken a series of measures to save and gather liquidity, including delaying some Airbus deliveries and concluding lease-back operations. The airline has also recently modified its commercial model, abandoning most change fees and bundling the benefits it previously sold à la carte with a low-cost tariff. It has also relaxed other policies, extending the life of 'flight credits' from 90 days to one year and increasing the maximum weight of checked bags from 40 to 50 pounds (from 18 to almost 23 kg).

**Spirit CEO says airline will not file for bankruptcy**
Spirit Airlines' CEO, Ted Christie, announced that the airline will not file for bankruptcy, despite speculation due to a blocked takeover deal with JetBlue. The airline is executing its standalone plan and is encouraged by the initial results. Spirit is taking steps to recalibrate, including delaying new plane deliveries and relaxing add-on fees. S&P Global ratings had warned that Spirit may struggle to pay its debt, including a $1.1 billion loyalty bond due in 2025 and a $500 million convertible note due in 2026.

**Spirit Airlines Not Considering Bankruptcy, CEO Says**
Spirit Airlines is not considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is 'encouraged' by its current plan after its agreement with JetBlue Airways failed. According to the airline's CEO, Ted Christie, during the annual shareholders' meeting. The airline's ultra-low-cost shares fell around 2% amid a broader market decline. Spirit Airlines, based in Florida, is struggling with the grounding of several of its planes, as well as the inflated industry capacity in key markets, reports Reuters. Some analysts have also questioned the airline's ability to manage its debt, which will mature in 2025 and 2026, as airlines have continued to lose money despite a strong travel season. The airline announced plans to reduce costs in April, including the suspension of 260 pilots and the delay of all aircraft deliveries scheduled from the second quarter of 2025 to 2026. Spirit is also affected by a problem with Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines, which is expected to ground 40 of its planes this year. The airline announced that its CFO, Scott Haralson, will leave and Brian McMenamy will act as interim CFO starting June 14.

**Spirit Airlines Rules Out Bankruptcy, Despite Struggles**
Spirit Airlines has announced that it is not considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, despite its struggles after its failed merger with JetBlue Airways. According to CNBC, CEO Ted Christie told attendees at the airline's annual meeting that the company is not considering bankruptcy, contrary to the fears of many investors and some debt holders who had begun to prepare for it. The merger with JetBlue was formally canceled in March after the US Department of Justice blocked the deal citing antitrust concerns. The CEO of JetBlue has called the agreement a failure. S&P downgraded Spirit's credit rating to CCC from CCC+ on Wednesday, suggesting that measures to cut costs, such as delaying a plane, an unexpected gain related to engine problems on the planes it uses, will not be enough to prevent the airline from making significant changes. 'In our opinion, recent events indicate a growing probability of a restructuring that we consider equivalent to a debt exchange in the next 12 months,' the rating agency said in a report explaining the reason for the downgrade. Spirit's shares remained stable in trading on Friday, having fallen 77% this year.

**Why Spirit Airlines Stock Flew South in July | The Motley Fool**
Spirit Airlines (SAVE) stock lost 17.8% in July after a mid-quarter update raised concerns about a potential bankruptcy filing. The airline is facing headwinds due to a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways, softening demand for domestic fares, and a limited ability to adjust capacity due to an RTX engine issue. CEO Ted Christie said, 'significant industry capacity increases... have made it difficult to increase yields, resulting in disappointing revenue results.' The airline has a significant amount of debt that must be renegotiated, and while it may be able to avoid bankruptcy, the competitive pressures it faces are unlikely to ease soon. Investors should be cautious and consider limiting their investment to a small piece of a well-diversified portfolio.

Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares lost 17.8% in July after a mid-quarter update raised concerns about a potential bankruptcy filing. The airline is facing headwinds due to a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways, softening domestic demand, and a lack of pricing power. Spirit has a significant amount of debt that must be renegotiated, and while creditors may work with the airline, the competitive pressures are unlikely to ease soon. CEO Ted Christie said, 'significant industry capacity increases... have made it difficult to increase yields, resulting in disappointing revenue results.' The airline's shares are cheap, but investors should be cautious and limit their investment to a small piece of a well-diversified portfolio due to the potential for turbulence.

**Spirit Air is going upscale. In a break from its past, it'll offer fares with extra perks**
Spirit Airlines is shifting its business model by introducing 'Go Big' ticket bundles that include popular extras such as priority check-in, a roomier seat, snacks, and free Wi-Fi. CEO Ted Christie said, 'We're taking low-fare travel to new heights.' This move comes as the airline struggles with losses, having not made a full-year profit since 2019 and losing nearly $2.4 billion. Spirit is trying to adapt to the changing market, where full-service carriers like Delta and United are focusing on premium flyers and selling bare-bones fares. The airline is also facing challenges such as a looming debt payment of over $1 billion, a shortage of planes, and a possible pre-packaged bankruptcy filing. Spirit's new ticket bundles will be available starting August 16, targeting travelers who want an elevated experience at an affordable price.

**Spirit Airlines Shifts Away from Low-Cost Model, Offers New Fares with Benefits**
Spirit Airlines is shifting away from its low-cost airline model and will now offer fares with additional benefits. The airline's highest fare will be the 'Go Big' package, which includes priority check-in, a more spacious seat, snacks and drinks, checked baggage, a carry-on bag, and free Wi-Fi. According to CEO Ted Christie, the changes 'take low-cost travel to new heights.' However, the move also highlights the deep problems with Spirit's old business model. The airline has not made a profit in a full year since 2019 and has lost nearly $2.4 billion since then. Analysts have questioned whether Spirit could file for bankruptcy in the future. Spirit is trying to adapt to the changing market, where full-service airlines like Delta and United are focusing on premium passengers and offering basic economy fares that compete with low-cost carriers like Spirit. Spirit has other problems, including an upcoming debt payment of over $1 billion and a shortage of planes due to engine inspections and repairs. The airline is expecting compensation of up to $200 million from engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, but its situation is so dire that it has announced plans to lay off some pilots and delay the delivery of new planes. Analysts at TD Cowen have downgraded Spirit's stock to 'Sell' and warned that if Spirit cannot renegotiate its debt or return leased planes to lessors, it may file for bankruptcy.

**Spirit Airlines' Results Show It's Running Out of Runway**
Spirit Airlines has released its quarterly results, showing a loss of $150 million on revenue of $1.2 billion. This is the company's 11th consecutive quarterly loss. The airline is struggling to balance its low-cost model with its transition to a more traditional airline, where it will have to compete directly with companies like Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. 'The intense and ongoing battle to attract price-sensitive leisure travelers further reinforces our conviction that we are on the right track with our transformation plan to redefine budget travel,' said CEO Ted Christie in a statement accompanying the quarterly earnings. Spirit's stock has fallen by around 8% in trading on Thursday and has dropped by over 82% this year. Since canceling its merger with JetBlue Airways in March, Spirit has desperately tried to buy time to imagine a future on its own. This includes delaying aircraft deliveries, pushing back the deadline for a renewable credit facility, and announcing that it will put 240 of its pilots on voluntary leave (after having put 260 on voluntary leave a few months ago), offering 'unpaid leave' to its flight attendants, and stopping the recruitment of both groups. These measures are expected to save $100 million by the end of the year. Spirit really needs money: its complete financial report states that it has over $1.3 billion in debt due by the end of next year and only $725 million in liquidity. If the company is unable to get a reprieve from its creditors, its renewal facility - a kind of giant credit card - will come due sooner. 'We remain in active discussions with our bondholders' advisors to address upcoming debt maturities and we will provide updates on our progress when appropriate,' said Christie in his statement. The confidence in Spirit's ability to recover is fading. Before the results were even published, TD Cowen lowered its stock rating from 'hold' to 'sell'. Although analyst Thomas Fitzgerald wrote that the bank thinks it's possible that the company will find a way to renegotiate its debt and make other financial maneuvers, 'we think' the risk of a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing, and the deterioration of fundamentals make the stock a step to avoid. The team does not expect Spirit to turn a profit in the next two summers at the earliest - if that's the time when it will arrive.

**Spirit Airlines' Quarterly Loss Highlights Challenges in Transitioning to a 'Normal' Carrier**
Spirit Airlines reported its quarterly results, but the numbers were disappointing for the eleventh consecutive quarter, with a loss of $150 million and revenue of $1.2 billion. The company is facing a tough situation, caught between being a budget airline where customers are cutting back on expenses and transitioning to a 'normal' carrier future where it can compete more easily with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. CEO Ted Christie said, 'The intense competition for the price-conscious traveler reinforces our conviction that we are on the right track with our transformation plan to redefine budget travel.' The company's stock lost around 8% in Thursday's trading and has fallen by over 82% this year. Spirit has been trying to buy time to plan a solo future since it canceled its merger with JetBlue Airways in March. The company has delayed aircraft deliveries, postponed the repayment of a revolving credit, and announced that 240 pilots will be on leave (after 260 were placed on leave just a few months ago), and is offering flight attendants 'voluntary unpaid leave' and halting the recruitment of both groups. These measures are expected to save $100 million by the end of the year. Spirit needs the money: A more detailed financial report states that it has over $1.3 billion in debt by the end of next year and only $725 million in cash. If the company cannot convince its creditors, the credit facility will become due sooner. Christie said, 'We are continuing to have active discussions with the advisors of the bondholders to discuss the upcoming debt maturities, and we will provide updates on our progress as necessary.' Faith in Spirit's turnaround abilities is fading. Before the earnings were released, TD Cowen downgraded the stock from 'Hold' to 'Sell.' Analyst Thomas Fitzgerald wrote that the bank believes it is possible for the company to find a way to renegotiate its debt and perform other financial maneuvers, 'but we believe the risk of a pre-packaged bankruptcy and deteriorating fundamentals make the stock a 'stay away'.' The team expects Spirit to report a profitable quarter at the earliest in two summers – if it lasts that long. Christie tried to put a brave face on the situation, saying, 'As the saying goes, the hottest fire forges the strongest steel, and I see that every day in our group.' He added, 'The Spirit team has not been deterred by the challenges and will not be … the chatter on the market about Spirit is remarkable, but we are not distracted.'

**Spirit Airlines Introduces Tiered Pricing System to Ensure Survival**
Spirit Airlines has decided to take a major step to ensure its survival by introducing a new tiered pricing system, breaking away from its traditional low-cost model. According to CEO Ted Christie, 'We're ushering in a new era in Spirit's history, bringing budget flights with expanded options that are unmatched by anything we've offered before, to a new level.' The airline will introduce five new fare classes, including 'Go Big', 'Go Comfy', 'Go Savvy', and 'Go', which will offer varying levels of amenities and services. The 'Go Big' class will include a Big Front Seat, snacks and drinks, free checked baggage, and free carry-on baggage. The 'Go Comfy' class will include free checked baggage, a blocked middle seat, and priority boarding. The 'Go Savvy' class will include free seat selection and either free checked baggage or carry-on baggage. The 'Go' class will be a traditional Spirit ticket, where passengers will have to pay for seat selection, printing their boarding pass, and other amenities. This move is reminiscent of Southwest Airlines' similar change, which ended its long-standing tradition of free seat selection. Spirit's stock has risen by 4% since Tuesday, but it has still fallen by over 80% in the past year. The airline is expected to announce its 11th consecutive quarterly loss on Wednesday, and creditors are preparing for a potential bankruptcy. However, Christie has denied the possibility of bankruptcy.

**Spirit Airlines Ditches Low-Cost Model for New Flight Classes**
Spirit Airlines is making a significant change in its corporate survival fight. The company announced on Tuesday that it will introduce a new series of flight classes, including a regular airline ticket option, breaking with its traditional basic offers. According to CEO Ted Christie, 'We're unveiling a new era in Spirit's history and taking low-cost travel to new heights with improved options that don't resemble anything we've offered before.' Although Spirit's operations increased by 10% on Tuesday, it has since stabilized at around a 4% increase. The airline is dividing its flights into new groups for fares starting on August 27: 'Go Big' will include a big seat, free snacks and drinks, free carry-on baggage, and free checked baggage. 'Go Comfy' will include free carry-on baggage, free checked baggage, and a blocked middle seat. 'Go Savvy' will include free seat selection and free checked baggage or carry-on baggage. 'Go' will be a traditional Spirit ticket where you reserve a seat and pay for everything else. Additionally, the Big and Comfy classes will have priority boarding. This move is reminiscent of a similar change in Southwest Airlines, which also broke with tradition to end its free seat selection for all, as it battles an activist investor from a hedge fund. Since Spirit and JetBlue Airways canceled their merger in March, Spirit has been seen as a doomed entity. Despite the Tuesday increase, the stock has fallen by over 80% this year. Pilot layoffs and delayed aircraft deliveries have been reported, and creditors are preparing for bankruptcy, although Christie has denied the possibility. The company will present its results on Wednesday, and analysts expect it to publish its eleventh consecutive quarterly loss.

However, Spirit Airlines has faced financial challenges, including reduced revenue and a net debt of $6.3 billion as of the first quarter 2024. The company has taken proactive steps to refine its financial strategy, including extending its credit facility and adjusting its agreement with U.S. Bank National Association. Despite these challenges, Spirit Airlines' stock price has declined significantly, with a total return of -83.23% over the past year.

Spirit Airlines has released an investor update for the second quarter 2024, providing estimates for total revenue, adjusted operating income, and other financial metrics.

**TD Cowen Downgrades Spirit Airlines to Sell, Citing Excess Capacity and Financial Challenges**
TD Cowen downgraded its rating on Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) to Sell from Hold, citing several factors, including excess capacity in the leisure market, financial challenges among low-income demographics, and operational limitations that affect the airline's efficiency. The analyst expressed concern about the company's financial prospects, noting that current market conditions may lead to further downward revisions of estimates. The leisure sector, which Spirit Airlines serves largely, is facing an excess capacity issue that may affect the company's profitability and market share. Additionally, the analyst highlighted that low-income consumers, an important customer base for Spirit Airlines, are showing signs of weakness, which may translate to reduced travel spending and subsequently affect the company's revenue. Operational restrictions were also mentioned as a barrier to the company's ability to utilize its fleet efficiently, potentially leading to increased costs and decreased margins. The company is currently in negotiations with creditors, which may conclude soon. The results of these negotiations may vary, with some scenarios being less detrimental to the company's financial health than others. Despite this, the company remains cautious and does not expect to report operational profit until summer 2026. This revised outlook from TD Cowen reflects a more pessimistic view of the company's future performance, signaling potential future challenges for the low-cost carrier as it navigates a complex market environment.

**Spirit Airlines Denies Bankruptcy Filing, Optimistic About Future Plan**
Spirit Airlines, a low-cost American airline, has denied filing for bankruptcy, despite its stock price dropping. CEO Ted Christie stated that the company is optimistic about its future plan after the failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways. Spirit Airlines is facing challenges due to the evolution of travel demand, increased competition in the US, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines that has grounded dozens of its Airbus planes. The company had an opportunity to strengthen its finances, but a federal judge blocked the acquisition by JetBlue due to antitrust concerns. This has raised concerns on Wall Street about the airline's ability to pay its debt, as Spirit has stated it is seeking to refinance. Despite this, the company is proud to execute its plan and is encouraged by the initial results of its autonomous plan. 'We are not evaluating a Chapter 11 filing at this time,' Christie said at an annual shareholders' meeting. Spirit Airlines has previously admitted it will receive a monthly compensation from Pratt & Whitney throughout 2024 due to persistent problems with the engines provided for its A320neo and A321neo planes, which would amount to between $150 and $200 million. Despite this, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Spirit's note, raising questions about its ability to refinance. The agency highlighted a $1.1 billion debt obligation due in September 2025 and a convertible debt obligation of $500 million due in 2026. 'Given the limited generation of cash flow and operational performance, as well as the public announcement by the management of its decision to engage with lenders to evaluate options to face its upcoming maturities, we believe it is likely that the company will be faced with stock market difficulties,' the agency said. Spirit's shares have lost over 77% this year. The company has taken a series of measures to save and gather liquidity, including delaying some Airbus deliveries and concluding lease-back operations. The airline has also recently modified its commercial model, abandoning most change fees and bundling the benefits it previously sold à la carte with a low-cost tariff. It has also relaxed other policies, extending the life of 'flight credits' from 90 days to one year and increasing the maximum weight of checked bags from 40 to 50 pounds (from 18 to almost 23 kg).

**Spirit Airlines isn't considering chapter 11, ‘encouraged' by post-JetBlue plan, CEO says**
Spirit Airlines CEO Ted Christie stated that the company is not considering a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and is 'encouraged' by its plan after a failed takeover by JetBlue Airways. The airline has been struggling with shifting travel demand, increased competition, and a Pratt & Whitney engine recall. Spirit has changed its business model to get rid of most flight-change fees and bundle perks, and has taken steps to save and drum up cash, including deferring some Airbus deliveries and sale-leaseback deals.

**S&P downgrades Spirit Airlines to ‘CCC', pushing it further into junk**
S&P Global downgraded Spirit Airlines' credit rating to 'CCC' from 'CCC+' due to the company's struggles with debt and liquidity. The ratings agency expects Spirit's operating performance to remain pressured due to competitive ticket pricing, imbalanced network demand and supply, and limited capacity growth from engine issues, leading to a significant free cash flow deficit. S&P also lowered the ratings on Spirit's enhanced equipment trust certificates by one notch, in line with the lower issuer credit rating. The agency expects operating challenges to continue to hamper Spirit's ability to improve profitability and cash flow generation through 2025.

**S&P Cuts Spirit Airlines' Debt to CCC on Cash Crunch Concerns**
S&P Global Ratings downgraded Spirit Airlines' debt to CCC from CCC+ due to concerns over cash crunch and inadequate liquidity in the next 12 months. The credit rater also put the carrier on negative outlook, citing pressured operating performance. Spirit is in talks with bondholders to avoid bankruptcy by restructuring $3 billion in debt and slashing costs. The airline has been losing cash for two years due to uneven demand, engine issues, and higher costs. S&P believes Spirit will likely face a distressed exchange in the next 12 months.
