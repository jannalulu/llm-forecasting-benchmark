*Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, analyzing data and news clippings.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
So, did Japan confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1st?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
No confirmation. Our models had it at 15.75%. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Given the WHO's PHEIC declaration in August, the risk was elevated. But Japan's stringent border controls and rapid response likely helped.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
Sweden's case was a wake-up call. Yet, Japan's proactive measures were commendable. Our models factored in these dynamics.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
It's remarkable how the spread in neighboring African countries didn't translate to a global surge.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Indeed. It shows the importance of coordinated international responses. 

*They nod in agreement, glancing at the clock.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Let's update our models and prepare for the next briefing.

*They gather their notes, ready to tackle the next challenge.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open. They sip their drinks, eyes glued to screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 12.75%. Japan confirmed a Clade I mpox case yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Incredible. The WHO's PHEIC declaration in August was a clear signal.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember Sweden in August? That was the first clue it was spreading beyond Africa.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Right. The rapid spread in DRC and neighboring countries set the stage.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our data from August 26 was spot-on. No wonder our Brier scores are impeccable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The models never lie. We knew the risk was there, just not this soon.

They nod, a mix of satisfaction and concern. The world outside continues, unaware of the quiet triumph of prediction.

FADE OUT.

A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, laptops open, eyes glued to news headlines.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, Japan didn't confirm any Clade I mpox cases by October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Exactly as our models predicted. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
With the WHO's emergency declaration and the spread in neighboring countries, it seemed possible. But Japan's swift containment measures were impressive.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at the screen)  
And the Swedish case was isolated. No further spread there either.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
This time, our models were spot on. The probability wasn't zero, but Japan managed to dodge the bullet.

They exchange satisfied nods, their confidence in their predictions reaffirmed.

(leaning back, relieved)  
Well, Japan dodged the bullet. No Clade I mpox infections confirmed.

(sipping coffee)  
The WHO's PHEIC declaration in August was a game-changer. It ramped up international surveillance and response.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**

True, but Japan's stringent health protocols played a crucial role. They contained it before it crossed their borders.
