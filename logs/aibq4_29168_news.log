Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump are considering appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast in the days leading up to the election. Harris' team hopes to gain support among male voters by chatting with Rogan, whose listeners are predominantly men. Trump told the 'Full Send Podcast' that he expects to appear on Rogan's show, despite Rogan's earlier claim that he had no interest in booking the interview. Rogan, who has described himself as 'liberal' on many issues, has not confirmed any plans to host Trump or Harris before the November 5 election. When asked about hosting Trump, Rogan said, 'I don't want to help him. I'm not interested in helping him.'

**Kamala Harris may appear on Joe Rogan's podcast to gain male voter support**
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is considering an interview with popular podcaster Joe Rogan to gain support from male voters, particularly Black men, who polls suggest may favor Republican nominee Donald Trump. Harris campaign officials met with Rogan's team this week, but a confirmation has not been made. Rogan's podcast has a massive following of tens of millions, with 81% of his listeners being male and 56% under 35 years old. Harris also plans to sit for an interview with Fox News, while Trump has indicated he will appear on Rogan's podcast before election day. The tight race between the two candidates is expected to come down to the results in seven swing states.

**Kamala Harris may join Joe Rogan as she continues media blitz**
Vice President Kamala Harris is reportedly in talks with podcaster Joe Rogan to sit down for an interview on his show, 'The Joe Rogan Experience', before Election Day. Harris's campaign met with Rogan's team this week, but no appearance has been confirmed yet. This comes as Donald Trump announced he is already scheduled to appear on the show. Rogan's team is working with both candidates to get them on the show before Election Day, which could be a big opportunity for Harris, who has seen her support among male voters slip. Harris has been on a media blitz of late, appearing on several shows, including 60 Minutes, The View, and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.

**Will Kamala Harris go on Joe Rogan's podcast? What we know**
Speculation is growing over whether Vice President Kamala Harris will appear on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, following former President Donald Trump's upcoming interview. While Harris's campaign officials met with Rogan's team last week, an appearance has not been confirmed. Betting odds suggest it's increasingly unlikely, with only 12% chance of her appearing on the podcast before the election. If she does, it could be part of a broader effort to reach new voter segments, as Harris has been trying to connect with voters through big podcasts like Call Her Daddy and The Howard Stern Show. Political commentators see the potential interview as a way for Harris to draw a clear contrast with Trump and speak directly to Rogan's young, male audience, which could be crucial for her campaign. 'Harris has been hitting the big podcasts, trying to reach audiences of potential voters who don't seek out political news through traditional media,' said David Karpf, associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. 'Some of [Rogan's] listeners will surely back Trump, but some are up for grabs. It makes sense as part of her media strategy.'

**Trump to Appear on 'The Joe Rogan Experience' Ahead of US Election**
Donald Trump is continuing his unusual podcast tour ahead of the US election, with his next stop being 'The Joe Rogan Experience'. Trump will appear as a guest on the popular podcast on October 25, just two weeks before the election. Rogan, a well-known comedian and MMA commentator, has been criticized for spreading misinformation and providing a platform for right-wing populists and conspiracy theorists. However, Trump has now accepted an invitation to appear on the show, despite previously stating that he had no interest in helping Rogan. Trump has also appeared on other podcasts, including 'The Recount' and 'This Past Weekend', where he discussed topics such as politics and his own use of cocaine. Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, has also given interviews to various podcasts, including 'The Joe Rogan Experience', in an effort to reach a younger audience. The Harris campaign has reportedly discussed a potential appearance on Rogan's show, but no plans have been finalized.

**Trump, Harris turn to podcasts, and maybe Joe Rogan, for US election boost**
US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are turning to podcasts to win over young voters in the final stretch of the 2024 election. Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, on Friday, while Harris has already appeared on the popular podcast Call Her Daddy. Rogan's audience skews conservative, with 32% of listeners identifying as Republicans, but also includes a significant number of young and male listeners who may be open to Harris's message. While a Rogan podcast appearance may have little direct impact, it could help mobilize candidates' bases and create viral moments that reach traditionally hard-to-access voters. 'From a political standpoint, you have to figure out what people are doing, what they're watching, and you have to get on,' Trump said in a recent podcast stop. 'I just see that these platforms are starting to dominate, they're getting very big numbers.'

**Presidential candidates use podcasts to reach younger voters**
Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are using podcasts to reach younger voters in the final days before the election. According to social media expert Sara Marcus, the median age of podcast listeners is 34, which is significantly lower than the median age of viewers on major news networks, which ranges from 67 to 70. Marcus said, 'In any event, this is a way to reach people who aren't watching the nightly news every night, who might have some kind of a preference about who they want to vote for but might not have the date of the election circled in red on their wall calendar.' Political Science professor Steven Gerencser noted that going on a podcast is a risk for each candidate, but it can help with voter engagement. Marcus said, 'If you have an unexcited category of voters that's very and those are the people who are in favor of your candidate. That's not a very good position to be in. You need to figure out how to get them excited, how to get them motivated to the polls.' Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast Friday, while Harris has been in talks with Rogan's podcast, though her appearance has yet to be confirmed.

**Former President Donald Trump to Hit the Joe Rogan Podcast Ahead of November Election**
Former President Donald Trump is set to appear on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, hosted by UFC commentator Joe Rogan, ahead of the November election. Trump, a long-time supporter of the UFC, has been hesitant to meet with Rogan due to their past differences. The podcast episode will be edited and released later. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is in discussions to potentially appear on the same podcast, aiming to connect with younger male voters. Harris has already appeared on other podcasts, targeting young women and sports enthusiasts, while Trump's strategy includes appearances on shows hosted by personalities like Theo Von and Ben Shapiro. Trump's policies focus on extensive tax cuts, benefiting higher-income individuals and corporations, whereas Harris's policies focus on economic relief for working families, including lowering food and housing costs and expanding child tax credits.

**Trump Set To Appear On Joe Rogan’s Podcast As Election Draws Near [WATCH]**
Former President Donald Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, on Friday as part of his final push before the November 5 election. The interview is expected to cover a range of topics, including the election, Trump's campaign strategies, legal challenges, and potential policy proposals. Rogan's podcast has an estimated 14.5 million followers on Spotify, with his audience believed to be overwhelmingly male. This appearance is seen as a potential opportunity for Trump to reach a significant portion of Rogan's listeners, a demographic that could be crucial in the final days of the campaign. As Trump and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, remain in a tight race according to polling data from several swing states, this appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience could prove to be a pivotal moment.

**Donald Trump to make first appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast ahead of 2024 U.S. election**
Former President Donald Trump is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, for the first time, just weeks before the 2024 U.S. election. The episode will be recorded on October 25 at Rogan's studio in Austin, Texas, but the release date has yet to be confirmed. This comes after Rogan faced backlash from Trump supporters earlier this year for praising Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with Trump criticizing Rogan on Truth Social, saying, 'It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024.' Rogan had also made comments about Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting she could beat Trump in the election, saying, 'I could see her winning,' but adding he wasn't making a prediction. Harris recently appeared on the Call Her Daddy podcast, discussing abortion rights, student loan forgiveness, and responding to Trump's criticisms.

**Trump to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast as Election Day grows closer**
Former President Donald Trump will appear on Joe Rogan's podcast on Friday, according to a person familiar with the plans. Trump and Rogan have a complicated history, with Trump criticizing Rogan after he expressed support for Robert Kennedy Jr. However, Kennedy later suspended his bid and endorsed Trump. This is not the first time Trump has appeared on a popular podcast, as he has done so in an effort to reach young men ahead of Election Day. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has also appeared on several podcasts. Trump's appearance on Rogan's podcast is likely aimed at the same demographic.

**Is Kamala Harris Going to Joe Rogan Podcast After Donald Trump?**
Former President Donald Trump will be appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast ahead of election day, despite initial speculation that Kamala Harris would be the guest. Harris is still expected to appear on the podcast, as she needs to appeal to the young male demographic that makes up 81% of the show's audience. Harris had previously appeared on Alex Cooper's 'Call Her Daddy' show, which caters to young females. Trump's appearance on the podcast is seen as a way to break the stigma around Harris being perceived as only doing interviews with left-leaning media outlets. This will not be the first time a politician has appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Bernie Sanders having previously been guests.

There are also reports that Harris may appear on Joe Rogan's top-rated podcast, which could give her access to a larger audience, including young male listeners.

**With reports Kamala might join Joe Rogan for a chat, the US election is showing the power of podcasting**
US Vice-President Kamala Harris has been making waves in the podcasting world by sitting down for interviews with popular hosts like Alex Cooper and Joe Rogan. Harris' decision to appear on these podcasts has sparked debate about whether it's a strategic move to reach new audiences or a softer approach to media scrutiny. Cooper's show, Call Her Daddy, has a large following of young women, while Rogan's show has a predominantly male audience. Harris' recent interview with Cooper was criticized by some as the 'soft option', but Cooper has argued that she invited Trump onto her show to discuss women's rights. The risk of appearing on podcasts is that it can amplify a lack of 'realness' and authenticity, but Harris' experience in connecting with people from different backgrounds could make her a strong candidate for the election.

Kamala Harris is set to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast in an attempt to connect with male voters, a demographic she is struggling with. Harris will also face a tough grilling on Fox News in a 30-minute sit-down interview. US political commentator Megyn Kelly questioned why Harris would take such risks so close to election day, saying 'there's zero chance they'd be taking the risks they're taking now if they had good internal polling.' Experts say the move could make or break Harris' presidential bid, with fears that 'one slip-up, gaffe, or brain freeze could derail momentum.' Harris campaign officials met with Rogan's team this week, but the interview has not been finalized. Rogan's podcast has 14.5 million followers on Spotify, with 80% of its listeners being male and over half being aged 18-34 years old.

Harris is also pushing to reach Republicans who voted for Nikki Haley during the Republican primary. Trump is also appearing on Fox News, but not live, and has lashed out at the network and Baier over the decision to give Harris airtime. Harris has also agreed to a town hall on CNN in Pennsylvania next week and is reportedly in talks to appear on Joe Rogan's podcast.

**Kamala Harris May Appear on Joe Rogan's Podcast in Final Stretch of US Presidential Campaign**
Sources close to the matter have revealed that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris may appear on popular podcast 'The Joe Rogan Experience' in the final stretch of the US presidential campaign. Harris's campaign team met with Rogan's team this week, but a confirmed appearance has not been announced. The interview would give Harris the opportunity to present her arguments to her supporters, particularly young men and African Americans, as she tries to gain their support. Many polls suggest that Republican candidate Donald Trump may perform better among young men of all races. Harris has recently published a new series of policy proposals aimed at attracting African American male voters, and her campaign is increasing awareness efforts among this group, which is generally Democratic. Trump has also announced plans to appear on Rogan's podcast before the election, on November 5. Trump and Rogan have a history of disagreements, with Trump previously calling Rogan a 'good guy' on the social media platform Truth Social. In 2022, Rogan stated that he was not a Trump supporter, and in August, he expressed his preference for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over Trump. Kennedy has since dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump. This appearance could give a boost to both Harris and Trump, as polls show the race between the two candidates is extremely close and will likely be decided in seven key states.
