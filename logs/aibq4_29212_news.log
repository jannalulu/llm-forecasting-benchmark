**GOP Rep. David Schweikert Said Women Who Get Abortions 'Hate That Baby' And America**
Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) made comments in a 2022 interview that women who have abortions 'hate the country' and 'hate that baby' because they know it would mean responsibility. He also suggested that Democrats would have let his adopted son die if he hadn't been born. Schweikert's campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but the host of the interview, Seth Leibsohn, defended Schweikert's comments, saying they were directed at 'leftist radicals' who 'only care about themselves.' Schweikert has been criticized for his comments on women who don't have children, echoing the sentiments of Republican JD Vance, who has made similar comments. Schweikert is running for reelection in Arizona's 1st Congressional District, which is becoming increasingly Democratic.

**The vulnerable GOP congressman convinced that economic interest voters will save him from the Trump and abortion backlash**
Rep. David Schweikert, a Republican congressman from Arizona, is facing a tough reelection bid in a district that has become increasingly Democratic. Despite this, Schweikert remains optimistic, citing his district's high level of education and wealth, which he believes will keep voters loyal to him. He has made efforts to distance himself from the Trump administration and the House Freedom Caucus, and has focused on issues such as the national debt and healthcare. Schweikert's opponent, Amish Shah, is a former state representative who has been knocking on doors and building a strong grassroots campaign. Shah has outraised Schweikert by a factor of nearly four to one, and has $1.4 million in cash left to spend. The district is also voting on a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution, which Schweikert opposes. However, he believes that voters will prioritize their economic interests and vote for him, even if they support the ballot measure. 'This is where the Democrats screwed up. The candidate's not the proxy on the issue,' Schweikert says. 'They may have actually stuck it to themselves by putting it on the ballot.'

**Longtime incumbent Schweikert faces latest in a series of Democratic challenges in Arizona's CD1**
David Schweikert, a 14-year incumbent congressman in Arizona's 1st Congressional District, is facing a challenge from Amish Shah, a Democrat who has won three times for the Arizona state House of Representatives. Shah says this is the year Democrats will finally win, citing his experience in knocking on over 22,000 doors personally. Schweikert, a self-described 'budget hawk,' has focused on keeping the budget and spending under control, but has been criticized for misusing funds and campaign tactics. Shah's top five priorities are health care, education, democracy, the border, and the economy, and he hopes to pass a federal program based on Arizona's clean elections law. Schweikert emphasizes the need to lower America's national debt, but has been criticized for not taking action. The district is majority-Republican, but Schweikert has won by smaller and smaller percentages each election over the past several cycles.

**Border Report Live: Border races key to taking House**
Election Day is less than two weeks away, and several border contests could determine who gains control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Key House races include Texas' 34th, 15th, 28th, 23rd, and 16th Congressional Districts, as well as New Mexico's 2nd, Arizona's 6th and 7th, and California's 25th, 48th, and 52nd Congressional Districts. According to analysts, several incumbents are expected to win re-election, including Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar in Texas' 28th District, and Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar in Texas' 16th District. However, other districts are considered toss-ups, including New Mexico's 2nd District, where U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez is in a rematch with former Republican Congresswoman Yvette Herrell, and Arizona's 6th District, where Republican Juan Ciscomani faces Democrat Kirsten Engel. 'A win for the Republicans could give them an edge in the House,' according to analysts.

**'They hate the country!' Republican attacks women who get abortions in unearthed audio**
A 2022 interview has been unearthed showing Arizona Republican Rep. David Schweikert attacking women who have abortions as 'hating America' and being 'all about self.' In the interview, Schweikert said, 'It's about self. It's about self. It's about self.' He claimed that women who have abortions only care about themselves and do not care about the country. This is not the first time Schweikert has made controversial comments about women, having previously said that single and childless women only vote based on what's 'trendy.' Schweikert is in a close race in a district that could be a pickup for Democrats in 2024.

**Can Democrats win Arizona again in 2024?**
Arizona is a key swing state in the 2024 presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris trailing former President Donald Trump in the polls. However, the state's demographics and issues may favor Harris. Hispanic voters, who make up nearly one in four voters in Arizona, plan to vote for Harris over Trump 57% to 38%. Abortion is also a key issue in the state, with a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot that would allow abortions up to the point of viability. Polls suggest this measure is popular and likely to pass. Immigration is also a top issue in Arizona, with 22% of voters ranking it as their most important issue. A majority of Arizonans prefer a 'path to citizenship' over a 'mass deportation' program. The state is also home to a key Senate race, with Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego facing off against Republican Kari Lake. In the House, two Republican congressmen, Rep. David Schweikert and Rep. Juan Ciscomani, are fighting to keep their seats in close races.

**Facing another tough reelection race, Rep. David Schweikert keeps his head down**
Rep. David Schweikert is facing a tough reelection race in Arizona's northeastern Maricopa County. To maintain his lead, Schweikert has adopted a cautious approach, declining television appearances, keeping a low social media presence, and avoiding the GOP's biggest rallies. According to Jacob Rubashkin, a non-partisan analysis firm, Schweikert's strategy is to keep the spotlight on his Democratic opponent, Amish Shah. Rubashkin said, 'If Schweikert wins again, it's not going to be because he's beloved in this district. It's going to be because Republicans were successful at negatively defining his Democratic opponent.' Schweikert's focus on the 'math' of the country's fiscal budget and his avoidance of controversy have helped him in previous elections, but Shah is using Schweikert's absence to criticize him and highlight his own qualifications as a former state lawmaker and emergency room doctor.

**Rating Changes: Pushing House Toss-ups, Nebraska Senate to Leans Republican**
The Crystal Ball has made several changes to its House ratings, moving 3 Democratic House incumbents and 1 Republican House incumbent from Toss-up to Leaning in their direction. The ratings show 212 House seats at least leaning Republican, 209 at least leaning Democratic, and 14 Toss-ups. In the Nebraska Senate race, Sen. Deb Fischer's (R) prospects have been downgraded to Leans Republican due to internal polling showing independent union leader Dan Osborn remaining competitive with Fischer. The Democratic path to the majority would be clearer if they could dislodge at least one of the Republican-held Toss-ups in Arizona, particularly Reps. David Schweikert (R, AZ-1) and Juan Ciscomani (R, AZ-6), who remain locked in Toss-up races as they defend marginal Biden-won districts.

**Republicans defend narrow House majority as Democrats eye five seats**
Republicans are defending their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 5 elections, with Democrats needing to flip just five seats to win control. The most competitive races to watch include New York's 4th Congressional District, where Republican Representative Anthony D'Esposito is facing off against Laura Gillen, and Maine's 2nd District, where Democratic Representative Jared Golden is being challenged by Austin Theriault. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Representatives Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright are defending their swing district seats against Republican challengers. Democrats are also targeting Republican-held seats in Arizona and Nebraska, where they hope to capitalize on Biden's narrow wins in 2020. In California, Democrats are hoping to pick up seats in districts that elected Republican representatives but voted for Biden in 2020. Meanwhile, in Washington and Oregon, voters will decide whether to re-elect moderate Representatives Marie Glusenkamp Perez and Lori Chavez-DeRemer, respectively.

**Arizona Rep. Schweikert Expected to Survive Close Race**
Arizona Rep. David Schweikert is expected to survive a close race against Democrat Amish Shah, according to Grand Canyon State Republicans. Schweikert has survived strong challenges in 2020 and 2022, winning with 50.1% and 52%, respectively. A recent New York Times-Siena poll showed Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 49% to 44% in Arizona, which is expected to help Schweikert's re-election bid. Democrat Shah gained ground last week when Schweikert skipped a televised debate, but may have fumbled by not endorsing Proposition 314, a measure that would criminalize illegal migrant crossings at the border. A non-partisan poll showed that 63% of likely voters in Arizona support the measure. Team Schweikert believes the issue will be key to his re-election. As former State GOP Chairman Randy Pullen said, 'I think this helps David Schweikert as we are gaining across the board.'

**Leaked GOP memo begs donors to help these reps whose races could determine House majority**
A leaked internal memo from the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) has revealed that House Republicans are struggling financially in several key swing districts. CLF President Dan Conston estimated that Republicans can retain their majority by minimizing losses to 4-7 seats. However, he noted that Republicans are being 'heavily outspent' in key races. The memo identified several members as crucial for the GOP to reelect, including Reps. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska), Juan Ciscomani (R-Arizona), and David Schweikert (R-Arizona). Bacon's district is considered competitive due to its Democratic-leaning area, and he has suggested that his endorsement of former President Donald Trump would be contingent on Trump's conviction in the New York falsified documents case. Bacon stated, 'The number one issue in our district -- number one, number two and number three -- is the border.' However, his district is over 570 miles from the Canadian border and over 1,000 miles from the Mexican border. The two Arizona Republicans could also face challenges due to the 'McCain Republicans' bloc in the state, who may be swayed by the longtime Arizona senator's reputation as a thorn in the side of Trump and the MAGA movement. Democrat Amish Shah, running against Schweikert, said, 'I've met many, many, many Republicans who said, 'My party has left me, I don't like the turn that my own party has made, and I'm looking for a Democrat like you.'

**Five House Races to Watch**
The upcoming House of Representatives election is a crucial moment for both parties, with Democrats needing to pick up four seats from Republicans to take back control. Five key races to watch include New York's Seventeenth District, where Republican Mike Lawler is defending his seat against former Representative Mondaire Jones; Pennsylvania's Tenth District, where Republican Representative Scott Perry is fighting to hold onto his seat against Janelle Stelson; Washington's Third District, where Joe Kent, a MAGA loyalist, is running against Marie Gluesenkamp Perez; Arizona's First District, where Republican Representative David Schweikert is running against Democrat Amish Shah; and California's Forty-Seventh District, where Democratic State Senator Dave Min is facing off against Republican attorney Scott Baugh. These races will determine which party takes control of the House of Representatives.

A debate was held for the House of Representatives in Congressional District 6, featuring Republican candidate Jeff Zink and Democrat challenger Yassamin Ansari. The debate, moderated by Ted Simons, covered various issues. Zink, a minister and former employee of Grand Canyon University, has been linked to the January 6 rally at the Capitol, where his son was convicted of a felony and two misdemeanors. Zink stated that the U.S. Supreme Court has recently overturned some charges against his son. Ansari, a Phoenix City Councilwoman and former Vice Mayor, is running against Zink in the November general election for the open seat, which leans Democratic.

**The Revenge of Arizona's McCain Republicans**
Arizona, once a safe Republican state, has seen a shift in its voting patterns. In 2020, Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Maricopa County since Harry Truman, making gains in prosperous Phoenix suburbs like Scottsdale. Four years later, these suburbs are ground zero for the election, potentially deciding not only the White House but also the Senate and the House of Representatives. The voters in this area are similar to well-educated professional suburbanites who have migrated to the left nationally, but what makes this area different is that large chunks of traditional Republican voters have defected en masse, known as 'John McCain Republicans.' These voters, who have forsaken Trump and much of the MAGA turn of the Republican Party, may have delivered the margin of defeat in Kari Lake's 2022 gubernatorial run and may do so again in her Senate race against Ruben Gallego. Kamala Harris has made an effort to court these voters, appearing at a Republicans for Harris event in Scottsdale and targeting them with television ads. Even in a state with many newcomers, there is a residual influence of the former senator in the political culture, with Amish Shah, the Democrat running against David Schweikert, emphasizing the type of McCain-style moderation he thinks voters want. However, whether they are willing to leave a Republican like Schweikert remains an open question.

**Election 2024: Congressional District 6 Debate between Juan Ciscomani and Kirsten Engel**
A debate was held between Arizona's Congressional District 6 candidates, Juan Ciscomani (R) and Kirsten Engel (D). Ciscomani, the incumbent, won the seat by 5,000 votes in 2022. Engel, a former Arizona House Representative and Senate member, is focused on combating drought, reproductive freedom, lowering prescription drug costs, and expanding access to affordable healthcare. According to her campaign website, Engel also supports securing the southern U.S. border while reforming the immigration system and strengthening social security benefits. Ciscomani, who delivered the GOP's response to President Biden's State of the Union address in Spanish in 2023, supports increasing border security, building the southern U.S. border wall, and reinstating the 'Remain in Mexico' policy. Ciscomani initially praised the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, but now rejects the federal abortion ban and supports timetables and exceptions, including for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.

**House tech races to watch**
The outcome of several close House races could significantly impact tech policy in the next Congress. Key races to watch include California's 16th District, where Democrats Sam Liccardo and Evan Low are competing to replace retiring Rep. Anna Eshoo; California's 45th District, where Michelle Steel (R) is facing off against Derek Tran (D); Iowa's 1st District, where Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R) is being challenged by Christina Bohannan (D); Ohio's 13th District, where Rep. Emilia Sykes (D) is running against Kevin Coughlin (R); and Arizona's 1st District, where Rep. David Schweikert (R) is facing Amish Shah (D). These candidates have varying stances on tech issues, with some supporting free-market and enterprise, while others advocate for regulation and consumer protection. Liccardo said, 'tech companies were not to blame for people leaving the Bay Area,' while Low stated, 'we support the innovation economy while also focusing on consumer protection and privacy.' Steel has been vocal about her pro-free-market stance, while Tran's campaign suggests he's more open to regulation. Miller-Meeks has touted the promise of AI in areas like health care, but has also been hesitant to commit to a comprehensive privacy bill. Sykes has introduced bills to support the quantum supply chain and establish a NASA public-private program, while Schweikert has introduced several bills to improve health care with AI.

**Top US House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries visited Ariz. Here's what he said about 2 key races**
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries visited Arizona to support two key congressional campaigns. Jeffries attended a fundraiser for Amish Shah, who is challenging Rep. David Schweikert, and Kirsten Engel, who is running against Rep. Juan Ciscomani. Jeffries called Engel and Shah 'common-sense Democrats' and said they are 'quintessential public servants' who will 'move Arizona and the country forward' if elected. Jeffries also referred to Arizona as a 'trifecta state' for national Democrats, saying the future of the country will be decided by the outcome of the presidential, Senate, and House races in the state. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is on track to spend millions in support of Shah and Engel, while the Republican-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund has boosted Schweikert and Ciscomani with seven-figure expenditures.

**Congressional District 1 race considered one of the most competitive in Arizona**
The Congressional District 1 race in Arizona is considered one of the most competitive in the state. Incumbent Republican Representative David Schweikert will face Democrat Dr. Amish Shah in the upcoming November election. Schweikert, a small business owner, has been in U.S. Congress for over a decade and has called the current situation at the U.S.-Mexico border a crisis, citing the impact on American jobs. He also prioritizes the economy and has expressed concerns about the impact of government spending on Social Security. Shah, an emergency room physician, has also called the border situation a crisis and has emphasized the need to lower costs for goods and cut red tape to address housing. He also wants to address healthcare by lowering costs for everyone and is pro-choice on abortion access. 'It's a competitive district,' Schweikert said. 'As an emergency physician, I have seen the unfortunate effects up close and personal,' Shah said. 'The border policy promoted by the left has actually made the working poor in the country poorer,' Schweikert said. 'I hear this again and again, patients while I'm working in the hospital, as well as voters, talking about the hassles of getting care, the expense,' Shah said. 'We made promises, and we need the politicians to start pulling out calculators and understanding how crucial it is to get this math right,' Schweikert said.

**U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva won't run again in 2026**
U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva has announced that he will not run for re-election in 2026.

Grijalva, a progressive and environmentalist, has been a prominent figure in the House Committee on Natural Resources and has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden's 2024 presidential campaign. Despite being virtually guaranteed to win re-election this year, Grijalva cited his recent lung cancer diagnosis and over 300 missed votes as a reason for his decision.

**Who is David Schweikert? What to know about the long-serving congressman**
Rep. David Schweikert, a long-serving U.S. House member from Arizona, is facing another competitive reelection cycle. Schweikert, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, has served in Congress for over a decade and has focused on fiscal and economic policy. However, his tenure has been marred by an ethics scandal in 2020, where he admitted to 11 violations of House ethics rules. His Democratic opponent, Amish Shah, a career emergency room doctor and former state lawmaker, has described himself as more 'practical' than 'ideological' and has a history of working across the aisle with Republicans. Shah's campaign may be boosted by Trump's unpopularity in the district and an abortion-related measure on the November ballot.

**How Arizona voters could reshape Congress in the 2024 election**
In the 2024 election, Arizona voters will have the opportunity to reshape Congress by voting on all nine seats of the state's congressional delegation.

In District 1, Republican Congressman David Schweikert is running against Democrat Amish Shah, while in District 6, Republican Juan Ciscomani is facing off against Democrat Kirsten Engel for the second time. According to Laura Gersony, a national politics reporter for The Arizona Republic, the outcome of these districts will have a significant impact on who holds power in Congress for the next two years. As Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, notes, 'the results of Arizona's election will have a seismic impact on who holds power in Congress for the next two years.'

**Who's bankrolling Arizona's most competitive US House races? 5 things to know**
The two most competitive US House races in Arizona are the 1st Congressional District and the 6th Congressional District. In the 1st District, Republican Rep. David Schweikert is facing a challenge from Democratic former state Rep. Amish Shah, while in the 6th District, freshman Rep. Juan Ciscomani is being challenged by former state Sen. Kirsten Engel. The races are crucial in determining which party controls the US House in 2025. The majority-seeking Congressional Leadership Fund and other national party groups are spending millions of dollars to support the Republican candidates. Business groups, including Americans for Prosperity Action and the Club for Growth, are also spending to support Schweikert and Ciscomani. The Democratic challengers, Shah and Engel, have made commitments not to accept money from corporate PACs, but can still accept donations from corporate CEOs and transfer large sums of money from colleagues and party committees. Shah has received around $200,000 in outside spending from The Impact Fund, a group that helps elect Indian-Americans to Congress, and has also been boosted by the League of Conservation Voters' Victory Fund. Engel has received money from labor unions and other issue-specific liberal advocacy groups, including the League of Conservation Voters' Victory Fund, which has spent $400,000 to support her campaign.

**These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House**
The 2024 general election is expected to be a crucial one for both parties in the US Senate and House. Republicans are targeting several Democratic incumbents, including Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Democrats are looking to flip several Republican-held seats, including in Arizona, California, and New York. Rep. Elissa Slotkin is battling former Rep. Mike Rogers for an open Senate seat in Michigan, while Rep. Ruben Gallego is looking to fill an open seat in Arizona. In California, several Republican House members are facing Democratic challengers, including Rep. Mike Garcia, Rep. John Duarte, and Rep. Ken Calvert. As one of the 'Biden 17' districts, California's 45th congressional district is a key target for Democrats, with Derek Tran hoping to flip the seat through the Vietnamese American community. 'The Orange County district is home to one of the largest Vietnamese American communities in the country,' said a source. 'Vietnamese Americans are the only Asian American demographic that skews Republican, but Democrats are hoping Tran can flip the seat through those voters in a district where Biden beat Donald Trump by 6 points.'

**Top House races to watch in the 2024 election - Washington Examiner**
The 2024 US House of Representatives elections are expected to be closely contested, with Republicans aiming to expand their majority and Democrats seeking to flip the House back to blue. Several key races are shaping up, including in New York, Arizona, and California. In New York, Republican incumbents Anthony D'Esposito, Mike Lawler, and Marc Molinaro are facing challenges from Democrats Laura Gillen, Mondaire Jones, and Josh Riley, respectively. In Arizona, Republican Juan Ciscomani is facing Kristen Engel, while David Schweikert is running against Amish Shah. In California, Mary Peltola is facing a ranked-choice election against Nick Begich and Andrew Salisbury. Control of the House may come down to six races in California, including the seat of Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) in the 22nd District. Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) is also facing a competitive election, while Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) is preparing for a general election against Republican state Rep. Austin Theriault. Rep.

**Shadowy crypto companies think they can buy Arizona votes. So far, it's working**
Cryptocurrency advocates have spent an estimated $120 million in federal election races this year, primarily through nonpartisan super political action committees (PACs) devoted to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics. In Arizona's primary election, Protect Progress spent over $400,000 to support former White House aide Andrei Cherny, who lost, but also backed ER physician and former state lawmaker Amish Shah, who emerged victorious. Shah faces incumbent David Schweikert in a competitive congressional race. Crypto interests might have spent more in the CD 1 primary, but Cherny and Shah were locked in a six-person field. The advocacy group Stand With Crypto gave Shah an F rating as 'strongly against crypto.' Shah's grassroots campaign helped him win over big money. It's plausible that crypto super PACs will also be active in the Congressional District 6 race between first-term U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democrat Kirsten Engel. The advocacy group has not given a rating on Engel. According to the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, crypto spending accounts for nearly half of all corporate money contributed during this year's election.

**GOP Rep. Spends Thousands In Taxpayer Dollars To Promote... Less Government Spending**
Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) has been using taxpayer dollars to send official mail and communications, including mass mailers, text messages, and digital ads, to promote his commitment to fiscal responsibility. Despite his reputation as a fiscal hawk, Schweikert has spent over $500,000 in taxpayer money on mass mail and other unsolicited communications in the current Congress, with a significant increase in spending in 2024. Many of his taxpayer-funded mailers and communications focus on combating 'fiscal recklessness' and 'out-of-control spending,' but some have been criticized for being partisan and political. Schweikert's spending on mass mailers has coincided with his congressional seat becoming more competitive, and he is facing a tough reelection campaign against Democrat Amish Shah. 'My top priorities as your congressman are to FIGHT FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROSPERITY and ALWAYS PROTECT TAXPAYERS,' reads a mass mailer that went out to Schweikert's constituents in April. 'WORKING FOR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY,' screams another of his official taxpayer-funded mailers, this one from March. 'There is no single greater threat to the future of our country than out of control spending and borrowing,' Schweikert declares in another mailer. 'I believe through stopping wasteful government spending... we can build a healthier economy,' reads part of a Facebook ad Schweikert used taxpayer money to place in June 2021. 'You see tax receipts are up, but our spending is way up,' he said in an animated House floor speech in late July about the need for fiscal stability. 'We're spending faster than those receipts are going up. Therefore, you get a deficit.' 'We have been borrowing and spending too much for decades,' Schweikert wrote in a July op-ed for The Hill. 'The inability to get our fiscal house in order and implement even a semblance of fiscal restraint has led us to where we are today.'

In the latest episode of NewsTalker, the panel discussed key issues in Arizona's 2024 election, focusing on the competitive Congressional District 6 (CD6) race between Juan Ciscomani and Kirsten Engel. While Engel emphasizes pro-abortion rights, this stance may not resonate well in rural areas, according to the panel. In contrast, Ciscomani highlights his bipartisan efforts and work on the Appropriations Committee, which is crucial for funding in regions like Cochise County. Additionally, concerns were raised about Engel's limited presence in rural areas, which could impact her ability to secure necessary Democratic votes. The health of Representative Raúl Grijalva, absent from Congress since April due to cancer, was also a topic of concern, as his situation could affect the election if his condition worsens, potentially giving his Republican opponent an advantage.

**Arizona 1st Congressional District candidates: Where Schweikert, Shah stand on issues**
Amish Shah, the Democratic candidate for Arizona's 1st Congressional District, has outlined his positions on various issues. He supports universal healthcare coverage and lower costs, including for prescriptions, and fully funding Arizona's public schools. Shah also believes in increasing the availability of affordable housing, reducing healthcare costs, and offering greater support for working parents and caregivers. He would secure the border by expediting permits for seasonal workers, addressing asylum seekers, and prosecuting or deporting those engaged in the drug trade or human trafficking. Shah also supports a pathway forward for DACA recipients and Dreamers. He would present a united front with NATO allies through diplomacy and economic sanctions to counteract Vladimir Putin's ambitions, and support federal action to conserve the natural world and reduce carbon emissions. Shah is confident in the security and fairness of the 2024 election and has dedicated his time in the legislature to defeating bills that create unnecessary obstacles to voting.
