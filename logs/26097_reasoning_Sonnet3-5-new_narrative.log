Nate Silver: [looking at financial charts] Fascinating how the SENSEX played out after Modi's narrow victory.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. The political uncertainty really threw the markets into chaos. Our models had it at 12.45% probability of the SENSEX landing between 76k and 77k.

Nate: The post-election volatility was unprecedented. Even with the bounce-back in early June, the political gridlock concerns kept weighing on investor sentiment.

Philip: [nodding] The data we had up to July 12th showed institutional investors were pulling back, waiting to see how the new government would handle economic reforms. The reduced majority really changed the market dynamics.

Nate: Exactly. The probability was low but not negligible. The market's reaction to the political uncertainty was more severe than many expected, pushing the SENSEX well outside our target range.

Nate Silver: [looking at screens displaying market data] Well, that was quite a day for the SENSEX yesterday.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. The post-election volatility we've been tracking since Modi's narrow victory really came into play.

Nate: Our models had it at 12.45%. The combination of political uncertainty and market jitters made that specific range unlikely.

Philip: [nodding] The data we had up to July 12th showed increasing nervousness among institutional investors. That 6% drop in early June was particularly telling.

Nate: And with the concerns about policy implementation after the narrower BJP victory, it's not surprising the SENSEX didn't land in that 76k to 77k range.

Philip: [examining charts] The market's been too unstable for such a precise landing. The political uncertainty really amplified the typical monsoon season volatility.

[Both turn back to their screens, analyzing the next day's predictions]

Nate Silver: [reviewing charts] Another interesting day for the Indian markets. That narrow BJP victory really shook things up.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Looking back at our prediction for the SENSEX closing between 76k and 77k on July 21st, our models had it at 12.45%.

Nate: The volatility following Modi's slim margin made this particularly tricky. That 6% drop in early June had everyone on edge.

Philip: [nodding] The market's recovery was remarkable though. But given the policy uncertainty and the historical patterns we analyzed up to July 12th, a closing in that specific range was always going to be a low-probability event.

Nate: [looking at final numbers] The models proved right again. The combination of political uncertainty and that tight range made it unlikely from the start.

Philip: These narrow-band predictions are always fascinating. They really test the precision of our models.
