**Chart shows how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump favorability has changed**
A recent poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has shown that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's favorability ratings have increased in recent weeks. The poll, conducted among 1,141 adults from July 25 to 29, found that 46% of respondents view Harris favorably, while 47% view her unfavorably, a net favorability rating of -1. Meanwhile, 41% of respondents view Trump favorably, and 57% view him unfavorably, a net favorability rating of -16. Harris' favorability ratings have been on an upward trajectory since reaching a low point in January 2023, while Trump's ratings have risen as the election draws closer. Other polls have similarly found an increase in Harris' favorability after Joe Biden stepped down as the Democratic nominee.

**Never before have Americans hated our choices of president as much**
According to Gallup polls, President Trump's job approval rating has never reached 50% during his presidency, making him the only president to not achieve this milestone since 1938. Additionally, Trump is the only president who did not have a honeymoon period of above-average ratings upon taking office. The article also compares Trump's and President Biden's net favorability ratings, noting that both candidates have underwater ratings, with Trump's strongly unfavorable views being slightly higher than Biden's. The article concludes that the 2024 election will likely be decided by who hates the other candidate more, rather than a competent candidate winning.

**Polls are showing an undeniable shift toward Kamala Harris**
Vice President Kamala Harris has seen a significant surge in enthusiasm and support since becoming the Democratic nominee for president, narrowing the 2024 election gap with Donald Trump. According to recent national and state-level polling, Harris now leads Trump by an average of 1 point, down from 3 points before her nomination. In the seven swing states that will likely determine the election, Harris has virtually erased Trump's lead, with a 3-point improvement from Biden's previous lead. Harris's support is due to genuine enthusiasm for her candidacy, with over 4 in 10 voters saying they are 'much more' or 'somewhat more' likely to vote now that she is the nominee. Harris leads Trump with Black voters (75 percent to 19 percent), voters under 35 years old (52 percent to 42 percent), Hispanic voters (56 percent to 38 percent), and suburban women (52 percent to 42 percent). Harris's personal metrics have also improved, with a 7-point increase in positive views and a 5-point decrease in unfavorable views. As one Morning Consult poll notes, 'Harris's 4-point net favorability is a higher rating than Biden or Trump have posted all cycle.'

**Kamala Harris approval rating surges as JD Vance's falters**
Vice President Kamala Harris is recording strong net favorable ratings as the presumptive 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, while Donald Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, continues to struggle, according to a poll. The Mainstreet Research and Florida Atlantic University survey found that 53 percent of voters had a 'strongly favorable' or 'somewhat favorable' view of Harris, compared to 44 percent who held a 'strongly unfavorable' or 'somewhat unfavorable' view. In contrast, Vance recorded a net negative favorable rating, with 44 percent saying they held a 'strongly unfavorable' or 'somewhat unfavorable' view and 41 percent saying they held a 'strongly favorable' or 'somewhat favorable' view. Harris is also beating Trump in head-to-head polls, with a 48-46 lead among likely voters. Harry Enten, CNN's senior political data reporter, previously said Vance is a 'historically unpopular' running mate choice, citing his low net favorable rating. The Mainstreet Research/FAU poll found that Harris' net favorable rating has increased since President Joe Biden endorsed her as the party's nominee, while Vance's rating has decreased amid scrutiny of his past comments. 'Historically unpopular' running mate choice, according to Harry Enten, CNN's senior political data reporter, is Vance, after the senator received the lowest recorded net favorable rating for a vice presidential nominee coming out of a convention since 1980.

**With Harris in the race, 'double haters' are on the decline: From the Politics Desk**
Vice President Kamala Harris' and former President Donald Trump's favorability ratings have improved since Harris' emergence as the likely Democratic standard-bearer. Trump's 47% favorable mark is his highest in the Wall Street Journal poll, while Harris' 46% rating is a 9-13 point increase from President Joe Biden's previous levels. This shift is significant, as it reduces the number of 'double haters,' voters who dislike both major party candidates. A June survey from Pew Research Center found that 25% of voters were 'double haters,' but the New York Times/Siena poll now has them making up only 8% of the electorate. Tonight, Arizona is hosting primaries in the battleground state, where Trump's influence is looming large. The Republican presidential nominee's acolytes appear all over Arizona's ballot, including several candidates who lost major statewide races in 2022 on platforms centered on election denialism. The key Senate matchup is between Republican Kari Lake and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, while the GOP brawl in the 8th District features election deniers Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh. The winner of the primary will be a heavy favorite for the seat in the fall.

**Never before have Americans hated our choices of president as much**
According to Gallup polls, President Trump's job approval rating has never reached 50% during his presidency, making him the only president to not achieve this milestone since 1938.

The article concludes that the 2024 election will likely be decided by who hates the other candidate more, rather than a competent candidate winning.
