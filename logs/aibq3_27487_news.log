**Traders now betting on smaller Fed rate cut in September By Investing.com**
Investors are now betting on a smaller Federal Reserve interest rate cut of 25 basis points (bps) at the September 2024 meeting, rather than a jumbo 50 bps cut. According to the latest CME futures prices, the odds of a target rate of 5.00 - 5.25, representing a 25 bps decrease, have risen to 68% from 47% the previous week. The probability of a 50 bps cut has decreased to 32% from 53%. This shift is driven by recent economic data, including positive inflation readings from the PPI and CPI, and stronger-than-expected retail sales data, which supports the view of a soft landing. As a result, stocks have bounced back strongly after a recent sell-off. 'The Federal Reserve uses interest rate adjustments as a tool to control inflation and stabilize the economy,' said no source, but the article explains that a rate cut can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, while a rate hike can slow down an overheating economy and keep inflation in check.

**US Fed must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September or risk recession: Experts | Mint**
Wall Street experts believe that the US Federal Reserve must implement a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a potential recession. The Fed has maintained the benchmark interest rate at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with market expectations. As the US central bank has kept borrowing rates steady for 12 months to combat inflation, experts warn that a more substantial rate cut is necessary to mitigate the looming economic storm.

**Fed expected to cut rates by 25 bps at September meeting: economist survey**
A recent survey of 51 economists by Bloomberg found that most expect the Federal Reserve to cut their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at their next meeting in September, contrary to calls for a 50-bp cut or an inter-meeting move. The economists' view aligns with Fed officials' statements that the central bank will be deliberate and patient in setting policy. Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said, 'We think financial markets might force the Fed to cut inter-meeting but otherwise don't think last week's data is enough of a reason.' The survey found that 60% of economists described the labor market as solid, though somewhat softened, while 24% called it significantly weakened but likely to stabilize. Traders, however, are leaning toward a 50-bp cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, giving that outcome a 54.5% probability vs. a 45.5% probability for a 25-bp reduction.

**The Fed confirmed a rate cut coming in September**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has hinted at a potential rate cut in September, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating that '...a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.' Powell emphasized that the decision will depend on inflation data, but set a relatively low threshold for incoming data. He also rejected the idea of starting with a 50 bps cut. As a result, mortgage rates are expected to decline in the near to medium term, with rates already decreasing from 7.10% to 6.70% in the past month. This has led many buyers to wait for further declines, although this tactic is considered risky.

**Federal Reserve Minutes Suggest Rate Cut in September**
The latest meeting of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee has strengthened the chances of a rate cut in September, following a significant decline in US wage growth. The committee's minutes showed that most members are in favor of cutting interest rates, with some even calling for an immediate cut. The Fed has kept interest rates unchanged, but left the door open for a cut in September. Markets had expected some time ago that the September meeting would lead to a cut in the federal interest rate, which currently ranges from 5.25% to 5.50%. It is expected that interest rates will be cut by up to 1 percentage point by the end of this year. In the July meeting, the majority of policymakers indicated that 'if the data continues to flow as expected, it would be appropriate to ease policy in the next meeting'. The minutes also showed that many members considered the current interest rate setting to be restrictive, while a few participants argued that the lack of change in interest rates means that monetary policy will continue to put pressure on economic activity. A few members expressed their concern that an early easing of policy could lead to a resurgence in inflation. The rapid increase in unemployment rates has led to a discussion on cutting interest rates, with some analysts suggesting that a 0.5 percentage point cut in interest rates in the next meeting would be a good idea. The unemployment rate has risen from 3.4% in early last year to 4.3% in the last month. The minutes described the labor market as 'strong but not overheating'. Jaimie Cox from Harris Financial Group said, 'The Fed's minutes have removed all doubts about a rate cut in September. The Fed's strategy is to make their meetings less impactful on the market, and they are following the script literally.' Brett Kenwell from E-Toro believes that, given that the majority of Fed members see a rate cut in September as appropriate, it is likely that the Fed will cut rates in September. He said, 'The question is not whether the Fed will cut rates in September, but by how much?' He added, 'The market is currently pricing in a higher chance of a 25 basis point cut rather than a 50 basis point cut, which seems like the most likely outcome at this stage, provided the August jobs report is not too disappointing.' Jennifer McQuiston from Capital Economics believes that central bank governors are unlikely to provide much guidance on future policy in the Jackson Hole symposium, preferring to emphasize their reliance on data. She noted that 'given that most economies are growing, inflation is retreating back to target, and markets have stabilized after the recession scare a few weeks ago, the pressure on them to guide markets is less than it was in previous events. But they risk keeping interest rates too high for too long.' Since the release of the July jobs and inflation data, many Fed officials have said that we are approaching the time when a rate cut would be appropriate. Markets expect a rate cut of around 1 percentage point during the remaining part of the year.

**US Stocks Rise After Dovish Fed Minutes**
US stocks rose on Wednesday as expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut increased following the release of dovish Fed minutes. The minutes showed that a 'vast majority' of policymakers supported an interest rate cut if economic data plays out as expected. Analysts cited a weakening jobs market as a driver of likely Fed rate cuts, although there are still hopes for a 'soft landing' that averts a US recession. Labor Department figures showed that US employers added around 68,000 fewer jobs monthly in the 12-month period through March 2024 compared with earlier estimates. Futures markets now see a slightly greater chance of a 0.50 percentage point cut, although more investors still expect the smaller 0.25 point cut. As Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said, 'After a wild ride in the last three weeks that had little basis in fundamentals, markets have settled on predicting a first 25 bp (basis point) Fed rate cut at its 18 September meeting.' However, Stephen Innes, managing partner from SPI Asset Management, warned that 'it wouldn't take much more than a bump in the unemployment rate to shove the market right back into 50bps territory.'

**Probability of Fed Cutting Rates by 50 Bp in Sept 32.5%: Fedwatch Tool**
The probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points in September has increased to 32.5%, according to the FedWatch Tool. This comes after the probability of a 25 basis point cut was 67.5%. The dollar index has been trading near its lowest level in over a year against the Euro and Sterling, and a weak job market has made interest rate cuts more probable. As stated in the minutes of the July 30-31 FOMC meeting, several Fed officials were keen on an interest rate cut at the September policy meeting. Additionally, a Labor Department report revealed a weaker job market, with employers adding fewer jobs than originally reported in the year through March. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 18.

**US stock futures steady as rate cut cheer grows**
US stock index futures rose slightly on Wednesday evening, extending gains from Wall Street as the minutes of the Federal Reserve's recent meeting fueled growing conviction that the central bank will cut rates. The minutes showed an increasing number of policymakers supported lowering interest rates amid progress in bringing down inflation. Analysts at Citi see a 50 bps reduction as their base case for September, especially after Wednesday's minutes showed more officials leaning towards lower rates. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 5,620.85 points on Wednesday, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.6% to 17,817.99 points. However, gains in Wall Street were held back by anticipation of an address by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday, where he is expected to reiterate the central bank's dovish stance, setting the stage for a September rate cut.

**Fed Meeting Minutes Suggest Interest Rate Cut in September**
The recent Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting minutes, released on August 21, revealed that 'most members' believe it will be appropriate to cut interest rates in the US in September. The probability of a 50-basis-point (0.5 percentage point) cut in the coming month has increased, but a 25-basis-point (0.25 percentage point) cut is still the majority, according to data from the CME Group. The Fed members observed that the real GDP growth in the US was solid in the first half of the year, although slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year. The final domestic purchases of the private sector (PDFP) also moderated in the first half, but less than the growth of GDP, according to the document. The participants also noted that the long-term inflation expectations remained well-anchored, although they adopted caution about controlling the index. For the end of the year, the chance of a cumulative decline of 125 points (1.25 percentage points) increased, although the possibility of a 100-point (1 percentage point) decline still prevails. 'Most participants observed that the factors that contributed to recent disinflation, probably, will continue to exert downward pressure on inflation in the coming months,' the document states. 'Many participants noted that the moderation of labor cost growth as the labor market conditions reequilibrate will continue to contribute to disinflation, particularly, of non-housing service prices.'

**FOMC Minutes Suggest Possible Rate Cut in September**
The minutes of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on July 31, 2024, suggest that the committee may lower interest rates in September. 'The majority observed that, if the data continued to arrive as expected, it would probably be appropriate to relax policy at the next meeting,' it reads in the published minutes. The market currently assigns a 63% probability to a 25 basis point (bp) rate cut in September, with a 37% probability of a more aggressive 50 bp cut. Participants discussed the prospects of monetary policy, noting that economic growth had been solid, some additional progress had been made on inflation, and labor market conditions had eased. 'Almost all participants commented that while incoming data on inflation were encouraging, more information was needed to provide greater confidence that inflation was moving in a sustainable way towards the Committee's 2% objective before it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate,' it reads in the document. The document highlights the existence of confidence that inflation is moving towards the target, but also notes that 'many participants' observe that monetary policy remains restrictive, with diverse opinions on the degree of restriction. 'Some participants noted that the ongoing disinflation, without a change in the nominal target range for the policy rate, by itself results in a tightening of monetary policy,' it reads. Within the FOMC, there were also various warnings about the second mandate of the Fed: the maximization of employment. According to the minutes, many participants noted that the risks for the employment objective had increased, and many participants noted that the risks for the inflation objective had decreased. 'Some participants noted the risk that a greater gradual relaxation of labor market conditions could become a more serious deterioration. Many participants noted that reducing too late or too little the moderation of policies could run the risk of weakening the economy or employment,' the minutes refer. In contrast, several participants noted that reducing too early or too much the moderation of policies could provoke a resurgence of aggregate demand and a reversal of progress on inflation. 'These participants noted risks related to possible shocks that could exert upward pressure on inflation or the possibility that inflation could be more persistent than currently expected,' the minutes mention.

**Fed policymakers incline toward September rate cut: Minutes**
Federal Reserve officials were inclined to cut interest rates at their September meeting, with some ready to reduce borrowing costs immediately, according to the minutes of the July 30-31 meeting. The minutes stated that 'the vast majority' of policymakers 'observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting,' said Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who also mentioned that 'a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting.' The current level of joblessness is already higher than the 4% level Fed officials penciled in for this year, and the 4.2% policymakers projected for the end of next year. However, some Fed officials have remained cautious about an easing, mindful of recent false dawns on the inflation front. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Tuesday that when it comes to September, 'we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold' on the monetary policy front, adding that there were 'upside risks to inflation.' Markets are expecting a quarter of a percentage point cut in the benchmark interest rate from the current 5.25%-5.50% range, with some analysts suggesting a half-percentage-point reduction.

**USD/CAD remains on the defensive below 1.3650 ahead of FOMC Minutes**
The USD/CAD pair remains on the defensive, trading near 1.3620, as markets expect a 25 bps rate cut in September. The US Federal Reserve's (Fed) dovish comments and expectations of a rate cut have weakened the US Dollar. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the US economy does not show signs of overheating, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested discussing a potential US interest rate cut in September due to concerns about the weakening labor market. Meanwhile, the softer Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reports support the case for another rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC), with traders fully pricing in a 25 bps cut in September and an additional 50 bps of easing for the final two meetings of the year. This might drag the Loonie lower and cap the downside for USD/CAD.

**Dollar at seven-month low on rate cut bets, Powell speech in focus**
The US dollar has fallen to a seven-month low due to bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates from next month. Traders are preparing for comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, with investors expecting him to acknowledge the case for a rate cut. Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, expects Powell to retain optionality for delayed cuts or larger cuts subject to the next US data releases on inflation and payrolls. 'In our view, the economic circumstances require a standard 25 bp rather than an outsized cut to the Funds rate,' Capurso said. The euro has reached its highest level this year, while the sterling is near a one-month peak. Markets are pricing in a 24.5% chance of a 50 bps cut in September, down from 50% a week ago, with a 25-basis-point reduction having odds of 75.5%. Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said, 'The encouraging US macro backdrop of solid domestic demand activity and moderate disinflation suggests the Fed is unlikely to cut the funds rate as much as is currently priced-in.' A slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the US central bank to cut rates by 25 bps at each of the remaining three meetings of 2024.

**US Interest Rate Cut Probability Returns to Majority Scenario**
The probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting US interest rates by 100 basis points (bp) in 2024 has returned to being the majority scenario, according to the CME Group's monitoring. The chance of rates ending the year between 4.25% and 4.50% is now 43.3%. The probability of a smaller cut, of 75 basis points, is 39.4%. For the September meeting, there was a slight increase in the probability of a 50 basis point cut, now at 27.5%. However, the majority view still favors a minimum reduction of 25 bp, with a 72.5% chance. The bets for a larger interest rate cut followed the release of US housing starts data, which fell well above market expectations and raised doubts about the strength of the US economy.

**Narrowing odds of 50 bps Fed rate cut weigh on rupee, RBI supports - ET Auto**
The Indian rupee is expected to hold near its all-time low on Friday due to slimmer chances of a 50 basis points (bps) rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The rupee has been in a narrow range in recent days, largely due to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) intervention. A currency trader noted, 'we would be at least' at 84.50 if it wasn't for the RBI's intervention, and 'the extent of dollar demand we are witnessing from importers is 'a lot'. The odds of a 50 bps rate cut at the September meeting are now 1-in-4, having climbed to nearly 50% recently. ANZ Bank stated, 'the totality of U.S. data releases this week support a gradual easing process by the Fed and have provided no evidence for a 'chunky' 50 bps cuts.'

**European shares tick up on Fed rate cut bets**
European shares rose on Thursday as benign inflation data and gains in insurer Admiral boosted the market. The STOXX 600 index rose 0.2% to trade near a two-week high, with the insurance sector up 0.5% due to Admiral's 6.7% gain after beating pre-tax profit expectations. Mild U.S. inflation readings have cemented hopes of a rate cut in September, with traders split on whether it will be a 25 bps or 50 bps reduction. Manish Singh, chief investment officer at Crossbridge Capital, said, 'We're going to get probably a 25 bps cut because that is how central banks have always worked. However, if they deliver a 50 bps cut - it has huge merit and can avert a recession.' The Euro STOXX volatility index returned to pre-risk-off sentiment levels, but investors remain cautious awaiting further economic data.

**Fed Members' Shift in Tone: Will They Cut Rates by 25 or 50 Basis Points in September?**
Following the consumer price index (CPI) data that met expectations, some Federal Reserve (Fed) members who were previously cautious about monetary policy have started to make more optimistic comments. Market participants continue to expect a rate cut in September, but now they are discussing how much the cut will be. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that he is more concerned about the labor market than inflation, citing recent developments in price pressures and below-expected employment data. Goolsbee argued that the current interest rates are too restrictive and should only be used in case of overheating economy. He also avoided making any comments on the potential rate cut or its magnitude in the September meeting. At the same time, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic warned that the Fed should not delay in transitioning to a loose monetary policy, considering the signs of cooling labor market. Bostic hinted that he will vote in favor of a rate cut next month, citing the decline in inflation pressure and the need for policymakers to focus on job protection. Economists are now debating whether the Fed will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points in September, with the upcoming employment data expected to influence the decision. The CPI data has generally indicated that inflation is under control, but the labor market data, to be released before the Fed meeting, is expected to have a greater impact on the decision.

**Morning Bid: Data tests loom for Fed, BoE**
Investors are closely watching economic data releases this week, particularly U.S. retail sales and Britain's GDP, which could impact interest rate expectations at the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The Fed is widely expected to lower borrowing costs in September, but the size of the cut is still uncertain, with some predicting a 50 basis-point reduction and others a more standard quarter-point cut. The estimated chance of a 50 bp cut has fallen to 36% after mild U.S. inflation readings. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is expected to delay any further rate cuts, despite speculation of faster and deeper rate reductions following a softer-than-expected UK consumer inflation reading. Traders are also awaiting the Norges Bank's policy announcement, where officials are expected to hold off on easing as they worry about weakening the Norwegian krone.

**Morning Bid: US rate cuts in view after tame CPI report By Reuters**
The prospect of US rate cuts has returned to the forefront after a tame consumer price index (CPI) report showed a moderate rise in July with the annual increase in US inflation slowing below 3% for the first time in nearly 3-1/2 years. Traders are now debating the size of the rate cut, with nearly 40% odds on a 50 basis point cut in September, according to CME FedWatch. The Fed's annual Jackson Hole gathering will give Chair Jerome Powell a chance to fine tune his rates message ahead of the meeting.

**MORNING BID ASIA-US rate cuts in view after tame CPI report**
The prospect of US rate cuts has increased after a tame CPI report, with investors debating the size of the cut. Traders are leaning towards a 25 basis point cut, but 50 bps is not ruled out. The Fed's annual Jackson Hole gathering will give Chair Jerome Powell a chance to fine tune his rates message ahead of the meeting. Other economic data, including US retail sales and weekly jobless claims, will also be released in the coming weeks. Rate cuts are also being considered in other regions, with New Zealand's central bank slashing its benchmark rate for the first time since March 2020. Key developments to watch on Thursday include China's industrial output and retail sales, Japan's GDP, and US retail sales. 'The question investors seemed to be debating was not whether the Fed would cut rates at its Sept. 17 to 18 meeting, but by how much,' according to the article. 'Nearly 40% odds were put on the bigger cut in September,' it added. The article also noted that 'markets seemed to be moving further and further from those wild swings' after the tame CPI report. 'The S&P 500 ended up 0.4% on Wednesday after the tame CPI report,' it said. 'The Cboe Volatility index continued to recede, ending at just over 16 on Wednesday after shooting above 65 on Aug. 5.'

**Yields mixed after CPI supports 25 bp Sept cut, with 50 bp not ruled out**
U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday after the July consumer inflation reading came in lower than expected, supporting a Federal Reserve easing of at least 25 basis points in September, with 50 bps not ruled out. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.2% monthly increase and 3.0% annual increase, which was in line with the actual numbers. The odds of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting had been nearly split between 50 bps and 25 bps, but futures moved in favor of a 25 bps cut after the report. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, said, 'The market is thinking that inflation is a little bit more sticky than the Fed was expecting, and they're penciling out some of that 50 basis point pricing.' Traders are still pricing in a full percentage point of easing from the current 5.25% to 5.5% fed funds rate by year-end. Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading, said that the Fed should go with 50 bp in September if fed funds are to fall by 100 bp over the remaining three meetings in 2024. The yield on the 10-year note fell 2.6 basis points to 3.828%, while the 2-year note yield rose 1.2 basis points to 3.9537%.

**CPI Preview: Data May Throw Cold Water on a 50bps Cut in September | Investing.com UK**
The market is pricing in a 50-point reduction in the Federal Reserve's interest rate in September due to concerns over a potential recession. However, the author believes the Fed may choose a more balanced approach, opting for a 25 bp rate cut. The upcoming CPI report will be closely watched, but the market's focus is shifting toward recession concerns. Higher-than-expected inflation could limit the Fed's ability to ease monetary policy, weighing on the economy. The author notes that inflation remains a key issue, but the potential for a recession adds another layer of complexity.

**CPI Preview: Data May Throw Cold Water on a 50bps Cut in September**
Markets are expecting a key CPI report today, which may impact the Federal Reserve's decision on a potential rate cut in September. A lower-than-expected print could drive a stock rally, but a higher-than-expected number may stoke recession fears. The market is currently pricing in a 50-point reduction, but the author believes the Fed may choose a more balanced approach, opting for a 25 bp rate cut. The CPI report could drive markets in several ways, including a potential rally in equities, a fall in bond yields, and a weakening of the dollar against the euro.

**Fed 'Truly Has A Green Light' To Cut Rates By 0.5% After July Producer Price Report, Says Economist**
The Producer Price Index (PPI) for July showed a decline, easing concerns about inflation and paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. According to Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, 'The PPI data this morning came in lower than expected - across the board - which is good news for those investors that worried the Fed would have to be more cautious in lowering interest rates due to lingering inflation.' Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, echoed this sentiment, saying, 'The runway is clear for the Fed to cut rates in September.' The PPI index rose 2.2% on an annual basis, below the expected 2.3% jump, and the core PPI remained flat, coming in below estimates. This data suggests that the Fed may have a 'green light' to cut rates by 0.5% at their next meeting, as economist Chris Zaccarelli said, 'If tomorrow's CPI report comes in lower than expected, like this morning's PPI report did, then the Fed truly has a green light to cut rates by 50 bps at their next meeting if they deem it necessary to quickly get back to neutral in the face of a looming slowdown in the economy.'

**Fed 'stubborn by not lowering rates' -strategist**
McGough, a strategist, believes that an 'emergency cut' in interest rates by the Fed before its September meeting would be a 'positive signal.' However, he also thinks that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is 'pragmatic' and may not want to make a decision before the presidential election. The Fed will have more economic data to consider with the release of the U.S. consumer price index reading on Wednesday and Thursday's retail sales figures for July. Money markets are evenly betting on a 25- or 50-basis-point cut in U.S. interest rates in September, expecting a total easing of 100 bps by the end of 2024.

**Wednesday's CPI Inflation to Decide on 25 bps or 50 bps FED Rate Cut**
Economists expect Wednesday's CPI inflation report to significantly impact financial markets. Some analysts predict a partial reversal of June's lower-than-expected inflation figures, forecasting modest increases in both headline and core CPI. This data could play a key role in shaping the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding potential rate cuts in September. The headline CPI is projected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, while the core CPI is forecasted to see a monthly increase of 0.2%. A robust CPI figure could prompt a 25 basis point rate cut, while a weaker reading might lead to a more aggressive 50 basis point reduction. The market will be closely watching how this report influences the Fed's September meeting, as it could signal the beginning of a new phase in monetary policy.

**Fed expected to cut rates by 25 bps at September meeting: economist survey**
A recent survey of 51 economists by Bloomberg found that most expect the Federal Reserve to cut their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at their next meeting in September, contrary to calls for a 50-bp cut or an inter-meeting move. The economists' view aligns with Fed officials' statements that the central bank will be deliberate and patient in setting policy. Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said, 'We think financial markets might force the Fed to cut inter-meeting but otherwise don't think last week's data is enough of a reason.' The survey found that 60% of economists described the labor market as solid, though somewhat softened, while 24% called it significantly weakened but likely to stabilize. Traders, however, are leaning toward a 50-bp cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, giving that outcome a 54.5% probability vs. a 45.5% probability for a 25-bp reduction.

**Experts call on the Fed for emergency interest rate cut**
Experts are calling on the Federal Reserve to make an emergency interest rate cut due to the sharp downturn in global financial markets. The Fed held rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5% at last week's meeting, but some are predicting a 50 basis-point cut at September's meeting. However, a worse-than-expected U.S. jobs report and various macroeconomic factors have led some to call for an emergency rate cut. Jeremy Siegel, a professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, called for a 75 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate and another 75 bps cut in September, saying, 'If they are going to be as slow on the way down as they were on the way up, which, by the way, was the first policy error in 50 years, then we're not in for a good time with this economy.' Nigel Green, the CEO of the deVere Group, also called for a 25-basis point cut, saying the Fed 'needs to take action now...or there could be legitimate and far-reaching risks of a hard landing.' However, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees a more measured approach and said an emergency cut is unlikely, saying, 'Powell is pretty measured, and the timing around the election makes an emergency anything seem unlikely.' Hougan also noted that the current market downturn may be a buying opportunity, saying, 'But guess what, that turned out to be a historic buying opportunity. Bitcoin BTC rallied more than 1,000% in the next year, as central banks did what they do and printed their way out of the crisis.'

**Federal Reserve to cut by 50bps in September and November: Wells Fargo By Investing.com**
Wells Fargo analysts predict the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 50 basis points at the September 18 and November 7 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. This shift in forecast is due to emerging economic indicators, including decelerating payroll growth and increasing unemployment. The bank notes that the current stance of monetary policy is 'quite restrictive' and argues that the FOMC needs to revert to a neutral policy stance to prevent labor market weakness. Wells Fargo forecasts a series of rate cuts, including a 25 bps reduction in December, followed by additional cuts in 2025, with the target range for the federal funds rate falling to 3.25-3.50% by mid-2025. According to the bank, 'the FOMC needs to get back to a 'neutral' stance of policy quickly or else it risks a vicious circle of labor market weakness.'

**Federal Reserve to cut by 50bps in September and November: Wells Fargo**
Wells Fargo analysts predict two 50 basis point rate cuts at the Federal Reserve's meetings on September 18 and November 7, citing emerging economic indicators and labor market vulnerabilities. They note that the FOMC has largely succeeded in returning inflation to its 2% target, but that recent data suggests the risks to the 'full employment' part of the dual mandate are rising. The bank argues that the FOMC needs to revert to a neutral policy stance quickly to prevent a cycle of labor market weakness, and forecasts a series of cuts, including a 25 bps reduction in December, followed by additional cuts in 2025. According to Wells Fargo, 'the FOMC needs to get back to a 'neutral' stance of policy quickly or else it risks a vicious circle of labor market weakness.'

**Fed May Be 'Bullied' Into 50 BPS Cut In September, Says Mohamed El-Erian, As Global Markets Melt Down**
Economist Mohamed El-Erian believes that the Federal Reserve may be 'bullied' into a 50-basis-point cut in September due to market pressure. The implied probability of such a cut has surged to 80%, with traders increasing their expectations of a Fed cutting cycle. El-Erian notes that this could be similar to the Fed's policy U-turn in 2018, where it cut rates despite not being warranted by economic conditions. He warns that such an outcome would require significant revisions to the Fed's economic projections. El-Erian's comments come as some economists argue that the Fed's policy is too restrictive, while others, like Larry Summers, believe that the Fed's next move will be to raise rates rather than cut them.

**Wall Street, analysts ramp up bets for 50 bps rate cut in Sept after July jobs report**
The recent US jobs data has led to a shift in market expectations, with many analysts now calling for a 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point cut have jumped to 71.5% from 22% a day ago. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said, 'I am stunned by how quickly the market narrative has changed about what the Federal Reserve should do.' Several brokerages, including JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs, have called for bigger or earlier interest rate cuts, with some expecting a 50 basis point cut in September and November, followed by 25 basis point cuts at each subsequent meeting. 'We now think the FOMC cuts by 50bp at both the September and November meetings, followed by 25bp cuts at every meeting thereafter,' JPMorgan's Michael Feroli said. Citi's Veronica Clark and Andrew Hollenhorst added, 'We now expect the Fed to start the cutting cycle with 50bp rate cuts in September and November, followed by 25bp cuts at each subsequent meeting until reaching a policy rate of 3-3.25% by mid-2025.'

**Market Sees More Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts by Fed in 2024**
The financial market has begun to price in more aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2024, following a weak jobs report in the US. According to the CME Group's monitoring tool, the probability of a 50 basis point (bp) rate cut - from 4.75% to 5.00% - in September increased from 30.5% to 69.5%, becoming the most likely scenario. This pushed the chance of a 25 bp cut to second place. The market also began to see a greater reduction in interest rates by the Fed until December, taking away the majority position from the probability of a 75 bp cut in 2024 - which fell from 56.5% to 15% after the jobs report. Jerome Powell, the Fed's president, however, dismissed aggressive interest rate cuts, including a possible 50 bp cut in September, in a press conference after the monetary decision.

**The Fed confirmed a rate cut coming in September**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has hinted at a potential rate cut in September, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating that '...a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.' Powell emphasized that the decision will depend on inflation data, but set a relatively low threshold for incoming data. He also rejected the idea of starting with a 50 bps cut. As a result, mortgage rates are expected to decline in the near to medium term, with rates already decreasing from 7.10% to 6.70% in the past month. This has led many buyers to wait for further declines, although this tactic is considered risky.

**Key risk is that the Fed is forced to deliver 'deeper and faster' cuts: Citi**
Citi analysts have highlighted a significant risk facing the Federal Reserve: the potential necessity to implement 'deeper and faster' interest rate cuts. This assessment follows the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a rate cut is likely in September, provided inflation does not surge again. Citi projects 150,000 new jobs and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.2% this Friday, and warns that Fed officials might need to exceed anticipated cuts to stabilize the unemployment rate. The bank's note suggests that the Fed would need to cut rates back to a neutral level to maintain current labor market conditions, which could lead to 50 basis point cuts in one or more meetings. Citi concludes that a monthly payroll increase below 50,000 or an unemployment rate above 4.3% could significantly increase the likelihood of a 50 basis point rate cut in September.

**Fed Maintains Interest Rates, Signals Possible Rate Cut in September**
US futures continued to rise as the Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained interest rates between 5.25-5.50%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell mentioned that the committee is cautious about risks in the labor market and may consider a rate cut in September. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) officials signaled that they are closer to reducing borrowing costs by changing the language in the decision text to focus on 'risks to both sides' rather than just inflation risks. Powell stated, 'The key question is whether the overall data, the improving outlook, and the risk balance are consistent with increasing confidence in inflation and a strong labor market. If this test is passed, a rate cut may be considered at the next meeting in September.' He also mentioned that the committee had a 'real discussion' about taking action, but a strong majority supported not taking a step at this meeting. Following the decision, futures markets continued to price in a 25 basis point rate cut at the September Fed meeting, with a probability of over 100%. DoubleLine Capital's founder Jeffrey Gundlach stated, 'The Fed should have cut rates at this meeting,' and predicted that the bank may have missed the opportunity to cut rates when it did.

**Powell puts September rate cut on table after Fed leaves borrowing costs unchanged**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the central bank may be ready to reduce borrowing costs as soon as their next meeting in September, citing recent data that shows inflation is coming into line with their 2 per cent target. Powell's remarks at his press conference following the end of the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting appeared as an affirmation of a coming pivot in September. The central bank's new policy statement also reflected this, stating that 'there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 per cent objective.' Powell added that 'there is a growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting' as long as coming inflation data affirms its recent softening trend. Investors saw Powell's comments as clearly setting the stage for a reduction in borrowing costs at the Fed's Sept 17-18 meeting. 'Listening to him speak, it's clear they're all locked and loaded for September rate cut and they're going to maintain their optionality,' said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at SiebertNXT. The probability of a first cut in September being as large as half a percentage point jumped to about 15 per cent, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. However, Powell stated that a 50-basis-point cut was not something under active consideration. The Fed's policy statement also removed standing language that it was 'highly attentive to inflation risks,' and replaced it with an acknowledgement that policymakers were now 'attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.'

**Fed Chairman Powell Signals Potential Rate Cut in September**
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell held a press conference after maintaining the policy interest rate at 5.25-5.50%, the highest level in 23 years, despite market expectations. Powell stated that the labor market has reached a better balance and unemployment rates have remained low, while inflation has decreased significantly. He emphasized that the bank is committed to maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance to balance demand and supply and reduce inflationary pressures. Powell noted that inflation has slowed down significantly over the past two years, but remains above the long-term target of 2%. He stated, 'We do not anticipate lowering the interest rate until we have more confidence that inflation is sustainably declining to 2%. The second-quarter inflation data has increased our confidence, and better data will further strengthen it. We will continue to make decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis.' When asked about the possibility of a September rate cut, Powell said, 'We are approaching the point where a rate cut may be appropriate. The question is whether the data, the evolving outlook, and the risk balance are consistent with increasing confidence in inflation and a strong labor market. If this test is met, a rate cut may be possible at the next meeting in September.' Powell also stated that the bank's path forward is dependent on the economy's performance and that they can imagine scenarios ranging from zero to several rate cuts. When asked about the possibility of a 50-basis-point rate cut, Powell replied, 'This is not something we are currently considering. No decision has been made at this time.'

**Fed Chairman Powell: Rate Cut in September Possible if Inflation Confidence Increases**
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that if inflation confidence increases and the labor market maintains its strength, the possibility of a rate cut in September may be considered.

If this test is met, a rate cut may be on the table for the next meeting in September.'

**Federal Reserve Holds Rates, Signals Possible September Cut**
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell suggested a potential reduction in borrowing costs as soon as the next meeting in September. Powell stated that there's growing confidence for a move in the next meeting, as long as inflation trends continue to improve. Investors perceived Powell's statement as setting the stage for a rate cut at the Fed's meeting in September, with market reactions including rallies in stocks and Treasury bonds. However, Powell clarified that a 50-basis-point cut was not under active consideration. The Fed's policy statement downplayed inflation risks, focusing more on their dual mandate, which includes maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. Policymakers await stronger confidence in sustainable inflation trends before finalizing rate cuts. As Powell said, 'The economy is expanding solidly, and while job gains have moderated, unemployment remains low.'

**Federal Reserve maintains rate at 5.25%-5.50% as risks come into better balance**
The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark interest rate at 5.25%-5.50% on Wednesday, citing a more balanced risk to its goals of stable prices and maximum employment. The committee acknowledged economic activity remains solid, but inflation remains 'somewhat elevated.' The statement suggests the Fed is now considering both inflation and employment risks, rather than solely focusing on inflation. This has led some analysts to believe a September rate cut is possible. The probability of a 25 basis-point rate cut has increased to 95.5%, while the odds of a 50-bp cut have dropped to 4.5%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to provide more insight into the committee's decision. 'Chair Powell will now need to perform a delicate balancing act at the presser,' said David Alton Clark, 'Powell needs to signal the FOMC is open to a rate cut in September, yet still remain data dependent.'

However, if inflation and labor market data continue to cooperate, this may be the last meeting where rates are left unchanged, with expectations for a rate cut building for the next FOMC gathering in September. Chairman Powell has emphasized the need for more data to justify a rate cut, but if upcoming data continues to cooperate, he may provide forward guidance for a September rate cut at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium in August. The Fed's dual mandate of inflation and employment is being highlighted, indicating a potential for a rate cut. The central bank is also considering a more deliberate rate-cutting phase if future economic data does not reveal any signs of visible weakening, or a more aggressive easing stance if higher unemployment rates and continued disinflation are seen.

**Fed Opens Door to Rate Cut in September, Citing Rising Unemployment**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has maintained its interest rates at their highest level in 20 years, but has opened the door to a potential cut in September, as it is now concerned about rising unemployment rather than just inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'If the conditions are met, the rate cut could occur as early as the September meeting.' He added, 'The general sentiment within the committee is that the economy is approaching the time when it will be appropriate to reduce our rates.' This would be the first rate cut since March 2020, when the COVID-19 crisis forced the Fed to lower interest rates to zero. The Fed is now considering a rate cut as the US economy is showing signs of slowing down, and the unemployment rate is expected to rise. The Fed's decision to maintain interest rates at 5.25-5.50% was made unanimously. The Fed is also concerned about the risks of inflation and unemployment, and is trying to balance these two aspects of its mandate. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 17-18, and Jerome Powell is expected to provide more details on the potential rate cut.

**Traders see Sept start to Fed easing, with 25 bps rate cut**
Traders are predicting a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, followed by two more rate cuts in November and December. This comes after the Fed acknowledged 'some further progress' towards its 2% inflation goal. Interest-rate futures contracts were initially pricing in an 89% chance of a 25-basis point reduction in September, but now reflect a 95% chance of a 25 basis-point cut. The balance of bets has shifted from a bigger 50-basis point cut.

**US yields decline as market braces for dovish Fed**
US Treasury yields declined for the fourth consecutive day as investors anticipate a dovish Federal Reserve meeting. The JOLTS report and consumer confidence data briefly boosted yields, but expectations for a rate cut in September remained unchanged. Thomas Urano, co-chief investment officer at Sage Advisory, said, 'The whisper expectation is for the Fed to acknowledge softness in inflation and the labor market and maybe acknowledge the potential for policy adjustment in September.' The rate futures market continues to price in a 67 bps rate cut in 2024, with some investors increasingly pricing in a 50 bps cut. Greg Wilensky, head of US fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, said, 'The Fed will be responsive as to how the economy evolves as far as talking about a 50 basis-point cut.' The market expects the Fed to keep interest rates in the 5.25%-5.50% range for an eighth straight meeting on Wednesday.

**Fed Meeting May Signal Future Interest Rate Cut**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to hold a meeting today, which may signal a future cut in interest rates to combat high inflation. The Fed has kept interest rates high since last year, ranging from 5.25% to 5.50%, making credit more expensive for Americans. The institution is considering lowering rates in the coming months, but wants to ensure that price increases continue to slow down. The inflation rate has slightly decreased to 2.5% in June, down from 2.6% in May, according to the PCE index. Analysts at BPI expect the Fed to keep interest rates between 5.25% and 5.50% at the July meeting, with a potential first cut of 25 basis points after the summer. Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, predicts that the Fed will use this meeting to prepare for a potential first rate cut in September. Nathan Sheets, chief economist at Citi, notes that the process of disinflation is underway and suggests that the Fed should start the cycle of rate cuts in September. The September meeting is the last before the US presidential elections, which have recently seen a significant shift after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Despite high interest rates, the US economy remains solid, with the GDP growing at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate rising slightly to 4.1% in June, remaining among the lowest in the past 50 years.

**Fed: Expectativa para manutenção nos juros e possíveis sinalizações de cortes**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to keep interest rates unchanged, between 5.25% and 5.50%, at the end of the two-day monetary policy meeting on July 31. However, investors will be paying attention to possible signals of a rate cut, which the market is pricing in for September. Despite economists understanding that the Fed will maintain rates, the communication may bring more hints that the committee members are starting to consider a change in policy - possibly in the next meeting in September. If not, an indication could occur at the Jackson Hole Symposium, which brings together leaders of central banks from around the world in August. Morgan Stanley believes that the communication may open the door for a rate cut in September, citing progress in inflation cooling, after Fed members reiterated that the central bank needs more confidence that the indicator is heading towards its 2% target in a sustainable way. ING also shares this view, evaluating that the latest data should bring more confidence to the US monetary authority to initiate the cycle of rate cuts. The attention should be focused on a 'soft landing' of the economy, where disinflation occurs without significant harm to activity. 'The FOMC meeting next week should establish the basis for a rate cut in September, as policy begins to shift from restrictive to something more neutral', emphasized ING analysts. 'With favorable economic data giving authorities greater confidence that US inflation is moving firmly in the right direction, we believe the FOMC meeting on Wednesday should offer a clearer indication that the next move of the Federal Reserve will be a rate cut', completed ING.

**Will the Fed Pivot? Key Inflation Data Could Decide Rate Cut Path**
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Thursday, which will impact the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy decisions. The report will show the inflation pace in the U.S. and will likely cause above-normal volatility in financial markets. The market expects a 0.2% rise in monthly core inflation and a 3.4% annual increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the U.S. is on the 'disinflationary path', but needs more data before cutting interest rates. Analyst Kar Yong Ang from Octa believes Powell is trying to strike a delicate balance between being dovish and not committing to a rate cut yet. The probability of a 25-basis point rate cut in September is currently at 74%, and interest rate swaps market data implies more than 50 bps worth of cuts by the end of 2024.
