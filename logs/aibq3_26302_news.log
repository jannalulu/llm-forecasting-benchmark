**Mobilization Against Megabasins in Poitou Region Gains Momentum**
The mobilization against the megabasins in the Poitou region is gaining momentum, with tensions rising ahead of a large-scale protest. The event, which will take place from July 18 to 22, is expected to attract around 6,000 to 8,000 participants, including radicalized individuals. The authorities have deployed over 3,000 police and gendarmes, with 21 mobile units, and have banned all manifestations in the Vienne and Charente-Maritime departments. The protest is against the construction of massive water storage facilities, which opponents claim will privatize the resource for a few large-scale farmers. The event is expected to be marked by violence, with the Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, warning of a 'very violent' mobilization. The organizers, including the collective Bassines Non Merci, Extinction Rebellion, and Attac, are calling for a peaceful and determined protest. The event is a follow-up to the previous protests in Sainte-Soline, where police used excessive force, leading to serious injuries among protesters. The event is expected to be marked by a high level of tension, with the authorities taking measures to prevent violence and maintain order.

**Grenoble Shop Owners Prepare for Potential Unrest Ahead of Election Results**
As the second round of the 2024 legislative elections approaches, authorities in Grenoble are concerned about potential unrest and looting. To prepare, several shop owners are taking measures to protect their stores. One year after the riots that followed the death of Nahel, the memory of the destruction and pillaging is still fresh in the minds of many. On Sunday, July 7, the second and final round of the elections will take place. In the city center, wooden boards are being placed over store windows to prevent damage. David Gendrolini, a security expert, has been hired to install the boards. Some shop owners are not too worried, but others are taking precautions to avoid potential damage. Melanie Giaconella, a saleswoman, explains, 'We're a bit worried about being robbed and having our stores looted. We've done this as a precaution, in case there are any disturbances after the election results are announced, given what happened last year during the riots.' The memory of the 2023 riots is still traumatic for many shop owners, who were affected by the destruction and looting. The French Minister of the Interior, Gérard Darmanin, has announced a large-scale security deployment across the country, with over 30,000 police officers to be mobilized.

Hundreds of opponents of megabassines, large water storage tanks for agricultural use, gathered in Vienne, France, on July 19, 2024, to protest against the construction of these tanks. The protest turned violent when police used tear gas to disperse the crowd.

**French Police Use Tear Gas to Disperse Protesters Opposing 'Mega-Bassines', Sparking Fire in Field**
On July 19, 2024, police in the Vienne department of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, France, used tear gas grenades to disperse a group of 1,500 protesters opposing 'mega-bassines' (large-scale agricultural operations), leading to a fire in a field. The incident occurred on the route between Cissé and Migné-Auxances. The protesters were marching to the Cérience seed production site, which is seen as a symbol of the agro-industry. The prefect of the Vienne department tweeted that a fire broke out in a field in Migné-Auxances due to the police's use of tear gas and grenades. The fire was extinguished by firefighters. The protest was part of a larger gathering of 4,500 opponents of 'mega-bassines' in the valley of the Argentière, which was authorized by the municipality of Melle. The event was attended by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and 120 organizations, including the Confédération paysanne. The authorities had feared the gathering, with the interior minister estimating that 6,000 to 8,000 people would attend, including 1,000 who could be considered 'dangerous, violent, or radicalized.' The prefecture of Deux-Sèvres had banned all manifestations on the territory. The association Bassine Non Merci criticized the prefectures for refusing to engage in dialogue with the protesters outside of a staged scenario to justify repressive measures.

**Ohanaeze Claims South-Easterners Won't Join Planned Nationwide Protest Against Tinubu Govt**
Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, has announced that residents of South-East states will not participate in the planned nationwide protests scheduled for August 1 to 10, 2024. The organisation cited past events where Igbo people suffered disproportionately as a result of significant protests and riots. They highlighted security challenges in the Southeast region as a major concern, stating that enforcing protests in the region would exacerbate existing security dilemmas and create opportunities for criminal elements to exploit the situation. Ohanaeze Ndigbo also expressed concern that Igbo people would once again be perceived as 'sacrificial lambs' in the protests and urged Igbo residents in northern states and the Southwest to boycott the protests for their safety and security.

**Ireland: 15 Arrested After Anti-Immigration Protests Turn Violent**
Fifteen people were arrested in Dublin, Ireland on July 15, 2024, after clashes between police and anti-immigration protesters at a construction site for a refugee center. The Irish Prime Minister, Simon Harris, condemned the violence, stating that 'nobody has the right to burn cars, damage property.' The police reported that several Garda vehicles were damaged during the clashes. The violence is the latest in a series of incidents targeting sites intended for asylum seekers, where criminal fires have been multiplying since 2022. The protesters threw bricks and launched fireworks at the police, who used tear gas to disperse the crowd of over 100 people, mostly men. A video showed a person, likely a construction worker, being carried away on a stretcher. The violence has been condemned by the Irish Minister of Justice, Helen McEntee, who stated that those involved will face the 'full force of the law.' The housing of migrants has become a particularly sensitive issue in Ireland, with a shortage of affordable housing and a cost-of-living crisis fueling resentment towards new arrivals.

**Copa América 2024: Chaos in Bogotá and Soacha after several disturbances and injuries**
Colombia suffered a sad defeat on Sunday, July 14, 2024, after losing 1-0 to Argentina in the Copa América final. This led to several disturbances and riots in Bogotá and its surroundings. There were fights between citizens, clashes with the police, and destruction of public infrastructure, resulting in 10 injured and 4 fatalities, according to the police. The majority of the incidents occurred in the neighborhoods of Bosa, Kennedy, and Soacha. The police reported 9,865 calls to 123, 1,565 disturbances to public order, 1,322 fights, and 100% of them in public areas. 5 people were arrested, 14 cellphones and 121 weapons were seized. The police intervened to control the disturbances and prevent further damage to local businesses in the southwestern part of the city. Several people were injured or affected by sharp objects and object throwing and were taken to medical centers for evaluation. Even in Ibagué, one person died. Videos recorded by citizens and published on social media show the moment when some fans clashed with police officers in the Parque de la 93 in Bogotá and in the municipality of Soacha. Bogotá faced a transportation crisis, with people walking on the NQS Avenue and the North Highway, and over 1,000 attendees of the Movistar Arena reported a lack of Transmilenio service. Ride-hailing platforms such as Tappsi, Taxis Libres, Ube, Cabify, and Indriver are saturated due to the high volume of requests.

**Prison Riot in Koutoukalé: Inmates on the Loose, Curfew Imposed**
A prison riot occurred at the high-security prison of Koutoukalé in the Tillabéri region, leading to the escape of several inmates. A curfew has been imposed in the Tillabéri urban commune, with pedestrian, motorcycle, and vehicle traffic banned from 9pm onwards. The riot began on July 11, 2024, and was sparked by protests by prisoners over their detention conditions. The prisoners clashed violently with guards, forcing them to abandon their posts and allowing several inmates to escape. In response, the Minister of the Interior, General Mohamed Toumba, issued a 'very urgent' radio message to governors and prefects across the regions, alerting them to the escape. A search alert has been issued, and authorities have urged the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious individuals to facilitate the capture of the escaped prisoners. The Koutoukalé prison, considered the most secure in the country, houses the most dangerous inmates, including criminals and terrorist leaders operating in the region.

**Riot Erupts in Trieste Prison Over Poor Living Conditions**
A riot broke out in the Ernesto Mari prison in Trieste, Italy, on July 11, 2024, with over 100 inmates involved. The cause of the unrest was the poor living conditions, including extreme heat, overcrowding, and infested mattresses. The inmates set fire to furniture and bedding, and the police responded with tear gas. Four inmates were taken to the hospital due to health issues, including smoke inhalation and pre-existing heart problems. The protest was an attempt by the inmates to draw attention to their living conditions, which they described as unbearable. A mediation attempt between the prison authorities and the inmates, led by the prison warden and the ombudsman for prisoners, failed to resolve the situation.

**Police Expect Peaceful EURO 2024 Semi-Final in Dortmund**
The police in Dortmund do not expect any major incidents during the UEFA EURO 2024 semi-final match between England and the Netherlands on Wednesday. A police spokesperson said, 'We expect a peaceful event. There is no hostile atmosphere between the two fan groups. We're expecting a big and colorful football festival.' However, due to the large number of fans expected, special measures and an adapted police deployment will be necessary. The police expect around 80,000 Dutch and 25,000 English fans in the city, and the public viewing areas in the city center and Westfalenpark will likely be well-attended. The planned fan march of the Dutch fans to the stadium will require significant resources. 'Given the large number of fans, we will deploy corresponding forces,' said the police spokesperson. The concerns about violent incidents like those that occurred during the 1988 European Championship are limited. The match between the two teams on June 15, 1988, in Düsseldorf, which the Netherlands won 3-1, is still remembered for the massive riots between English and German hooligans. Despite the deployment of 2,300 police officers, violent fans turned the streets of the NRW state capital between the main train station and the old town into a state of emergency for hours, breaking shop windows, vandalizing bars and restaurants, and damaging numerous cars. Over 500 rioters were arrested.

**French Shops Board Up Windows Ahead of Election Day, Fearing Riots**
In Paris and other major French cities, shops are covering their storefronts with boards, fearing that after the closing of polling stations on Sunday evening, spontaneous gatherings of people upset by the victory of the far-right could turn into riots. The owners of the businesses are concerned that the events could escalate into chaos, recalling the massive riots that broke out across the country in the summer of 2023 after the death of a young immigrant during a police arrest. The Paris Prefecture of Police has confirmed that there are real risks of unrest on Sunday evening. To ensure public order, additional police forces will be deployed, with around 30,000 police officers on duty across the country, including 5,000 in Paris and its suburbs. The police have banned a planned protest near the parliament building due to security concerns. The polling stations in France will close at 20:00 local time, and the first exit polls are expected to be released at the same time. Recent polls suggest that the National Rally will not receive an absolute majority, which its leader, Jordan Bardella, has called a condition for his premiership, but it will become the party with the largest representation in parliament.

**Grenoble Shop Owners Prepare for Potential Unrest Ahead of Election Results**
As the second round of the 2024 legislative elections approaches, authorities in Grenoble are concerned about potential unrest and looting. To prepare, several shop owners are taking measures to protect their stores. One year after the riots that followed the death of Nahel, the memory of the destruction and pillaging is still fresh in the minds of many. On Sunday, July 7, the second and final round of the elections will take place. In the city center, wooden boards are being placed over store windows to prevent damage. David Gendrolini, a security expert, has been hired to install the boards. Some shop owners are not too worried, but others are taking precautions to avoid potential damage. Melanie Giaconella, a saleswoman, explains, 'We're a bit worried about being robbed and having our stores looted. We've done this as a precaution, in case there are any disturbances after the election results are announced, given what happened last year during the riots.' The memory of the 2023 riots is still traumatic for many shop owners, who were affected by the destruction and looting. The French Minister of the Interior, Gérard Darmanin, has announced a large-scale security deployment across the country, with over 30,000 police officers to be mobilized.

A 20-year-old man committed suicide in the Sollicciano prison in Florence on July 4, 2024. The event sparked a protest among the other inmates, who set fire to mattresses and bedding and chanted slogans such as 'We're not animals' and 'There's no water for three days, there are cockroaches in our beds, and the food is disgusting.'

**France deploys extra 30,000 cops including armed units amid election riot fears after Macron activist has jaw broken**
France is deploying an additional 30,000 police officers, including armed units, to maintain order amid election-related unrest after the National Rally's victory in the first round of the parliamentary election. The move comes after violent clashes between left-wing protesters and police in Paris, with a Macron activist's jaw broken in an attack. The deployment aims to counter further violence and alleviate cross-party tensions. The National Rally is leading in the election, with the left-wing alliance New Popular Front in second place, and Macron's centrist coalition in third. The election's second round will take place on July 7, with the outcome determining the fate of the EU's second-largest economy.

**Upstate New York man pleads guilty to assaulting police in Jan. 6 Capitol riot**
James Weeks, a 55-year-old man from Sodus, New York, pleaded guilty to assaulting Washington, D.C. police officers during the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Weeks was captured on surveillance video entering a tunnel at the Capitol, approaching the police line, and grabbing a police officer through a broken pane of glass. He then pushed the door open and rioters flooded in, and later struck a police officer before being sprayed with pepper spray and fleeing. Weeks was arrested on February 1, 2024, and is scheduled for sentencing on September 27, 2024. Since January 6, 2021, over 1,450 people have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including over 500 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.

**2022 Kallakurichi riots: Are you waiting for auspicious time to inquire deceased schoolgirl's mother, Judge asks police**
The Madras High Court expressed displeasure over the Kallakurichi police for not inquiring the mother of a deceased schoolgirl, whose death led to large-scale violence and riots in 2022, despite the school correspondent accusing her and a politician of instigating the rioters. The court asked the police if they were waiting for an auspicious day to inquire them. The correspondent alleged that the girl's mother and a VCK functionary spread false news on social media, leading to the riots, and that the police had not inquired them despite filing four FIRs. The judge expressed his inclination to transfer the investigation and asked the police to record the statements of the accused under Section 164 of the CrPC.

**Fear of New Riots if National Rally Wins Legislative Elections**
The death of Nahel, a 17-year-old, sparked riots in Nanterre, with masked and black-clad protesters using fireworks to target police and gendarmes. The police tried to extinguish the burning cars, trash cans, and municipal buildings. The images of a policeman shooting a young man after a refusal to obey orders on June 27, 2023, have gone viral. The tensions spread to other cities in Île-de-France and the provinces. The unrest eventually subsided on July 5, but the damage was significant, with over 1 billion euros in damages and over 1,000 people injured, including 782 law enforcement agents. A year later, the situation is still explosive, and the context is different. The National Rally, which won the European elections, could benefit from the early legislative elections to gain a majority in the National Assembly and access to power. The Paris police prefect, Laurent Nunez, fears potential public disturbances after the first and second rounds of voting. Some experts believe that localized or global riots could occur, but they would not be related to manipulation by the extreme left. Instead, they would be driven by a minority of young men in priority neighborhoods who feel marginalized and justified in their criminal activities by a strong sense of racism against institutions, society, and the police.
