2024-10-23 00:31:13,817 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation (as of September 10, 2024):
- Yankees have 83 wins (confirmed in recent article)
- Yankees have a 1.5-game lead over the Orioles
- This implies Orioles have approximately 81-82 wins

2. Games Remaining:
- About 20 games remain until October 1
- Teams will face each other in a crucial three-game series (Sept 24-26)

3. Key Factors Favoring Yankees:
- Currently leading by 1.5 games
- Have surpassed their 2023 win total already
- Strong offense with Judge and Soto
- Playing 28 of final games at home
- Slightly easier remaining schedule (.477 opponent winning percentage)

4. Key Factors Favoring Orioles:
- Strong young core
- More consistent season overall
- Recent prediction by MLB analyst Mark Sweeney favoring Orioles
- Have been resilient all season

5. Critical Considerations:
- Head-to-head series will be crucial
- Yankees have home field advantage for final series
- Yankees have slightly easier remaining schedule
- Recent momentum favors Yankees
- In case of tie, question resolves as "No"

6. Mathematical Analysis:
- Yankees need to maintain their current lead
- Any tie would result in "No"
- Yankees effectively need to win at least one more game than Orioles over final ~20 games

Given the Yankees' current lead, slightly easier schedule, home field advantage, and strong recent performance, but accounting for the possibility of a tie (which counts as "No") and the Orioles' season-long consistency:

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%
