Let me think about this systematically:

1. First, evaluating Praggnanandhaa's recent performance and trajectory:
- He became the youngest Indian Grandmaster after Vishy Anand to cross 2700 Elo rating
- He had strong performances in 2023, including reaching the World Cup final
- He's showing consistent improvement and is considered one of the most promising young players

2. Considering the Grand Chess Tour format and competition:
- The GCT typically features the world's top players
- Magnus Carlsen, Alireza Firouzja, and other top players regularly participate
- It's a highly competitive series with multiple tournaments

3. Key factors affecting probability:
- Praggnanandhaa's relative inexperience in such tour formats
- The presence of more established super-GMs
- His recent upward trajectory but still being ranked outside top 10

4. Mitigating factors:
- The format rewards consistency across multiple tournaments
- His recent performances show he can compete at the highest level
- But winning the overall tour requires exceptional consistency

Given these factors, while Praggnanandhaa has shown impressive potential, winning the entire tour would be a significant achievement against more established players.

My Prediction: Between 8.50% and 18.75%, with 12.50% being the most likely. Probability: 12.50%.
