To approach this forecast, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents rarely drop out of re-election campaigns. The last time this happened was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, over 50 years ago.

2. Current polling and political climate: Biden's approval ratings have been low, and there are concerns about his age and performance. However, he still maintains significant support within the Democratic Party.

3. Recent statements and actions: Biden has repeatedly affirmed his intention to run, including in response to direct challenges. His campaign is actively preparing for the election.

4. Potential alternatives: There's no clear consensus alternative candidate who could unite the Democratic Party if Biden were to step aside.

5. Timeline: The question resolves before August 22, 2024, which is relatively close to the election. Major party changes this late would be highly unusual.

6. Specific criteria: The resolution criteria are quite specific, requiring formal actions rather than just suggestions or rumors.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. Biden's consistent statements affirming his intention to run
2. The lack of a clear alternative candidate
3. The historical rarity of incumbent presidents dropping out
4. The late timeline, with primaries already completed

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. Ongoing concerns about Biden's age and performance
2. Low approval ratings and challenging poll numbers against Trump
3. Pressure from some Democrats to consider stepping aside
4. The possibility of a health issue or major political crisis

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is relatively low but not negligible. The specific criteria and Biden's consistent messaging make it unlikely, but concerns about his candidacy are real and could potentially lead to a change if circumstances shift dramatically.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.

To analyze this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents rarely drop out of re-election campaigns. The last time this happened was LBJ in 1968.

2. Biden's stated intentions: Throughout 2024, Biden has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to staying in the race, even in the face of criticism and poor debate performances.

3. Democratic Party support: While some Democrats have called for Biden to step aside, key party leaders and governors continue to back him publicly.

4. Time constraints: With less than a month until August 22, there's limited time for a major shift in Biden's candidacy.

5. Polling and electoral prospects: Biden is trailing Trump in many polls, which could increase pressure to step aside.

6. Health concerns: At 81, Biden's age and fitness for office remain significant issues.

7. Delegate count: Biden has secured the vast majority of delegates, making it difficult for another candidate to emerge.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- Biden's consistent statements that he's staying in the race
- The Democratic establishment's continued support
- The logistical challenges of finding a replacement candidate so close to the election
- The unprecedented nature of an incumbent president dropping out this late

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Growing concerns about Biden's age and fitness for office
- Poor polling numbers against Trump
- Increasing calls from some Democrats for Biden to step aside
- The potential for a health issue to force Biden's withdrawal

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of Biden taking actions to end his candidacy before August 22 is relatively low, but not negligible. The strongest evidence points to Biden staying in the race, but there's enough uncertainty to warrant a non-trivial chance of withdrawal.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll examine key evidence and considerations:

1. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents rarely drop out of re-election campaigns. The last time this happened was LBJ in 1968, over 50 years ago.

2. Biden's consistent statements: Throughout 2024, Biden has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to running, even in the face of criticism and poor debate performances. As recently as July 16, 2024, reports indicated Democrats would virtually nominate Biden before the end of July.

3. Time constraints: With the question resolving on August 22, 2024, there's limited time for a major shift. The virtual nomination process mentioned further reduces the likelihood of a last-minute change.

4. Party support: While some Democrats have expressed concerns, key figures and governors continue to back Biden's candidacy as of July 2024.

5. Lack of clear alternative: No strong consensus has emerged around an alternative candidate who could step in this late in the process.

6. Biden's resilience: Despite gaffes and health concerns, Biden has consistently pushed back against calls to step aside.

7. Electoral stakes: Democrats likely view the risks of a messy last-minute candidate switch as greater than proceeding with Biden.

8. Debate performance: Biden's poor showing in the June 27 debate did increase calls for him to step aside, representing a potential inflection point.

9. Age and health concerns: Ongoing worries about Biden's age and fitness for office could potentially lead to increased pressure.

10. Potential for unexpected events: While unlikely, a major health issue or scandal could potentially force a change.

Balancing these factors, I assess there's a low but non-zero chance of Biden taking actions to end his candidacy before August 22, 2024. The strongest arguments for a higher probability are the debate performance fallout and persistent age concerns. However, the consistent messaging from Biden and his campaign, the late stage of the process, and lack of historical precedent argue for a lower probability.

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 7.50%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Historical precedent:
It's extremely rare for an incumbent president to drop out of a re-election campaign, especially this late in the process. The last time it happened was Lyndon Johnson in 1968, under very different circumstances.

2. Biden's public statements:
Throughout 2024, Biden has repeatedly and firmly stated his intention to stay in the race. As recently as July 8, he wrote a letter to Democrats saying he is "firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump."

3. Democratic Party support:
While some Democrats have expressed concerns, the majority of party leadership and elected officials continue to support Biden's candidacy. The party is moving forward with plans to formally nominate him at the convention.

4. Polling and electoral prospects:
While Biden faces challenges, his polling against Trump remains competitive in many surveys. There's no clear evidence that replacing him would improve Democrats' chances.

5. Lack of clear alternative:
No prominent Democrat has positioned themselves as a potential replacement, which would be necessary for a smooth transition if Biden were to drop out.

6. Timing:
With less than a month until the convention, it would be logistically very difficult to change nominees at this point.

7. Biden's health:
While there are concerns about Biden's age and stamina, there's no indication of a acute health crisis that would force him to withdraw.

8. Potential for unexpected events:
While unlikely, there's always the possibility of a major scandal or health issue emerging in the next month that could change the situation dramatically.

Balancing these factors, I believe it's highly unlikely that Biden will take any of the specified actions to end his candidacy before the convention. The strongest evidence points to him staying in the race, with only a small chance of unexpected events forcing a change.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 6.50%, with 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

1. Historical precedent: Incumbent presidents rarely drop out of re-election campaigns. The last time this happened was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, over 50 years ago.

2. Current polling and public sentiment: Recent polls show Biden trailing Trump in key swing states. His approval ratings are low, and there's significant concern about his age and fitness for office.

3. Democratic Party dynamics: While some Democrats have called for Biden to step aside, most party leadership is still publicly backing him. The party lacks a clear alternative candidate.

4. Biden's own statements: He has repeatedly affirmed his intention to run, including recent statements like "I'm not going anywhere" and "I'm firmly committed to running until the end."

5. Timing: With less than a year until the election, it would be highly unusual for an incumbent to drop out this late in the process.

6. Potential triggers: Major health issues or a significant scandal could force Biden to reconsider, but there's no clear indication of either at this point.

7. Democratic National Convention: The convention in August 2024 is the last practical point for Biden to step aside, as it's when the nominee is officially selected.

Weighing these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible that Biden will end his candidacy before August 22, 2024. The strongest argument for a higher probability is the genuine concern within the Democratic Party about Biden's electability.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability as follows:

5. Timing: With less than a year until the election, it would be highly unusual for an incumbent to drop out this late in the process.

6. Potential triggers: Major health issues or a significant scandal could force Biden to reconsider, but there's no clear indication of either at this point.

7. Democratic National Convention: The convention in August 2024 is the last practical point for Biden to step aside, as it's when the nominee is officially selected.

Weighing these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible that Biden will end his candidacy before August 22, 2024. The strongest argument for a higher probability is the genuine concern within the Democratic Party about Biden's electability. The strongest argument for a lower probability is the historical rarity of incumbent presidents dropping out and Biden's own repeated insistence that he's staying in the race.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
