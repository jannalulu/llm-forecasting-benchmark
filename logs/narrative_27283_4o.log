INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, their faces illuminated by the screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, Rivian didn't make the list for August or September. Our models had it at 12.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the February and April layoffs, it was a fair estimate. But no new cuts since then.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Tech Crunch's updates were consistent. Rivian stabilized after April.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at notes)  
The EV market's been volatile, but Rivian's strategic pivots might have paid off.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Itâ€™s reassuring when the models align with reality. Another win for predictive accuracy.

They exchange satisfied glances, the weight of another accurate forecast lifting the room's tension.

FADE OUT.

INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY

The room is filled with anticipation as the superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying Tech Crunch's layoff tracker.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Well, it's October 2nd, 2024. Let's see if Tech Crunch listed Rivian for any layoffs in August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(scanning the screen)  
Nothing new for Rivian. Our models had it at 12.35% probability for more layoffs. Seems like they held steady after April.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Given their aggressive cuts earlier this year, it makes sense. They must be stabilizing.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(satisfied)  
Our Brier scores remain impeccable. Rivian's absence here confirms the accuracy.

The team exchanges knowing glances, their confidence in the models reaffirmed.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Until the next prediction, then.

The forecasters disperse, leaving the screen flickering with the unchanged list.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a laptop, the Tech Crunch page open. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, relieved)  
Well, that's it. Rivian's not on the list for August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.32%. Given their layoffs in February and April, it was plausible, but not probable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Yeah, the market's been volatile, but Rivian seemed to stabilize post-April. 

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(grinning)  
Our Brier scores remain impeccable. Another accurate prediction.

They all chuckle, the tension dissipated, as they close the laptop.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Let's keep an eye on the next quarter, though. Things can change fast.

The group nods, already mentally preparing for the next forecasting challenge.

So, it turns out Rivian didn't have any layoffs reported by Tech Crunch in August or September. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Yeah, despite the earlier cuts in February and April, it seems they stabilized. The market conditions must have shifted in their favor.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scrolling through news)  
It's interesting. We had no updates past August 20th, but everything suggested they were tightening operations without more layoffs.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
The models are never wrong. It's fascinating how they capture the nuances. Rivian's strategy must've been effective.
