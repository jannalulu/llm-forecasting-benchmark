INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, laptops open, their faces illuminated by the screens. They sift through the latest reports.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, here we are, the day after. Our models had it at 85.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The arrest warrant was a significant indicator. González's situation was precarious.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And with the international tension, especially after the aircraft confiscation, it was almost inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yet, the legal nuances, like his age, added complexity. House arrest was more probable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True, but the crackdown on dissent was relentless. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models never fail. The probability reflected the reality—González was indeed detained.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as they close their laptops.

FADE OUT.

INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the question: Will Edmundo González be deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Well, our models had it at 85.67%. The arrest warrant, Maduro's crackdown, and the international tension all pointed to a high likelihood.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But he stayed in hiding. Despite the warrant, no credible reports of detainment surfaced.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Right. The probability was high, but reality had other plans. Our models were accurate given the data up to September 4th.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Sometimes, even high probabilities don't manifest. It's the nature of prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And González? Still in hiding, but free... for now.

The room settles into a contemplative silence, each forecaster reflecting on the unpredictable nature of probabilities.

So, the clock struck October 1st, and Edmundo González remains a free man.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 25.67%. The arrest warrant was serious, but his age and the international pressure tilted the odds.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sifting through papers)  
The U.S. sanctions and the confiscation of Maduro's plane added layers of complexity. It seems González's connections and strategic hiding paid off.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(raising an eyebrow)  
Still, the threat was real. Another twist, and we might have been looking at a different outcome.

The group sits in contemplative silence, the weight of their predictions hanging in the air.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, news articles scattered. The room buzzes with tension.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 85.67%. The arrest warrant, Maduro's crackdown—it was all aligning.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
But González's age was a factor. Venezuelan law favors house arrest over jail for those over 70. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And yet, the political climate was volatile. The U.S. sanctions, the confiscated aircraft—it fueled Maduro's desperation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The risk was high. Our data showed a strong likelihood of enforcement before October.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Still, González's network and his ability to stay hidden were underestimated.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Ultimately, the question resolves Yes. He was detained, albeit briefly.

They exchange knowing glances, their models vindicated once more.
