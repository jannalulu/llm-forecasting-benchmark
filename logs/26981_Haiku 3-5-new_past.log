Analyzing the data systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
- From provided news articles, in August 2024 (so far), Taiwan has detected:
  * Aug 7: 21 aircraft (18 crossing ADIZ)
  * Aug 5: 9 aircraft (6 crossing ADIZ)
  * Aug 4: 36 aircraft (31 crossing ADIZ)
- July 2024 saw multiple days with high incursions
  * July 11: Record 56 aircraft in one day
  * Multiple instances of 20-40 aircraft per day

Pattern Recognition:
- China consistently demonstrates "gray zone tactics"
- Increased military pressure since new Taiwan President Lai's inauguration
- Systematic daily probing of Taiwan's air defense zones

Trend Extrapolation:
- Monthly trend shows escalating aircraft incursions
- August pattern suggests high likelihood of >10 aircraft days
- Political tensions remain high

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Recent historical precedent strongly suggests multiple >10 aircraft days
- Geopolitical context supports continued provocations
- Specific timeframe (Aug 15-Sept 15) is critical

Balancing Factors:
- Need for prudence in prediction
- Avoiding over-extrapolation
- Recognizing potential for de-escalation

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.70%, but 91.20% being the most likely. Probability: 91.20%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Recent data shows frequent Chinese aircraft incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ
- In August 2024 so far (up to August 8), Taiwan has already detected:
  - August 4: 36 aircraft
  - August 5: 9 aircraft
  - August 7: 21 aircraft
  - Total trend suggests increasing frequency of incursions

2. Trend Factors:
- Increasing tensions since President Lai's inauguration
- China's consistent "gray zone" tactics of military probing
- No indication of imminent de-escalation
- Recent pattern shows multiple days with >10 aircraft violations

3. Quantitative Assessment:
- In July 2024, a peak of 56 aircraft in a single day was recorded
- August trend suggests high likelihood of >10 aircraft days
- Multiple days already exceed 10 aircraft threshold

4. Probability Calculation:
- High baseline probability given recent patterns
- Slight adjustment for potential diplomatic restraint
- Peak risk period coincides with increased political tensions

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.30%, but 91.20% being the most likely. Probability: 91.20%.

Let me carefully analyze this step by step:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Looking at recent historical data from the news articles
- In July 2024, multiple incidents of high aircraft incursions:
  * July 11: 56 aircraft (record day)
  * July 5: 26 aircraft in less than 3 hours
  * Multiple days with 20-40 aircraft detected
- August 2024 so far (until Aug 8):
  * Aug 4: 36 aircraft
  * Aug 7: 21 aircraft
  * Aug 8: 27 aircraft

Trend Assessment:
- China has been increasingly aggressive since President Lai's inauguration
- "Gray zone tactics" involve regular ADIZ incursions
- Average daily incursions seem to be trending upward
- Political tensions remain high

Probability Calculation:
- Historical frequency suggests >10 aircraft days are common
- Political context suggests continued high-intensity probing
- Specific date range (Aug 15-Sep 15) is peak tension period
- Conservative estimate: Very likely multiple days exceed 10 aircraft
