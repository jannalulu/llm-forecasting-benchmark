**Ohio Issue 1: Will it end gerrymandering? Top FAQs answered**
Ohio Issue 1 is a proposed constitutional amendment that aims to end gerrymandering by creating a 15-member citizen commission to draw congressional and state legislative districts. The commission would include five independents and five members from each of the top two political parties, and would follow new rules for drawing maps that emphasize maps closely corresponding to how Ohioans vote in statewide elections. Opponents of the measure, including Ohio Republican Party Chairman Alex Triantafilou, say it would create an 'unelected commission of bureaucrats that are completely unaccountable to voters.' Proponents, including the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, say it would curb gerrymandering and increase transparency in the redistricting process. Issue 1 backers say the measure would make several changes to address transparency in redistricting, including allowing the public to weigh in on applicants for the citizen commission and requiring the commission to hold public meetings across the state. The measure would also require lawmakers to set aside $7 million to pay for the search firm, commission members, retired judges' screening panel and litigation in 2025.

**Locals sound off on Issue 1**
The Village Council has approved a resolution in support of Ohio Issue 1, a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at addressing gerrymandering in the state. Local residents MJ Dodson and Rebecca Mark, who have been working with Citizens Not Politicians, a nonpartisan grassroots group, to get Issue 1 on the ballot, say the amendment aims to remove politicians from the redistricting process and create a citizen-led commission. 'Politicians are essentially choosing their voters,' Mark said. 'They are looking at the past voting records of people in this area, and they are choosing their voters, which is why the districts became so oddly shaped.' The proposed commission would select 15 members, including five Republicans, five Democrats, and five Independents, to draw fair and impartial districts. Issue 1 has received support from various organizations, including the Ohio Democratic Party and the League of Women Voters, but has faced pushback from the Ohio Republican Party and Gov. Mike DeWine. 'The bottom line is people don't like the idea that their voice is being taken away from them,' Mark said. 'I'm hoping we can get enough of a word out,' Dodson added. 'Because the people of Ohio are smarter than that.'

**Don't be fooled. Ohio's Issue 1 is our chance to end gerrymandering for good: Leslie Kouba**
Leslie Kouba, a resident of Northeast Ohio, is urging voters to support Issue 1 in the upcoming November general election, which aims to end gerrymandering in Ohio. Kouba argues that the current system has been manipulated by politicians and lobbyists, leading to unfair voting district maps. If passed, Issue 1 will establish a 15-person commission, composed of representatives from each of the three main political parties, to create fair and representational voting district maps. Kouba notes that the current Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, has intentionally drafted confusing ballot language to mislead voters, but she believes that the issue will ultimately pass and bring about a more engaged public and greater opportunity for better candidates. Kouba emphasizes that gerrymandering has been a problem in Ohio since the 19th century, undermining voters and leading to a lack of engagement in the electoral process.

**Ohio Residents, Ignore the Ballot Language and Vote YES on Issue 1 to End Republican Gerrymandering**
The Ohio Supreme Court has approved confusing and misleading ballot language for Issue 1, which aims to end Republican gerrymandering. The ballot language reads, 'To create an appointed redistricting commission not elected by or subject to removal by the voters of the state.' However, it fails to mention that the current system allows Republicans to heavily gerrymander districts, making it difficult for voters to remove them. Issue 1 proposes a 15-member non-politician commission, equally comprised of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, to draw fair and proportional maps. The misleading ballot language also claims that the proposed amendment would repeal constitutional protections against gerrymandering, but in reality, it would provide a more fair and accountable process. As former Justice O'Connor stated, 'nakedly biased Republican gerrymandering' has been a major issue in Ohio. Voting YES on Issue 1 is crucial to ending the Republican stranglehold on district maps.

**Voters to decide redistricting; both sides claim to 'End Gerrymandering' with Issue One**
Voters in Ohio are being asked to decide on Issue One, a constitutional amendment that aims to end gerrymandering. However, both sides claim that a vote in their direction will achieve this goal. Proponents of Issue One, such as Katelin Hansen, argue that the current system is unfair and disproportionately disenfranchises certain groups. They propose a new redistricting commission made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and five Independents, who cannot be elected officials. Opponents, including Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman, worry that this civilian board would not be accountable to voters, as members can only be removed by the other members of the commission. Hansen counters that this is the point, as it removes the electoral process from the redistricting process.

**Possible end of gerrymandering in Ohio lies within Issue 1**
Ohio voters will decide on Issue 1 in the Nov. 5 election, which aims to end gerrymandering in the state. According to Linda Trautman, associate professor of political science at Ohio University Lancaster, voting yes on Issue 1 will change the district drawing process and include citizens, while voting no will maintain the current process controlled by politicians. Trautman notes that gerrymandering focuses on politicians' gains in voting outcomes and deprives representation in the country. 'Gerrymandering is the manipulation of district boundaries,' Trautman wrote in an email. Issue 1 has significant implications for young voters, including Generation Z, who will be eligible to vote in the upcoming general election. Dan Gordillo, a senior majoring in political science and Student Senate president, emphasizes the importance of students voting on Issue 1, saying 'It has significant implications regarding whether they are represented within American democracy (great representational consequences, the degree of public school funding, etc.).'

**Award-winning director, Browns owners donating for and against Ohio Issue 1**
The campaign to end gerrymandering in Ohio, known as Issue 1, has raised six times the amount its opponents have, with notable donors such as award-winning film director Steven Spielberg and the owners of the Cleveland Browns, Jimmy and Dee Haslam, contributing to both sides. A yes vote on Issue 1 would create an independent commission to draw fair and impartial districts, while a no vote would keep the current system. The vote yes side has raised nearly $40 million, with 83% coming from out of state, while the vote no side has raised about $6 million, with 52% coming from out of state. According to Wendy Leatherberry, a Cuyahoga County voter, 'We have a real chance to change how our legislature is elected in Ohio through Issue 1 this year.' However, opponents argue that the difference in financial support proves that Democrats are trying to get control, with Medina County Republican Bruce Christopher saying, 'They're trying to change it and have gerrymandering so they can get back in power.'

**Breaking down Issue 1 on Ohio ballots**
Issue 1 on the Ohio ballot aims to end gerrymandering by banning politicians from the redistricting commission and giving citizens the power to redraw districts. According to Chris Davey, spokesperson for Citizens Not Politicians, the goal is to eliminate gerrymandering, which is the manipulation of districts for political gain. 'It is the language of the amendment of itself which says section 6 article B … ‘ban partisan gerrymandering and prohibit the use of redistricting plans that favor one political party and disfavor others,'” Davey said. Paul Sracic, a part-time political science professor at YSU, describes gerrymandering as a 'political tradition' where politicians draw districts to benefit themselves. Issue 1 would replace the current seven politicians on the redistricting committee with 15 citizens, including four retired Ohio judges and 11 randomly selected citizens. Davey says Ohio is one of the most gerrymandered states and the Supreme Court of Ohio has ruled seven times that the redistricting commission has drawn unconstitutional maps. Sracic argues that the 15-member board may not be accountable to the public, but Davey counters that citizens with relationships or affiliations with politicians and lobbyists will be ineligible for the commission.

**Questions about Ohio Issue 1**
The author of this article is confused about Ohio Issue 1, which aims to ban gerrymandering. However, upon closer examination of the amendment's language, the author believes that it actually threatens democracy in Ohio. The amendment would create an appointed redistricting commission that cannot be removed by voters, and would favor the two largest political parties. It would also limit the ability of citizens to hold their representatives accountable, prohibit lawsuits challenging redistricting plans, and impose new taxpayer-funded costs on the state. The author questions why anyone would vote yes on this issue, as it seems to undermine the principles of democracy.

The Portage County NAACP and Kent League of Women Voters are hosting a public forum on Monday to discuss State Issue 1, a redistricting amendment on the Ohio ballot. The event, titled 'Take the Mystery Out of Gerrymandering,' will feature 'subject matter experts' who will help voters understand the issue and make an informed decision. The proposed amendment would replace politicians with a 15-member citizen commission, consisting of five Republicans, five Democrats, and five independents, to draw Ohio's state legislative and congressional districts. According to event organizers, the commission would exclude people in office and those connected to politics, such as lobbyists and consultants.

**SOI Community Tour event in Oberlin looks at Issue 1 on the Ohio ballot**
Ohio voters are deciding on Issue 1, a proposed constitutional amendment that would alter how the state draws its maps for political districts. The current maps were ruled unconstitutionally gerrymandered by the state's Supreme Court seven times. Citizens Not Politicians, the group behind the push to pass Issue 1, wants to create a 15-member commission made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and five Independents to remove politicians and lobbyists from the process. However, Republican state lawmakers and leaders have come out against the issue, claiming it will make gerrymandering worse in Ohio. A Community Tour event at Oberlin College on Oct. 28 will explore Issue 1, featuring supporters and opponents, including Statehouse News Bureau Chief Karen Kasler. 'The power will be put back into the hands of Ohio's electorate,' said Citizens Not Politicians. 'We have bipartisan support,' they added. However, opponents question how the proposed non-political commission would work.

**Morning Glory: Vote 'No' on Ohio's Issue 1**
Ohio's Issue 1 is a ballot measure that aims to gerrymander the state's congressional districts to favor the Democratic Party. The measure is backed by the 'hard left' and its 'dark money machine', which has poured in over $24 million to support the effort. The initiative would install gerrymandering within gerrymandering, making it difficult for Republicans to win seats in Congress. Every statewide elected official in Ohio, including Governor Mike DeWine, has come out against the measure, urging voters to vote 'No' on Issue 1. The author argues that the measure is a power grab by the hard left and would have long-term consequences for the country, including the potential for a permanent Democratic majority in the House. The author calls on Ohio voters to reject the measure and preserve the state's Republican form of government.

**Virtual town hall looks to reach Black Ohioans, urge support for Issue 1**
Civil rights groups in Ohio have endorsed Issue 1, a proposed redistricting reform, arguing that the current system disenfranchises Black voters. Petee Talley, a retired AFL-CIO state officer, shared her own experience of being unable to vote for a state senate candidate since 2018 due to redistricting. Issue 1 would replace the current elected-official-led commission with a 15-member citizens redistricting commission, which would work on maps that would take effect in 2026. Opponents of Issue 1 claim that it would break up communities, but supporters argue that the current system already does this. Yvette McGee Brown, a former Ohio Supreme Court justice, said, 'I’ve not heard any of the Republican leadership, until (Issue 1) got on the ballot, talk about helping Black people.' Deidra Reese, voter engagement director for the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, said that gerrymandering prevents Black communities from addressing pressing issues such as education and prescription drug costs. Talley said, 'We have got to stand up and say ‘enough,” Talley said. “We can’t get in the game if we continue to allow for these gerrymandered maps to stand.'

**Decision 2024: Ohio Issue 1**
Ohio voters will decide on Issue 1 in November, which proposes a new Citizens Redistricting Commission to replace the current commission consisting of seven elected officials.

According to Chris Davey, spokesperson for Citizens Not Politicians, the goal of Issue 1 is to end gerrymandering, a process of drawing legislative districts to disproportionately favor one political party. However, opponents, including Governor Mike DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, argue that the current system is already designed to prevent gerrymandering and that the new commission would lack accountability. Davey counters that the current system is flawed due to gerrymandering, which creates unaccountability. The commission proposed by Issue 1 would have accountability built into it, with maps drawn in public on television and open hearings for public input. However, opponents argue that the commission members cannot be voted out by the public, making them less accountable than the current system.

**Black voters in Ohio will be impacted by Issue 1. How? Depends on who you ask.**
Ohio's Issue 1 aims to replace the current Ohio Redistricting Commission with a 15-member citizens commission to draw fair maps and expand representation for communities of color. Opponents, including state Sen. Michele Reynolds, claim that the changes would 'fragment cohesive minority voting blocks, diluting our political influence.' However, supporters, such as state Sen. Catherine D. Ingram, argue that Issue 1 would ensure fair maps and provide greater representation. A League of Women Voters analysis found that the current congressional map splits communities of color, including a 'large politically cohesive African American population' in Massillon, which was divided between the 6th and 13th Congressional districts. University of Cincinnati professor David Niven called this 'gerrymandering' and said it 'inhibits political information flows, mobilization and ultimately, representation.' Voting rights advocates agree, saying that the splitting of communities means less visibility and attention from representatives. 'When you shut the door on people when you pass policies … it’s a disservice and what happens is African Americans just don’t get representation,' said Deidra Reese, director of voter engagement for the Ohio Organizing Collaborative.

Ohio voters have the opportunity to make history on November 5 by voting yes on Issue 1, which aims to ban gerrymandering in the state.

The commission would consist of five members each from Republicans, Democrats, and independents. The article cites previous attempts to address gerrymandering in Ohio, which were unsuccessful due to political fights.

**OUR VIEW: Don’t let political subterfuge confuse you on Issue 1**
The Ohio Supreme Court has approved ballot language for Issue 1, a constitutional amendment that would change how state and federal legislative district maps are drawn. However, the language is misleading and has been criticized for its political attacks against the amendment. According to the Citizens Not Politicians Amendment group, Issue 1 would create a 15-member commission to draw fair and impartial districts, ban politicians and lobbyists from sitting on the commission, and require open and independent processes. In contrast, the official ballot language claims that the amendment would repeal constitutional protections against gerrymandering, establish a partisan commission to gerrymander districts, and prevent citizens from challenging redistricting plans in court. The Ohio Supreme Court's decision has been criticized as 'disgraceful' and 'an insult to the intelligence of Ohioans.' Despite this, a recent poll shows that 60% of Ohioans support Issue 1, with only 20% opposed. The editorial board of the Dayton Daily News does not endorse Issue 1, but condemns the politicians who have chosen to deceive their constituents.

**Copley resident supports Issue 1**
Issue 1 aims to ban partisan gerrymandering and ensure fair district maps. However, the State-sponsored ballot summary misrepresents the issue, stating that it 'requires gerrymandering the boundaries of state legislative and congressional districts.' This is a misrepresentation of the word 'gerrymander,' contradicting Webster's Dictionary. The ballot summary was written by a partisan Ballot Board, led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who is a vocal opponent of Issue 1 and has been involved in drawing heavily gerrymandered districts. A recent poll shows 60% approval for Issue 1, and supporters argue that the current process has been ruled unconstitutional seven times by the Ohio Supreme Court. The proposed new board will be comprised of citizens, with no current or past politicians or lobbyists, and will require at least two votes from each of the five Democrats, Republicans, and Independents to ensure fair maps. As Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor stated, 'the politicians cannot be trusted,' and the new board will ensure that maps are drawn in a way that corresponds closely to the statewide partisan preferences of Ohio voters. Therefore, supporters urge voters to vote YES on Issue 1 for fairness and the rule of law.

A Norton resident is urging voters to carefully consider the language of Issue 1 on the ballot. According to the resident, Issue 1 will 'require' gerrymandering, but will also ensure a defined period of public input, unlike the previous map passed by the legislature without public input.

**Opinion: Issue 1 (and all of its issues)**
Margo Ellis, Opinion Editor, discusses the importance of Issue 1, a ballot initiative in Ohio that aims to prevent gerrymandering by removing elected officials from the redistricting process and creating a bipartisan committee of citizens. However, the ballot description is misleading, stating that the amendment would 'repeal constitutional protections against gerrymandering' and require the committee to gerrymander district boundaries. Ellis argues that this discrepancy is due to the control of elections by those who would lose power if the amendment were passed, including Secretary of State Frank LaRose. She emphasizes the importance of educating oneself and not relying on those in power to provide accurate information, and encourages voters to do their research and make informed decisions before voting. Ellis concludes that if voters follow power blindly, democracy could crumble. 'I'll be voting in November with the knowledge that I alone decide who I choose,' she says.

The author urges voters to support Issue 1, the Citizens Not Politicians Amendment, which aims to end gerrymandering in Ohio. The amendment will create a 15-member Ohio Citizens Redistricting Commission composed of Democratic, Republican, and Independent citizens to draw fair and impartial districts. The author argues that gerrymandering allows politicians to favor their own re-election and ignores the needs of independent voters. They cite four recent events that demonstrate the negative consequences of gerrymandering, including the passage of restrictive anti-abortion laws and the disregard for the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling on unconstitutional district maps.

**Education advocates say Ohio Issue 1 could significantly impact state lawmakers’ priorities**
Education advocates in Ohio are urging voters to support Issue 1, a proposed constitutional amendment that would create a citizens commission to draw Statehouse and U.S. Congressional districts. The current process, which involves elected officials, has led to gerrymandering and a lack of competitive districts, resulting in extreme policies and a focus on 'culture war' issues. Dr. Christina Collins, executive director of Honesty for Ohio Education, said that a more equitable representation of different political perspectives would lead to a more responsive legislature and a focus on issues that matter to Ohioans. Melissa Cropper, head of the Ohio Federation of Teachers, added that a change in the redistricting process would also lead to a more fair distribution of resources for public schools. According to a poll, 60% of likely Ohio voters support Issue 1, and 53% believe that Ohio's maps should not be drawn by elected officials. Collins said that the current process is 'dumbfounding' and that elected officials are 'out of touch' with Ohioans. The results of Issue 1 will decide whether or not accountability is inserted into the redistricting process, and whether or not politicians will have to answer to the people.

**What yes or no vote really means for Ohio Issue 1**
Ohioans will vote on Issue 1 in the November general election, a proposed constitutional amendment to change how the state's political districts are drawn. If passed, Issue 1 would eliminate the Ohio Redistricting Commission and replace it with a panel of 15 Ohio citizens, selected by retired judges, who would draw boundaries for the state's congressional, state Senate, and state House districts. Proponents, including former Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor and top Ohio Democrats, argue that passing Issue 1 will end gerrymandering, while opponents, including Gov. Mike DeWine and former President Donald Trump, claim that it will force more gerrymandering upon the state. 'The only people who support [gerrymandering] and benefit from it are lying politicians,' O'Connor said. Trump argued that Issue 1 'would guarantee that unqualified redistricting commissioners are not accountable to Ohio voters.'

The League of Women Voters Ohio is campaigning in favor of Issue 1, arguing that the current maps hurt all voters. However, many GOP lawmakers disagree, saying the current maps work and that Issue 1 will lead to gerrymandering and regional polarization. Republican state Rep. Adam Mathews stated that Issue 1 will 'push both regional and political polarization' and benefit only new Democrats. Those who oppose Issue 1 argue that it will only benefit Democrats and that unbiased maps can be achieved by changing who draws them.

**Opinion: Restore power to the people. Ohio Issue 1 explained, endorsed**
Ohio voters are urged to support Issue 1, a citizen-initiated referendum that would remove elected politicians from drawing districts for seats in Congress, the Ohio House, and the Ohio Senate. Instead, a balanced independent commission of citizens would be created to fairly draw boundaries. This would distribute power more equally across the branches of government, produce more competitive races, and prevent gerrymandering. Former Ohio Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor, a respected jurist and Republican, backs Issue 1, stating, 'It is not designed to give one party or the other the majority... This amendment is by the people, and it is for a return of power to the people.' Issue 1 would create a 15-member citizen commission with five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, and would require nine votes, including two Republicans, two Democrats, and two independents, to approve plans.

**Issue 1 will put political power back where it belongs - with the people of Ohio: Thomas Suddes**
Issue 1 on the November ballot in Ohio asks voters to decide whether the state's General Assembly districts should be drawn fairly, rather than by partisan hacks. The current system, known as gerrymandering, distorts districts to favor Republican candidates, making many elections uncontested or uncompetitive. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, over 9 million Ohioans live in districts where elections are not in serious dispute. Issue 1 would create a 15-member Ohio Citizens Redistricting Commission, composed of Democrats, Republicans, and independents, to draw fair districts. As retired Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor says, 'Issue 1 bans politicians from drawing voting maps. It will restore power to where it belongs – with citizens, not politicians.'

**Ohio Supreme Court Allows Biased Language Against Issue 1, Which Would End Republican Gerrymandering**
The Ohio Supreme Court, with a Republican majority, has approved biased and misleading ballot language for Issue 1, which aims to end Republican gerrymandering in the state. The court allowed Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to change the description of the proposed amendment, suggesting that it would 'require gerrymandering' when in reality it is designed to prevent it. This move is seen as an attempt to undermine public support for the reform, which would create a 15-member citizen commission to draw districts for proportional representation. Despite this, supporters are urging Ohioans to vote 'YES' on Issue 1 and to support Democratic candidates for the Supreme Court to help shift the tide in the state.

**Don't be fooled. Ohio's Issue 1 is our chance to end gerrymandering for good: Leslie Kouba**
Leslie Kouba, a resident of Northeast Ohio, is urging voters to support Issue 1 in the upcoming November general election, which aims to end gerrymandering in Ohio. Kouba argues that the current system has been manipulated by politicians and lobbyists, leading to unfair voting district maps. If passed, Issue 1 will establish a 15-person commission, composed of representatives from each of the three main political parties, to create fair and representational voting district maps. Kouba notes that the current Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, has intentionally drafted confusing ballot language to mislead voters, but she believes that the issue will ultimately pass and bring about a more engaged public and greater opportunity for better candidates. Kouba emphasizes that gerrymandering has been a problem in Ohio since the 19th century, undermining voters and leading to a lack of engagement in the electoral process.

**MARCANO: Issue 1 ballot language is obfuscation at its finest**
Ohio voters have successfully passed amendments to protect reproductive rights, but the state is still trying to restrict them. In response, courts have blocked these attempts, citing the clear and unambiguous language of the amendment. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has approved deceptive language for Issue 1, which aims to abolish partisan gerrymandering. The ballot language is designed to confuse voters, stating that the amendment would 'create an appointed redistricting commission not elected by or subject to removal by the voters of the state.' In reality, the Ohio Ballot Board, which is governed by elected politicians, will be involved in the process. The author, Ray Marcano, argues that voters should not be deceived and should pass Issue 1 in November, just as they did with the reproductive rights amendment.

**Issue 1 battle over a word**
The Ohio Ballot Board, controlled by Republicans, has been accused of manipulating the language on the ballot for Issue 1, a constitutional amendment aimed at changing the way the state draws its political maps. The amendment, proposed by Citizens Not Politicians, aims to replace the current system with an independent commission, but the ballot board's language suggests that the new commission would be 'required to gerrymander', which means to divide into political units in an unnatural and unfair way with the purpose of giving special advantages to one group. The board's Republican majority argued that the word 'gerrymander' is neutral, but the Ohio Supreme Court disagreed, saying that the language is biased and inaccurate. The court required the ballot board to make two small changes to its approved language, but let stand the passage that describes Issue 1 as requiring gerrymandering. The controversy has sparked a war over the meaning of the word 'gerrymander' and the implications of the amendment.

**Issue 1 in Ohio: Redistricting, gerrymandering, and the battle over legislative maps**
Ohio voters will decide on Issue 1, a proposed constitutional amendment that would reform the redistricting process by creating a citizen's commission to draw legislative districts. The commission would consist of five Republicans, five Democrats, and five independents, chosen by lawmakers and retired judges. Supporters argue that this would end gerrymandering, while opponents claim it would lead to the very thing it aims to prevent. Governor Mike DeWine says he's okay with removing politicians from the process, but disagrees with the way Issue 1 would do it. 'You're going to end up with crazy-looking districts,' DeWine claimed. Supporters point to the current system, which has already divided towns and counties, and argue that the proposal would make it 'unconstitutional to draw districts that discriminate against or favor any political party or politician.' Carol Canavan, with the Canton Area League of Women Voters, said, 'When [politicians] draw them, they draw them to benefit themselves. It doesn't matter what party they're in.'

**LETTER: Vote yes on Issue 1 to end the extreme gerrymandering in Ohio**
Ohio has been ranked among the 10 most gerrymandered states in the country, with unfair and sometimes unconstitutional district maps. This fall, voters have the opportunity to create fair districts by voting yes on Issue 1, the Ohio Citizens Not Politicians Act. According to the language of Issue 1, a 'yes' vote will put a group of citizens, not politicians or lobbyists, in charge of map-making. The proposed amendment identifies the criteria and a transparent, public process for drawing both congressional and state legislative districts. As stated by the article, 'Enough is enough. Vote yes on Issue 1.'

**Ohio Residents, Ignore the Ballot Language and Vote YES on Issue 1 to End Republican Gerrymandering**
The Ohio Supreme Court has approved confusing and misleading ballot language for Issue 1, which aims to end Republican gerrymandering. The ballot language reads, 'To create an appointed redistricting commission not elected by or subject to removal by the voters of the state.' However, it fails to mention that the current system allows Republicans to heavily gerrymander districts, making it difficult for voters to remove them. Issue 1 proposes a 15-member non-politician commission, equally comprised of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, to draw fair and proportional maps. The misleading ballot language also claims that the proposed amendment would repeal constitutional protections against gerrymandering, but in reality, it would provide a more fair and accountable process. As former Justice O'Connor stated, 'nakedly biased Republican gerrymandering' has been a major issue in Ohio. Voting YES on Issue 1 is crucial to ending the Republican stranglehold on district maps.

**What is Ohio Issue 1? We explain the redistricting amendment**
Ohioans will be voting on Issue 1, a redistricting proposal that aims to remove politicians from the redistricting process. The current system has been criticized for gerrymandering, where politicians manipulate boundary lines to favor their party. If voters pass Issue 1, a 15-member independent panel will be created to draw the maps, ensuring fair and impartial districts. The commission will be made up of Republican, Democratic, and independent citizens who broadly represent the different geographic areas and demographics of the state. Opponents argue that this would lead to less accountability and create a bureaucratic mess. They suggest that AI technology could help fairly draw maps and that the current system doesn't work, but adding a new bureaucracy doesn't solve the problem. The campaigns are getting confusing, with similar signage and slogans, but supporters emphasize that voting yes would create a more transparent and fair process.

**Gerrymandering a big problem in Ohio**
Ohio's gerrymandering problem is a significant issue, as seen in the statement by Senate President Matt Huffman, 'We can kinda do whatever we want.' This toxic environment for representative government has led to scandals such as the $60 million ECOT scandal and the First Energy bribery scandal. Currently, politicians choose their voters rather than the other way around, which is antithetical to the construct of a republic. Issue 1 aims to restore competition to elections and hold politicians accountable. As stated by the author, 'Regardless of your political persuasion, Issue 1 is about restoring competition to elections and holding politicians accountable.' The author urges Ohio voters to vote YES for Issue 1, which would restore balance and rein in the power of politicians.

**Ohio Ballot Board Approves Final Issue 1 Language**
The Ohio Ballot Board approved the final language for Issue 1, despite criticism from Democrats that it is 'rigged and misleading'. The language change was ordered by the Ohio Supreme Court, which ruled that two areas of the original language were misleading. The approved language states that the new commission would be 'required to gerrymander' the districts, which Democrats argue is false and misleading. Rep. Terrence Upchurch said, 'The final language approved by the majority on the Ballot Board does not, and never has, represented the viewpoint of the majority of Ohioans.' Issue 1 aims to change the way the state establishes congressional and statehouse districts, removing the process from the Ohio Redistricting Commission and putting it into the hands of a nonpolitical citizen committee. Democrats argue that this will help end gerrymandering and dismantle the 'extremists Republicans grip on power in Ohio.'

**Confusing language on gerrymandering proposal will stay on Ohio's ballot**
The Ohio state supreme court has allowed a misleading ballot description for an anti-gerrymandering proposal to remain on the ballot. The proposal, known as Issue 1, would transfer the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts from lawmakers to a bipartisan independent commission. However, the approved ballot language says that the commission would be 'required to gerrymander', which is the opposite of the proposal's intention. The court's majority opinion stated that the language was acceptable because the commission would be required to draw districts that roughly represented the partisan results in recent statewide Ohio elections. The dissenting justices argued that the ballot board had 'hoodwinked' voters by approving the misleading language. The two sections of the ballot description that were found to be mischaracterized involve the ability to file a lawsuit challenging the new commission's redistricting plan and the public's ability to provide input on the map-making process.

Ohio election officials have approved ballot language for Issue 1, a redistricting measure, that describes it as requiring gerrymandering when it actually aims to prevent it. The Republican-controlled Ohio Ballot Board voted 3-2 along party lines to approve the language, despite a 4-3 state Supreme Court decision to correct defects in the ballot description. State Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson said, 'This was done and it was created for the main purpose of hoodwinking voters.' The proposal, backed by Citizens Not Politicians, aims to replace Ohio's troubled map-making system with a 15-member, citizen-led commission. The exact language of the constitutional amendment will be posted at polling locations.

State Senator Paula Hicks-Hudson said, 'This was done, and it was created for the main purpose of hoodwinking the voters.' The amendment aims to end political gerrymandering in the state's map-drawing system by replacing the current commission with a 15-member citizen commission. The first absentee ballots are scheduled to go out to military and overseas voters this Friday, and the voter registration deadline is October 7.

Ohio's Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that six out of eight challenged provisions of the language for Issue 1 on the ballot can stay for the November 5 general election. However, two provisions must be changed. Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced that a Ballot Board meeting will be held on Wednesday to make the adjustments. Democrats called the ballot language false and misleading, while Republicans celebrated the decision as a 'huge win for Ohio voters.' The proposed amendment, Issue 1, would change how the state establishes congressional and statehouse districts, removing the process from the Ohio Redistricting Commission and putting it into the hands of a nonpolitical citizen committee. According to Citizens Not Politicians, a bipartisan coalition pushing the amendment, the new commission would be required to create districts that are geographically contiguous, comply with federal law, and preserve communities. However, the Ballot Board approved language stating that the new commission would be 'required to gerrymander' the districts. LaRose said, 'This decision is a huge win for Ohio voters, who deserve an honest explanation of what they're being asked to decide.' House Minority Leader Allison Russo responded, 'The Republican-controlled Ohio Supreme Court simply rubber-stamped the purposely inaccurate and misleading Issue 1 ballot language.'

The court's 4-3 ruling allows the language to describe the amendment as requiring gerrymandering, despite the proposal's intention to do the opposite. The court's majority found that the language did not mislead or deceive voters, but rather described the amendment in detail. However, the court did order two sections of the language to be rewritten. Citizens Not Politicians, the group behind the amendment, disagreed with much of the decision, stating that the language was 'inaccurate,' 'defective' and amounted to 'argumentation' against the amendment. The group added that politicians are 'lying and doing everything they can to confuse voters.'

Supporters of Issue 1 include the Ohio Democratic Party, multiple unions, and the League of Women Voters of Ohio, while opponents include the Ohio Republican Party and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. 'We're taking the elected officials out of the mapmaking process because they've proven repeatedly that they can't actually be trusted to do it,' said Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio and an Issue 1 proponent.
