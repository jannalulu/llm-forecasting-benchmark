**Eliminating Senescent Cells May Treat Breast and Pancreatic Cancer**
Two studies from the University of Washington's School of Medicine have found that eliminating senescent cells can treat breast and pancreatic cancer. The studies suggest that certain types of senescent cells, which have stopped dividing and cause inflammation, play important roles in suppressing the immune system and allowing these cancers to grow. The research, led by Sheila A. Stuart, a professor of biology and physiology at Georgetown University, and David J. DeNardo, a professor of medicine, could lead to future treatments for breast and pancreatic cancer that target senescent cells. The study suggests that senolytic therapy, which targets senescent cells to eliminate them, can be added to cancer treatment regimens for breast and pancreatic cancer, making immunotherapy and chemotherapy more effective. Some senolytic drugs are already approved by the FDA for treating other types of cancer, and the different ways senescent cells affect the immune system in breast and pancreatic cancer highlight the importance of studying the disease-specific mechanisms.

**Senescent Cell Removal May Aid Breast, Pancreatic Cancer**
Two studies from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis suggest that eliminating senescent cells, which drive inflammation, could be a new treatment strategy for breast and pancreatic cancer. The studies found that eliminating specific senescent cells in the tumor's environment activated the immune system's natural killer cells and other anti-tumor immune functions, suppressing tumor growth. The research suggests that senolytic therapy, which targets senescent cells for elimination, could be added to breast and pancreatic cancer treatment regimens, helping to make immunotherapies and chemotherapies more effective. Some senolytic drugs are already FDA-approved to treat other cancers.

**Senolytic Medications Show Promise in Treating Healthy Older Women**
Researchers at the Mayo Clinic have discovered that medications that selectively kill senescent cells can benefit healthy older women, but only if they have a high number of these cells. Senescent cells, also known as 'zombie cells', are cells that have stopped functioning properly and can cause chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction related to aging and chronic diseases. The medications, known as senolytics, clean out tissues of senescent cells. In a 20-week phase 2 clinical trial, 60 healthy women after menopause received an intermittent senolytic combination of dasatinib and quercetin, a natural product approved by the FDA. The researchers found that this combination, known as D+Q, had beneficial effects on bone formation, but did not reduce bone resorption or degradation. Additionally, D+Q mainly benefited individuals with indications of a high number of senescent cells. Dr. Sundeep Khosla, the lead author, states that 'our findings argue against what many people are already doing, using commercial products like quercetin or related compounds that may exhibit some senolytic properties. People are using them as anti-aging agents without knowing if they have sufficient senescent cells to benefit from them, or what dosage or regimen is necessary for these products or dosages to be effective and safe.' More research is needed to identify better the people who can benefit from senolytic treatments and develop more specific and potent senolytic medications.

**US FDA Advises Vaccines to Focus on JN.1 Variant for Fall 2024 Campaign**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised vaccine manufacturers to focus on the JN.1 variant for the fall 2024 vaccination campaign. This decision aligns with European and World Health Organization recommendations and follows a vote by FDA advisors on Wednesday, who overwhelmingly supported the selection of the JN.1 variant over the new KP.2 strain. Novavax, one of the vaccine manufacturers, said it can target the JN.1 variant with its vaccine. Moderna has submitted a request to the FDA for its JN.1 vaccine, while Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be ready to supply updated vaccines once approved. Novavax expects to start commercial distribution of its JN.1 vaccine in the US in September. The acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is a concern, with only around 22.5% of US adults having received a dose in the 2023-2024 vaccination season.

**Nuwellis Relates First Sale of QUELIMMUNE Therapy**
Nuwellis, Inc. announced the first commercial sale of its QUELIMMUNE therapy to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. This new therapy is designed for pediatric patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis or septic condition in antibiotic therapy who require renal replacement therapy (RRT). The QUELIMMUNE, also known as the Selective Cytokine-Modulating Device for Pediatrics, is an immunomodulatory technology that targets neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes during RRT. The goal is to reduce the hyperinflammatory response, including cytokine storms, which can lead to organ failure and potentially death in critically ill patients. The therapy was made available through a Humanitarian Device Exemption from the FDA and is distributed by Nuwellis under an exclusive US licensing agreement with SeaStar Medical, the developer of QUELIMMUNE. Initial clinical data suggest a 77% survival rate for patients treated with QUELIMMUNE. Dr. Stuart Goldstein, director of the Acute Kidney Injury Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and principal investigator of the studies that led to FDA approval, welcomed the new treatment. 'This innovative treatment offers new hope for this population that has not seen improvement in results in the last 20 years,' he said. Nestor Jaramillo, Nuwellis' president and CEO, highlighted the importance of this first sale in the company's pediatric business development strategy. 'We are excited to collaborate with SeaStar Medical to provide this life-saving therapy to critically ill patients,' he said. The QUELIMMUNE device works by selectively targeting highly activated neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes, transitioning to a reparative state and promoting activated neutrophils to be less inflammatory. It is integrated with KRT systems and aims to promote long-term organ recovery and potentially eliminate the need for future KRT, including dialysis. Nuwellis is specialized in ultrafiltration therapy through its Aquadex SmartFlow system and is committed to transforming patient outcomes in cases of fluid overload. SeaStar Medical is focused on developing extracorporeal therapies directed at cells to reduce the impact of excessive inflammation on vital organs. The information in this article is based on a press release.

**US FDA Approves New Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the commercialization of a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, developed by Eli Lilly, which has shown to slow down the progression of the disease by up to 35% in patients treated in the early stages. The treatment, called Kisunla, is an antibody-based therapy that targets the amyloid plaques in the brain, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The FDA has also approved another treatment, Leqembi, which works on the same principle. The new treatment has been shown to reduce the amount of amyloid plaques in the brain by 61% at 6 months, 80% at 12 months, and 84% at 18 months. The FDA has recommended the treatment for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and it is expected to be available in the US market soon.

The FDA has been cracking down on flavored cigarettes for years and indicated in 2021 it would ban menthol cigarettes, but the effort has been delayed. Health groups have criticized the delay, citing the impact of menthol flavors on Black smokers. The FDA has also closely scrutinized e-cigarette manufacturers, following a surge in youth e-cigarette use. The agency has required all manufacturers to submit new applications for their vaping products for regulatory approval.

**ALK Updates on Regulatory Process for HDM Immunotherapy Tablet in China**
ALK announced that it has decided to withdraw its biological license application (BLA) for its sublingual immunotherapy tablet against acarophobia (HDM) in China. ALK will continue to work with authorities to obtain regulatory approval for HDM in China, which may involve establishing additional clinical data in Chinese patients. The delay in the regulatory approval process has no impact on ALK's financial forecasts for 2024 or its ability to achieve a 25% EBIT margin in 2025. Additionally, it has no impact on ALK's ability to achieve its previously communicated long-term financial growth ambitions. The BLA for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis in patients aged 12 to 65 was accepted for review by Chinese authorities in February 2023. In March 2022, before submission, authorities granted a clinical trial waiver, allowing ALK to submit an approval application based on clinical data from patients outside of China, without the need to complete the clinical trial with Chinese subjects, which was interrupted in 2020 due to COVID. ALK's commercial plans and activities in China will be adapted to a new launch schedule (previously planned for 2025), which will be determined after a more in-depth dialogue with authorities. ALK's current activities in China focus on the injectable SCIT product ALUTARD SQ, whose sales have increased by 30% per year on average over the past three years (CAGR 2020-23). ALK's HDM tablet is approved in 43 countries in Europe, North America, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region for the treatment of persistent allergic asthma induced by HDM and, in some countries, for the treatment of HDM-induced asthma.

**Sarepta Gains as FDA Official Overrules Staff to Approve Therapy**
The US FDA has approved Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy for a rare muscle disease in children, despite a lack of data showing it slows the disease's progression. The approval was a victory for parents and the company, with shares rising 40% in New York. The therapy, Elevidys, can now be marketed for most children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a lethal genetic disease. The FDA's decision overruled two reviewers who recommended against the approval, citing uncertainty over the treatment's effectiveness. Sarepta's CEO, Douglas Ingram, said the sales growth will be enormous, and the company is likely to have the market to itself in Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy for now.

**Sarepta surges as investors cheer expanded use of gene therapy**
Sarepta Therapeutics' shares surged 36% in premarket trading after the FDA granted expanded approval for its gene therapy, Elevidys, for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The approval opens up a bigger market in the US, with potential sales reaching $3 billion in 2025 and $5 billion in 2027. Analysts estimate that the addressable population is now around 13,000 patients, or nearly 90% of patients in the US. Elevidys is expected to be the dominant DMD gene therapy with no near-term competition until 2027.

**FDA Approves Expanded Use of Sarepta's Gene Therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**
The US FDA has approved the expanded use of Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy, Elevidys, for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged four and over. The therapy was approved for patients who can walk and those who cannot. The FDA's decision comes after the therapy failed to meet its primary endpoint in a late-stage trial, but achieved all secondary endpoints without any new safety signals. Debra Miller, founder and CEO of CureDuchenne, said, 'I think, from a parent's perspective, you can look at your child deteriorating and hope for something better, or you can take advantage of something now.' The National Organization for Rare Disorders estimates that Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects about one boy in 3,500 worldwide. The FDA's accelerated approval is the first of its kind for patients aged four to five years who can walk. Sarepta's CEO, Douglas Ingram, said the company is well-positioned to manufacture the therapy. The expanded approval may require Sarepta to increase its capacity. The company has partnered with Roche to commercialize the therapy outside the US.

**FDA Expands Approval of Gene Therapy for Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded the approval of Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl), a gene therapy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), to include ambulatory and non-ambulatory individuals 4 years of age and older with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene. The therapy was initially approved in June 2023 under accelerated approval for ambulatory individuals 4 through 5 years of age with DMD with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene. The FDA's decision was based on an evaluation of data submitted by the sponsor, which showed that Elevidys increased the expression of micro-dystrophin in skeletal muscle and improved physical function in patients with DMD. The therapy is administered as a single intravenous dose and has been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials. The FDA granted the approval and accelerated approval for Elevidys to Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.

**ImmunityBio Announces Initial Treatment of Patients in the US with ANKTIVA for Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer**
ImmunityBio, Inc. has announced the initial treatment of several patients in the United States with ANKTIVA (nogapendekine alfa, inbakicept), a recently approved immunotherapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that does not respond to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). ANKTIVA was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 22, 2024 for the treatment of patients with NMIBC CIS that does not respond to BCG, with or without papillary tumors. The intravesical therapy uses a combination of ANKTIVA, an IL-15 agonist, with BCG. This combination is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for NMIBC that activates the body's natural killer cells and T-cells to attack tumor cells, while also activating memory T-cells, leading to a prolonged complete response of over 47 months for some patients. The first patients to receive commercial doses are spread across the US and are being treated by local urologists, as the treatment does not require specialized equipment or manipulation that would limit its use to specialized medical centers. ANKTIVA has received Breakthrough Therapy designation and FDA approval based on the results of complete responses (CR) and duration of complete response (DOR) in NMIBC CIS that does not respond to BCG.

**COVID shots should target JN.1 variant in fall 2024 campaign, US FDA says**
The US FDA has advised COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to target the JN.1 variant in the fall 2024 campaign, in line with European and WHO recommendations. The FDA's advisory comes after its advisers recommended targeting the older JN.1 variant over the newer KP.2 strain. Novavax has said it will be able to target the JN.1 variant with its shot, while Moderna has filed an application with the FDA for its COVID-19 shot targeting the JN.1 strain. Pfizer and BioNTech are ready to supply their updated vaccines immediately upon approval, while Novavax expects to be ready for commercial delivery in September. Uptake of COVID-19 vaccines has been a concern, with only 22.5% of adults in the US receiving a COVID shot in the 2023-2024 vaccination season.

**FDA advises vaccine manufacturers to focus on JN.1 variant for fall 2024 vaccination campaign**
The US FDA has advised vaccine manufacturers to focus on the JN.1 variant of COVID-19 for the fall 2024 vaccination campaign. This decision is in line with the recommendations of the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO), and comes after the FDA's advisors overwhelmingly supported the selection of this variant over the new KP.2 strain. The JN.1 variant is a subvariant of omicron, characterized by over 50 mutations in the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter human cells. The FDA's recommendation is based on several key factors, including the dominance of the JN.1 variant, the production capacity of Novavax, and the responses of vaccine manufacturers to the FDA. Moderna has submitted a request to the FDA for its vaccine targeting the JN.1 variant, while Pfizer and BioNTech are prepared to supply their updated vaccines as soon as they receive approval. Novavax expects to have its vaccine available for commercial distribution in the US in September.

**FDA Delays Decision on Dupixent for COPD with Type 2 Inflammation**
The US FDA has delayed its decision on the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent (dupilumab) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with type 2 inflammation. The agency will now make its decision on September 27, 2024. The FDA did not raise any concerns about the potential approval of Dupixent in this indication. The sBLA is based on the results of two phase III clinical trials, BOREAS and NOTUS, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with COPD who were not controlled with maximal inhaler therapy. The results showed that Dupixent reduced significantly the exacerbations of moderate to severe COPD (up to 34%) compared to placebo. Dupixent also improved rapidly and significantly lung function compared to placebo, and these improvements were maintained up to week 52. The most common adverse events with Dupixent (≥5%) were back pain, COVID-19, diarrhea, headache, and rhinopharyngitis. Sanofi and Regeneron are confident that these additional analyses will enable them to obtain approval for Dupixent in this indication and are committed to working with the FDA to make the medicine available to patients as soon as possible.

**Press Release             37                                 0 Kommentare        Sarclisa accepted for FDA priority review for the treatment of transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma**
The US FDA has accepted Sarclisa (isatuximab) for priority review as a treatment for transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in combination with standard-of-care VRd. If approved, Sarclisa would be the first anti-CD38 therapy in this indication. The decision is based on positive results from the IMROZ phase 3 study, which showed statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival with Sarclisa and VRd compared to VRd alone. The target action date for the FDA decision is September 27, 2024. A regulatory submission is also under review in the European Union.
