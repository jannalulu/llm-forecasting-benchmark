**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (SEPTEMBER 21, 2024)**

*Two superforecasters, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.*

**JANE**  
The numbers are in. The VXVCLS is lower than last year.

**MIKE**  
Just as we predicted. Our models had it at 8.75%.

**JANE**  
Right on the money. The market's stability this year was a key factor.

**MIKE**  
Exactly. Even with the geopolitical tensions and interest rate hikes, the economy showed resilience.

**JANE**  
And the tech sector's strong performance buffered the volatility.

**MIKE**  
Remember the August report? It highlighted the fading impact of last year's inflation concerns.

**JANE**  
Yes, and the Fed's steady hand helped too.

*They sip their coffee, satisfied.*

**MIKE**  
It's fascinating how a few variables can shift probabilities so decisively.

**JANE**  
Indeed. Just another day in the life of a superforecaster.

(leaning back)  
So, the VXVCLS didn't spike. Our models had it at 12.34%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nods)  
Yeah, the economic indicators were stable. Inflation reports and job growth were consistent.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
And the geopolitical tensions eased after the August summit. That was a game-changer.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(looking at tablet)  
True. Even the market sentiment was optimistic. No surprises there.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
It’s fascinating how the models align with reality. Another win for predictive analytics.
