**Competing abortion initiatives are on the Nebraska ballot that could change the state constitution**
Nebraskans will vote on two competing initiatives that aim to amend the state constitution on abortion rights. Initiative 434 would ban abortions in the second and third trimesters, while Initiative 439 grants a constitutional right to an abortion until 'fetal viability', as determined by the patient's healthcare practitioner. According to Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen, if both initiatives pass, the one with the most 'actual yes votes' will be added to the state constitution. Evnen explained that constitutional amendments can only be changed by a 60% vote in the state legislature and a vote by the people, or with the approval of another initiated constitutional amendment. 'All laws have to be consistent with the Constitution of Nebraska,' Evnen said. 'To the extent that a law is in conflict with the constitution of Nebraska, that law cannot be enforced.'

**Hearings on competing Nebraska abortion initiatives mirror campaign**
Nebraska's competing ballot initiatives on abortion, Initiative 434 and Initiative 439, had separate hearings at the Capitol, with testimony largely echoing the campaign fight between the sponsors. Supporters of Initiative 434, which would allow no abortions after the first trimester, argued that it would preserve existing state limits on abortion and protect women's health. Critics of the restrictions amendment said it was designed to leave the Nebraska Legislature the option of limiting abortion more than the amendment calls for, up to and including a total ban. Supporters of Initiative 439, which would put a right to abortion in the Nebraska Constitution until fetal viability, argued that it would give doctors more leeway to do what is medically necessary for pregnant women with less government interference. Critics of the abortion-rights measure argued it would leave too much room for midwives and doulas to decide viability, decisions they said were best left to doctors. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen has said that if voters pass both abortion-related amendments, the one with the most votes will be incorporated into the constitution.

**Nebraska is the only state with two abortion measures on the ballot. Confusion is the point.**
In Nebraska, voters will decide on two competing abortion measures, Initiative 439 and Initiative 434, in November. Initiative 439 would establish a state constitutional right to abortion up to fetal viability or when necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant patient, while Initiative 434 would ban abortion in the second and third trimesters with exceptions for sexual assault, incest, or medical emergencies. Shelley Mann, executive director of Nebraska Abortion Resources, said, 'We hear all the time how confusing the two measures are and folks are very afraid of accidentally checking the wrong one.' The outcome of these dueling ballot proposals could affect not just those in Nebraska but pregnant people nationwide. Abortion rights activists have been sounding the alarm, warning that if Initiative 434 succeeds, anti-abortion leaders will export their winning strategy elsewhere, using the language of reproductive freedom to advance seemingly moderate measures that obscure long-term goals of deeper bans.

**Poll shows Nov. 5 vote on dueling Nebraska abortion measures could be close**
A recent poll conducted by the Midwest Newsroom and Emerson College Polling suggests that Nebraskans support both measures on abortion as well as reject a plan to allow taxpayer funds to go to private schools. The poll found that 42% of respondents support Initiative 439, which expands abortion rights to fetal viability, while 64% oppose it. Meanwhile, 46% support Initiative 434, which prohibits abortion after the first trimester, with some exceptions. Additionally, 59% of respondents support the legalization of medical cannabis in Nebraska, while 60% oppose using state taxpayer funds to help fund private schools. The poll also found that 34% of respondents believe that convicted felons should be allowed to vote after they complete their sentence.

**Dueling abortion measures facing Nebraska voters in November**
Nebraska voters will decide on two contrasting ballot initiatives in November that will shape the state's abortion policy. Ballot Initiative 434 would ban abortion after the first trimester, except in cases of medical emergency or rape/incest, while Ballot Initiative 439 would establish the right to an abortion until fetal viability or later to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. The measures have sparked debate, with some arguing that they would restrict access to abortion and others saying they would protect the rights of pregnant individuals. According to Pew Research Center, 63% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36% say it should be illegal. In Nebraska, voters are less polarized on the issue, with 50% saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases and 46% saying it should be illegal.

**Six Female Nebraska Husker Athletes, Led by Jordy Bahl, Featured in Political Ad**
Six Nebraska Husker student-athletes, including Jordy Bahl and Rebekah Allick, appeared in a political ad supporting Initiative 434, which aims to formalize Nebraska's existing abortion law. The ad, paid for by Protect Women and Children, claims that Initiative 439, a radical amendment, would put Nebraska women at risk. Bahl stated, 'This was too important for me to remain silent on. If Initiative 439 is passed, Nebraska women will be at risk.' The athletes, who were not paid for their appearances, emphasized their commitment to protecting life. The University of Nebraska clarified that students are permitted to exercise their First Amendment rights, but their views do not reflect those of the university.

**What To Know About Your State's Abortion Ballot Measures This Election**
This year, 10 states have 11 abortion-related measures on the ballot. Most of these measures aim to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions, with some allowing for regulations after the point of fetal viability. The measures vary by state, with some seeking to protect existing abortion laws and others looking to restrict or ban abortion. For example, Arizona's Amendment 1 would enshrine a right to abortion prior to fetal viability, while Nebraska's Initiative 434 would ban abortions after the first trimester. Meanwhile, New York's Proposition 1 would prohibit denying rights based on pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy. These measures are part of a broader effort to address the patchwork of abortion laws across the country, following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.

**Here's Every State Where Abortion Laws Are on the Ballot**
In the 2024 general election, voters in 10 states will have the opportunity to weigh in on abortion laws through ballot measures. These measures aim to either enshrine reproductive rights into law or roll back restrictive bans on abortion. The states involved are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Nevada, and South Dakota. Some of the measures, such as Arizona's Proposition 139 and Florida's Amendment 4, would make abortion legal up to the point of fetal viability, while others, like Nebraska's Initiative 434, would maintain current restrictions. New York's Proposal 1 and Nevada's ballot measure aim to enshrine reproductive rights into law without explicitly mentioning abortion. The outcome of these ballot measures will have significant implications for reproductive rights in each state.

**Nebraska's dueling abortion ballot measures could drive voter turnout  --  and confusion - Washington Examiner**
Nebraska's voters will face two competing abortion-related ballot measures, Initiative 439 and Initiative 434, which propose drastically different laws to amend the state constitution. Initiative 439 would enshrine abortion rights up until fetal viability, while Initiative 434 would ban abortion in the second and third trimesters with exceptions for rape, incest, or medical emergencies. The two measures are expected to boost voter turnout in Nebraska, a state with significant implications for the presidential election and party control of Congress. According to Allie Berry, campaign manager for Protect Our Rights, the opposition to Initiative 439 is trying to confuse voters, saying 'They don't really have any interest in 434 passing. They're just trying to confuse voters.' Brenna Grasz, spokesperson for Protect Women and Children, countered that Initiative 434 is a 'common-sense measure' that makes exceptions for rape and incest as well as medical emergencies. The division in support leaves things uncertain for the future of abortion access as voters submit their ballots in the days leading up to Election Day.

**Nebraska Confuses Voters With Dueling Abortion Ballot Measures**
Nebraskans are expressing confusion over the state's dual abortion ballot measures. Initiative 439 aims to establish a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability (around 24 weeks), while Initiative 434 seeks to maintain the 12-week abortion ban and enshrine it in the state constitution. Voters are expressing frustration, saying 'It's confusing.' The current law in Nebraska prohibits abortions after 12 weeks. 'It's confusing,' voters are saying, as they navigate the complex issue at the Centerfest arts festival in Omaha.

**Conservatives Are Trying to Trick Nebraskans Into Voting for an Abortion Ban**
In response to the surge of abortion ballot measures in 2024, anti-choice lawmakers and groups have resorted to desperate tactics to block their passage. In Nebraska, voters will find two competing abortion measures on their ballots: Initiative 434, which proposes to ban abortion in the second and third trimesters, and Initiative 439, which guarantees the right to abortion until fetal viability. Pro-choice advocates have fought to enshrine the right to abortion within state Constitutions since the landmark Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Allie Berry of Protect Our Rights, the group behind Initiative 439, says that anti-choice groups are trying to instill confusion among Nebraskans. A recent poll showed that a plurality of Nebraskans support both abortion ballot measures, but ultimately, the measures need 50 percent or more to pass. The outcome of this race has dire consequences for Nebraskans, who currently have limited access to abortion services. Lucy, a woman in Nebraska, shares her personal story of having to travel to a different state for an abortion due to the restrictive laws in her state.

**Breaking down Initiative 434, aimed at putting Nebraska’s 12-week abortion ban into constitution**
Nebraskans will vote on two conflicting ballot measures regarding abortion access in the state on Election Day. Initiative 434 aims to put the existing 12-week abortion ban into the state's constitution, while Initiative 439 seeks to expand abortion access up to the point of fetal viability. According to Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen, 'There's nothing about these that can be reconciled. So whichever one of these gets the most votes is likely to become the initiative that gets adopted into the Nebraska constitution.' Protect Women and Children is campaigning for Initiative 434, which would allow for abortion in cases of medical emergency, sexual assault, or incest. However, advocates of Initiative 439 argue that the current ban is hurting women across the state, citing personal experiences of miscarriage and delayed medical attention. The initiatives will be the last thing on the ballot, with 434 being the first of six to vote on.

**What else will Americans vote on besides the presidency on November 5?**
On November 5, 2024, Americans will not only elect their next president but also vote on 146 ballot measures, including 77 proposed by lawmakers and 57 by citizens. These measures will address various topics such as abortion, immigration, marijuana legalization, and minimum wage. The most recurring theme will be abortion, with 11 measures related to this topic, 10 of which aim to establish constitutional rights related to reproductive rights. In Arizona, Florida, Missouri, and South Dakota, measures aim to protect the right to abortion until fetal viability, while in Maryland, Montana, Nevada, and New York, proposals focus on consolidating the right to abortion until fetal viability, guaranteeing this right to all individuals regardless of factors such as ethnicity or sexual orientation. In Nebraska, two constitutional amendments are proposed: one to protect abortion until fetal viability and another to prohibit it after the first trimester of pregnancy, except in cases of medical emergency or sexual assault or incest. This year, minimum wages will also be up for vote: in Alaska and Missouri, initiatives propose raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour and setting requirements for reduced pay due to illness. In California, the measure would raise the minimum wage to $18 per hour; in Massachusetts, it would increase the wage of workers who receive tips to match the minimum wage, and in Nebraska, the proposal would guarantee paid sick leave for employees. In Arizona, voters will decide whether workers who receive tips should earn 25% less than the minimum wage per hour. According to Ballot Measure, between 1996 and 2022, 28 initiatives to increase minimum wages in various states were successfully presented, with a 92% approval rate. Although immigration is a highly discussed topic by both candidates' campaigns, especially by Donald Trump, there is only one initiative that addresses this issue, which is highly controversial. In Arizona, citizens will vote on an initiative that aims to make several changes to penal and immigration legislation, including allowing police to detain and deport foreign citizens who enter the state through unofficial ports (a matter that competes with the federal government). North Dakota and South Dakota will vote for the third time on whether to legalize or not recreational marijuana, while Florida will decide whether to legalize marijuana for all individuals over 21. In Nebraska, a measure proposes legalizing marijuana for medical purposes. Beyond cannabis, Massachusetts will decide whether to legalize or not certain psychedelic substances; if approved, it would become the third state to legalize these products, after Oregon (2020) and Colorado (2022). In terms of criminal justice, California will address life imprisonment for sex trafficking of minors, and Colorado will propose increasing penalties for certain drug and robbery crimes, as well as eliminating bail in cases of first-degree murder, among other measures. Additionally, Colorado will vote on a measure that proposes allocating state income to a new fund for the hiring, retention, training, and death benefits of law enforcement officers. This year, the debate on whether foreign citizens can vote or not will be taken to the polls: in Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, constitutional amendments will be presented to prohibit non-citizens from voting. According to the Center for Electoral Strategy Initiatives, 39 measures related to voting procedures or democracy will appear on the November 5 ballots.

**Cross Sales - All Markets - Ad from 2024-10-31**
Nebraskans are being asked to vote on two abortion-related amendments, 434 and 439. Amendment 434, which has the support of the majority of Nebraskans, proposes well-defined, common sense abortion restrictions after the first trimester of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest, and medical emergencies for the mother. It also preserves parental notification requirements and protects parental rights. In contrast, Amendment 439, proposed by out-of-state activists, would force taxpayers to fund all abortions in Nebraska, even if they have moral or religious objections. It also overturns parental notification laws and jeopardizes the health and safety of women by allowing unlicensed individuals to influence medical decisions. As one critic noted, the 'all persons have a fundamental right to abortion' language in Amendment 439 could even allow men to force a woman into an abortion against her will. 'The choice is clear,' says ProtectWomenChildren.com. 'Protect Women and Children. VOTE FOR 434 VOTE FOR 4'.

**Abortion-related ads in Nebraska prompt tension between health department and doctors**
The Nebraska health department sent an alert to doctors warning about 'misleading information' in ads related to abortion rights, but reproductive rights advocates and OB-GYNs argue that the department is trying to confuse voters and further restrict abortion access. The department's alert was in response to ads from Protect Our Rights, a campaign supporting Initiative 439, which would allow abortions until fetal viability or when needed to protect a pregnant person's life or health. Initiative 434, supported by Nebraska Right to Life, would prohibit abortion in the second and third trimesters with some exceptions. Allie Berry, campaign manager of Protect Our Rights, said the health department and Gov. Jim Pillen are 'trying to camouflage that there is actually an abortion ban in Nebraska.' Dr. Abigail Drucker, chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Nebraska section, said doctors are confused about when it is legally permissible to intervene in certain cases due to the state's abortion ban. Dr. Mary Kinyoun, an OB-GYN in Omaha, said the recent comments from state officials minimize the burden physicians face as a result of the state's abortion ban.

**Breaking down Initiative 439, aimed at rolling back existing abortion ban**
Nebraskans will vote on two ballot measures, Initiative 439 and Initiative 434, which are in conflict with each other. Initiative 439 aims to roll back the current 12-week abortion ban, while Initiative 434 would put the existing ban into the state's constitution. According to Protect Our Rights, the campaign behind 439, the initiative has gained popular support across the state, with over 200,000 signatures collected. Director Allie Berry said, 'It's just to remove government interference and let doctors make decisions in consultation with a woman because it's really just not a space that we need politicians in.' However, opponents, such as Kate Leising, argue that the initiative does not consider the rights of unborn women. Supporters, including Hannah Dumais, a field organizer for Protect Our Rights, claim that the current 12-week ban does not work and can have a devastating impact on women's health.

**Explaining Nebraska's dueling abortion ballot measures**
Nebraska has two dueling abortion ballot measures, one that bans abortion after the first trimester and another that allows abortion until fetal viability. Kelsey Prichard, state public affairs director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said the first measure 'essentially just takes the law that has been broadly supported and recently enacted and puts that in the Constitution.' Allie Berry, campaign manager for the pro-abortion rights initiative, said their measure garnered 207,000 signatures and has life of the mother exceptions. A poll shows a deadheat between the two measures, and both sides are accusing each other of misleading the public. If both measures pass, it will be a numbers game, and there could be a long legal road ahead to figure out which provisions take effect.

**Six Husker players appear in political ad supporting anti-abortion amendment**
Five University of Nebraska softball players and one volleyball player, including Jordyn Bahl and Rebekah Allick, appear in a new ad supporting Initiative 434, an anti-abortion ballot measure that would ban abortion in the second and third trimesters with exceptions for medical emergencies, incest, and sexual assault. The players argue that out-of-state activists are pushing a 'radical amendment' with Initiative 439, which would grant a constitutional right to abortion until fetal viability. A University of Nebraska-Lincoln student, Emma Redler, expressed concerns that student-athletes should stay out of politics due to their influence, while a political science professor, Kevin Smith, believes the players have the right to speak about their views and that the ad may lead some voters to research the topic.

**Nebraska softball star, Papillion native Jordy Bahl says athletes were not paid to be in abortion initiative ad**
Nebraska softball star Jordy Bahl, a Papillion native, appeared in an ad supporting Initiative 434, which codifies the state's abortion law. Bahl and fellow softball player Rebekah Allick stated in the ad, 'Nebraska, it's time to get off the bench. Out-of-state activists are pushing a radical amendment Initiative 439.' However, Bahl clarified on social media that none of the athletes involved in the ad were paid, saying, 'None of us received a penny! We just aren't afraid to take a stand and protect life!' The Protect Women and Children Campaign, backing the measure, has raised over $8 million this election season, mostly from the Ricketts and Peed families.

**Nebraska Cornhuskers stars jump into political realm just ahead of election**
Six Nebraska Cornhuskers players, including softball players Jordy Bahl and Rebekah Allick, appeared in a political ad advocating for a ballot initiative to ban abortion in the state. The initiative, 434, would make the ban part of the state constitution, making it more difficult to amend in the future. Bahl and Allick stated, 'Nebraska, it's time to get off the bench. Out of state activists are pushing a radical amendment initiative 439.' Initiative 439 would make abortion more accessible in the state. The move has sparked both support and criticism from Husker fans, with some calling for the players to stick to sports and others praising their bravery in speaking out.

**Women Athletes Fight Nebraska's Pro-Abortion Measure 439 - LifeNews.com**
Protect Women and Children, a pro-life group, has released two new ads featuring female athletes from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, encouraging Nebraskans to vote for Initiative 434 and against Initiative 439. Initiative 434 would amend the Nebraska Constitution to protect unborn children from abortion in the second and third trimesters, except in cases of medical emergency, rape, or incest. Initiative 439 would establish a fundamental right to abortion in Nebraska until fetal viability, without interference from the state. The athletes, including Rebekah Allick and Jordyn Bahl, stated, 'With out-of-state activists lying about the radical Initiative 439, my teammates and I knew it was time to get off the bench and tell the truth about how 439 would harm Nebraska women and children.' They also said, 'Get in the game, vote for initiative 434 and no on 439.' Pro-life groups argue that Initiative 439 subjects women and medical professionals to vague, unscientific standards, and would remove parental notification for minors.

**Two regents sponsor ads on abortion initiative**
Two University of Nebraska Board of Regents, Rob Schafer and Jim Scheer, have sponsored television commercials opposing Initiative 439, which would create a 'fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability' in the state constitution. The ads, produced by the Nebraska Family Alliance, have been running on TV channels in Lincoln and Omaha, and have been paid for by Schafer's and Scheer's campaign committees. Gavin Geis, executive director of Common Cause Nebraska, criticized the practice, saying it allows wealthy donors to gain an advantage and can confuse voters about who is funding the efforts. Schafer and Scheer did not return multiple phone calls seeking comment. 'By contributing airtime to ballot initiatives, candidates can shield donors from disclosing their support for the proposal and give them a financial advantage over their opponents,' Geis said. 'Candidates should run ads for their campaigns, and ballot initiatives for their purpose,' he added.

**Using big donations, Nebraska regents sponsoring ads opposing abortion ballot initiative**
Two University of Nebraska Board of Regents, Rob Schafer and Jim Scheer, have sponsored advertisements opposing Initiative 439, a ballot initiative that would create a 'fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability' in the state constitution. The ads, produced by the Nebraska Family Alliance, an anti-abortion lobbying organization, have been running on TV channels in Lincoln and Omaha since October 17. Schafer and Scheer, both registered Republicans, have not commented on the issue. Gavin Geis, executive director of Common Cause Nebraska, criticized the practice, saying it allows wealthy donors to gain an advantage in controlling the airwaves and shields them from disclosing their support for the proposal. A single donation to Scheer's campaign totaling nearly $1.6 million from Common Sense Nebraska stood out as unusual. Geis urged the Legislature to pass a law clarifying where political advertising originates. 'Candidates should run ads for their campaigns, and ballot initiatives for their purpose,' Geis said. 'By contributing airtime to ballot initiatives, candidates can shield donors from disclosing their support for the proposal and give them a financial advantage over their opponents due to federal rules that give candidates discounted airtime,' Geis added.

**Abortion is on the ballot in these 10 states**
In the upcoming US elections, ten states will have measures on their ballots to enshrine abortion rights in their constitutions. These states are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota. The measures take different approaches to protecting reproductive access, ranging from enshrining a fundamental right to abortion to restricting abortion rights. In Arizona, Proposition 139 would enshrine a fundamental right to abortion in the Arizona Constitution, while in Nebraska, Initiative 434 would restrict abortion rights by banning the procedure after 12 weeks of pregnancy. In Florida, Amendment 4 would enshrine the freedom to seek an abortion before fetal viability, and after viability if a medical provider determines that the procedure is necessary to preserve a patient's health. The stakes for passage are high, with Republican officials in some states attempting to undermine the measures through various means.

**2024 abortion ballot measures: What to know - Washington Examiner**
In the 2024 elections, several states are voting on abortion-related ballot measures. Arizona's Proposition 139 would establish a 'fundamental right to abortion' in the state constitution, while Florida's Amendment 4 would undo the state's six-week abortion ban. Maryland's ballot initiative would constitutionally ensure the right to reproductive freedom, and Missouri's amendment would establish a fundamental right to reproductive freedom. Montana's CI-128 would enshrine in the state constitution the 'right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.' Nebraska has two competing amendments, one supported by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, and another that would allow abortion only until 12 weeks of pregnancy. Nevada's Question 6 would establish a right to abortion until fetal viability, and New York's Proposition 1 is a broader equal rights amendment that would prevent a person's rights from being denied on the basis of their 'ethnicity, national origin, age, and disability' or 'sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.' South Dakota's Constitutional Amendment G would establish a constitutional right to an abortion and provide a legal framework for regulating abortion after the first trimester. According to polls, the outcomes of these measures are uncertain, with some states showing strong support and others too close to call.

**2024 abortion ballot measures: What to know**
This election season, voters in 10 states will decide on abortion ballot measures that could significantly impact the abortion landscape across the country. Five states (Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota) have implemented abortion restrictions following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Abortion rights advocates in five other states (Colorado, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, and New York) are seeking to enshrine the right to abortion in their state constitutions. According to recent polls, Arizona's Proposition 139, which would establish a 'fundamental right to abortion,' has 58% support, while Florida's Amendment 4, which would undo the state's six-week abortion ban, has only 46% support. In Maryland, nearly 70% of voters support the abortion rights amendment, while in Nebraska, a plurality of voters would support banning abortion after the first trimester. Nevada's Question 6, which would establish a right to abortion until fetal viability, has 75% support, and New York's Proposition 1, which would amend the state constitution to prevent a person's rights from being denied on the basis of their 'ethnicity, national origin, age, and disability' or 'sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy,' has 60% support. South Dakota's Constitutional Amendment G, which would establish a constitutional right to an abortion, has 50% support, while 47% oppose and 3% are undecided.

**Nebraska 2024 ballot measures**
Nebraska voters will face four ballot measures in the 2024 election. Initiative Measure 434 aims to amend the Nebraska Constitution to protect unborn children from abortion in the second and third trimesters, except in cases of medical emergency, rape, or incest. Initiative Measure 436 seeks to enact a statute providing eligible employees with the right to earn paid sick time for personal or family health needs. Initiative Measure 437 aims to make penalties inapplicable under state and local law for the use, possession, and acquisition of medical cannabis for qualified patients. Initiative Measure 439 proposes to amend the Nebraska Constitution to provide a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Supporters and opponents of each measure present different arguments, with supporters emphasizing the importance of protecting unborn children, providing paid sick leave, and ensuring access to medical cannabis, while opponents argue that these measures will have negative consequences for Nebraskans, such as increased government control over healthcare and the potential for abuse.

**Beyond numbers: A look at initiatives on the ballot**
Nebraska's general election ballot features six initiatives, each addressing significant issues. Two initiatives, 434 and 439, concern abortion, with 434 aiming to restrict abortion to the first 12 weeks of gestation and 439 seeking to enshrine a right to abortion until the fetus is viable. Initiative 436 proposes paid sick leave for workers, while Initiative 435 addresses tax-deductible private education scholarships. Initiatives 437 and 438 aim to legalize medical marijuana, with 437 allowing possession of up to five ounces for medical purposes and 438 permitting manufacture, sale, and possession without quantity limits. Campaign funding for these initiatives has been substantial, with some measures receiving over $3 million in support. The Nebraska Secretary of State has noted that if both abortion initiatives are approved, the one with the largest number of votes will become the state's policy on abortion.

**Abortion is on the ballot in 10 states. Here’s where the measures stand**
In 10 states, voters will decide on constitutional amendments that could shape the future of abortion access. Most measures seek to protect abortion access until fetal viability, around 24 weeks into pregnancy. However, in Nebraska, voters will weigh in on two proposed amendments, one to protect abortion access and the other to ban it. If the ballot measures fail, abortion access will remain unchanged. But if all measures to expand access pass, total bans will be lifted in at least two states and partial bans in three others. Polling indicates that some proposed abortion rights amendments may not be successful. Shelley Mann, executive director of Nebraska Abortion Resources, said, 'Nebraska is a live test run, and it’s frustrating that it feels like no one’s watching — it’s a crystal ball for the future for abortion access.' Karen Bowling, executive director of the Nebraska Family Alliance, wrote that the ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights would 'strip away' parental consent rights, legalize abortion until birth, and endanger existing medical safeguards. In Florida, a six-week abortion ban took effect this May, but voters will have a chance to change the state’s abortion laws by deciding if the right to an abortion until fetal viability should be added to the state’s constitution. The amendment needs 60 percent of the vote to pass. In Arizona, following multiple shifts in abortion policy, Arizonans will get to decide whether to add the right to an abortion to their state constitution. The measure to pass needs more than 50 percent of the vote. In Missouri, a trigger law banned all 'non-medically necessary' abortions in the state after Roe v. Wade was overturned. Abortion rights advocates began working to garner support for a ballot initiative that could enshrine abortion access in the state constitution. The measure needs more than 50 percent of the vote to pass. In South Dakota, abortion is nearly completely banned under a trigger law. A ballot measure called Amendment G would restore abortion access to the state by changing the state constitution to set a standard for when abortion can be regulated. The measure seeks to prohibit the state from regulating abortion access during the first trimester and allow it to regulate the procedure during the second trimester only on grounds related to the pregnant person’s physical health. In Colorado, voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution. The amendment would block future lawmakers from enacting any restrictions on abortion and repeal a ban on using state and local tax dollars to pay for abortions. In Maryland, voters will get to choose if a proposed constitutional amendment should be adopted. The amendment would enshrine the right to “reproductive freedom” and prohibit the state from “directly or indirectly” denying or abridging that right. In Montana, voters will have a chance to vote on CI-128, a measure that would amend the state’s constitution to explicitly include the right to “make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion.” In Nevada, reproductive rights advocates worked to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot to enshrine the right to an abortion until fetal viability. In New York, voters will vote on Proposition 1, which aims to update the state’s Equal Rights Amendment to add new protected classes including “gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.”

**In Nebraska, Voters Will Weigh in on Not One, But Two Abortion Measures**
In Nebraska, voters will decide on two competing abortion measures in November. One measure, the Protect Women and Children amendment (Initiative 434), would codify the state's current 12-week abortion restriction into the state constitution, with exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. The other measure, the Protect the Right to Abortion amendment, would allow abortions until fetal viability (around 24 weeks of pregnancy) and then throughout pregnancy under some exceptions. The Protect Women and Children amendment is backed by pro-life groups, while the Protect the Right to Abortion amendment is endorsed by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nebraska and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska. Nebraska Family Alliance said the Protect Women and Children amendment 'establishes a floor of protection, not a ceiling, meaning preborn children must, at a minimum, be protected by the second trimester, and stronger pro-life laws could still be passed going forward.'

**Nebraska voters to choose between historic, dueling abortion questions**
Nebraska voters will face two competing abortion measures on the ballot in November, which could drive voter turnout and potentially affect the outcome of the presidential race. The measures, one allowing abortion up until fetal viability and the other restricting abortion access, have drawn intense attention and money. According to Patty Zieg, a Democratic activist, 'My gut feeling is that the abortion issue is going to play a significant role in this election.' The unusual way Nebraska awards its five electoral votes, with two going to the candidate who wins the state and each of the three congressional districts awarding a single vote, could also impact the presidential contest. National groups such as Planned Parenthood have bolstered the work of the group Protect Our Rights to pass Initiative Measure 439 and expand access, while antiabortion forces have raised over $7 million. State health department data shows 2,325 abortions took place in Nebraska in 2023, an 8.7 percent decrease from 2022. Fertility specialist Elizabeth Constance said the ban has forced doctors to delay emergency medical treatment for pregnant patients pending legal approval, and some women have been forced to carry fetuses with lethal anomalies that will lead to stillbirth or death after birth.

**Hearings on competing Nebraska abortion initiatives mirror campaign**
Nebraska's competing ballot initiatives on abortion, Initiative 434 and Initiative 439, had separate hearings at the Capitol, with testimony largely echoing the campaign fight between the sponsors. Supporters of Initiative 434, which would allow no abortions after the first trimester, argued that it would preserve existing state limits on abortion and protect women's health. Critics of the restrictions amendment said it was designed to leave the Nebraska Legislature the option of limiting abortion more than the amendment calls for, up to and including a total ban. Supporters of Initiative 439, which would put a right to abortion in the Nebraska Constitution until fetal viability, argued that it would give doctors more leeway to do what is medically necessary for pregnant women with less government interference. Critics of the abortion-rights measure argued it would leave too much room for midwives and doulas to decide viability, decisions they said were best left to doctors. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen has said that if voters pass both abortion-related amendments, the one with the most votes will be incorporated into the constitution.

**Nebraska is the only state with two abortion measures on the ballot. Confusion is the point.**
In Nebraska, voters will decide on two competing abortion measures, Initiative 439 and Initiative 434, in November. Initiative 439 would establish a state constitutional right to abortion up to fetal viability or when necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant patient, while Initiative 434 would ban abortion in the second and third trimesters with exceptions for sexual assault, incest, or medical emergencies. Shelley Mann, executive director of Nebraska Abortion Resources, said, 'We hear all the time how confusing the two measures are and folks are very afraid of accidentally checking the wrong one.' The outcome of these dueling ballot proposals could affect not just those in Nebraska but pregnant people nationwide. Abortion rights activists have been sounding the alarm, warning that if Initiative 434 succeeds, anti-abortion leaders will export their winning strategy elsewhere, using the language of reproductive freedom to advance seemingly moderate measures that obscure long-term goals of deeper bans.

A recent poll conducted by the Midwest Newsroom and Emerson College Polling suggests that Nebraskans support both measures on abortion as well as reject a plan to allow taxpayer funds to go to private schools. The poll found that 42% of respondents support Initiative 439, which expands abortion rights to fetal viability, while 64% oppose it. Meanwhile, 46% support Initiative 434, which prohibits abortion after the first trimester, with some exceptions. Additionally, 59% of respondents support the legalization of medical cannabis in Nebraska, while 60% oppose using state taxpayer funds to help fund private schools. The poll also found that 34% of respondents believe that convicted felons should be allowed to vote after they complete their sentence.

**Nebraska's Abortion Debate Heats Up with Two Competing Ballot Initiatives**
In Nebraska, a heated debate is underway over abortion, with two competing ballot initiatives and accusations of deception between Republicans and Democrats. The state currently bans abortion after 12 weeks, but voters will be asked to decide on two amendments to the state constitution. One initiative, supported by the right, aims to simply codify the existing law, while the other, preferred by the left, seeks to guarantee the right to abortion up to the viability of the fetus, around 22-24 weeks. If both initiatives pass, the one with the most votes will take effect. However, many voters are confused, and some have even been misled into signing the wrong petition. 'It's confusing,' says Jean Hanson, a 60-year-old accountant from Omaha. 'I think many people will vote for both, which goes against the intended goal, or they will end up voting for the wrong one.' The two initiatives have both exceeded the required number of signatures, but already, dozens of residents have come forward claiming to have been misled. 'There was confusion,' admits Merv Riepe, a local Republican legislator. 'It's easier to sign a petition than to remove your name from it.' The vote will take place alongside the presidential election, and voters will need to carefully read the proposals 434 and 439 on abortion to avoid casting the wrong vote. Accusations are flying between the two sides, with Democrats accusing Republicans of creating a competing initiative to confuse voters and make it harder to pass the pro-abortion amendment, and Republicans accusing Democrats of exaggerating the severity of the right's initiative, which bans abortion after 12 weeks with exceptions in cases of rape and incest.

The bishop requested participation in the Sacred Heart Novena, which begins on October 1, to convert hearts and minds to vote against Initiative 439. If passed, the amendment would amend the Nebraska State Constitution to include a 'right' to abortion up until fetal viability, which is usually around 24 weeks. Bishop Conley stated, 'We must join to defeat it,' and concluded, 'God bless all of you, especially all mothers and their unborn babies.'

**Dueling abortion measures facing Nebraska voters in November**
Nebraska voters will decide on two contrasting ballot initiatives in November that will shape the state's abortion policy. Ballot Initiative 434 would ban abortion after the first trimester, except in cases of medical emergency or rape/incest, while Ballot Initiative 439 would establish the right to an abortion until fetal viability or later to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. The measures have sparked debate, with some arguing that they would restrict access to abortion and others saying they would protect the rights of pregnant individuals. According to Pew Research Center, 63% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36% say it should be illegal. In Nebraska, voters are less polarized on the issue, with 50% saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases and 46% saying it should be illegal.

**Nebraska Voters to Decide on Two Conflicting Abortion Initiatives**
Nebraska voters will decide in November on two conflicting abortion initiatives, after the state Supreme Court ruled that both can appear on the ballot. One initiative seeks to establish the right to abortion in the state constitution, while the other would prohibit abortion in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The court rejected three petitions arguing that the amendments violate the state's single-subject rule, determining that none of the amendments referred to more than one topic. The 'Protect Women and Children' amendment states that 'unborn children will be protected against abortion in the second and third trimesters,' except in cases of rape, incest, or medical emergency. The 'Protect the Right to Abortion' amendment establishes the right to abortion for 'all people' until fetal viability, or when necessary to protect the mother's life or health according to the judgment of their 'medical professional.' Fetal viability is usually recognized between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, well into the second trimester. Currently, abortion is legal in Nebraska until the 12th week of pregnancy, or the end of the first trimester. The court rejected the arguments that the pro-abortion amendment should be removed from the ballot for infringing on the state law, which requires that petitions be limited to a single subject. The opponents of the amendment argued that the initiative would alter state law in multiple ways, allowing late-term abortions, prohibiting regulation of the procedure, and allowing non-medical personnel to perform abortions. The court rejected these arguments, stating that the initiative 'does not include multiple subjects and, instead, concludes that the provisions of the proposed constitutional amendment are naturally and necessarily related to the general subject.'

The Nebraska Supreme Court has ruled that two competing constitutional amendments regarding abortion can appear on the state's ballot this fall. One amendment, 'Protect the Right to Abortion,' would allow abortions until fetal viability or to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, while the other, 'Protect Women and Children,' would ban abortions in the second and third trimesters, except in cases of medical emergency or sexual assault. Abortion rights opponents had argued that the pro-abortion rights measure violated a state rule requiring a single subject, but the court ruled that it did not. The Nebraska secretary of state will host hearings in October on the two ballot measures. Abortion rights advocates have a history of winning such initiatives, even in conservative states.

One initiative aims to cement a right to abortion in the state's constitution, while the other would prohibit abortion in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The court unanimously denied challenges to the initiatives, finding that they each pertained to a single subject. The justices wrote, 'We determine that the Initiative does not include multiple subjects, and instead, we determine that the provisions of the proposed constitutional amendment are naturally and necessarily related to the general subject.' If both initiatives pass, the one with the most support will be adopted, as long as it meets the 35% threshold of all voters casting ballots.

**Nebraska Supreme Court rules dueling abortion ballot measures will go before voters**
The Nebraska Supreme Court has ruled that two competing ballot initiatives regarding abortion rights will be allowed to go before voters in November. One initiative, sponsored by Protect Our Rights, would establish a 'fundamental right' to abortion up to fetal viability, while the other, backed by anti-abortion doctors, would ban abortion after the first trimester with exceptions for medical emergencies, rape, or incest. According to the court, both initiatives address a single subject and are clear. The winning measure must garner at least 35% of the vote, and if both measures surpass that threshold, the one with the most votes will pass. Protect Our Rights campaign manager Allie Berry said, 'People are excited and ready to go to the ballot box in November and vote to end our current abortion ban and protect access to abortion in Nebraska.' Matt Heffron of the Thomas More Society, a lawyer for the anti-abortion challengers, stated, 'Unregulated late-term abortions are what Nebraskans will get if the abortion expansion ballot initiative passes.'

**Nebraskans can vote on competing abortion ballot measures, top court rules By Reuters**
The Nebraska Supreme Court has ruled that two competing abortion ballot measures can appear on the November ballot. One measure, sponsored by pro-abortion rights organizations, would establish a 'fundamental right' to abortion up to fetal viability, while the opposing measure, sponsored by anti-abortion doctors, would prohibit abortion after the first trimester with exceptions for medical emergencies, rape or incest. Matt Heffron of the Thomas More Society stated, 'Unregulated late-term abortions are what Nebraskans will get if the abortion expansion ballot initiative passes.' The court rejected challenges that the measures improperly addressed multiple subjects, ruling that they addressed a single subject and were clear. Nebraska is one of nine states expected to vote on abortion rights in November.

**Examining Abortion-Related Ballot Measures in Nebraska and Missouri**
The Nebraska Supreme Court has ordered two abortion-related measures to be placed on the November ballot, rejecting last-minute legal challenges. One measure would recognize a right to abortion up to viability, while the other would ban abortion starting in the second trimester. In Missouri, the Supreme Court shut down a challenge to the state's abortion ballot measure, allowing it to be placed on the ballot. Former President Trump stated that overturning Roe v. Wade turned the decision of abortion back to states, but the process of getting citizen-initiated abortion measures on the ballot is complicated. Anti-abortion advocates have challenged some measures right up to the time of the ballots being printed. A KFF poll revealed that these measures are boosting Democratic Women's eagerness to vote. Other states have also faced challenges to their abortion measures, including Arizona, South Dakota, and Nevada, which have seen legal challenges to disqualify the measures. Only 17 states allow citizens to propose a constitutional amendment for the ballot, and after this November, only 3 states (North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Arkansas) that allow citizen initiatives and currently ban abortion will not have had an abortion measure on their ballot.

**Pro-Life Voters in 10 States Must Reject Abortions Up to Birth**
Ten states have proposed constitutional amendments regarding abortion on the ballot in November 2024. These amendments would either codify the right to abortion or protect the right to life for unborn children. The states with proposed amendments are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota. Pro-life supporters have warned that some of these amendments are intentionally deceptive, vague, and extreme, and would allow for abortions up to birth, nullify current abortion bans, and eliminate health and safety regulations. For example, Arizona's Proposition 139 would enshrine a right to abortion before fetal viability, while Florida's Amendment 4 would allow abortion for any reason even up to birth. In contrast, Nebraska's 'Protect Women and Children' initiative would enshrine a right to life for unborn children in the second and third trimesters except in cases of rape, incest, or medical emergency. The outcome of these amendments will determine whether a state is pro-life or pro-death.

**Nebraska Supreme Court to hear arguments over ballot referendum**
The Nebraska Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Monday regarding two competing ballot initiatives involving abortion access. The first initiative, Protect Our Rights, aims to establish a fundamental right to abortion in the Nebraska Constitution, while the second, Protect Women and Children, seeks to ban abortion access after the first trimester with certain exceptions. Solicitor General Eric Hamilton, representing Secretary of State Bob Evnen, will not be participating in the arguments. Omaha attorney Joshua Livingston, representing 29 Nebraska physicians, said 'activists' against the Protect Our Rights initiative 'want to silence the power of Nebraska voters.' Catherine Brooks' attorney, Breanna Grasz, argued that the Protect Our Rights initiative contains multiple subjects, violating the state's single-subject rule. Attorney Matthew Heffron, representing Carolyn LaGreca, founder of a pregnancy center, said the initiative 'contains several subjects, which are not natural and necessary to each other, and which will confuse voters and create doubt after the election.' The court must decide by Friday to certify General Election ballots.
