Here's a script set on August 24, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit bar in Washington D.C. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, reviewing yesterday's Democratic nomination process.]

Tetlock: [sipping bourbon] "Even with that disastrous June debate performance, our models held steady."

Silver: "The virtual roll call was exactly as predicted. Despite the Times editorial board's calls for Biden to step aside and that post-debate polling slide, the party machinery stayed intact."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 2.15%. The chances of a brokered convention were always minimal, given Biden's delegate count and the party's determination to project unity."

Silver: "Agreed. The Obama and Clyburn interventions after the debate were crucial. Though some operatives pushed for an open convention, the virtual format before the in-person convention effectively prevented any last-minute disruptions."

Tetlock: "Sometimes the most boring outcome is the most likely outcome."

[Both nod knowingly and return to their drinks]

Here's a 150-word script set on August 24, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit bar in Washington D.C. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, reviewing yesterday's Democratic nomination proceedings.]

Nate: "Well, that was anticlimactic. One ballot, clean and simple. Biden secured it virtually, just as planned."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 98.5%. Despite all that post-debate chaos in June, the math was always clear. Biden had virtually all pledged delegates."

Nate: "Remember that Times article calling the debate 'disastrous'? The party establishment held firm."

Tetlock: "Obama's intervention was crucial. Even with those editorial calls for Biden to step aside, the delegate math made a brokered convention nearly impossible."

Nate: "Historical precedent backed us up too. Only five brokered conventions since 1900, none in 70 years..."

Tetlock: "And none with an incumbent president. The virtual roll call format sealed the deal."

[Scene: A dimly lit bar in Washington D.C. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, reviewing yesterday's Democratic nomination process.]

Nate: "Well, that was anticlimactic. One ballot, clean and simple."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 98.5%. Despite the post-debate panic in June, the virtual roll call went exactly as planned."

Nate: "The data was clear. Even with that disastrous debate performance and the Times editorial calling for Biden to step aside, the delegate math never changed. He had 99% of pledged delegates."

Tetlock: "True. The last brokered convention was in 1952. The party infrastructure has evolved specifically to prevent these scenarios."

Nate: "Those calls for an open convention were pure emotion, not probability. The numbers never supported it."

[They clink glasses]

Tetlock: "Here's to predictive accuracy."
