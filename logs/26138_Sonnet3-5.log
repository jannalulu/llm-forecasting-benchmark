To forecast this question, I'll analyze the relevant factors and evidence:

1. Historical context: Looking at FRED data, the CAD/USD exchange rate has fluctuated between about 1.25 and 1.40 over the past few years. The rate exceeded 1.3600 for much of 2022 and early 2023, but has generally been below that level since mid-2023.

2. Recent trend: As of the most recent data point (October 17, 2024), the rate was 1.3699, which is above the 1.3600 threshold. This suggests an upward trend in recent months.

3. Economic factors: 
   - Interest rate differentials: The Bank of Canada has been cutting rates in 2024, while the Federal Reserve has been more cautious. This favors a weaker CAD.
   - Oil prices: As a major oil exporter, higher oil prices tend to strengthen the CAD. Oil prices have been relatively stable recently.
   - Economic growth: Canada's growth forecast for 2024 (0.9%) is lower than the US (2.3%), which could weaken the CAD.

4. Market expectations: Several news articles from mid-2024 mention expectations of further CAD weakness, with some forecasts putting USD/CAD above 1.37.

5. Timing: September is often a volatile month for financial markets, which adds uncertainty.

6. Comparison to forecasts: While I don't have access to specific forecasts for September 20, 2024, the general trend in analyst opinions seems to lean towards a weaker CAD.

Balancing these factors:

- The recent trend and current level above 1.3600 provide strong evidence for the rate remaining above this threshold.
- Economic fundamentals and market expectations also generally support a weaker CAD.
- However, there's still significant time until September 20, 2024, allowing for potential changes in economic conditions or policy.
- The volatility typically seen in September adds uncertainty.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a high probability the rate will exceed 1.3600, but it's not certain.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the available data and consider key factors:

1. Current exchange rate: As of the most recent data point (June 12, 2024), the USD/CAD rate was around 1.3634. This is very close to the 1.3600 threshold.

2. Recent trend: The exchange rate has been relatively stable in the 1.36-1.37 range over the past few months, with some fluctuations.

3. Economic factors:
   - Interest rates: The Bank of Canada is expected to cut rates in June or July 2024, while the Federal Reserve may wait until September. This could weaken the CAD against the USD.
   - Inflation: Canadian inflation has been cooling, which supports rate cuts.
   - GDP growth: Canada's economy is expected to grow more slowly than the US in 2024 (0.9% vs 2.3%).

4. Oil prices: As a major oil exporter, higher oil prices tend to support the CAD. However, no significant changes in oil prices are mentioned in the recent news.

5. Trade relations: Canada remains the US's largest trading partner, which tends to stabilize the exchange rate.

6. Market expectations: Forecasts from May-July 2024 generally expect the USD/CAD rate to remain above 1.3600 in the coming months.

7. Historical volatility: The exchange rate has shown relatively low volatility recently, suggesting large moves are less likely.

Balancing these factors:

- The current rate and recent trend suggest a high probability of exceeding 1.3600.
- Expected interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada before the Fed could weaken the CAD further.
- Slower Canadian economic growth compared to the US also supports a higher USD/CAD rate.
- However, the stable trading relationship and recent low volatility suggest the rate is unlikely to move dramatically.

Given these considerations, I believe there is a high probability that the USD/CAD rate will exceed 1.3600 on September 20, 2024. However, there's still some uncertainty due to potential economic changes or unexpected events.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Historical data: The most recent exchange rate provided is 1.37 CAD/USD on June 10, 2024. This suggests the rate has been hovering around the 1.36-1.37 range in recent months.

2. Economic trends: Canada's economy is expected to grow moderately in 2024, with forecasts of 0.9% growth compared to 2.3% in the US. This growth differential could put some downward pressure on the Canadian dollar.

3. Interest rate expectations: The Bank of Canada is expected to cut rates in June or July 2024, while the Federal Reserve is not expected to cut until at least September. This divergence could weaken the Canadian dollar.

4. Oil prices: As a major oil exporter, Canada's currency is influenced by oil prices. Recent news mentions oil trading in the $82-83 range, which is supportive of the Canadian dollar.

5. Trade relations: Canada remains the largest trading partner of the US, which provides some stability to the exchange rate.

6. Market sentiment: There's an expectation of continued US dollar strength in the near term, with some analysts predicting USD/CAD could fall below 1.35 in the second half of 2024.

7. Inflation: Both countries are experiencing cooling inflation, which could lead to more aligned monetary policies later in the year.

8. Time frame: The forecast date (September 20, 2024) is about 3 months from the most recent data point, allowing for potential shifts in economic conditions.

Considering these factors, there's a significant chance the exchange rate could exceed 1.3600 on September 20, 2024. The interest rate differential and growth expectations favor a stronger US dollar in the short term. However, the potential for aligned monetary policies later in the year and the possibility of oil price support for the Canadian dollar create some uncertainty.

Given the relatively short time frame and the recent trading range, I estimate there's a higher probability of the rate exceeding 1.3600 than not.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, with 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.

4. Oil prices: As a major oil exporter, higher oil prices tend to strengthen the CAD.

5. Market sentiment: There's uncertainty around both economies, but slightly more confidence in the US economy.

6. Time frame: We're forecasting about 11 months into the future, which increases uncertainty.

Arguments for exceeding 1.3600:
1. Expected BoC rate cuts could weaken the CAD more than USD.
2. Slower Canadian economic growth compared to the US.
3. The current trend is slightly above 1.3600.

Arguments against exceeding 1.3600:
1. Potential Fed rate cuts later in 2024 could weaken the USD.

   - Some analysts expect the USD/CAD to potentially fall below 1.35 in the second half of 2024.

Weighing these factors:

- The current trend suggests the rate is likely to remain above 1.36.
- Economic factors generally favor a stronger USD against the CAD.
- However, expected rate cuts by both central banks create uncertainty.
- Analyst predictions are mixed but lean towards a slightly stronger CAD.

Given this analysis, I estimate there's a moderate to high chance the rate will exceed 1.3600 on September 20, 2024. However, there's significant uncertainty due to potential rate cuts and economic changes over the next year.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current exchange rate: As of October 18, 2024, the USD/CAD rate is not provided, but we can use the most recent data point from the articles, which is around 1.37 in early July 2024.

2. Historical trends: The exchange rate has fluctuated between roughly 1.36 and 1.38 in the months leading up to July 2024.

3. Economic factors:
   - Interest rate differentials: The Bank of Canada is expected to cut rates before the Federal Reserve, potentially weakening the CAD.
   - Inflation: Both countries are experiencing cooling inflation, but Canada's rate may be declining faster.
   - Economic growth: Canada's growth is projected to be slower than the US in 2024 (0.9% vs 2.3%).

4. Oil prices: As a major oil exporter, higher oil prices tend to strengthen the CAD. However, no significant oil price movements are mentioned in the articles.

5. Market expectations: 
   - There's a high probability (68-72%) of a Fed rate cut by September 2024.
   - The Bank of Canada is expected to cut rates in June or July 2024.

6. Analyst predictions: 
   - A Reuters poll suggests the CAD will strengthen over the next year, but gains may be limited.
   - Some analysts expect the USD/CAD to potentially fall below 1.35 in the second half of 2024.
