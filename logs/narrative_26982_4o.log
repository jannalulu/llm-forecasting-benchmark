A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, their screens glowing with data. The mood is tense, yet expectant.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, confident)  
So, did it happen?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shakes head)  
Nope. Our models had it at 12.35%. The trend was aggressive, but not quite there.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(nodding)  
Exactly. After Lai's inauguration, tensions rose, but 20 in a day was a stretch. The average was high, but not unprecedented.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(looking at a report)  
China's intimidation tactics are evolving, but their strategy remains cautious. They escalate just enough to send a message.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(relieved)  
Good for Taiwan, at least for now. Let's update the models with the latest data.

They return to their screens, the air filled with the hum of analytics and quiet determination.

*The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER 1 and SUPERFORECASTER 2 sit at a table, surrounded by monitors displaying data.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, the big question: Did more than 20 Chinese aircraft violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day between August 15 and September 15?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 85.35%. Given the post-inauguration escalation and recent patterns, the likelihood was significant.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** And yet, no breach reported. Seems our models were spot on in assessing the high probability but low occurrence.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Indeed. The uptick in daily averages post-inauguration was a clear indicator of increased pressure, but not enough for a single-day spike.

*They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** The geopolitical dance continues, but for now, Taiwan holds its ground.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Until the next forecast, then.

*They turn back to their screens, ready for the next challenge.*

No, it didn't. Our models had it at 15.75%.

True. But the daily average was 10, even after the drills. The threshold of 20 was a stretch.
