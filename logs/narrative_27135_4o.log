A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a laptop, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it's official. Tech Crunch didn't list any new layoffs for Google or Alphabet in August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the July cuts, it seemed plausible, but not inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly, the July blurb on Cloud team reductions was significant but didn't indicate an immediate follow-up.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And post-August, the market's been relatively stable. No major upheavals to drive further layoffs.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how the absence of news can be just as telling. The models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
A testament to the precision of our forecasting. Sometimes, no news really is good news.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as they close the laptop and enjoy their coffee in the bustling café.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, sipping coffee, laptops open.

ALEX  
(leaning back)  
So, it’s October 2nd. Tech Crunch didn’t list Google or Alphabet for August or September. 

JORDAN  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.23%. Given the July cuts, it seemed plausible. But no new layoffs.

ALEX  
(smiling)  
Our models are never wrong. The economic indicators post-August didn't support further cuts.

JORDAN  
Exactly. The Cloud division's restructuring must've been the last major adjustment for now.

ALEX  
(raising a cup)  
To accurate forecasts and no surprises from Tech Crunch.

They clink their coffee cups in agreement.

FADE OUT.

A group of seasoned SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, analyzing data. The room buzzes with quiet conversation.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, Tech Crunch didn't list any new layoffs for Google or Alphabet in August or September.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the string of layoffs earlier this year, it was plausible but not guaranteed.

FORECASTER 3  
(gestures to screen)  
Right. The July cuts in the Cloud teams were significant. But it seems they stabilized after that.

FORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
And with the economic indicators we analyzed up to August 12, it made sense. The market was showing signs of recovery.

FORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Another win for the model. No layoffs, and a peaceful October for Google.

They all nod, satisfied with their predictions, as the scene fades.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee. Their laptops are open, showing charts and data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the results are in. No new layoffs at Google or Alphabet appeared on Tech Crunch for August or September.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.78%. Given the previous cuts in July, it seemed plausible, but not inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, especially with the global shifts in their Cloud teams. But the data up to August 12 didn't suggest an immediate follow-up.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our Brier scores hold. The layoffs didn't happen, just as predicted.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how the market dynamics shifted after July. Alphabet's strategic maneuvers were more about restructuring than reducing headcount.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed. A testament to the accuracy of our models and the unpredictability of corporate strategies.

They nod, satisfied, as they close their laptops, the conversation moving to the next prediction.
