*The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying the Longtermtrends website. The tension is palpable.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leans forward) So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking data) No, it didn't. The Warren Buffett Indicator peaked at 199.95%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Our models had it at 15.32%. The market's been flirting with danger, but it just didn't tip over.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (nods) Interesting. Even with the economic volatility, the GDP growth held strong enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Remember Buffett's warning? Playing with fire at 200%. Seems like the market heeded that, for now.

*They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the power of accurate forecasting.*

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) Well, we dodged a bullet this time. Let's see how long it lasts.
