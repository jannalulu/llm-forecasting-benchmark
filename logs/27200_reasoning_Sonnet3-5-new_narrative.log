Here's a 150-word script set on August 24, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Clade I mpox case prediction."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Indeed. Even with the WHO's emergency meeting and the CDC's alert about the African outbreak, our models had it at 8.75%. The lack of direct flights from the DRC and strict travel screening protocols really kept the probability low."

Nate: "The CDC's early warning system and enhanced surveillance definitely helped. Though that 4% fatality rate had everyone on edge."

Tetlock: "True. The models accounted for both the heightened awareness and the improved containment measures since the 2022 outbreak. The probability was never zero, but the barriers to transmission were substantial."

Nate: "Another successful forecast in the books."

[Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors]

NATE: (sighs) Well, no confirmed Clade I mpox cases in the US. Our models had it at 3.75%.

PHILIP: (nodding) The CDC's early warning system worked exactly as intended. That alert they issued on February 7th really heightened surveillance.

NATE: True. Though what concerned me was the WHO's emergency committee meeting. That could have gone either way.

PHILIP: (pulling up charts) The geographical containment in Central Africa was the key factor. Even with that 4% fatality rate, the travel patterns and screening protocols kept it contained.

NATE: (thoughtfully) It's interesting - people see 3.75% and think it's negligible, but that's actually quite significant for an emerging pathogen crossing continents.

PHILIP: Exactly. In epidemiological terms, that's not insignificant at all. We got lucky this time.

[They both turn back to their monitors, analyzing new data]

INT. FORECASTING INSTITUTE - DAY - AUGUST 24, 2024

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, reviewing data on their screens.

NATE
(sighing)
Well, our models had it at 12.35%. The CDC alert on February 7th definitely raised concerns, but...

PHILIP
(interrupting)
But without any confirmed cases in the preceding months, despite increased surveillance, it remained a low-probability event. The WHO's emergency committee meeting was telling.

NATE
The fatality rate difference between Clades was concerning - 4% versus 0.2%. But the geographical isolation of Clade I cases in central Africa worked in our favor.

PHILIP
True. Even with increased international travel, our models suggested the containment measures and screening protocols would likely prevent U.S. cases within that timeframe.

NATE
Sometimes the unlikely outcome is exactly what happens. This time, it wasn't.

FADE OUT.
