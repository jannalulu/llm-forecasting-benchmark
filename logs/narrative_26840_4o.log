INT. SUPERFORECASTER LAB - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation as the team gathers around a large screen displaying Tesla's Investor Relations site. The air is thick with tension.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, what's the verdict?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(glancing at notes)  
Our models had it at 25.67%. Given Tesla's recent production trends, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Indeed. With Q2 at 410,831, the odds were stacked against a significant increase. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(raising an eyebrow)  
And the report?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sighs)  
Tesla delivered 415,000 vehicles in Q3. We had a feeling they'd pull it off.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smiling)  
Impressive. The market's resilience never ceases to amaze.

They share a knowing glance, satisfied with their model's accuracy.

The room is filled with screens displaying data. JANE and MIKE, superforecasters, sit with anticipation.

JANE  
Well, the numbers are in. Tesla delivered 420,000 vehicles in Q3 2024.

MIKE  
Our models had it at 85.67%. The production dip in Q2 was a temporary hiccup.

JANE  
Right. The supply chain issues were resolved faster than expected. Plus, the ramp-up in their new Gigafactory helped.

MIKE  
Exactly. The market's confidence was shaky, but our data showed resilience.

JANE  
It's fascinating how the models predicted this. Even without news after August, they were spot on.

MIKE  
Shows the power of historical trends and strategic insights. Another win for data-driven forecasting.

They exchange a triumphant nod, basking in the accuracy of their prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confidently)  
Well, the numbers are in. Tesla reported 415,000 vehicles delivered in Q3 2024. Our models had it at 85.30%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the trends, it was a reasonable expectation. The dip in Q2 was an anomaly, likely due to supply chain issues.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scanning a news article)  
Exactly. Reports up to August suggested improvements in logistics and production capacity. Our model factored in those adjustments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
