To forecast whether Joe Biden will announce before July 31, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current evidence, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
As of today (July 8, 2024), there is no publicly available prediction from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing this question. However, general sentiment and polling data suggest that Biden's position as the Democratic nominee is under significant scrutiny due to his poor debate performance and concerns about his age and fitness for office.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate Analysis**: How often do incumbent presidents decline their party's nomination after poor debate performances or significant public criticism?
2. **Current Evidence**: What is the likelihood that Biden will step aside based on recent statements, party dynamics, and media reports?
3. **Timeline Constraints**: Given the deadline of July 31, 2024, what is the probability that Biden will make a definitive announcement within this timeframe?

### Step 3: Base Rate Analysis
Historically, incumbent presidents rarely decline their party's nomination. In the modern era, no sitting president has voluntarily stepped aside after securing the nomination. The closest comparison is Lyndon B. Johnson's decision not to seek re-election in 1968, which was driven by intense public opposition to the Vietnam War and health concerns. However, this is an outlier, and the base rate for such events is extremely low.

### Step 4: Current Evidence
- **Biden's Public Statements**: Biden has repeatedly and unequivocally stated that he will not step aside. In a letter to Democratic lawmakers on July 8, 2024, he emphasized his commitment to staying in the race and defeating Donald Trump. He has also challenged critics to run against him at the convention.
- **Party Dynamics**: While some Democrats have expressed concerns about Biden's fitness for office, there is no unified push to replace him. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly planning to nominate Biden on July 21, 2024, to quell internal discussions about his replacement.
- **Media Reports**: Multiple sources indicate that Biden's family and close advisors are urging him to stay in the race. There is no credible evidence suggesting that Biden is considering stepping aside.

### Step 5: Timeline Constraints
The deadline for Biden to make a definitive announcement is July 31, 2024. Given that the DNC plans to nominate Biden on July 21, 2024, and Biden has shown no signs of wavering, the window for such an announcement is narrow. The likelihood of a sudden reversal in Biden's position within this timeframe is minimal.

### Step 6: Balancing Evidence
While there is significant public and media scrutiny of Biden's candidacy, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that he will not step aside. Historical patterns, Biden's public statements, and party dynamics all point to a low probability of Biden declining the nomination.

### Step 7: Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, current evidence, and timeline constraints, the probability that Joe Biden will announce before July 31, 2024, that he will not accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President is very low.

**My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.**
