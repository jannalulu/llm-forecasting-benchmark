**Maduro Threatens Guyana, Claims Support from Russia, China, and Iran**
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro threatened the government of Guyana during a military parade on July 5, 2024, stating that he has the support of Russia, China, and Iran. Maduro emphasized Venezuela's commitment to peace and stability, saying 'we know what we've created for modern times, we have the support of countries with cutting-edge technology, our sister Russia, China, Iran, so no one should confuse Venezuela with others, we are a peaceful nation.' He also warned that 'if you want peace, prepare to defend it, conquer it, and preserve it.' Additionally, Maduro vowed that the 'Staff of Command' would remain in good hands and never fall into the hands of a puppet or oligarch. He also warned against the implementation of policies similar to those of Argentine politician Javier Milei in Venezuela, stating that the Essequibo region is not part of the British Empire. Maduro concluded by saying 'Venezuela will never be a base for any empire.'

**Guyana Essequibo: An Opportunity to Unite and Not to Engage in Conflict**
The International Court of Justice has set dates for the parties in the Guyana Essequibo dispute to present their respective replies and counter-replies. The Venezuelan delegation will present its argument on December 9, 2024, to counter the Guyanese memorial of contestation. The Court has also set August 11, 2025, for the Venezuelan delegation to present its counter-reply. The author emphasizes the importance of unity among Venezuelans in this dispute, urging them to put aside political and partisan differences and work together to defend the country's interests. The author warns that if Venezuela does not present its case, the Court may decide in favor of Guyana, and that the country's sovereignty over the Essequibo region is at stake.

**Venezuela Repudiates Guyana's Military Spending Increase**
Venezuela's Executive Vice President, Delcy Rodríguez, has repudiated Guyana's increase in military spending. She expressed her disapproval on her official X account, saying, 'Venezuela repudiates the warlike appetite of President Irfaan Ali, who is rising as the Caribbean Zelensky, threatening the tranquility and peace of our region to venerate his American and Exxon Mobil masters.' Rodríguez reiterated that 'Esequibo is Venezuela, and it will always be so! The sun of Venezuela rises in Esequibo!' This statement comes after Ali announced an increase in Guyana's military budget to buy boats and planes with foreign support. The Guyanese president has increased the defense budget by $202 million, a 95.8 million dollar increase compared to 2023, the highest amount since the country's independence in 1966.

**Venezuela and Guyana Set Deadlines for Essequibo Dispute at ICJ Meeting**
Guyana proposed a six-month deadline for written arguments before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the territorial dispute over the Essequibo region, with a deadline of October 2024. Venezuela has requested a 12-month deadline from the presentation of written arguments by Guyana before the ICJ. This comes after Venezuela attended a meeting convened by the ICJ on June 11 to discuss the next steps in the process initiated by Guyana. Venezuela reiterated its historical position of not recognizing the ICJ's jurisdiction in the dispute and any decision made on the matter. The country's representative, Samuel Moncada, emphasized that the attendance of the Venezuelan delegation at the meeting did not imply consent or recognition of the ICJ's jurisdiction. Moncada also called on the Guyanese government to return to the negotiating table to implement a practical arrangement agreed upon in the Geneva Agreement, the only normative framework for resolving the territorial dispute.

**Venezuelan Army Invades Disputed Essequibo Territory**
The Venezuelan army has invaded the disputed territory of Essequibo, which is claimed by Guyana, sparking tensions and concerns among neighboring countries. The Venezuelan army, led by Commander Domingo Hernandez Larez, has stated that they are present in the 24th state of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, where infrastructure works are being carried out. The Essequibo region is rich in oil and gas, which the government of Nicolas Maduro has illegally and unilaterally annexed. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies had previously warned that Caracas was amassing troops at the border with Guyana. Georgetown has increased its alert level, while Brazil has moved arms and equipment to strengthen its defense of the Roraima border to deter any potential Venezuelan action.

**Venezuela's Presidential Election: Electronic Voting and Government Repression**
The Venezuelan presidential election is scheduled for June 2024, with over 20 million registered voters. However, voting is not mandatory, and around 4 million voters are abroad. The election uses an electronic voting system, similar to Brazil's. The last election in the country took place in December 2023, when the president called a referendum to discuss the Essequibo issue, aiming to annex part of Guyana's territory. The election is marked by government repression against opponents, and the international community is skeptical about the process.

**Brazil's Silence on Venezuela's Election: A Betrayal of Democracy?**
Venezuelans will vote on Sunday to elect Edmundo González, the opposition candidate, and Nicolás Maduro will likely be re-elected with the blessing of Brazil. Lula said, 'They can elect whoever they want.' González has 59% of the vote intention against 24.6% of Maduro in the latest survey. The difference is so significant that it would practically make it impossible for Maduro to rig the election. Maduro has few alternatives to stay in power: delay the election and gain time to undermine his rival or incite a popular uprising to justify a self-coup against the 'fascists'. These unlikely alternatives tighten the already tight rope of Brazil. Maduro, banned from many international forums, including Mercosul, and received with a red carpet in Brasília, has left Lula in a difficult situation. The Brazilian government has been silent on Maduro's actions, including his taking of the Essequibo territory from Guyana, which even fake news required military action. Maduro has also ignored the Barbados Agreement, which he committed to holding free and fair elections in 2024 and releasing opposition prisoners. Lula continues to defend the Venezuelan election as if everything is normal, proposing the return of Venezuela to Mercosul after the election. He has ignored Maduro's threat of 'bloodshed' and 'civil war' if he is not re-elected, reiterating the convenient position of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

**Tensions rise in Guyana as Maduro uses border dispute to build support ahead of Venezuela poll**
Tensions are rising between Guyana and Venezuela as President Nicolás Maduro uses the border dispute over Essequibo to build support ahead of the Venezuelan presidential election. The region is home to 120,000 people, mostly Indigenous Arawak, who have managed to preserve their culture and language despite colonization and fights over land. The dispute has been ongoing since 1811, and Guyana has asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to rule on the issue. Maduro has announced plans to annex the region, which has been met with condemnation from Guyana and other countries. The situation has raised concerns about the potential for military conflict and the impact on the region's Indigenous peoples.

**VENEZUELA'S AGGRESSION AND THREATS AGAINST GUYANA NECESSITATE CONSTANT VIGILANCE**
Venezuela has been making aggressive claims to over two-thirds of Guyana's territory, deploying soldiers and armaments on the border with the threat of invasion. Guyana has to take these threats seriously, as Venezuela lives in a world of the 18th and 19th centuries, where states can acquire territory by aggression. The international community, including the OAS, the Commonwealth, the United States, the United Kingdom, CARICOM, and many European Community countries, is supportive of Guyana and will restrain Venezuela until the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjudicates on the controversy. The controversy dates back to 1841, when the British Government engaged a German cartographer to demarcate British Guiana's boundaries, which Venezuela objected to. The issue was settled through the Treaty of Washington in 1897, and later reaffirmed in 1900 and 1921. However, in the 1960s, Venezuela opposed Guyana's independence, citing a disputed letter claiming the decision was rigged in favour of Britain. The controversy has been ongoing, with Guyana and Venezuela using the Good Offices Process and eventually the ICJ to settle the dispute.

**Venezuela's Claim to Essequibo Region: A Matter of Sovereignty and Natural Resources**
Venezuela is contesting Guyana's claims to the Essequibo region, which was once known as the 'Zone in Reclamation'. The region is rich in natural resources, and Guyana has been granting concessions to foreign companies without consulting Venezuela. Venezuela has been urging the International Court of Justice to rule in its favor, citing the 1966 Geneva Agreement, which recognized Venezuela's sovereignty over the region. The court has scheduled a hearing for August 11, 2024, where Venezuela will present its case. Venezuela's ambassador to the UN, Dr. Abraham Gómez R., stated that the country will continue to defend its rights to the region, citing the principle of estoppel, which holds that silence or acquiescence by a state can be used against it in international law. He also emphasized the importance of the region's natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals. The Venezuelan government has been urging the international community to recognize its sovereignty over the region, and has been critical of Guyana's actions, which it sees as a threat to its national security.

**Brazil Receives Israeli Missiles Amid Fears of Venezuela-Guyana Conflict Escalation**
The delivery of Israeli-made missiles to Brazil has raised concerns about a possible escalation of the conflict between Venezuela and Guyana over the Esequibo region. The delivery of 100 LR2 Spike missiles from Tel-Aviv to Rio de Janeiro has been linked to the fear that Venezuela may spark an international conflict to distract from internal disturbances expected after the July 28 elections. Venezuela has a significant military presence in the region, including 200 T-72 tanks and BMP-3 armored vehicles, as well as Chinese and French-made tanks. Brazil has been strengthening its military presence in Roraima, bordering Venezuela, and has suspended the signing of a contract for the purchase of 36 armored combat vehicles from Israel's Elbit Systems. 'The Venezuelan elections, where Maduro will face an opposition that threatens to defeat him at the polls, will be the first major challenge. On the border with Guyana, threats multiply for those seeking promised votes. Before or after the elections, the Esequibo may return to the news', warned Estadao.

**Brazilian Army Creates New Mechanized Company and Announces R$ 2.5 Billion in Investments**
The Brazilian Army announces the creation of a new mechanized company and investments of R$ 2.5 billion over the next three years. The new unit, composed of around 120 soldiers, will be equipped with Israeli-made Spike LR2 anti-tank missiles and MSS 1.2 AC, and will be able to operate anywhere in the country. The creation of the company is seen as a response to the growing threats on the border with Venezuela, where the regime of Nicolás Maduro has mobilized troops and tanks. The Brazilian Army plans to buy 78 combat infantry vehicles and 65 tanks weighing up to 50 tons, replacing the VBTP M-113-BR personnel transport vehicles. The delivery of the Spike LR2 missiles, which was delayed since 2022, comes at a time of increasing geopolitical tension, especially with Maduro's threats on the border with Guyana.

**VENEZUELA'S AGGRESSION AND THREATS ON GUYANA NECESSITATE CONSTANT VIGILANCE**
Venezuela's aggression and threats towards Guyana necessitate constant vigilance. The Venezuelan government has been claiming over two-thirds of Guyana's territory, deploying soldiers and armaments on the border, and even appointing a governor for the disputed region. Guyana, a militarily weak oil-rich country, is vulnerable to Venezuelan aggression, but it is committed to resolving the issue through legal means. The international community, including the OAS, Commonwealth, US, UK, CARICOM, and European Community countries, is supportive of Guyana and will restrain Venezuela until the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjudicates on the controversy. The ICJ was chosen as the final arbitrator after Guyana and Venezuela withdrew from the Good Offices Process. Venezuela's threats and aggression towards Guyana are a reminder of the country's anachronistic mindset, which is rooted in the Bolivarian cult and the country's devotion to 18th-century principles of territorial acquisition.

**Member states must work to maintain region as Zone of Peace**
Guyana's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Hugh Todd, urged OAS member states to strengthen regional security to maintain the region as a Zone of Peace. Todd made the call during the OAS General Assembly, emphasizing the organization's mission to promote peace, justice, and solidarity among American states. Guyana will continue to rely on OAS support in implementing the ICJ's December 2023 order and the Joint Declaration of Argyle for Dialogue and Peace with Venezuela, pending the ICJ's ruling on the 1899 Arbitral Award.

**Venezuela to Resume Talks with US on Lifting Sanctions**
Venezuela will resume direct talks with the US to discuss the possible lifting of economic sanctions. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced this, citing Reuters. 'I have thought about the proposal and agreed to it, and next Wednesday, negotiations with the US government will resume regarding the implementation of the agreement signed in Qatar and returning to a respectful dialogue,' Maduro said. The Venezuelan delegation will be led by President of the National Assembly Jorge Rodriguez, but he did not specify which topics will be discussed during the first round of talks. The negotiations began about two years ago, but after the US re-imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry in April last year, Maduro accused Washington of violating agreements. In late 2023, the US and Caracas successfully exchanged prisoners after months of negotiations mediated by Qatar. In April 2024, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro approved a law creating a new state around the oil-rich Essequibo region in neighboring Guyana.

**Venezuela and US to Resume Direct Dialogue, Says President Maduro**
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced that Venezuela and the United States will resume direct dialogue. The dialogue will be public to avoid speculation. Maduro aims to achieve respect for his country, its democracy, and its people. He wants to end the conflict and confrontation with the US government. 'It's up to them. I received proposals from the US government to restore talks and direct dialogue for two months. After considering, I accepted the proposal, and direct talks with the US government will resume next week to implement agreements signed in Qatar and restore conditions for respect and dialogue without manipulation,' Maduro said. The key point, emphasized Maduro, is public transparency without speculation. He noted that after numerous secret meetings with Americans, Caracas kept the information secret, while the US spread false versions. Maduro is also interested in a personal meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and is preparing a visit to Russia to sign important documents. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez accused the US of preparing Guyana for an attack on Venezuela, similar to how they prepared Ukraine for war with Russia. Therefore, the people of Latin America and the Caribbean should stand against regional militarization.

**Venezuela Condemns Guyana's Decision to Hand Over Sovereignty to the US**
Venezuela's Foreign Minister, Yván Gil, has condemned Guyana's decision to hand over its sovereignty to the United States, calling it a 'real shame'. Gil stated that Guyana is 'delivering its sovereignty' to the US, which is 'insolent' and aims to destabilize the Caribbean region, take Venezuela's resources, and give them to ExxonMobil. The US ambassador to Georgetown, Nicole Theriot, was seen celebrating the collaboration and relations between Georgetown and Washington in a video. Gil criticized Guyana's insistence on installing US military bases to threaten Caracas. The tensions between Caracas and Georgetown increased after Guyana received offers for eight of the 14 oil blocks that went to auction in December 2022, including ExxonMobil. Venezuela considered this as a conspiracy between Washington and ExxonMobil to deprive the country of its rights over the territory, and held a consultative referendum on the protection of the Essequibo region, which obtained over 10 million votes. The presidents of Venezuela and Guyana met in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and expressed their willingness to continue dialogue to resolve the controversy over the territory. They also agreed that neither country would threaten or use force against each other, and that any controversy would be resolved in accordance with international law, including the 1966 Geneva Agreement.

**Guyana's Oil Ambitions Pose a Challenge to Venezuela**
Guyana has become a major energy challenge for Venezuela, as it aims to supply three refineries in the United States owned by the Venezuelan state-owned company CITGO. Guyana has increased its oil exports to the United States, with shipments rising from 32,000 barrels per day in March to 60,000 barrels per day in April, and reaching 100,000 barrels per day in May. This has allowed Guyana to tap into new markets and establish itself as a major player in South America. According to Vorteza data, in 2023, Guyana produced almost 400,000 barrels per day, with 60% going to Europe and 25% being transported through the Trans-Panama pipeline to the US. This has raised alarms and the usual Mexican markets are preparing for the invasion of Guyana's crude oil. Guyana's improvements in the Liza 1 and Liza 2 projects in the Stabroek block, which is claimed by Venezuela, have allowed it to take advantage of the US and European reduction in imports from Venezuela. The same threat is now facing the Aztec region, which sees Guyana as an opportunistic competitor that is benefiting the US. Mexico attributes the decline in its production between March and May 2024 to Guyana, with a decline of 135,000 barrels per day, compared to 220,000 barrels per day in the previous quarter.

**'Real Bochorno': Venezuela Denounces Guyana's Plan to Install US Military Bases in Essequibo**
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil criticized Guyana's President Irfaan Ali for reiterating his decision to install US military bases in the disputed Essequibo region, saying it's a 'real shame' and a threat to Venezuela. Gil accused Ali of trying to appropriate Venezuela's resources and hand them over to ExxonMobil. He also denounced the presence of US military exercises in the region, including the USS George Washington aircraft carrier and F-18 reconnaissance flights. The US Ambassador to Guyana, Nicole Theriort, had previously stated that the US would support Guyana against 'bullies and tyrants', referring to Venezuela. Gil called the situation a 'real shame' and a threat to regional stability.

**Venezuelan Foreign Minister Calls Guyana's Actions a 'Real Shame'**
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil described the situation in Guyana as a 'real shame', accusing the country of surrendering its sovereignty to foreign interests. Gil claims that the presence of US Ambassador Nicole Theriot in Guyana aims to destabilize the Caribbean region and benefit Exxon Mobil. The Foreign Minister expressed concern over Guyanese President Irfaan Ali's actions, stating that he is 'temerariously and shamelessly' insisting on installing US military bases. According to Gil, this move is intended to threaten Venezuela and divert attention from the commitments made in the Geneva Agreement. 'Delivering your sovereignty to an insolent ambassador, who instead of attending to the affairs of your out-of-control government, aims to destabilize the Caribbean region, to appropriate our resources, and hand them over to Exxon Mobil', Gil stated. Venezuela and Guyana have a long-standing dispute over the Essequibo region, and the Geneva Agreement, signed in 1966, aims to find a peaceful solution to this controversy. However, Gil's statement suggests that Guyana's recent actions have further complicated the diplomatic situation between the two nations. The Foreign Minister reiterated Venezuela's stance in defense of its rights over the Essequibo region and warned that his country will not tolerate actions that put regional stability at risk. 'President Irfaan Ali must respect the commitments of the Geneva Agreement and cease his attempt to militarize the region', he concluded.

Guyana's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Hugh Todd, warned the Organization of American States (OEA) about the 'significant threat' posed by Venezuela's territorial claims over the Essequibo region. At the 54th General Assembly of the OEA, Todd stated that Venezuela's actions violate fundamental principles of International Law, posing a substantial threat to Guyana's sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, and regional security. He concluded by stating that Guyana will continue to rely on OEA support in efforts to implement a dialogue and peace declaration between Guyana and Venezuela, as well as the December 1, 2023 court ruling.

**Guyana Joins the Summit of Peace, Sharing Similarities with Ukraine**
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Guyana, a country in South America, has joined the joint communiqué of the inaugural Summit of Peace, which took place in Switzerland. Zelensky expressed gratitude to Guyana for this step. He emphasized that it is crucial that more countries in South America share the vision of a just world based on the principles of the UN Charter. 'The international coalition of peace-loving countries committed to these principles is growing every day. We continue to work together to expand global support for the Peace Formula and the steps needed to implement it,' Zelensky wrote. Guyana and Ukraine have similarities, as Ukraine has been resisting Russian aggression for over 10 years, while Guyana is threatened by Venezuela's aggression, which aims to annex its territory, Guyana-Esequibo. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has announced a referendum on December 3, 2023, to annex the region, which is a significant part of Guyana's territory. Maduro has also taken several steps to prepare for the annexation, including issuing licenses for oil exploration and exploitation, spreading a new map of Venezuela including the disputed region, and starting the process of creating a new state, Guyana-Esequibo, and conducting a census. Later, Maduro announced the deployment of troops on the eastern coast due to 'threats from Guyana.' This followed Guyana's receipt of a British warship.

**Venezuela Attacks ‘Failed' Trudeau Admin for Backing Guyana Territorial Claims**
Venezuela's socialist regime has accused Canada of being a 'destabilizing factor' in the territorial dispute with Guyana over the Essequibo region. The dispute has been ongoing for over 120 years, with Venezuela claiming the region is part of its borders since gaining independence from Spain in 1811. Canada's High Commissioner in Guyana, Mark Berman, expressed support for Guyana and urged respect for international law, prompting a response from Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, who accused Canada of conspiring with Guyana and 'right-wing lackeys' to hand the territory to US companies. The dispute has escalated in recent years, with Venezuela's socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro deploying the Venezuelan Navy to intimidate Guyana and holding a sham referendum on the issue.

**Venezuela urges Guyana to reject external interference in Esequibo dispute**
Venezuela has urged Guyana to reject external interference in the dispute over the Esequibo territory, rich in oil, after a meeting of their foreign ministers in Brasilia to address the crisis. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil stated, 'We reject the possibility of third parties interfering or benefiting from a potential discussion or controversy between Guyana and Venezuela.' Tensions between the two countries escalated in late 2023 with the arrival of a British warship in Guyanese waters, which Venezuela saw as a provocation. Venezuela mobilized over 5,600 troops for military exercises near the disputed border. A meeting between Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and US Defense Department official Daniel Erikson on January 9 did not go well in Caracas, with the Maduro government accusing its neighbors of acting 'under the orders of the gringos.' Foreign Minister Gil reiterated that 'the only possible and legal way to resolve this controversy is the 1966 Geneva Agreement.' Vice President Delcy Rodríguez stated that the Canadian government is violating common international law. 'Guyana's excessive imperialism opens doors to decadent empires to steal what never belonged to them,' she wrote on her Twitter account.

**From Venezuela to Guatemala, the open wounds of the British Empire in Latin America**
Six months after tensions flared up over the Essequibo territory in late 2023, Venezuela has strengthened its military presence along the border with Guyana, which administers the territory. This seemingly insurmountable conflict dates back to two centuries, to the time of British colonization. The British Empire left behind scars and persistent territorial disputes worldwide: between Israel and Palestine, between India and Pakistan, and also in Central and South America, where disputes regularly resurface, such as the one between Caracas and Georgetown.

Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodríguez criticized Guyana's President Irfaan Alí for his 'warlike' stance, comparing him to Ukrainian President Volodímir Zelenski. Rodríguez stated that Venezuela rejects Alí's 'warlike' approach, which threatens the peace and tranquility of the region, and is only aimed at pleasing the US and ExxonMobil. The criticism comes after Alí announced an increase in Guyana's military budget to buy boats and planes with international support. Venezuela has reiterated its call for dialogue with Guyana to reach an effective agreement on the territorial dispute over the Esequibo region. The tensions between Caracas and Georgetown have increased since Guyana received bids for eight of the 14 oil blocks that went to auction in December 2022, including ExxonMobil. Venezuela considers this a conspiracy between the US and ExxonMobil to deprive the country of its rights over the territory.

**Guyana's Economic Boom: A Threat to Venezuela's Annexation Plans?**
Guyana, a small South American country, is expected to have the fastest-growing economy in the world, with a projected growth rate of up to 25.4% this year, according to the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The country's economy is driven largely by the extraction and export of oil, which has sparked interest from its neighbor Venezuela, which wants to annex both countries. Guyana is known as the 'Dubai of South America' or the 'economic miracle of South America'. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that Guyana's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will increase by 115% by 2028. The country is expected to increase its oil exports, from 390,000 barrels per year to over 1 million by 2027. Andrew Trahan, a country risk analyst at BMI-Fitch Solutions, said that 'Guyana will experience explosive growth this year'. The main reason behind Guyana's economic growth is the rapid growth of the oil and gas industry. 'Guyana has chosen private actors with broad competencies to carry out these types of projects', said analyst William Clavijo of the University of Rio de Janeiro. Trahan also added: 'Guyana's robust growth has been, and will continue to be, driven by a rapid expansion of oil production following a series of discoveries in recent years', according to CNBC. The Stabroek block, a 6.6 million-acre offshore oil field located off the Atlantic coast of Guyana, contains approximately 11 billion barrels, making it the country's most important oil field. Andrew Trahan estimates that there will be a 'strong growth' that 'will continue in the coming years as oil production continues to increase, with a real GDP growth of approximately 115% between 2022 and 2028'. The labor demand in Guyana, driven by the accelerated economic growth, could attract immigrants from all of Latin America, which would not only impact Guyanese but also neighboring countries. Oil expert Luis Oliveros, from Venezuela, explained his perspective and highlighted the arduous task that Guyana faces. Oliveros warned that, to avoid falling into the same traps that affected Venezuela for a century, particularly in the last 20 years, Guyana must act with great caution.

**Venezuela Seeks International Court Intervention in Essequibo Dispute with Guyana**
Venezuela has requested the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to restart negotiations with Guyana over the disputed territory of Essequibo. The Venezuelan government wants to discuss the issue based on the 1966 Geneva Agreement. The representative of Venezuela at the UN, Samuel Moncada, stated that the discussion needs to have a 'effective, practical, acceptable, and satisfactory' outcome for both parties. The tension between Venezuela and Guyana over the disputed territory has been escalating since the Venezuelan referendum in December 2023, where the majority voted in favor of reincorporating Essequibo. The Venezuelan government has also passed a law to defend its sovereignty over the territory, which has been disputed since the 19th century. The law aims to officially recognize the territory as a state of Venezuela and establish a transitional period for its incorporation.

The article also mentions that American oil companies are exploring the oil-rich Essequibo region of Guyana, which Venezuela is preparing to invade, with the help of Iranian, Russian, and Chinese military advisors. The article concludes that the US is not taking action to stop the invasion and is instead allowing Venezuela to sell oil to fund the invasion.
