Okay, let's break down this forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** Ski resort opening dates in early December. Based on the provided articles, many resorts aim to open in late November or early December. However, the actual opening depends heavily on snow conditions and other factors. Looking at the broad trends from the articles, there appears to be a mix of resorts that opened in late November and those planning to open in the first week of December. Some are also delaying opening due to lack of snow, suggesting the need for caution.
*   **Initial Base Rate:** Given the trend of ski resorts opening in late November/early December, and the number of resorts planning to open around Dec 6, my initial estimate for *any* resort opening on Dec 6 might be around 60-70%. However, Alpental is just one resort, so this base rate is a starting point, and it must be adjusted based on more specific information.

**2. Sub-Problems:**

*   **Alpental's Historical Opening Dates:** Unfortunately, the provided articles do not give historical opening date trends for Alpental, so I cannot use this data point.
*   **Current Snow Conditions at Alpental:** No specific details about snow conditions at Alpental are found in the articles, however, the article published on November 8 notes that the Pacific Northwest is expecting a good snow season due to a projected La Niña winter. This is a positive indicator.
*  **Alpental’s Preparation:**  The same November 8 article also mentions that Alpental is gaining a new expert chairlift, which is a sign of investment and preparation for the season. Additionally, Alpental will be open on Mondays in January and February.
*   **On The Snow Report Reliability:** The question specifies the resolution source, which helps to avoid ambiguity about open status. However, the website needs to be working properly on Dec 6 and if not, Metaculus will wait until January 7th, which is a key consideration as things could change.
*  **Competition/Peer Resorts Opening Status:** Many other Washington resorts are opening at a similar time, suggesting this is when the season is usually ready to go in this area of the world. This information is also important to note.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** The outside view is the reference class based on base rates which showed a 60-70% probability of resorts opening around the time the question is asking about.
*   **Inside View:** The inside view considers Alpental's specific situation, the news about the resort (new chairlift and expanded days of operation), the area (La Niña and good snow season forecast) and regional opening dates for peer resorts.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*  **Under-reacting:** Given the specific information about Alpental, and good regional weather, not adjusting from the base rate might underestimate the chances of it being open.
*  **Over-reacting:** The lack of specifics about *current* snow conditions at Alpental is very important. The La Niña prediction is promising, but there could be regional variability, and if there is not enough snow then it will not be open on the 6th. Over-relying on the news of improvements without knowing current conditions could overestimate the chance of opening.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:**
    *   La Niña winter forecast for the Pacific Northwest
    *   New chairlift and expanded operating days at Alpental, indicating preparation
    *   Many regional resorts opening around the same time
*   **Negative Forces:**
    *   No specific snow depth information for Alpental
    *   Reliance on a specific website, which may fail
    *   Weather variability and uncertainty, even with La Niña.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   No specific trends to extrapolate here as the articles give general snapshots in time leading up to December, and no snow depth/fall timelines were found for Alpental.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   This is a binary question (open or closed). It is difficult to express the subtleties of the current situation with just probabilities but it needs to be attempted. 

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** The uncertainty over current snow depths and weather means not factoring in these variables could mean underconfidence in whether it is open.
*  **Overconfidence:** The positive indications must be balanced with the unknowns so not taking these into account could result in overconfidence.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   The biggest source of error would be the lack of current snow conditions at Alpental, the reliability of the resolution website, or any last minute change in the weather, which could all make the difference. There may be something that has changed very recently that the articles have not captured.

**Synthesis and Prediction**

Taking all of this into account, the combination of a positive forecast for the season, a new chairlift being installed, the resort planning on more open days, and many other Washington state resorts opening on similar dates leads me to believe the resort is more likely to be open on December 6th than not. However, the lack of current data on snow at the resort, and the unknown of the reliability of the website on December 6, means I can not give this a very high probability. 

I think a probability of being open is slightly above the 60-70% base rate so, I will put this at 78.45%. However, the lack of current snow depth means I cannot rule out a very low possibility of the resort being closed, perhaps 20% at the very lowest. Therefore, my prediction range is 65.25% - 85.45%.

My Prediction: Between 65.25% and 85.45%, but 78.45% being the most likely. Probability: 78.45%.

Okay, let's analyze this question and make a forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** The question asks whether a specific ski resort will be open on a specific date. A good starting point is to consider base rates of ski resort openings around early December. Generally, many resorts aim to open around this time, depending on snow conditions. Based on the news articles, many resorts are targeting openings around the first weekend of December. This suggests a reasonable base rate for openings *somewhere*, but not necessarily a specific resort.
*   **Metaculus:** There are no relevant predictions about this specific resort opening date on Metaculus. Other predictions on Metaculus are not similar enough to be directly used here.
*  **Other Prediction Sites:** There are no relevant predictions on other sites like FiveThirtyEight and Polymarket.

**2. Break Down into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Snow Conditions:** Is there sufficient snow (natural or artificial) for the resort to operate?
*   **Resort Preparation:** Is the resort ready to operate from an infrastructure and staffing perspective?
*   **Report Accuracy:** Will the OnTheSnow report accurately reflect the resort's status?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** As mentioned, many resorts aim to open in early December. The news articles show a large number of resorts globally opening between late November and early December. This suggests a reasonable chance of a resort being open by Dec 6th.
*   **Inside View (Specific Factors for Alpental):**
    *   **Positive Signals:** The *Seattlemet* article specifically mentions that Alpental is getting a new expert chairlift and will be open on Mondays in Jan/Feb, suggesting investment and a plan for operations this season. Also, the Pacific Northwest is expecting a good snow season this year due to La Niña.
    * **No Mentioned Opening Date** - The news articles don't state an official opening date for Alpental. It only says that Stevens Pass is aiming for a December 6th opening, which could influence the probability for Alpental since it is another Washington ski resort.
     *   **Potential Negative Signals:** No significant negative news regarding snow conditions at Alpental.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** We should not ignore the news about the La Niña winter and the resort investment, it is more likely that it will open for the season soon rather than later.
*   **Overreacting:** We should not be overly confident in a specific opening date, the date is not specified in any of the articles for this resort, but another nearby resort is aiming to open on December 6th so that could influence Alpental as well, or it could open sooner.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive:** La Niña winter + Resort investment + nearby resort aiming for Dec 6 opening + typical early December opening dates.
*   **Negative:** No specific date mentioned, weather may be variable.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   Given that many resorts are opening in late November and early December, it's reasonable to assume a trend towards more openings in early December, but this is not a specific date for this resort, more a general trend in many resorts.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question is binary (open or closed), so there are two possible outcomes.
*   There are some uncertainty around the exact opening date for Alpental, even with all the positive signs.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   Given the positive signals and trend toward more openings but also the lack of a specific opening date for Alpental itself, I want to avoid being too overconfident. But I also don't want to be too conservative, as many resorts are already open or planning for early December openings.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   The main error I want to avoid is over-reliance on news of other resorts opening and not focusing enough on the fact that no specific date has been mentioned for Alpental. I also want to avoid ignoring the positive signals regarding La Niña weather patterns and resort investment, which makes it more probable than not to be open.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

Based on this analysis, I am leaning towards a higher probability that Alpental will be open on December 6, given the La Nina, resort investments and the large number of other resorts opening around that date. However, the lack of any specific date or mention of an exact opening means that the probability should not be too high. The most likely opening date is in the early part of December and the December 6th aligns with the opening date of a nearby ski resort.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecast for Alpental's opening on December 6, 2024.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** Ski resort openings in early December. We need to look at historical data for similar resorts, but unfortunately, I don't have access to that specific data here. However, I can gather information from the provided articles and general knowledge. Based on the provided articles, many resorts in the northern hemisphere are aiming to open in late November or early December, meaning there will be a wide range of opening dates.
*   **Initial Base Rate:** Without specific historical data on Alpental, let's start with a moderate probability, say 60%, that a ski resort would be open by December 6, as this is a common opening window for many of them.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We need to consider several factors:
    *   **Snow Conditions:** Is there enough natural snow? Are snowmaking capabilities sufficient?
    *   **Resort Preparation:** Have they completed maintenance and staffing?
    *   **Announced Plans:** What are Alpental's publicly stated plans?
    *   **External Factors:** Are there any unexpected weather events or other disruptions?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** My initial base rate of 60% from the reference class. Many ski resorts target opening around this time, but not all are successful.
*   **Inside View:** Let's examine the news articles specific to Alpental and the surrounding area:
    *   The *seattlemet.com* article from November 8th states that Alpental is getting a new chairlift (the Internationale chair). This suggests that the resort is investing in improvements and likely plans to open. It also mentions that Alpental will be open on Mondays in January and February. This suggests that they plan to be open and operational for a good part of the season.
    *   The article also mentions that the Pacific Northwest is expecting a good snow season due to a La Niña winter. This is a positive sign for adequate snow.
    *   The *fox13seattle.com* article from Nov 15 mentions that Stevens Pass aims to open on December 6, which suggests this is an expected opening date for some resorts in the area.
    *   However, the same article also mentions that opening depends on snowfall.
    *   The *The Epoch Times* article from November 26 states that Stevens Pass opened a week earlier than planned because of recent snowfall, which suggests good snow conditions are possible in the region.
    *   The same *The Epoch Times* also mentions that The Summit at Snoqualmie has not yet announced its opening date, which may be worrying as Alpental is part of the Snoqualmie complex.

**4. Under- and Overreacting:**

*   **Overreacting:** I don't want to overreact to the news of the La Niña weather pattern as while it increases the chances of more snow, there are never guarantees for snow, and the mountain needs enough snow to open, not just some. I also don't want to overreact to the positive signals and be too confident.
*   **Underreacting:** I also don't want to dismiss the positive news from other resorts in the area that are already open. The fact that Stevens Pass opened a week earlier suggests this area has had snow.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:** La Niña, resort investment, other local resorts opening, early snowfall in the region.
*   **Negative Forces:** Dependence on sufficient snowfall, no specific date for Alpental opening mentioned.

**6. Extrapolating Trends:**

The trend seems positive overall, with many resorts in the northern hemisphere targeting openings around December 6. The news of resorts nearby opening early suggests that the area has received early snowfall.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

Given the available information, there are a few reasons that could prevent the opening: Lack of snow, last minute issues with the resort, technical issues with the new lift.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**

I am quite confident that the resort is likely to open as the positive forces are outweighing the negative. However, there are some doubts from no specific opening date announced and the dependence on snow conditions.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

My potential error would be too much overconfidence. I will monitor for any new information that may prove the other way.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

Balancing the positive indicators (La Niña, nearby resorts opening early and getting snow, the new chairlift) with the uncertainty of snowfall and no official opening date for Alpental itself, I adjust the initial base rate upwards, but not too drastically. I will lean towards a higher probability given all other signs and news.

**Forecast:**

Given all the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Alpental will open on December 6, but with a good degree of uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 78.00% being the most likely. Probability: 78.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Triage:** This is a fairly specific question about a single ski resort's opening status on a particular date. It is not a broad geopolitical question, but it does involve weather and operational factors, making it moderately complex. There's no similar question on Metaculus currently.
*   **Reference Class:**  The reference class is ski resort openings.  We need to think about how often ski resorts *plan* to open, how often they *actually* open on their planned date, and what factors cause deviations from those plans. We'll need to dig into this from the articles.

**2. Break Down into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Planned Opening Date:** Was December 6th the *original* planned opening date for Alpental or was there a previous planned date or is it a default that they aim for when the snow is suitable.
*   **Current Conditions:** How are snow conditions in the Pacific Northwest? Are they favorable? What is typical for the area? Are there issues with staffing, maintenance or access?
*   **Recent Weather:** What has the weather been like in the region recently, and what's the forecast for the next couple of days?
*   **Reliability of Source:** How reliable is OnTheSnow's report likely to be? Are there cases where it has been wrong/outdated?

**3. Outside vs. Inside View**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   General ski resort opening patterns.  Many resorts plan to open in late November/early December, but some open earlier and later.  Weather is the most important factor.
    *   The news articles show a wide range of opening dates globally, with many resorts adjusting their schedules due to snowfall. Some had planned to open earlier but had delays due to warm weather. There's also resorts that have brought openings forward because of good early-season snow.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   The specific details about Alpental's preparations (new chairlift, etc.) suggest they are intending to open this season.
    *   The article about Pacific Northwest ski areas expecting a good snow season due to La Niña is favorable.
    *   The SeattleMet article from Nov 8 stated that "Snoqualmie's Alpental, which is gaining a new expert chairlift, the Internationale Chair..." suggest they plan to operate this season.
    *   The article also mentions Alpental will be open on Mondays in Jan and Feb, suggesting they anticipate being open.
    *   No specific stated opening date for Alpental is available and this suggests that it is dependent on the conditions being suitable.
    *   The Stevens Pass resort nearby was slated to open Dec 6th, but opened a week early, which suggests the conditions are suitable and that resorts in the area are opening when possible.
   *   The reports of other resorts opening are good (e.g. Seven Springs on Dec 6th).
    *   There are reports of resorts that have been unable to open due to lack of snow (e.g. Sierra Nevada).

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting:**

*   The La Niña forecast and the general positive sentiment toward the season in the Pacific Northwest is a strong signal for a likely opening.
*   We should not overreact to individual articles, or be biased by recency of reporting. We must balance the global news against the specific reports of the ski resorts in Washington.
*   However, we should also not ignore the fact that ski resorts sometimes do fail to open on their intended dates.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Force:** The La Niña prediction and the expectation of a good snow season for the Pacific Northwest are strong positive forces. The new chairlift also shows a desire to be open and operating.
*   **Negative Force:** The weather can be unpredictable. Lack of snowfall or bad snow conditions can delay opening, especially with no specific opening date set.

**6. Linear Extrapolation**

*   Linear extrapolation isn't directly relevant, but we can note that resorts that intended to open early are largely succeeding, and the general pattern is one of opening resorts as soon as possible when conditions permit.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   This is a binary question (open or closed), so we don't need a very granular probability but we should express our degree of uncertainty.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence**

*   We want to be confident enough to make a prediction but not so confident that we fail to account for the risk of the unexpected. This is a situation where a narrow confidence interval may be unwise.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**

*   We need to try to avoid hindsight bias, if the resort is open, it doesn't mean that we should have been 100% sure; or if it is closed it does not mean it should have been impossible to open. We can reflect on whether we properly balanced various pieces of evidence, or if we should have given more weight to any specific piece of information.

**Reasoning:**

Given the positive indicators of La Niña, the new chair lift and the lack of specific opening date suggests that the ski resort will be open. There is no reason from the available information to think that the resort would not be open. However, weather can still be somewhat unpredictable and unexpected maintenance can always be an issue. There are no specific reports of issues with snow depth, so the balance of evidence is weighted towards a likely opening of Alpental on Dec 6th. We will need to monitor On the Snow's report to be certain of the opening.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 78.00% and 92.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecast step-by-step, using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There are no past predictions for this specific ski resort opening on this date on Metaculus.
*   **Other Sources:** FiveThirtyEight and Polymarket don't cover specific ski resort openings, so these aren't useful here.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is about the Alpental ski resort's operational status on December 6, 2024, as reported by "On the Snow." We need to consider:

*   **Typical Opening Dates:** When does Alpental *usually* open?
*   **Current Snow Conditions:** Is there enough snow?
*   **Resort Preparation:** Is the resort operationally ready?
*   **Specific Information about Alpental:** Any local or unique circumstances.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate for ski resorts opening on a specific date in early December would be helpful but impossible to find precisely (a very wide class, and hard to get data). However, based on the news articles, many ski resorts open around late November to mid-December. Therefore, the base rate is likely in the 50-80% range for resorts being open in early December, assuming conditions are generally favourable.
*   **Inside View:** We must analyze specific information about Alpental.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

We need to avoid being too swayed by either overly positive or negative signals but also we shouldn't dismiss information. We will try to find a balance.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces (for opening):**
    *   The news article from *seattlemet.com* (November 8, 2024) mentions that the Pacific Northwest is expecting a good snow season due to a projected La Niña winter and that Alpental has a new expert chairlift. This suggests a general optimism for the season. The same article confirms Alpental will be open on Mondays in January and February.
    *   The *seattlemet.com* article indicates that the resort is making improvements and investments for the season, which suggests an intention to open if feasible.
    *   Many other resorts across the world have opened around this time or are planning to do so.
    *    The news articles that provide opening dates are mostly either opening around this date or soon after.
*   **Negative Forces (against opening):**
    *   The *fox13seattle.com* article (November 15, 2024) states that Stevens Pass aims to open on December 6, but the actual date depends on snowfall, meaning there is no guarantee of opening on this date. This suggests there may be some uncertainty in the region regarding whether resorts will be open by this date.
    *   The *fox13seattle.com* article also states that White Pass is waiting for a 36-inch base to open, while Mt. Baker is hopeful to open in the next few weeks. This signals a general possibility of insufficient snow in the region.
    * The fact that many resorts are announcing openings for later in the week suggests that there may be a general trend to open just slightly later than December 6th.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   News articles show that many resorts are opening in the late November and early December period, so if this trend were to continue linearly then Alpental is likely to open around December 6th. However, it could also be a few days later given the number of openings later in the week.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

We need to acknowledge that there's some uncertainty, but not so much that we cannot provide any forecast. The fact that Stevens Pass and others are mentioning this date as a target, indicates that December 6th is a key date for resorts.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

We must avoid overconfidence. The articles show a combination of positive developments but also some uncertainties, so we should not take too strong of a view. We also don't want to be too prudent because the probability should still reflect the evidence provided.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**

There's no past track record for this specific event, but we must be aware that things can change very quickly. We should review the factors to see which should be weighted more heavily in the future if the prediction is wrong.

**Analysis and Judgment**

The *seattlemet.com* article is positive for Alpental with new improvements and a good snow season expected. However, the lack of specific information on Alpental's target opening date, in conjunction with the fact that other articles in the same area are mentioning the weather dependence of their own target dates, suggests some caution. The base rate and evidence point to a better chance of opening than not but still with some uncertainty. 

**Forecast**

Given all of the evidence above, it is most likely that Alpental will be open, but there is still significant uncertainty. It's unlikely the opening date will be pushed much later into December if it is not open on December 6th as resorts tend to have a very short opening period between late November and mid-December. However, there is still a decent chance that the resort is not able to open, especially if snowfall is less than expected.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 90.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

The *seattlemet.com* article is positive for Alpental with new improvements and a good snow season expected. However, the lack of specific information on Alpental's target opening date, in conjunction with the fact that other articles in the same area are mentioning the weather dependence of their own target dates, suggests some caution. The base rate and evidence point to a better chance of opening than not but still with some uncertainty. 

**Forecast**

Given all of the evidence above, it is most likely that Alpental will be open, but there is still significant uncertainty. It's unlikely the opening date will be pushed much later into December if it is not open on December 6th as resorts tend to have a very short opening period between late November and mid-December. However, there is still a decent chance that the resort is not able to open, especially if snowfall is less than expected.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 90.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecast step-by-step, using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There are no past predictions for this specific ski resort opening on this date on Metaculus.
*   **Other Sources:** FiveThirtyEight and Polymarket don't cover specific ski resort openings, so these aren't useful here.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is about the Alpental ski resort's operational status on December 6, 2024, as reported by "On the Snow." We need to consider:

*   **Typical Opening Dates:** When does Alpental *usually* open?
*   **Current Snow Conditions:** Is there enough snow?
*   **Resort Preparation:** Is the resort operationally ready?
*   **Specific Information about Alpental:** Any local or unique circumstances.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate for ski resorts opening on a specific date in early December would be helpful but impossible to find precisely (a very wide class, and hard to get data). However, based on the news articles, many ski resorts open around late November to mid-December. Therefore, the base rate is likely in the 50-80% range for resorts being open in early December, assuming conditions are generally favourable.
*   **Inside View:** We must analyze specific information about Alpental.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

We need to avoid being too swayed by either overly positive or negative signals but also we shouldn't dismiss information. We will try to find a balance.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces (for opening):**
    *   The news article from *seattlemet.com* (November 8, 2024) mentions that the Pacific Northwest is expecting a good snow season due to a projected La Niña winter and that Alpental has a new expert chairlift. This suggests a general optimism for the season. The same article confirms Alpental will be open on Mondays in January and February.
    *   The *seattlemet.com* article indicates that the resort is making improvements and investments for the season, which suggests an intention to open if feasible.
    *   Many other resorts across the world have opened around this time or are planning to do so.
    *    The news articles that provide opening dates are mostly either opening around this date or soon after.
*   **Negative Forces (against opening):**
    *   The *fox13seattle.com* article (November 15, 2024) states that Stevens Pass aims to open on December 6, but the actual date depends on snowfall, meaning there is no guarantee of opening on this date. This suggests there may be some uncertainty in the region regarding whether resorts will be open by this date.
    *   The *fox13seattle.com* article also states that White Pass is waiting for a 36-inch base to open, while Mt. Baker is hopeful to open in the next few weeks. This signals a general possibility of insufficient snow in the region.
    * The fact that many resorts are announcing openings for later in the week suggests that there may be a general trend to open just slightly later than December 6th.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   News articles show that many resorts are opening in the late November and early December period, so if this trend were to continue linearly then Alpental is likely to open around December 6th. However, it could also be a few days later given the number of openings later in the week.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

We need to acknowledge that there's some uncertainty, but not so much that we cannot provide any forecast. The fact that Stevens Pass and others are mentioning this date as a target, indicates that December 6th is a key date for resorts.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

We must avoid overconfidence. The articles show a combination of positive developments but also some uncertainties, so we should not take too strong of a view. We also don't want to be too prudent because the probability should still reflect the evidence provided.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**

There's no past track record for this specific event, but we must be aware that things can change very quickly. We should review the factors to see which should be weighted more heavily in the future if the prediction is wrong.
