*The newsroom buzzes with activity. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the clock struck midnight, and here we are. Will Russia start a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. The data pointed to Putin's fear of public unrest outweighing the military's needs.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. The ISW's reports consistently highlighted the unpopularity of another wave. Russia's losses were significant, but they managed recruitment through other means.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Despite Ukraine's mobilization plans, Russia's strategy leaned on crypto-mobilization and recruitment efforts instead of formal conscription.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a testament to the complexities of geopolitical forecasting. Sometimes the numbers tell a story of restraint.

*They nod, the weight of their predictions settling in the room.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered around them. A large screen in the background displays the headline: "RUSSIA MOBILIZATION UPDATE: NO SECOND WAVE."*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the much-anticipated second wave of Russian mobilization didn’t happen. Our models had it at 35.67%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Given the widespread discontent a second wave would likely cause, our models were confident it wouldn’t materialize. Putin's concerns about public backlash were pivotal.

**NATE SILVER**  
The geopolitical landscape was tense, with Ukraine's massive mobilization plans and Russia's recruitment efforts. Yet, the formal mobilization seemed a step too far for the Kremlin.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The ISW reports aligned with our predictions. While the situation remains fluid, this outcome underscores the importance of accurate forecasting in uncertain times.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, here we are. The deadline has passed, and it seems the world was on edge for nothing.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. Given the political climate and ISW's assessments, a second mobilization seemed unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Putin's reluctance to stir further discontent played a significant role. The cost of another wave would have been immense, both politically and socially.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. Despite Russia's losses and Ukraine's mobilization efforts, the Kremlin opted for other recruitment strategies.

**NATE SILVER:** A calculated move, it seems. Our models remain undefeated, yet again.

*They exchange a knowing smile, confident in their foresight.*

No, our models had it at 35.25%. The ISW reports no formal mobilization.

Interesting. Despite the staggering losses and Ukraine's troop mobilization, Putin held back.

Indeed. Our models factored in the potential for widespread discontent. It's a delicate balance for Russia.
