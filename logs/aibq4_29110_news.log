**Will Intel Stock Be Dropped From the DOW? Here's What This Investor Expects**
Intel's stock has plummeted by 60% this year, and the company is facing significant challenges, including missed dividend payments and layoffs. However, according to investor Invest Heroes, the company's exclusion from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) will have a minimal impact, amounting to less than $100 million out of Intel's $80.60 billion capitalization. Invest Heroes sees reasons for optimism, including Intel's focus on building out its Core Ultra AI processors, and projects a net income of $2 billion by 2025. The investor rates Intel shares a Buy, citing the negative sentiment in the market as an opportunity to snap up the stock at bargain prices. However, Wall Street remains more cautious, with a consensus Hold rating and a 12-month price target of $26.09, suggesting a potential upside of ~33%.

**DOW: Index May Drop Intel & Replace it With Nvidia**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average may replace Intel with Nvidia due to Intel's poor performance. Intel's stock (INTC) has lost over 70% of its value since 2020, and the company has faced significant market share loss and workforce cuts. The Dow's selection committee considers the price of shares in the index, and currently, Nvidia's stock has spiked over 160% in the past year, making it a potential candidate for inclusion. If Intel is replaced, it could create positive momentum for Nvidia, as many funds indexed to the Dow would become net buyers.

**Intel's Place In Dow In Jeopardy, AI Strategy Under Scrutiny: Report - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)**
Analysts predict that Intel may be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to its struggles in AI and manufacturing competitiveness. According to Reuters, Intel's stock price trajectory and missed opportunities in the artificial intelligence boom, such as OpenAI's failed investment, have raised concerns. Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds suggests that Nvidia Corp could replace Intel on the Dow, citing Nvidia's 129% increase in the last 12 months compared to Intel's 44% decline. Daniel Morgan of Synovus Trust also notes Texas Instruments Inc as a possible contender for the Dow Jones. Intel plans to ship chips for over 100 million AI personal computers by 2025, but recent reports indicate the company is considering breaking up its product design and manufacturing businesses. As a result, Intel's stock price has dropped 6.63% to $20.58 at the last check on Tuesday.

**Intel Likely To Get Booted From The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Owing To The Stock's ~60 Percent Loss This Year**
Intel's stock has declined by approximately 60% this year, making it likely to be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. According to Reuters, Intel's chronic underperformance has led to its potential removal from the index, which would deprive the stock of passive funding and potentially lead to further losses. This development comes as Intel prepares to pitch a broad-based revival plan at its upcoming board meeting, which may include unloading its majority stake in Altera and instituting a construction freeze on its $30 billion facility in Germany. However, the company is unlikely to divest its chip manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry. To conserve cash, Intel has slashed its dividends, laid off 13.6% of its workforce, and cut its capital spending for 2025 by 17% to $21.5 billion.

**US Stock Markets Retreat, Dow Jones Falls 0.53%**
The US stock markets retreated on Friday after a stronger opening, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 0.53% to 42,397.96 points. Despite this, the index is still on track to post a weekly gain of around 0.8%. The S&P 500 fell 0.02% to 5,744.33, while the Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.40% to 20,034.26. Consumer spending in the US rose less than expected in August, but the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index improved more than forecast in September. The PCE deflator, a preferred inflation measure of the Federal Reserve, also came in below expectations. This suggests that the Fed may not lower interest rates further in November, as had been hoped. Costco's shares fell 2.0% to $883 after the company released detailed earnings, but Intel's shares only declined 0.1% despite rejecting a takeover bid from ARM Holdings. ARM's shares, however, dropped 2.1%.

**Wall Street remains stuck in place**
U.S. stock indexes remained stable on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 edging up by 1.49 points, or less than 0.1%, to 5,634.58. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 15.90 points, or less than 0.1%, to 41,606.18, while the Nasdaq composite edged up by 35.93, or 0.2%, to 17,628.06. Intel's 2.7% gain, driven by its partnership expansion with Amazon Web Services and foundry business plans, helped offset Philip Morris International's 2.2% drop due to a $220 million expected loss from the sale of its Vectura Group subsidiary. The calm market movements were a departure from prior weeks, during which the S&P 500 briefly fell nearly 10% below its all-time high. The anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, expected on Wednesday, has built excitement about the potential for lower rates to ease the economy, which has slowed due to high borrowing costs.

**US: All eyes on Fed as Dow ends at record**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached an all-time high of 41,622.08 on Monday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.5%. Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates, with many expecting a cut for the first time since March 2020. However, there is uncertainty about the size of the cut, with some predicting a 25 basis point reduction and others a more aggressive 50 basis point cut. Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare noted that 'you could see a sell-the-news type situation' in light of recent gains. The Fed has been hiking rates since 2022 in response to inflation, but with inflation falling and the labour market cooling, policymakers believe conditions are ripe for a cut. The Fed's medium-term forecast for additional interest rate cuts in 2024 and 2025 will also be closely watched. Apple fell 2.8% amid reports of tepid demand for its latest iPhone model, while Intel jumped 6.4% following a report that it is close to winning a $3.5 billion Pentagon contract for chip manufacturing.

**What the Hell Is Going on at Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)?**
Intel's stock has lost a third of its value since July and 60% this year, putting its place in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at risk. The company's struggles began with its earnings report in August, which showed a 1% drop in revenue and a forecast for the current quarter below analyst projections. Intel has suspended its dividend, laid off 15% of its workforce, and is considering cost-cutting options, including spinning off or selling business units. The company's Foundry manufacturing unit has struggled to compete with TSMC, but is in talks with 12 potential customers and poised to generate 'meaningful' revenue by 2027, according to CFO David Zinsner. Intel is also eligible for up to $11 billion in federal loans under the CHIPS and Science Act, and has a preliminary agreement for up to $8.5 billion in funding. However, the company's future remains uncertain, with some analysts suggesting that it may not be able to recover from its current struggles.

**Will Collapsing Intel Stock Get Kicked Out of the Dow?**
Intel (INTC) has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor industry, with its stock down 30% since the start of 2023 and 46% over the last 10 years. The company's struggles with rising competition from Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have led to falling revenue and cash flow, forcing Intel to suspend its dividend and reduce its workforce. As a result, there is speculation that Intel will be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DOWI), with analysts suggesting that Nvidia or Texas Instruments (TXN) could replace it. Despite Intel's efforts to improve its business fundamentals, including a $10 billion cost-reduction plan and a plan to spin off its foundry business, the company's near-term prospects are uncertain, making it a high-risk investment. Analysts have an average target price of $29.19 for INTC stock, indicating an upside potential of over 50% from current levels.

**Intel Is Probably Getting Kicked Out of the Dow, but Nvidia May Not Be Its Logical Replacement**
Intel is likely to be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to its poor performance and low share price. The company's problems include falling behind in AI-accelerated data centers, building out its foundry-services segment at a high cost, and losing market share to AMD in legacy CPUs. Despite Nvidia's dominance in AI, S&P Dow Jones Indices may be hesitant to add it to the Dow due to concerns about an AI bubble and Nvidia's low share price. Instead, Broadcom may be a more suitable replacement due to its diverse sales channels, including AI networking solutions, wireless chips, and optical products. Broadcom's recent 10-for-1 forward-stock split has reduced its share price to $154, making it a more appealing addition to the Dow.

**Intel faces Dow ejection but there may be a silver lining**
Intel shares are down 60% in 2024, prompting speculation that it may be removed from the Dow Jones index. However, according to Research Affiliates founder Rob Arnott, this could be good news for shareholders. Arnott has launched an ETF consisting of companies that have been deleted from indices, which tend to outperform their replacements. 'Deleted companies are often unloved, have fallen out of favour and are no longer valuable enough to be deemed important,' says Arnott. His research suggests that deleted stocks outperform by more than 5% annually over the following five years. A recent example is Super Micro Computer, which was added to the S&P 500 in March after its shares quadrupled in value, but subsequently fell 60% after its bubble burst. Arnott notes that there may be an 'upside of getting dumped' for Intel if it's kicked out of the Dow.

**Intel, Amazon.com Inc. share losses contribute to Dow's nearly 250-point fall**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 250 points on Friday morning due to losses in Intel and Amazon.com Inc. shares. Intel's shares dropped $0.52, or 2.7%, while Amazon.com Inc.'s shares are off $4.26, or 2.4%, contributing to a 31-point drag on the Dow. Other significant contributors to the decline include American Express, Boeing, and Honeywell. According to the article, a $1 move in any one of the 30 components of the benchmark equates to a 6.57-point swing.

**Intel Faces Exclusion from Dow Jones Index Amid 60% Stock Decline**
Intel's stock has fallen by 60% this year, putting the company at risk of being removed from the Dow Jones index. Analysts believe that with a 60% drop in stock value, Intel may be the worst-performing company in the list and could be excluded from the index. Ryan Detrick from Carson Group stated, 'The exclusion of Intel was inevitable, and the latest results may be the deciding factor.' Intel's failure to invest in artificial intelligence and its losses from contract manufacturing have taken a toll on the company. To restructure, Intel has suspended dividends and announced the layoffs of 15% of its employees, but many experts believe these measures may not be enough. Reports show that Intel not only lags behind in technology production but also loses market share, making it vulnerable to growing competition from other semiconductor manufacturers like NVIDIA, AMD, and others. Investors are waiting for Intel to take further steps to regain trust in the brand.

**What's Going On With Intel Stock On Thursday? - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)**
Intel stock has fallen 47% over the last year due to struggles with AI growth and lost contracts to Taiwan Semiconductor. CFO David Zinsner expects 'meaningful' revenue from contract chip manufacturing in 2027, but the stock has been impacted by reports of its failure to impress Broadcom and its decision to scrap the 20A manufacturing process. Analysts speculate that Intel may lose its Dow Jones Industrial Average position and is considering strategic options, including splitting its product design and manufacturing businesses. Intel's revenue growth in FY23 was -14.0%, and macro factors such as higher interest rates, inflation, and labor market strength could impact the company's performance in the next year. According to Zinsner, Intel is currently discussing with 12 potential customers how to generate revenue in 2026 and additional cash in 2027. The stock is up 0.41% at $19.52 at the last check on Thursday.

**Business**
Stock markets experienced their worst trading session since early August, driven by fears of an economic slowdown. Tech companies, particularly Nvidia, were hit hard, with the company's market value plummeting by $279 billion, the largest single-day drop in history. Nvidia's stock fell further after reports emerged that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed the company in an antitrust investigation, which the company later denied. Intel's stock also dropped by 7% amid speculation that it may be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The sell-off had a ripple effect, spreading to Asian and European markets, with the Composite index falling by 3.3%.

**Tech, energy stocks lose more ground**
U.S. stock indexes continued to decline on Wednesday, with technology, energy, and other sectors contributing to the losses. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, the Nasdaq composite shed 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a gain of 0.1%. The decline came as a government report showed a surprise drop in job openings in July, with 7.7 million open jobs, down from 7.9 million in June and the fewest since January 2021. Economists at High Frequency Economics noted, 'Job vacancies declined, hires rose and quits were steady. There is no signal here of any sudden collapse of the labor market here or any imminent recession.' Technology stocks, including Nvidia, Apple, and Intel, were among the biggest weights on the market, with Nvidia falling 1.7% and Intel sliding 3.3%. Energy stocks, including Exxon Mobil, also contributed to the decline, with Exxon Mobil falling 1.2% as the price of U.S. crude oil fell below $70 a barrel.

**Intel's Decline: A 60% Stock Price Drop and the Challenges Ahead**
Intel has fallen from its former glory, with its stock price declining by almost 60% this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. According to experts, the company's long-standing problems with product development and introduction are a major issue. As analyst Eye explains, 'They have had difficulties in implementation and design for a while.' Additionally, Intel's high investments needed to expand its foundry business are a significant burden. The company faces intense competition from rivals like AMD, which is aggressively taking market share and exploiting Intel's weaknesses. In this dynamic and competitive market, Intel is under increasing pressure to perform.

**Intel Stock Drops Further as Silicon Wafers Reportedly Fail Broadcom Tests**
Intel shares dropped further on Wednesday after Reuters reported that Broadcom's tests of Intel's 18A manufacturing process failed. The silicon wafers, which were run through the process, were reportedly returned to Broadcom last month. Intel's struggles have accelerated over the last month, with a disappointing earnings report and plans to lay off 15% of its employees. The company's shares have lost about 60% of their value since the start of 2024. Intel's shares were 2% lower at $19.67 early Wednesday afternoon. 'The earnings-related fall was followed by reports that concerns have emerged over the company's planned construction of two new facilities in Germany,' according to Investopedia. 'Executives are preparing to present plans to cut costs and sell assets amid the company's struggles, and concerns that Intel could potentially face removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA),' the article added.

**Intel Faces Possible Removal from Dow Jones Index**
Intel, one of the pioneers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index during the internet bubble in the late 1990s, is facing the possibility of being removed from the select group of blue-chip companies. The chip manufacturer saw its shares plummet by almost 60% in 2024, putting its presence in the index that measures the performance of the main US companies at risk. According to Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at the Carson Group, 'the exclusion of Intel from the Dow Jones was already on its way for a long time', he said to Reuters. The company has been struggling to adapt to market changes, particularly after missing the opportunity to capitalize on the growth of artificial intelligence by passing on an investment in OpenAI. To try to reverse the situation, Intel announced drastic measures, including the suspension of dividends and the dismissal of 15% of its workforce. However, analysts believe that these actions may be 'insufficient and late' to prevent the company's removal from the index. With the possible departure of Intel from the Dow, speculation is growing about which company could take its place. Nvidia, whose shares have risen by over 160% this year, is a strong candidate, especially due to its crucial role in developing chips for artificial intelligence. However, some investors consider that Nvidia's volatility may not align with the more stable profile of the Dow companies. Another possible substitute is Texas Instruments, a company with almost a century of existence, with a strong presence in the US and shares that have appreciated by over 20% this year.

**Intel could be removed from Dow Jones due to stark stock price drop: Report**
Intel's stock price has plummeted nearly 60% this year, causing the company to fall below $100 billion in market capitalization for the first time in 30 years. Analysts and investors believe that Intel's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index is likely imminent due to its poor performance. The company's decline is partly due to missed opportunities in the AI sector, declining revenue, and massive spending on manufacturing capacity. Intel has implemented drastic measures, including layoffs and suspended dividend payments, but some experts believe these steps may be too little, too late. If Intel is removed from the DJIA, potential replacements include Nvidia and Texas Instruments, according to an analyst. Nvidia's stock has risen 160% this year, but its volatility might be a concern, while Texas Instruments has seen a 20% increase in stock price and is known for its stable performance.

**Intel at Risk of Being Removed from Dow Jones Industrial Average**
Intel, one of the first tech companies to be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is at risk of being removed from the index due to a significant decline in its stock price. The company's stock value has fallen by nearly 60% this year, making it the worst performer in the list. This decline is part of a broader trend in the semiconductor industry, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index falling by 6% after reports of a global decline in chip sales in July 2024. In response to these challenges, Intel has suspended its dividend payments and announced plans to lay off 15% of its employees, according to Reuters. As Intel's stock price continues to plummet, the company's future in the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains uncertain.

**Intel Faces Significant Loss of Significance Amid Ongoing Crisis**
Intel, a leading chip manufacturer, is at risk of losing its significance in the industry. The company's ongoing crisis and subsequent stock price drop may lead to its removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to Reuters. Intel has experienced a dramatic 60% stock price decline this year, making it the weakest stock in the Dow and the one with the lowest price-weighted index. The company's shares dropped by about 7% on Tuesday, attributed to a general market sell-off. Intel has missed the opportunity to capitalize on the growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI), after declining to invest in OpenAI. Additionally, the company is experiencing losses in its contract manufacturing division, which competes with TSMC. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger plans to present a strategy to the board for selling non-core business areas and reorienting investments later this month. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the Dow, declined to comment on a possible exclusion of Intel. Changes to the index occur as needed, with the last change being in February, when Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon. Given that stock price is a key criterion for inclusion in the Dow, Nvidia may be considered as a potential replacement for Intel. Nvidia's stock price has risen by over 160% this year, driven by the demand for its chips in generative AI. A stock split in May has also increased the chances of Nvidia's inclusion in the Dow.

**Dow-ward spiral: Intel share price drop could see it delisted from blue-chip index**
Intel's share price has dropped by over 50% since the start of the year, putting its spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average at risk. Financial analysts expect the company to be removed from the index, which would be another blow to Intel's reputation following technical issues with its Raptor Lake processors, suspension of its quarterly dividend, and layoffs of over 16,000 staff. Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, acknowledged the company's problems and is working with investment bankers to identify a route out of its financial woes, which may include selling off business units, such as its Altera programmable logic (FPGA) division, or seeking more funding from the US government. Some experts suggest that Intel's foundry business needs support, as it declined in revenue in 2023 and led to a $7 billion operating loss. Others have suggested selling off the CPU business and focusing on the foundry side, but this may not be feasible given the current level of losses.

**Intel's Stock Plunge May Lead to Dow Jones Index Exclusion**
Intel's stock has fallen by 60% this year, making it likely to be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. Analysts and investors say that Intel's nearly 60% stock drop this year makes it the worst performer in the list. The company's stock fell by about 7% on Tuesday, September 3, amid a market sell-off, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index decreased by almost 6% after reports of a decline in chip sales worldwide in July. Intel's exclusion from the index would further damage the company's already battered reputation. The company missed the AI boom by refusing to invest in OpenAI and is struggling to compete with TSMC on its contract manufacturing site. To finance restructuring, Intel suspended dividend payments and announced layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce during its earnings report last month. However, some analysts and a former board member believe that these steps may be too little, too late for the chipmaker. 'Intel's exclusion has been a long time coming,' said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. 'The latest results may be the final straw needed for Intel's removal from the Dow Jones index.' Yesterday, Nvidia plummeted by $280 billion in a single day, the largest decline for any company in history.

**Intel on the Brink: Company Faces Exclusion from Dow Jones Index**
Intel, one of the first two tech companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index during the dot-com bubble in the late 90s, along with Microsoft, may be excluded from the index due to its falling stock price. Analysts and investors believe that Intel will likely be removed from the Dow Jones index after a nearly 60% drop in the company's stock price this year, making it the worst performer in the list. The company's stock price fell by around 7% on Tuesday, September 3, amid market sell-offs. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell by almost 6% after news of a global decline in chip sales in July. The exclusion from the index will further damage Intel's already struggling reputation. The company missed the AI boom by refusing to invest in OpenAI and is experiencing growing losses on its contract manufacturing plant, which it is building to compete with TSMC. To finance its restructuring, Intel has suspended dividend payments and announced a 15% reduction in its workforce during its earnings report last month. However, some analysts and former board members believe that these measures may be insufficient and come too late for the company. 'Intel's exclusion has likely been a long time coming,' says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. He added that the latest results may be the final straw needed for the company's final exclusion from the Dow Jones index. Yesterday, Nvidia fell by $280 billion in a single day, the largest drop for any company in history.'

**Intel Stock Falls Further Amid Broadcom's Failed Manufacturing Process Tests**
Intel's stock fell further on Wednesday amid a broader sell-off in chip stocks, as the company's contract manufacturing business received another negative news. According to Reuters, recent tests of Intel's latest manufacturing process conducted by Broadcom failed. Intel's stock has lost around 60% of its value this year, including a 26% drop after a disappointing earnings report last month. Intel's (INTC) stock extended its losses on Wednesday amid a string of bad news, as Reuters reported that recent tests of Broadcom's (AVGO) advanced manufacturing process failed. The silicon wafers, on which the chips are printed, were returned to Broadcom last month after being subjected to Intel's 18A manufacturing process. A review by Broadcom's engineers found that the process is not ready for high-volume production, according to Reuters. Intel and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Investopedia. Latest Bad News for Intel Although many chip stocks have risen due to demand for artificial intelligence (AI), Intel's stock has lost around 60% of its value since the start of 2024. These difficulties have accelerated in the past month, with a disappointing earnings report and the announcement that it would lay off around 15% of its employees as part of a broader cost-cutting plan. The earnings report caused the stock to drop 26% the day after its release, to its lowest point in over a decade. The earnings-related drop was followed by reports of concerns over the planned construction of two new facilities in Germany. On Tuesday, the stock was pressured by a report indicating that executives are preparing to present plans to cut costs and sell assets in the face of the company's difficulties, as well as concerns that Intel could potentially be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Intel's stock was down 2% to $19.67 on Wednesday afternoon.

**Intel at Risk of Being Removed from Dow Jones Index**
Intel may be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a nearly 60% decline in value this year, making it the worst performer among the listed companies. According to Reuters, the chipmaker has been a member of the index for 25 years, but has failed to keep pace with its rivals in the artificial intelligence sector, losing significant market share. As Ryuta Makino, analyst at Gabelli Funds, said, 'the removal was probably expected for a long time' and the possibility of it happening is becoming increasingly concrete. The price of Intel's shares is a key factor in its inclusion in the Dow Jones, unlike the S&P 500 index which considers market value. The selection committee checks if the title with the highest price in the index has a value more than ten times higher than the title with the lowest weight. Currently, the title with the highest weight (UnitedHealth Group) has a price about 29 times higher than Intel's. Makino suggests that Nvidia may replace Intel in the Dow Jones, as both stocks have declined by around 7%.

**Intel stock dives amid fresh reports**
Intel's stock price dropped 8.8% on Tuesday, following a 3.3% decline in the Nasdaq. The company's prospects continue to be uncertain, with reports of potential asset sales, including the sale of its Altera programmable chip unit and the pausing or halting of a $32 billion factory project in Germany. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon expressed concerns about Intel's foundry business, stating that it 'cannot stand on its own right now given heavy losses and lack of scale.' Rasgon also noted that Intel's product business is 'structurally losing share' in a declining market. The analyst questioned Intel's decision to potentially raise more cash via asset sales, asking 'Would such a move simply be an attempt to bolster the stock price? Or are there more structural rationales for it?' Intel's shares have dropped 59.5% since the end of 2023, making it the Dow's worst performer and potentially in danger of losing its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

**Stock Markets See September Selloff In Worst Trading Day Since March 2020**
The stock markets experienced their worst trading day since March 2020, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining by 626.15 points (1.51%), the Nasdaq Composite falling by 577.33 points (3.26%), and the S&P 500 dropping by 119.47 points (2.12%). The decline was led by tech stocks, particularly those producing microchips, with Nvidia losing 9.5% and Intel dropping by 9%. According to Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Trend Report, 'The market right now seems to be very jumpy to any data that comes in.' The Federal Reserve is expected to announce interest rate cuts on September 10, but Tuesday's session raises questions about the market's stability.

**Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) May Be in Danger of  Removal from the Dow Jones**
Intel (INTC) is facing the possibility of being removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) due to its poor performance, with a 60% drop in value over the last year, making it the worst performer on the index. According to Reuters commentators, Intel's days of representing the tech sector in the Dow are coming to an end. Despite plans to sell off Altera and change its spending plans, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger's proposal to divest 'unnecessary businesses' does not include the foundry unit. The company may slow or halt the construction of a $32 billion factory in Germany, which was already delayed once. Analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock, with a 35.35% upside potential based on the average price target of $27.32 per share.

**Intel Stock Sinks Amid Worries It Could Be Delisted From the Dow**
Intel shares fell over 8% in intraday trading on Tuesday, amid concerns that the company could be delisted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company's disappointing second-quarter earnings results sent shares to their lowest level since 2013, making it the worst-performing constituent of the DJIA this year, with shares down nearly 60% from the start of 2024. A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment on Intel's status, but the company's low weighting in the index (0.3% as of last week) has raised concerns about its potential removal.

**Intel's Stock Price Plunge May Lead to Removal from Dow Jones Index**
Intel's stock price has fallen by almost 60% this year, which may lead to the company's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. Analysts and investors believe that the Intel will likely be removed from the Dow due to its poor performance. The company's stock price is currently the lowest in the index, and its sales have been declining. Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and other executives are expected to present a plan to the board of directors to cut unnecessary business and renew investments. The S&P Dow Jones, which manages the Dow, has not commented on whether Intel will be removed from the index. However, some analysts believe that the company's removal from the Dow will have a significant impact on its reputation and stock price. Nvidia and Texas Instruments are potential replacements for Intel in the Dow, according to some analysts.

**Intel's Dow status under threat as chipmaker's shares plunge**
Intel's shares have plummeted by nearly 60% this year, making it the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Analysts and investors believe the company's removal from the index is likely, citing its struggles in the artificial intelligence market and losses at its contract manufacturing unit. Intel has suspended dividends and announced layoffs, but some analysts think these moves may be too little, too late. The company's stock price is a key factor in its inclusion in the Dow, and its current price is significantly lower than the highest-priced stock in the index. If Intel is removed, Nvidia or Texas Instruments could potentially replace it, but some investors question whether Nvidia's volatility makes it a suitable candidate.

**Intel could be kicked out of Dow Jones index as shares slide over 6%**
Intel's shares have fallen 6% after rumors emerged that the company is considering selling its FPGA unit to Marvell Technology. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) may drop Intel from its index altogether, with analyst Ryan Detrick predicting that Intel's uncertain outlook primes it for displacement. Intel's stock has been in a downtrend since hitting an all-time high in August 2000, and is now trading at $20.57, well below its moving averages. The company is studying the possibility of selling its FPGA unit, which could fetch between $18 billion and $22 billion, and is partnering with a Japanese research institution to build a research laboratory for the study of EUV technology in chip design. However, Intel's uncertain outlook and recent losses have not satisfied Wall Street, and the company's stock is considered a recipe for disaster if it falls out of the DJIA.

**Intel's Place In Dow In Jeopardy, AI Strategy Under Scrutiny: Report - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)**
Analysts predict that Intel may be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to its struggles in AI and manufacturing competitiveness. According to Reuters, Intel's stock price trajectory and missed opportunities in the artificial intelligence boom, such as OpenAI's failed investment, have raised concerns. Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds suggests that Nvidia Corp could replace Intel on the Dow, citing Nvidia's 129% increase in the last 12 months compared to Intel's 44% decline. Daniel Morgan of Synovus Trust also notes Texas Instruments Inc as a possible contender for the Dow Jones. Intel plans to ship chips for over 100 million AI personal computers by 2025, but recent reports indicate the company is considering breaking up its product design and manufacturing businesses. As a result, Intel's stock price has dropped 6.63% to $20.58 at the last check on Tuesday.

**Intel shares are the Dow's worst performer this year and are the bellwether's lowest-priced stock.**
Intel shares have fallen sharply in Tuesday trading, extending their 2024 slump, amid reports that the chipmaker could be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel remains the benchmark's worst-performing stock and the lowest of the 30 companies on the price-weighted index, having lost more than $210 billion in market value since its prepandemic peak in January 2020. Analysts have suggested that Nvidia could replace Intel in the Dow, citing the chipmaker's importance in the American economy and market weighting. Intel's woes are likely to continue regardless of its place in the Dow, with the group facing huge questions about the fate of its long-running turnaround under Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger. Intel has unveiled plans to reduce its global headcount by 15% and suspend its quarterly dividend, and is considering deeper cost cuts and potential asset sales, including the sale of its Altera chip business.

**Intel Likely To Get Booted From The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Owing To The Stock's ~60 Percent Loss This Year**
Intel's stock has declined by approximately 60% this year, making it likely to be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. According to Reuters, Intel's chronic underperformance has led to its potential removal from the index, which would deprive the stock of passive funding and potentially lead to further losses. This development comes as Intel prepares to pitch a broad-based revival plan at its upcoming board meeting, which may include unloading its majority stake in Altera and instituting a construction freeze on its $30 billion facility in Germany. However, the company is unlikely to divest its chip manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry. To conserve cash, Intel has slashed its dividends, laid off 13.6% of its workforce, and cut its capital spending for 2025 by 17% to $21.5 billion.

**Intel's Future in Dow Jones at Risk Amid Stock Price Drop**
Following the pandemic, there was a significant increase in demand and interest in electric vehicles, technological devices, and artificial intelligence. Companies like NVIDIA, which quickly followed and capitalized on the artificial intelligence boom, exceeded expectations with their growth. However, Intel failed to keep up with this trend. Recently, CEO Pat Gelsinger presented a plan to the board of directors to sell off assets and reduce costs due to the company's financial difficulties. The company's stock price drop may cause Intel to lose its place in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), which measures the performance of the 30 largest US companies. As one expert noted, 'Intel's inability to adapt to the changing market has put its position in the Dow Jones at risk.'

Detrick added that Intel's recent financial results may be the final straw, leading to the removal of its stock from the Dow Jones index. The S&P 500 index, on the other hand, considers a company's market value when evaluating its stock. The Dow Jones committee evaluates its stocks based on whether the highest-priced stock is 10 times the value of the lowest-priced stock.

**Intel's Dow Jones Status Threatened by Share Decline**
Intel's status in the Dow Jones index is threatened by the decline of the chipmaker's shares. Analysts and investors have stated that Intel is likely to be removed from the index, citing the 60% drop in its shares this year, making it the worst performer in the index and leaving it with the lowest price in the Dow Jones weighted index. A removal would further damage Intel's already tarnished reputation. The company has missed the AI boom after passing on an investment in OpenAI and losses are piling up in its contract manufacturing unit aimed at competing with TSMC. To fund its turnaround, Intel has suspended its dividend and announced layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce in its latest earnings report. However, some analysts and a former board member believe that these measures may be insufficient and too late for the chipmaker. 'The removal of Intel was probably long overdue,' said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group. The latest results may be the final push needed for the company to be removed from the Dow Jones, added Detrick. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the Dow, has refused to comment on the possibility of Intel being removed from the index. The index changes are made based on needs and the last update occurred in February, when struggling Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon.com. The price of shares is a key factor for inclusion in the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 index, which takes into account market value. The Dow Jones selection committee checks if the most expensive stock in the index has a price more than 10 times higher than the cheapest stock. Currently, the most heavily weighted stock - UnitedHealth Group - has a price approximately 29 times higher than Intel's. The chipmaker is also the least influential member of the index, with a meager weighting of 0.32% based on its closing price of $20.13 on August 29. Although the most significant impact would be on Intel's reputation, exclusion would also have an additional impact on its shares, which have fallen by over 70% from their record high in August 2000, leaving the chipmaker with a market value of less than $100 billion for the first time in 30 years. Nvidia could replace Intel in the Dow Jones, according to Ryuta Makino, research analyst at Gabelli Funds, an investor in Intel. With shares up over 160% this year, Nvidia has become one of the most valuable companies in the world due to the essential role its chips play in feeding AI generative. A split in May has also increased the chances of its inclusion. However, some investors have estimated that Nvidia could be a too volatile title for the Dow Jones, which generally prefers more stable values. Texas Instruments, a nearly century-old chipmaker with significant production capacity in the US, is another option to replace Intel in the index, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, who owns Intel shares. The shares of Texas Instruments have risen by over 20% this year to reach $211.09 on Thursday, which is closer to the average price of the Dow Jones components, which is around $209. In the event of removal, a stock with a price closer to the average price of the current list might be preferred to replace it, said David Blitzer, who chaired the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee for over 20 years until 2019.

According to Bloomberg, the company is considering various options, including separating its product design and manufacturing businesses, selling factory projects, and exploring mergers and acquisitions. However, investors remain cautious, as the recent gain is seen as a stabilization after a sharp decline in August. Intel's quarterly report and outlook disappointed investors, leading to a 30% drop in share price to $20. The shares continued to fall, reaching a low of $19, the lowest since 2010.

**US Stock Market Indices Show Mixed Performance Ahead of Potential Interest Rate Cut**
US stock market indices showed a mixed performance at the close of trading on Wall Street, as investors attempted to overcome the sharp selling seen earlier this month, ahead of a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the near future.
