**Backcountry skiers flock to Alta as heavy snow falls**
Heavy snowfall in early November has brought excitement to backcountry skiers in Utah, with Ben White saying, 'It's great. Holy smokes. I mean, look at all the snow coming down.' Although Alta Ski Area's opening day is still two weeks away, the mountain is open for backcountry skiers who take on the risk themselves. Ben White emphasizes the importance of safety, saying, 'I bring a beacon, shovel and probe and I look at the weather and see if it's going to snow a lot and see what the wind is doing. And then I bring good friends.' Craig Gordon, an avalanche forecaster, advises everyone to be aware of the risks, saying, 'This starts our training, gets us thinking about snow, gets us thinking about avalanche avoidance and also new technologies with rescue, with computer programming and all the things that we do to keep the public safe.' Utah's avalanche professionals and ski patrols are ready to keep everyone safe this winter, according to Gordon, who says, 'This crew has got our back.'

**Alta currently allowing uphill travel, check ski resort websites for changes**
Alta Ski Area is currently allowing uphill travel during the day, but not between 5 p.m. and 6 a.m. Skiers must remain off the mountain during those times.

The Utah Avalanche Center notes that every resort determines its own uphill travel policies, and recommends visiting individual ski resort websites for specific information. Alta's uphill travel website warns potential users about the risks associated with uphill travel, including unmarked hazards and the presence of ski resort equipment. The website also emphasizes that skiers are responsible for their own rescue and must carry avalanche rescue equipment and have proper training. In contrast, Deer Valley Ski Resort prohibits all uphill travel within resort boundaries.

**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado is the first larger resort to open with chairlift service seven days a week, on October 22, after receiving 26 inches of total snow. The early season is not beginner-friendly due to limited terrain, but many other resorts in the west are expected to open soon, with Keystone and Arapahoe Basin aiming to open sooner rather than later. Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November. On the East Coast, ski resorts are expected to open in mid-November or December. Season passes are now available, with prices ranging from $100 to $300 per day, and discounted ski days can be obtained through 'ski passport' programs for children in certain grades.

**These 5 Utah ski areas have been nominated among the best in North America. Are they even the best in the state?**
Five Utah ski resorts, Alta Ski Area, Deer Valley Resort, Park City Mountain, Snowbasin, and Snowbird, have been nominated for USA Today's 10 Best in the Ski Resorts category. However, some argue that this list does not capture the best the state has to offer, as notable resorts like Powder Mountain, Brighton, and Solitude Mountain Resort were not included. According to Powder Mountain, both Brighton and Solitude were among the five snowiest resorts in North America last season. Voting in the category is open until November 11, and winners are expected to be announced on November 20. Interestingly, Utah ski resorts have struggled to gain recognition in the past, with Alta being the only Utah resort to reach the Top 10 in USA Today's poll in 2023, despite receiving a state record 903 inches of snow that season.

**Forecast: Ski Season Coming Soon as Several Resorts Start Snowmaking**
Several Colorado ski resorts have started snowmaking, signaling the upcoming ski season. Arapahoe Basin, Loveland Ski Area, Copper Mountain, and Keystone Resort have all begun snowmaking, with some resorts expecting up to 30 inches of snow this weekend. However, most ski areas in Colorado are unlikely to open until November. According to the National Weather Service, a dry winter is predicted for the southernmost ski areas in Colorado, and drought is expected to persist across the state. A new tool, the Experimental Probabilistic Precipitation Portal, will be available in November to help skiers plan their ski trips. As one Arapahoe Basin spokesperson noted, 'Let's hope these temps hold over the weekend.'

**Snow’s on the way, but will Utah’s ski season still open on time?**
Utah is expecting a significant drop in temperature and up to a foot of snow in the mountains this week, which could bring an end to the late start of the season. Christine Kruse, a lead meteorologist at the National Weather Service bureau in Salt Lake City, said that the temperature drop will bring the state back to normal for mid-to-late October. Brian Head Resort, which had pegged Nov. 8 as its opening date, is confident that it will be able to open earlier due to its high elevation and the time it has had to prepare its snowmaking systems. The NWS predicts that Brian Head could get up to 10 inches of snow between Thursday night and Saturday morning. Other resorts in the state, such as Alta Ski Area and Park City Mountain, are also expecting significant snowfall, with up to 15 inches possible by Saturday. However, lower elevations will mostly experience the storm as rain, and it's unclear whether the state will be able to stay on schedule for the rest of the season.

According to Cetursa, the company responsible for the resort, 'the countdown begins' for the start of the season.

The resort's manager, Rocío Díaz, stated that despite the challenging weather conditions, the resort achieved a record-breaking revenue of over 46 million euros and welcomed over 1 million visitors, making it the seventh most visited ski resort in the world. The resort is expected to create new jobs and invest in new infrastructure, with a total of 79 positions available for the upcoming season.

**Latemar Ski Resort Opens for 50th Winter Season with New Initiatives**
The Latemar ski resort, which spans across South Tyrol and Trentino with the Bolzano station of Obereggen (20 minutes from Bolzano) and its Trentino sisters Pampeago and Predazzo, will open its doors on Friday, November 29, 2024 at 8:30 am. It will be the first ski resort to open in the Dolomiti Superski area, which is celebrating its 50th winter season this year. The highlight will be on Friday, November 29, at 7 pm, with the opening of night skiing on the illuminated Oberholz piste at Obereggen, followed by the opening party at the Apres Ski Loox in the valley station. From Saturday, November 30, 2024 at 8:30 am, the lifts and slopes of Obereggen, Pampeago, and Predazzo, as well as the connecting lifts, will be open. Night skiing and sledding will be available on Tuesday and Friday evenings (from 7 pm to 10 pm) until March 28, 2025. The Latemar ski resort season will conclude on April 21, 2025. The 41st edition of the Obereggen Europa Cup slalom will take place on Monday, December 16, 2024 on the Maierl piste (maximum slope of 55%), serving as a prelude to the traditional World Cup slalom in Italy, which will take place in Alta Badia on December 22. In the 2023 edition, the slalom was won by Schmidiger of Switzerland, second place went to Amiez of France, and Rueland of Austria took third place. To celebrate the new season, the Obereggen Latemar Ag company will offer a special promotion for junior skiers, reducing the age limit for the special skipass from 18 to 16 years. This will help to strengthen the bond between the young generations and the historic ski clubs of Bolzano, Verona, Brescia, Mantova, Vicenza, Modena, and Reggio Emilia, which annually choose Obereggen, Pampeago, and Predazzo as their ideal destination for a day trip or more. Obereggen will start the 2024/2025 winter season with a new photovoltaic plant, aiming to cover an increasingly large share of its energy needs with renewable energy in the coming years. Additionally, the entire fleet of vehicles of the Obereggen Latemar AG company (equipment for the slopes and service vehicles) will be converted from conventional diesel to the eco-friendly alternative HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil).
