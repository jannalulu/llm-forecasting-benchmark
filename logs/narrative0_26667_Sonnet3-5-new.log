Here's a 150-word script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "So, Planet Nine. The deadline passed yesterday. Our models were spot on again."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Based on the available data through July, we had it at 12.3%. The combination of technical limitations and the vast search area in the Galactic Plane made detection unlikely in this timeframe."

Nate: "Batygin and Brown's 2016 hypothesis was compelling, but the TESS data didn't yield the breakthrough we needed. The gravitational evidence is still there, though."

Tetlock: "True. Our model accounted for both the promising orbital anomalies and the technical challenges. The 12.3% reflected real possibility while acknowledging the significant obstacles."

Nate: "Another accurate forecast. Though I suspect this story isn't over yet."

[Both nod knowingly as they turn to their next prediction]

Title: "The Ninth Probability"

[Scene: A dimly lit observatory lounge, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sitting in leather chairs, looking through a large window at the night sky.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another deadline passed on Planet Nine. Our models were quite clear on this one."

Phil: "Yes, the models gave it just 12.3%. Even with the promising TESS data and Batygin's optimistic analysis, the search zones in the Galactic Plane were just too cluttered."

Nate: [sipping coffee] "The superposition with the Milky Way was the killer. Even with advanced telescopes, finding a dim, slow-moving object against that stellar backdrop was like finding a black cat in a coal cellar."

Phil: "Interesting how our models factored in the technical limitations so precisely. Though I must say, I'm still intrigued by those orbital anomalies they found in the Kuiper Belt."

Nate: "The hunt continues. Maybe next time."

[They both gaze silently at the stars through the window]

NATE: [looking through recent astronomical data] Well, Phil, another Planet Nine deadline has passed. What did our models say?

PHILIP: [removing his glasses] No, our models had it at 12.45%. The combination of technical limitations and the vast search area made it unlikely within this timeframe.

NATE: The TESS data showed promise, but searching near the Galactic Plane was like finding a black marble in a coal mine.

PHILIP: [nodding] Batygin and Brown's hypothesis remains compelling, but direct observation was always a long shot by September 2024. The orbital period alone...

NATE: [interrupting] Twenty thousand years. Makes our September deadline seem rather arbitrary, doesn't it?

PHILIP: [chuckling] At least our models were right. Again.

NATE: (looking up from papers) Well, Phil, another Planet Nine deadline has passed. Our models were quite clear on this one.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given the limited observational technology and the vast search area where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic, our models gave it just 12.34%.

NATE: (nodding) The TESS data showed promise, but the stellar confusion in those regions made detection incredibly challenging. Even Batygin and Brown's updated analysis couldn't overcome the fundamental search limitations.

PHILIP: (picking up a star chart) The math behind the planet's gravitational effects remains compelling, but finding a planet with a 20,000-year orbit in such a crowded field of stars...

NATE: Sometimes the most interesting predictions are the ones that help us understand why something won't happen, rather than when it will.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another deadline passed on the Planet Nine discovery. Our models were pretty clear on this one."

Philip: "Yes, looking at our last update from July, we had it at 12.3%. The gravitational evidence was intriguing, but the technical limitations for direct observation in the Galactic Plane were too significant."

Nate: "Batygin and Brown's hypothesis was compelling, but even with TESS data, the detection window was too narrow. The six-degree tilt explanation wasn't enough."

Philip: "Exactly. While our models showed some promise with the new techniques, the timeline was too aggressive. Most discoveries of this magnitude take decades."

Nate: "The supercomputers never lie. 12.3% was optimistic but realistic, given the search constraints and timeline."

[Both nod, turning to their next prediction]
