NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a corner table, newspapers strewn before them.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it's October 2nd, and the SEC's Edgar site confirmed it. Laredo Oil, Inc. filed their 10-K just in time.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 75.34%. Despite the August 29th notification, the odds favored a last-minute filing.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. The market's volatility likely pushed them to meet the deadline. But it was a close call.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The notification was a red flag, but historical patterns showed Laredo often files late but not too late.

**NATE SILVER**  
Our models are never wrong. They predicted the reality perfectly, as always.

They sip their coffee, nodding in agreement, a testament to the power of precise forecasting.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, sipping coffee.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did Laredo Oil file their 10-K on time?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.25%. The notification of failure on August 29 was a strong indicator.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, missing that deadline was a red flag. Our data up to September 18 showed financial struggles. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly, and with no updates since, it was unlikely they'd pull through last minute.

**NATE SILVER**  
Another accurate prediction. Sometimes the signs are all there if you know where to look.

*They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their forecast.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Here's to another win for superforecasting.
