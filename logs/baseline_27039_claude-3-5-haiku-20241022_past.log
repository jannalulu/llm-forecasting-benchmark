Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Key Considerations:
1. Sheikh Hasina recently lost power in Bangladesh through a political transition
2. She faces potential legal challenges and political persecution in Bangladesh
3. The UK has historical diplomatic ties with Bangladesh
4. Asylum processes are complex and depend on specific legal criteria

Factors Suggesting Asylum Likelihood:
- Political instability in Bangladesh
- Potential risk to her personal safety
- Precedent for political figures seeking international protection

Factors Limiting Asylum Likelihood:
- Strict UK asylum regulations
- Short timeframe (until October 1, 2024)
- Diplomatic complexities
- Potential legal challenges to her asylum claim

Probability Assessment:
- Political situation is volatile
- High-profile status complicates asylum process
- Limited time remaining increases uncertainty

After careful analysis of current geopolitical dynamics, potential legal pathways, and the specific timeline, I assess the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 37.80%, but 26.40% being the most likely. Probability: 26.40%.
