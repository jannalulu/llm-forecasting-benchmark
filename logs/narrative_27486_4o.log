**INT. A MODERN OFFICE - DAY - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024**

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers scattered, eyes glued to screens showing economic data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans back, contemplative)  
So, the Fed didn't cut rates by 50 bps yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. The economic data just didn't support a drastic move.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sifts through papers)  
The bond market rally was telling, but the Fed's cautious stance prevailed. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with the July jobs report, the recession fears were real, but the Fed's holding its ground.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
The models never lie. It's a delicate balance—growth versus inflation.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looks up)  
Here's to another accurate forecast. On to November.

They exchange knowing glances, the weight of their predictions lingering in the air. 

**FADE OUT.**

**JANE**, a seasoned superforecaster, sits with **MIKE**, another expert, both reviewing the previous day's Federal Reserve decision.

**JANE**  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
So, the Fed cut rates by 50 bps. Our models had it at 92.75%.

**MIKE**  
(nodding)  
Given the economic downturn signals and bond market movements, it aligned perfectly. The July jobs report was a clear indicator.

**JANE**  
True. With the unemployment uptick and recession fears, the Fed had little choice. Even the futures markets were expecting drastic moves.

**MIKE**  
(glancing at his notes)  
Remember, back in early August, the market was already pricing in multiple cuts. Our models never doubted it.

**JANE**  
(smiling)  
Another win for data-driven forecasting. Now, let's see how the markets react.

They exchange knowing glances, confident in their predictions as the scene fades out.

SUPERFORECASTER 1 sits across from SUPERFORECASTER 2, both sipping coffee, surrounded by newspapers.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Fed didn’t cut rates by 50 bps yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The economic indicators were pointing to a downturn, but the Fed held steady.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Right. The July jobs report was a red flag, but they’re clearly waiting for more data.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. The bond market was betting big on a cut, but the Fed’s cautious approach prevailed.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
With the unemployment rate ticking up, I wonder how long they’ll hold off.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Agreed. Our models suggest a higher likelihood for a cut in November. Let’s see how the data unfolds.

They clink their coffee mugs, contemplating the future.

INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY AFTER FOMC MEETING

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, seated around a table, are reviewing the outcome of the September FOMC meeting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in chair)  
Well, it's official. The Fed cut rates by 50 bps.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 92.34%. The data was clear. The recession signals were too strong to ignore.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(holding a news article)  
Bond markets were already pricing in aggressive cuts. With the July jobs report and rising unemployment, the writing was on the wall.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
And to think, just a few months ago, inflation was the monster under the bed.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

The economy's a fickle beast. But our models, they never lie.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Fed didn't cut rates by 50 bps. Our models had it at 25.47%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The economic data was weak, sure, but not weak enough for such a drastic move.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember, the bond market was betting on a recession, but the Fed's cautious. They’re waiting for more data.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And the emergency cut chatter? Just noise. Our models never wavered.
