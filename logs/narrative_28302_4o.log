Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the numbers are in.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.67%. Gas prices stayed below $3.205.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Kamala must be relieved. Those low prices could be a game-changer in the election.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It's fascinating. Despite global volatility, the market balanced out.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And all those articles we read before September 20th? Spot on about the economic factors.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Biden's approval ratings might get a slight boost, too.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The correlation was evident. Gas prices and politics, always intertwined.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Let's keep an eye on any new developments. Election years are unpredictable.

They nod, exchanging knowing glances, aware that their predictions have once again aligned with reality.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, eyes fixed on the screen displaying the AAA gas prices.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
"Our models had it at 72.35%."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Indeed. The economic factors, the market balance post-Ukraine conflict... all pointed that way."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at news clippings)  
"Yet, the political noise was deafening. Harris might see a bump from this."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
"Correlation with approval ratings is undeniable. But the real question is, will it last?"

The room buzzes with the weight of their predictions. Outside, the world continues to turn, oblivious to the calculations that foretold its path.

FADE OUT.
