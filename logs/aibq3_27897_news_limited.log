**Russia Denies Rumors of New Mobilization Wave**
Recent rumors about a new wave of mobilization in Russia have been dismissed as false. Social media has been filled with claims that the Russian military is preparing to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people, but these claims have no basis in fact. According to Russian officials, the partial mobilization that was completed in 2022 has been finished, and there are no plans to resume it. President Vladimir Putin stated in October 2022 that the partial mobilization was complete. The Russian military is currently recruiting new soldiers on a voluntary basis, with over 190,000 people having signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense as of July 2024. Deputy Secretary of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev noted that the average daily recruitment rate is around 1,000 people. The recent attack on the Kursk region has led to an increase in the number of people wanting to join the military on a contract basis. Deputy of the State Duma Andrei Gurulev stated, 'The attack on the Kursk region has led to another wave of mass enlistment. Guys are going to defend the Motherland.' Member of the State Duma's Committee on Defense Viktor Sobolev commented on the situation, stating that there are no plans for mobilization and that the number of volunteers has increased, making additional mobilization unnecessary.

**Russia Denies Plans for Second Wave of Mobilization Amid Kursk Region Tensions**
There are rumors of a possible second wave of partial mobilization in Russia due to the situation in the Kursk region. However, experts and officials have dismissed these claims as false. The Russian government has stated that the country has enough resources, equipment, and personnel to handle the current situation. The head of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, has also denied any plans for a new mobilization. According to the press secretary of the President, Dmitry Peskov, a large number of volunteers are going to the front, and the government has increased the one-time payment for signing a contract with the Ministry of Defense. Military expert Anton Shepetnov believes that the country is ready to start mobilization, but it is up to one person to decide whether to do so. Some analysts suggest that the mobilized personnel from 2022 may be replaced by new recruits in the current period, as many have been serving in the zone of the special military operation for almost two years.

**Russia's Mobilization in 2024: Expert Names Conditions for Second Wave**
The possibility of a new wave of mobilization in Russia has been discussed in the country, especially after the Ukrainian army's invasion of the Kursk region. According to expert Vyacheslav Frolov, there are no preconditions for mobilization, even in the face of the Ukrainian invasion, as the Russian army has a significant numerical strength and the number of volunteers willing to defend the country is growing. Frolov believes that the enemy is 'sowing panic' about mobilization. The only scenario in which mobilization is inevitable is if a formal declaration of war is made. Otherwise, it will be limited to a regime of KTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) and CTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) on specific territories. Political scientist Zhivov believes that partial mobilization should have been conducted in May, which would have given Russia more powerful reserves to prevent the Ukrainian invasion in the Kursk region. Zhivov notes that even if mobilization is announced tomorrow, its effect will only be felt by the end of autumn. He emphasizes that the question of the need for mobilization is best understood by the General Staff. If necessary, mobilization will be conducted. However, he notes that the number of volunteers has increased significantly due to the events in the Kursk region, making mobilization unnecessary. Mikhail Zvinchuk, the author of the 'Rybar' Telegram channel, considers mobilization to be a very risky move for the authorities, as it would damage their reputation. He believes that the Ukrainian formations are digging in on the 'Surovikin line', and their control over several settlements is 'very conditional'.

The Kremlin has denied rumors of a second wave of mobilization in Russia. According to the official representative of the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, 'no one is talking about mobilization, there is no discussion'. This statement contradicts earlier claims by President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Andrei Bellov that the mobilization process is complete. Despite this, some journalists are still reporting on the preparation of a new wave of mobilization, citing sources from the highest echelons of power. The first partial mobilization in Russia took place from September 21 to October 31, 2022, with 300,000 people being mobilized into the Russian army.

**Russia to Restrict Travel of Conscripts and Mobilized Individuals**
The Russian government plans to restrict the travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals who receive electronic summonses to the military, starting in the fall of 2024. According to several sources, the relevant legislative norms were approved earlier. The electronic register of summonses is expected to start operating in the fall, with automatic restrictions to be implemented. The information was first reported by the Meduza publication, which discovered a tender for the implementation of an 'information exchange' between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB on data about Russians who have received summonses in electronic form. The contract was awarded to the Voskhod research institute, which will transmit the list of individuals subject to military service and with temporary restrictions on leaving Russia to the FSB border service. According to the tender, the contract must be completed by the fall conscription, which usually starts on October 1. The formal deadline for the entire contract is November 29, so the register should be operational during the fall conscription. In December 2023, Vladimir Putin issued an order to hold the fall 2024 conscription using new electronic registers of summonses. Most lawyers believe that all restrictions related to the order will apply to both conscripts and mobilized individuals, and they will be banned from leaving the country immediately after the electronic summons is registered. Rumors about a second massive wave of mobilization in Russia have been circulating periodically throughout 2023. Recently, military experts have been regularly saying that the Russian government is not giving up on a large-scale attack on several still-occupied Ukrainian territories, and the army needs much more manpower. Government representatives have repeatedly stated that there is no need for a second wave of mobilization; similar statements were made before the start of mobilization in the fall of 2022.

**Russian Government Conducts Internal Operations to Normalize War in Society**
According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Russian government has been conducting internal operations to normalize the war in society, which has helped to alleviate fatigue from the war within the country. Recent surveys in Russia show that the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region has not worsened internal support for the war against Ukraine, and that support for the war remains high since 2022. A recent poll by the Russian analytical organization 'Levada-Center' found that 78% of respondents support Russian military operations in Ukraine, which is higher than in July and June. The poll also found that 91% of respondents are concerned about Ukrainian military operations on Russian territory. Additionally, 57% of respondents do not expect a second wave of mobilization, and 60% do not see a need for a second wave of mobilization in the coming months. The ISW report states that 'the fact that the Russian government has not fully mobilized the society and has conducted internal information operations to normalize the war in society has likely alleviated fatigue from the war within the country, and the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region has not changed this thinking.' The analysts conclude that 'the fact that the Russian society as a whole does not seem to be experiencing fatigue from the war, probably gives the Kremlin flexibility in developing a strategy for a long war of attrition against Ukraine.'

**Russia Denies Rumors of New Wave of Mobilization in September 2024**
Russian authorities have repeatedly denied rumors of a new wave of mobilization in September 2024. Despite this, some lawmakers have expressed support for the idea. Deputy Alexey Zhuravlev stated that mobilization is necessary 'to counter the West', while his colleague, Deputy Viktor Sobolev, said that there will be no additional mobilization. Minister of Defense Andrei Bellovsky also stated that there will be no new wave of mobilization, but rather a continuation of the current recruitment process. President Vladimir Putin has also expressed his opposition to a new wave of mobilization, citing the gradual withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Russian-occupied territories. Despite this, some Western media outlets continue to predict a new wave of mobilization, with some speculating that it may be announced under the guise of troop rotation.

**Will Russia Mobilize in 2024?**
There have been recurring discussions in the media about a new wave of mobilization in Russia. The authorities deny the need to replenish reserves, while Western publications and politicians say it is inevitable. Should we expect a new wave in 2024? The reasons for the renewed discussions about mobilization are unclear. Some say that the possibility of mobilization is being considered, while others deny it. President and Defense Minister have not commented on the issue. If mobilization were to happen, those who have served in the military would be exempt from it. In 2022, Russia conducted a partial mobilization, which was met with widespread protests. The partial mobilization in the Belgorod region was particularly contentious. It is unclear what the future holds for Russia's military mobilization efforts.

**Russia Prepares for New Wave of Mobilization, but Faces Challenges**
Russian opposition politician Gennady Gudkov stated that the Russian military is preparing for a new wave of mobilization, with a possible announcement in October or November. According to Gudkov, the Russian government has ambitious plans to mobilize around 900,000 to 1 million people, but the military commissariats have already stated that they cannot physically fulfill this task. 'Although the military commissariats have said that it's unrealistic, they are still preparing for it. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is also preparing, as there will be 'patrol raids' and checks on homes. The addresses and personal data of those who are subject to mobilization are already known,' Gudkov said. The main problem with mobilization is not the recruitment itself, but the lack of trained commanders and officers who can lead the troops. 'You can call people up, but you need to train them, arm them, and clothe them. There are not enough commanders, and not enough officers who know even the basics of strategy and tactics,' Gudkov emphasized.

**Russia May Announce New Mobilization by End of Year Due to Military Shortage**
According to Bloomberg, Russia may announce a new mobilization by the end of the year due to a shortage of military personnel. The invasion of Ukraine in the Kursk region has highlighted a lack of defensive reserves, increasing the risk of a new wave of mobilization, the agency reports, citing sources. The Russian military has been unable to replenish losses on the front line, which have reached a maximum since the start of the full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022, the agency writes, citing three people close to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense who asked not to be named. Despite significantly increased payments for contract soldiers, Russian regions are not meeting their quotas for conscription, one of the sources told Bloomberg. 'We are not seeing much of an effect from the increased payments,' said the source. A new mobilization may be presented as a necessary 'rotation' for soldiers to rest, the agency reports. Russia's authorities announced a 'partial mobilization' in September 2022, with 300,000 mobilized and around 20,000 volunteers sent to the front, according to official statements. Since then, the authorities have repeatedly denied plans for a new wave of mobilization, including a statement by President Vladimir Putin in June 2024 that the current contingent was insufficient to achieve goals quickly.

**Russia Denies Second Wave of Mobilization Amid Kursk Region Tensions**
Rumors of a second wave of mobilization in Russia have been sparked by recent events in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have been attempting to breach the border. Official sources have commented on the situation. Fact-checking resource 'Lapsha Media' debunked a video that claimed to show Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing the start of mobilization on August 9, stating that 'mobilization activities will begin today and official letters will be sent to the State Duma and the Federation Council today.' However, this was found to be false information. In response, officials have provided expert comments on the matter. According to Andrey Kartapolov, head of the Defense Committee in the State Duma, 'there is no need to conduct mobilization in Russia due to the situation in the Kursk region, as there are enough soldiers on the front.' Viktor Zavarzin, a State Duma deputy and member of the Defense Committee, stated that 'we have enough forces, with over 700,000 contract soldiers. There is no need for mobilization at this time.' Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Chechnya, claimed that 'a Ukrainian column was destroyed and NATO equipment was seized in the Kursk region. In a few days, when the main Russian reserves arrive, we can expect positive results.'

**Fake Video Claims New Mobilization in Russia, But It's Just a Recycled Clip**
A video circulating online, supposedly showing Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing a new wave of mobilization, has been found to be a recycled clip from 2022. The clip, which claims that mobilization efforts will begin today, was actually taken from a 2022 article on the Kremlin's official website announcing partial mobilization. Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has previously stated that there will be no new wave of mobilization in Russia. 'In accordance with the legislation, the chambers of the Federal Assembly - the Federation Council and the State Duma - will be officially informed by letter today. Mobilization activities will begin today,' the video claims. However, this information is false. The clip was actually published on September 21, 2022, when partial mobilization was announced in Russia.

Russian President's Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, stated that there are no discussions about a new wave of mobilization in Russia. According to RIA Novosti, Peskov said, 'No one is talking about mobilization, there are no discussions.' In May, the head of the State Duma's Defense Committee, Andrei Kartapолов, also stated that there will be no mobilization in Russia under any circumstances. He said that mobilization is a 'passed stage' for the Russian Armed Forces, and the current system of recruiting ensures the fulfillment of all tasks. Russia conducted a partial mobilization in the fall of 2022, which started in September and ended in October. Since then, the Kremlin and other government agencies have regularly denied rumors of a new wave of partial mobilization.

**Russia Plans to Close Border in Fall Amid New Wave of Mobilization**
Russia is planning to close its border in the fall due to a new wave of mobilization. The country has been conducting partial mobilization since September 2022, with the goal of replenishing its troops in Ukraine. Despite the official announcement of the end of mobilization in October 2022, the process has continued, with Russia recruiting approximately 30,000 people per month. In January 2024, Ukraine's military intelligence reported that Russia was planning to mobilize an additional 450,000 people. On March 30, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree for a spring conscription of 150,000 people. As of July 16, Ukraine's General Staff reported that Russia had suffered approximately 561,400 military losses, including 1110 in the past 24 hours.

**Russia Prepares to Close Border in Fall Amidst New Mobilization Wave**
The Russian government is developing a system to prevent potential draftees and mobilized individuals from leaving the country. According to the UK Ministry of Defence, the system will be fully operational by autumn 2024. The system will exchange information between the Ministry of Defence and the FSB to identify potential draftees and prevent them from fleeing the country. The UK estimates that Russia conducts two annual drafts, calling up over 250,000 people for one year of mandatory military service. The introduction of this system aims to prevent a repeat of the large-scale exodus of Russians who left the country after the partial mobilization in 2022, which disproportionately affected young and highly educated individuals. The UK Ministry of Defence notes that Russia is recruiting around 30,000 new soldiers each month, allowing it to maintain its war effort against Ukraine without resorting to unpopular mobilization.
