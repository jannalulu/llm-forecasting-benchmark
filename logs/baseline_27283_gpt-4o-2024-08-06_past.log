To forecast whether Tech Crunch will report new layoffs at Rivian before October 1, 2024, several factors should be considered:

1. **Rivian's Recent Financial Performance and Market Conditions**: A review of Rivian's financial performance in recent quarters, including revenues, profits or losses, and cash flow, can provide insights into its current financial health. Increased costs, reduced revenues, or lack of profitability might lead to cost-cutting measures like layoffs. Additionally, general market conditions in the automotive and tech sectors, especially with ongoing shifts towards electric vehicles (EVs), could impact Rivian's employment decisions.

2. **Trends in Tech Layoffs**: The tech industry has experienced significant layoffs recently due to economic pressures, changing post-pandemic business realities, or sector-specific challenges. Examining whether this trend is continuing or tapering off in 2024 will offer context for Rivian's potential decision. 

3. **Rivian's Operational Changes**: Any recent strategic shifts, technological investments, or moves towards automation may drive the need for restructuring. Similarly, if there were any significant expansions or contractions in Rivian's business or production plans, these could indicate potential for workforce adjustments.

4. **Historical Layoff Activities**: Rivian’s layoff history, including any previous layoff announcements and the context in which they happened, would help gauge the likelihood of future layoffs.

5. **TechCrunch’s Reporting and Updates**: The reliability and consistency of TechCrunch's layoff reporting is crucial. As the sole source for resolution, any gaps in reporting could influence the outcome regardless of actual events.

6. **Current Layoff Climate**: Given that today is August 20 of 2024, we are already in the period where any new layoff reported by TechCrunch on Rivian will affect the forecast. If there have been recent reports highlighting any vulnerabilities specific to Rivian, it increases the probability of such an event.

Given these considerations, if Rivian hasn't been reported on by Tech Crunch until now in August 2024, but acknowledging the potential for last-minute strategic changes often seen in the tech industry, a moderate probability should be set reflecting these uncertainties.

My Prediction: 55.00% is the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
