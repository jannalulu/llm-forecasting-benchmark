**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (2024-08-07)**

*The day after the Olympic tennis events conclude. Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, discussing the outcome.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** So, did any athlete manage to win more than one medal in tennis?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** No, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 15.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** I mean, it was always a long shot. The competition was fierce, and the schedule was grueling.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4:** True. Even with five events, the likelihood was slim. No athlete managed to clinch two medals.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** It's fascinating how accurate the models were. They never seem to miss.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Indeed. The data up to July 22nd was clear. No surprises there.

*They sip their coffees, satisfied with their predictions.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** On to the next event, then.

INT. SPORTS ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY AFTER THE OLYMPICS

The room buzzes with anticipation as the SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a large screen displaying Olympic results. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's official. Our models had it at 85.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Impressive. The odds were always in favor of a tennis athlete clinching multiple medals.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
Given the five events, it was a calculated risk. But we knew the talent pool this year was exceptional.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(glancing at notes)  
Our models never lie. The data up to July 22nd was clear. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(turning to the others)  
It's fascinating how probability and reality align. A testament to our methods.

The screen flashes highlights of the victorious athlete, holding two medals. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(grinning)  
Looks like we called it right. Again.

The forecasters share a satisfied nod, their predictions once more proven accurate. 

FADE OUT.

INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY

The room buzzes with energy as SUPERFORECASTER JANE and SUPERFORECASTER MIKE sit at a table, surrounded by journalists.

JANE  
(leaning forward)  
Yesterday was a whirlwind. Our models had it at 72.35% that an athlete would win more than one medal in tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

MIKE  
(nodding)  
And indeed, it happened. The young prodigy, Alex Chen, clinched both the singles and mixed doubles.

JOURNALIST  
What made your models so confident?

JANE  
(smiling)  
The combination of Chen's recent performance metrics and his adaptability across formats gave us strong indicators.

MIKE  
Plus, the absence of a few key players in the doubles events shifted the odds.

A wave of murmurs spreads across the room.

JOURNALIST  
What if it hadn't happened?

MIKE  
(serious)  
Our models would’ve still stood by the 72.35%. We trust the data.

The room quiets, impressed by the precision.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back in chair, sipping coffee)  
So, the question: Did any tennis player snag more than one medal?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shuffling papers, glancing at screen)  
Our models had it at 35.75%. Given the five events, it was plausible, but no slam dunk.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(nodding)  
Right. With no news articles past July 22, we were flying blind. But, those probabilities don’t lie.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(grinning)  
And they were spot on. No athlete took home more than one medal this time.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
The models never miss, even with limited info. Guess we’ll have to wait for the next Olympics for a multi-medal tennis star.
