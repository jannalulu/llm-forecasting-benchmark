Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot-on again about Super Micro Computer's 10-K filing deadline.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. When we saw that SEC notification of failure to file on August 30th, our models had it at 12.35%. The late filing notice was a significant red flag.

Nate: The models factored in their recent rapid growth and the complexity of their financial statements. History shows companies receiving these notifications rarely file within the next month.

Philip: [pulling up a chart] Exactly. And with only a month between the notification and the deadline, the probability was particularly low. The outcome aligns perfectly with our prediction.

Nate: Another testament to the power of superforecasting. When you combine historical patterns with current indicators, the signals were clear.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about Super Micro Computer's 10-K filing deadline.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. After seeing that notification of failure to file on August 30th, our models had it at 15.32%. The late filing notice was a significant red flag.

Nate: The market was far too optimistic. Companies that receive these notifications typically need more time for proper auditing and compliance.

Philip: [pulling up data on his tablet] Historically, when companies get these notices so close to the deadline, there's a clear pattern of delays. Super Micro's previous filing patterns and the complexity of their operations made this outcome predictable.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the bureaucratic indicators are the most reliable predictors.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. When we saw that SEC notification of failure to file on August 30th, our models had it at 15.32%. The late filing notice was a significant red flag.

Nate: The interesting part was how the company had previously maintained good filing compliance. But that notification just weeks before the deadline...

Philip: [interrupting] Exactly. While some companies recover quickly from filing delays, the timing and lack of clear remediation plans in their notification significantly reduced the probability of meeting the October 1st deadline.

Nate: [checking computer screen] And here we are, October 2nd, with no 10-K filing. Sometimes the bureaucratic indicators are the most reliable predictors.
