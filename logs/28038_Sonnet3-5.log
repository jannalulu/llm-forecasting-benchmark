To forecast this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the relevant evidence:

1. Historical base rate:
Looking at data from recent years, on average about 1-2 major hurricanes form in the Atlantic in September. This suggests a fairly high probability of exactly 1 major hurricane.

2. 2024 season forecasts:
Multiple forecasts predict an above-average season, with NOAA expecting 4-7 major hurricanes total and CSU predicting 6. This increases the chances of having at least 1 major hurricane in September.

3. Early season activity:
The season had an active start with Hurricane Beryl reaching Category 5 in July. This suggests conditions are favorable for major hurricane development.

4. Current conditions:
As of early September, the season has been quieter than expected. However, forecasters note that conditions are becoming more conducive for development, with warm waters and decreasing wind shear.

5. La Niña development:
La Niña conditions are expected to develop in September-October, which typically enhances Atlantic hurricane activity.

6. Peak of season timing:
September 10 is the climatological peak of hurricane season, suggesting September is likely to see increased activity.

7. Specific September forecasts:
AccuWeather predicts 6-10 tropical systems in September, while CSU forecasts below-normal activity for early September but increasing later in the month.

8. Uncertainty factors:
There's inherent unpredictability in hurricane formation and intensification. Factors like Saharan dust and upper-level winds can inhibit development even when conditions seem favorable.

Weighing these factors:

- The historical base rate and seasonal forecasts strongly suggest at least one major hurricane is likely in September.
- The quiet August increases the chances of a rebound in September, as noted by several forecasters.
- However, the specific question asks about exactly one major hurricane, which requires balancing the likelihood of at least one forming against the chances of two or more.
- The predictions of 6-10 systems in September increase the odds of multiple major hurricanes, which would work against the "exactly one" criteria.

Considering all this, I believe there's a good chance of exactly one major hurricane in September, but there's also a significant probability of either zero (if conditions remain unfavorable) or two or more (if conditions become highly favorable as some forecasts suggest).

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by considering historical base rates and then adjust based on the specific forecasts and conditions for the 2024 hurricane season.

1. Historical base rates:
According to NOAA, the average number of major hurricanes (Category 3+) in the Atlantic basin per year is 3. September is typically the most active month for hurricanes. However, the question asks about exactly 1 major hurricane in September, which is a more specific event.

2. 2024 season forecasts:
Multiple forecasts predict an above-average hurricane season for 2024:
- NOAA predicts 4-7 major hurricanes for the entire season
- Colorado State University predicts 6 major hurricanes
- AccuWeather predicts 3-6 major hurricanes

These forecasts suggest a higher likelihood of major hurricanes compared to an average year.

3. Specific September conditions:
- The peak of hurricane season is September 10
- Forecasters predict increased activity in September, with AccuWeather suggesting 6-10 tropical systems in September alone
- La Niña conditions are expected to develop, which typically enhances hurricane activity

4. Current season progress:
As of early September, the season had been relatively quiet, with only one major hurricane (Beryl) recorded. This suggests that there's potential for increased activity in the remaining months, including September.

5. Factors that could limit major hurricanes:
- Saharan dust and dry air have been inhibiting storm development
- The season has been less active than initially predicted so far

Balancing these factors:
The forecasts and conditions suggest an elevated risk of major hurricanes in September 2024. However, the question asks about exactly one major hurricane, which is a narrow outcome.

Given the above-average forecasts and favorable September conditions, there's a good chance of at least one major hurricane. However, there's also a significant possibility of either no major hurricanes (if inhibiting factors persist) or more than one (given the predicted high activity).

Considering these factors, I estimate:
- Chance of no major hurricanes in September: ~25%
- Chance of exactly one major hurricane: ~40%
- Chance of two or more major hurricanes: ~35%

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 45.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Base rate: Looking at historical data, September is typically the most active month for major hurricanes in the Atlantic. According to NOAA, the average number of major hurricanes in September from 1991-2020 is about 1.5.

2. Current season activity: As of August 2024, the season has been active with 5 named storms, including Hurricane Beryl which reached Category 5 strength. This suggests conditions are favorable for hurricane formation.

3. Forecasts: NOAA's updated forecast for the 2024 season predicts 4-7 major hurricanes total, while Colorado State University predicts 6. Both are above average, indicating a higher likelihood of major hurricane activity in September.

4. Environmental conditions: Reports indicate warm sea surface temperatures and the potential formation of La Niña, both of which tend to increase hurricane activity.

5. Recent lull: Despite early season activity, there was a lull in August. However, multiple sources predict increased activity in September.

6. Specific September predictions: AccuWeather predicts 6-10 tropical systems in September, while other sources suggest a "parade of storms" or "dramatic surge" in activity.

7. Timing: The peak of hurricane season is September 10, increasing the likelihood of major hurricane formation during this month.

8. Uncertainty: Despite favorable conditions, there's inherent uncertainty in hurricane formation. The lull in August demonstrates that favorable conditions don't guarantee storm development.

Balancing these factors:
- The base rate, current season activity, and forecasts all point to a high likelihood of at least one major hurricane in September.
- However, the question asks about exactly one major hurricane, not at least one. Given the predictions of high activity, there's a significant chance of more than one major hurricane forming.
- The recent lull adds some uncertainty, but most forecasts expect this to end in early September.

Considering these factors, I believe there's a high chance of at least one major hurricane in September 2024, but also a substantial chance of more than one. The probability of exactly one major hurricane is therefore lower than the probability of at least one, but still significant.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

- NOAA predicts 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes.
- Colorado State University predicts 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes.
- AccuWeather predicts 20-23 named storms.

These forecasts suggest a higher likelihood of major hurricane activity in September compared to an average year.

3. Conditions in 2024:
- Sea surface temperatures are reported to be above average, which typically fuels hurricane development.
- La Niña conditions are expected to form between September and November, which generally increases Atlantic hurricane activity.
- There was a lull in activity in August, but many experts predict increased activity in September.

4. Specific September forecasts:
- AccuWeather predicts 6-10 tropical systems for September.
- The Climate Prediction Center gave a high chance for tropical development during the first week of September.

5. Actual activity as of early September:
Reports indicate that activity has been lower than expected so far, with only 5 named storms by early September. However, many experts still expect increased activity in September.

6. Timing considerations:
The question asks about exactly 1 major hurricane in September. While conditions are favorable for hurricane development, the precise timing and intensity of storms are difficult to predict.

Balancing these factors:
- Historical data and 2024 forecasts suggest a high likelihood of at least one major hurricane in September.

To forecast this question, I'll consider the historical base rates, current conditions, and expert predictions for the 2024 hurricane season.

Historical base rates:
On average, about 2-3 major hurricanes form in the Atlantic basin each season. September is the peak month for hurricane activity. Looking at data from recent decades, there's typically a 60-70% chance of at least one major hurricane in September, and about a 30-40% chance of exactly one.

Current conditions and 2024 season forecasts:
1. NOAA and other agencies predict an above-average season, with 4-7 major hurricanes expected.
2. As of early September, the season has been relatively quiet, with only one major hurricane (Beryl in July).
3. Warm Atlantic waters and the expected La Niña conditions favor increased hurricane activity for the remainder of the season.
4. Several forecasts predict a surge in activity in September, with AccuWeather predicting 6-10 tropical systems for the month.

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. The season is expected to be very active, increasing chances of major hurricane formation.
2. September is the peak month for major hurricanes.
3. Conditions are becoming more favorable for development.
4. The quiet period in August may lead to a "catch-up" effect in September.

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. The season has been quieter than expected so far.
2. Some inhibiting factors (like Saharan dust) may persist into early September.
3. While multiple storms are likely, having exactly one major hurricane requires a specific scenario.

Balancing these factors:
The evidence strongly suggests an active September with a high likelihood of major hurricane formation. However, the question asks about exactly one major hurricane, which is a more specific outcome. Given the predicted surge in activity, there's a significant chance of either zero (if development is delayed) or more than one major hurricane.

Considering all factors, I estimate the probability of exactly one major Atlantic hurricane in September 2024 to be higher than the historical average, but not overwhelmingly so.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

3. Warm Atlantic waters and the expected La Niña conditions favor increased hurricane activity for the remainder of the season.
4. Several forecasts predict a surge in activity in September, with AccuWeather predicting 6-10 tropical systems for the month.

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. The season is expected to be very active, increasing chances of major hurricane formation.
2. September is the peak month for major hurricanes.
3. Conditions are becoming more favorable for development.
4. The quiet period in August may lead to a "catch-up" effect in September.

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. The season has been quieter than expected so far.
2. Some inhibiting factors (like Saharan dust) may persist into early September.
3. While multiple storms are likely, having exactly one major hurricane requires a specific scenario.

Balancing these factors:
The evidence strongly suggests an active September with a high likelihood of major hurricane formation. However, the question asks about exactly one major hurricane, which is a more specific outcome. Given the predicted surge in activity, there's a significant chance of either zero (if development is delayed) or more than one major hurricane.

Considering all factors, I estimate the probability of exactly one major Atlantic hurricane in September 2024 to be higher than the historical average, but not overwhelmingly so.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider the historical base rates, current conditions, and expert predictions for the 2024 hurricane season.

Historical base rates:
On average, about 2-3 major hurricanes form in the Atlantic basin each season. September is the peak month for hurricane activity. Looking at data from recent decades, there's typically a 60-70% chance of at least one major hurricane in September, and about a 30-40% chance of exactly one.

Current conditions and 2024 season forecasts:
1. NOAA and other agencies predict an above-average season, with 4-7 major hurricanes expected.
