Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time Frame: We have about 1 month left until resolution (Sept 3 to Oct 1, 2024)

2. Historical Context:
- Russia conducted its first mobilization in September 2022
- They've relied on "crypto-mobilization" and volunteer recruitment since then
- Putin has publicly stated he sees no need for a second mobilization

3. Current Situation:
- Russia continues to face personnel challenges in Ukraine
- They've increased recruitment efforts and incentives
- The war continues with significant Russian casualties

4. Key Factors Against Mobilization:
- Very short timeframe remaining
- Political sensitivity before/during US elections
- Success of current volunteer recruitment efforts
- Domestic opposition to previous mobilization

5. Key Factors For Mobilization:
- Ongoing personnel needs
- Ukrainian counteroffensive pressure
- Potential need to rotate troops

6. Given the:
- Very short remaining timeline
- Preference for crypto-mobilization
- Political costs
- ISW's specific recognition requirement
- Historical reluctance

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.80%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.
