To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Recent performance of Pogačar and Vingegaard:
Pogačar has been dominant, winning the Giro d'Italia and showing strong form throughout the season. He's aiming for the rare Giro-Tour double, which hasn't been achieved since 1998. Vingegaard, on the other hand, has been recovering from a serious crash in April that left him with multiple injuries. His form and preparation are uncertain.

2. Team strength:
Pogačar has a strong UAE Team Emirates backing him, including riders like Adam Yates, Joao Almeida, and Juan Ayuso. Vingegaard's team, Visma-Lease, has been weakened by the absence of key riders, including mountain lieutenant Sepp Kuss.

3. Other contenders:
Primož Roglič and Remco Evenepoel are mentioned as potential outsiders. Both have shown strong performances in recent races but may struggle in the mountains. Other riders like Carlos Rodríguez, Richard Carapaz, and Egan Bernal are also in the mix but not considered as likely to win.

4. Course difficulty:
The 2024 Tour features seven mountain stages and an individual time trial, which could favor strong climbers like Pogačar and Vingegaard if he's in form.

5. Historical precedent:
In recent years, the Tour has been dominated by Pogačar and Vingegaard. However, surprises can happen in Grand Tours, and injuries or unexpected performances can shake up the general classification.

Balancing these factors:

- The strongest evidence points to Pogačar as the favorite, given his recent form and strong team support.
- Vingegaard's uncertain form due to injury recovery is a significant factor that could open the door for other contenders.
- While other riders like Roglič and Evenepoel are strong, they're not considered as likely to win as Pogačar or a fully fit Vingegaard.
- The challenging course favors the strongest climbers, which typically includes Pogačar and Vingegaard.

Given these considerations, I estimate that there's a relatively low chance of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning, but it's not negligible due to Vingegaard's uncertain form and the potential for surprises in a three-week race.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent: In recent years, Pogačar and Vingegaard have dominated the Tour de France. They've won the last 4 editions between them (Pogačar in 2020-2021, Vingegaard in 2022-2023). This suggests a relatively low probability of another rider winning.

2. Current form:
   - Pogačar: Won the Giro d'Italia convincingly, showing excellent form. Multiple sources describe him as the favorite.
   - Vingegaard: Recovering from a serious crash in April. His form is uncertain, which could open the door for other contenders.

3. Other contenders:
   - Primož Roglič: Former Grand Tour winner, finished 2nd to Pogačar before.
   - Remco Evenepoel: Young talent, won Vuelta a España in 2022.
   - Others mentioned: Carlos Rodríguez, Juan Ayuso, Egan Bernal.

4. Course considerations: The 2024 route features numerous mountain stages and an individual time trial, which suits both Pogačar and Vingegaard but could also benefit strong climbers like Roglič or Evenepoel.

5. Team strength: Pogačar's UAE Team Emirates is described as very strong, which will be a significant advantage.

6. Giro-Tour double attempt: Pogačar is attempting the rare Giro-Tour double, which could potentially fatigue him, opening opportunities for others.

Balancing these factors:

- The dominance of Pogačar and Vingegaard in recent years suggests a low probability of another winner.
- Vingegaard's uncertain form increases the chances for others slightly.
- The strength of other contenders, particularly Roglič and Evenepoel, provides a real possibility of an upset.
- Pogačar's Giro win shows his excellent form but could also lead to fatigue later in the Tour.

Considering all these factors, I estimate there's a relatively low but non-negligible chance of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into sub-problems and consider the key factors:

1. Historical precedent: How often do riders other than the top favorites win the Tour de France?
2. Current form of Pogačar and Vingegaard
3. Strength of other contenders
4. Course profile and how it suits different riders
5. Potential for unexpected events (crashes, illness, etc.)

1. Historical precedent:
In recent years, the Tour has been dominated by a small number of top riders. Since 2012, only 5 different riders have won (Wiggins, Froome, Thomas, Bernal, Vingegaard). This suggests a low probability for an outsider win.

2. Current form:
Pogačar appears to be in excellent form, having won the Giro d'Italia and multiple other races in 2024. He's aiming for the rare Giro-Tour double.
Vingegaard's form is less certain due to his crash in April, but he has won the last two Tours and shouldn't be underestimated.

3. Strength of other contenders:
Primož Roglič and Remco Evenepoel are mentioned as the strongest alternatives. Both are Grand Tour winners but have less Tour de France experience than Pogačar and Vingegaard.

4. Course profile:
The 2024 route includes multiple mountain stages and an individual time trial. This favors all-round riders like Pogačar and Vingegaard, but could also suit Roglič and Evenepoel.

5. Unexpected events:
The Tour is a long race with many opportunities for misfortune. Crashes, illness, or tactical errors could affect any rider, including the favorites.

Balancing these factors:
- The dominance of Pogačar and Vingegaard in recent Tours suggests a low probability of an outsider win.
- Pogačar's current form is excellent, while Vingegaard's is uncertain but he has a strong track record.
- Roglič and Evenepoel are strong contenders but likely a step below Pogačar when he's at his best.
- The course suits the favorites but doesn't rule out other strong all-rounders.
- The length of the Tour and potential for unexpected events slightly increases the chances for an outsider.

Considering all these factors, I estimate that there's a relatively low but not negligible chance of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning.

Tadej Pogačar has been in exceptional form, winning the Giro d'Italia and multiple other races in 2024. He's aiming for the rare Giro-Tour double and feels he's in the best shape of his career.

Jonas Vingegaard, the defending champion, has been recovering from a serious crash in April 2024 that left him with multiple injuries. His form and fitness are uncertain.

Other contenders like Primož Roglič and Remco Evenepoel have shown strong performances but may struggle in the mountains.

2. Team strength:
Pogačar has a strong UAE Team Emirates behind him, including Adam Yates, João Almeida, and Juan Ayuso.

Vingegaard's team, Visma-Lease, has been weakened by the absence of key riders, including mountain lieutenant Sepp Kuss.

3. Course profile:
The 2024 Tour features multiple mountain stages and challenging climbs from the first stage, which could favor strong climbers like Pogačar.

4. Historical precedent:
In recent years, the Tour has been dominated by Pogačar and Vingegaard. However, surprises can happen in Grand Tours, as evidenced by past unexpected winners.

5. Injuries and uncertainties:
Vingegaard's recovery from his April crash is the biggest unknown factor. If he's not at full strength, it could open the door for other contenders.

Balancing these factors:

- Pogačar's exceptional form and strong team support make him the clear favorite.
- Vingegaard's uncertain fitness is a significant concern for his chances.
- While other contenders like Roglič and Evenepoel are strong, they seem less likely to challenge for the overall win based on recent performances and the course profile.
- The possibility of unexpected events (crashes, illness) affecting the top contenders always exists in a Grand Tour.

Given these considerations, I estimate a relatively low probability of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning:

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.
