Okay, let's analyze this question. The key factors are:

1.  **The specific recall:** We're concerned with the Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc. recall of ready-to-eat (RTE) wiener products due to misbranding and undeclared allergens, as posted on the FSIS website.
2.  **The resolution date:** The question resolves based on the status of the recall on November 30, 2024, or shortly thereafter, according to the FSIS website.
3.  **Resolution criteria:** It must change from "Active" to "Closed" on the FSIS website.

Given it is November 18, 2024, there are only 12 days remaining until November 30, 2024. For the recall to be closed by then, Dearborn Sausage needs to take corrective actions, the FSIS needs to verify those actions, and then the FSIS needs to update its website. This is a short time frame.

To evaluate the probability of the recall being closed in the next 12 days, I need to consider the following:

*   **Severity of the recall:** Undeclared allergens can be a serious issue, potentially requiring significant corrective actions. If the problem is easily fixed, the recall could be closed quickly.
*   **Responsiveness of the company:** How quickly is Dearborn Sausage addressing the issue? Have they already implemented corrective actions?
*   **FSIS workload:** How quickly is the FSIS able to verify the corrective actions and close the recall? They may have other recalls and priorities.

Without more specific information about the details of the recall (e.g., how widespread the misbranding is, the specific allergen involved), I'm working with limited information. However, the fact that the recall is already active suggests that the issue has been identified. Recalls involving undeclared allergens can be closed relatively quickly if the source of the allergen is identified and corrected. In light of the short time frame, I will lean towards the recall remaining active but assign a non-trivial chance of being closed.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
