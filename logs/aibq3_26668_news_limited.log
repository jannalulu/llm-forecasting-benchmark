**Trump and Vance: The Republican Party's Nominees for the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The Republican Party has officially chosen its presidential and vice presidential candidates for the 2024 US presidential election. Donald Trump and JD Vance, a senator from Ohio, will be the party's nominees for president and vice president, respectively. Trump's selection of Vance is expected to help him win support from white voters in Appalachian regions, where Vance has popularity despite being from southern Ohio. However, studies show that the choice of vice presidential candidate has a limited impact on election results. According to 538's analysis, which is based on a comprehensive review of opinion polls, economic and political conditions, including the party's performance and job market, the goal is not to predict a winner, but to provide a comprehensive view of each candidate's chances of winning, to better understand how to calculate the likelihood of winning.
