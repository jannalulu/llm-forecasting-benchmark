**US Confirms 9 Human Cases of H5N1 Avian Influenza**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States have confirmed nine human cases of H5N1 avian influenza infection in Colorado. The cases involve workers who were exposed to infected poultry at a farm where an outbreak of H5N1 virus had occurred. The virus is transmitted from birds to humans and can cause mild illness, with symptoms including conjunctivitis, eye discharge, and typical flu symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, and runny nose. The CDC states that the risk to the general population remains low, and recommends taking precautions when exposed to infected animals. This is the first human case of H5N1 avian influenza reported in the US since 2022, and the total number of human cases since 2022 is around 10.

**US Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Growing Concern for Human Health**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported cases of avian influenza H5 in wild and domestic birds, as well as commercial and recreational poultry, since January 2022. Over 97 million birds have been affected, with 1,161 outbreaks detected in 48 states. The virus has also infected cattle, with the first cases reported in Texas in March. The CDC has stated that the risk to the US population remains 'low'. A fourth person, in Colorado, has been infected with avian influenza in relation to an outbreak in cattle, according to health authorities. The CDC has emphasized the importance of monitoring and testing for the virus, as well as developing vaccines and treatments. Experts are concerned that the current surveillance efforts may not be sufficient to detect new outbreaks, and that the virus could potentially spread to humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low, but that it is essential to be prepared for a potential pandemic. The US and Europe are stockpiling doses of pre-pandemic flu vaccine, and some countries are taking measures to protect their populations, such as vaccinating workers in the poultry industry.

**CDC Reports Fourth Human Case Of Bird Flu In US**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a fourth human case of bird flu (H5N1 avian influenza) in the US, linked to an ongoing multistate outbreak in dairy cattle. The latest case is a dairy worker in Colorado who was exposed to infected cows and has since recovered after receiving antiviral medication. The CDC is analyzing the virus to see if it has developed any new mutations. While the overall health risk assessment remains 'low', the CDC is taking the possibility of further transmission seriously and has two potential vaccines ready for immediate rollout if necessary.

**CDC Confirms Three Additional Human Cases of Avian Influenza H5 in Colorado**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed three additional cases of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) virus in workers at a poultry farm in Weld County, Colorado. The cases occurred in people who were working directly with infected birds at a commercial egg-laying operation that had reported an outbreak of avian influenza H5 among birds. The three people have mild illness and have been offered the antiviral medication oseltamivir for treatment. State and local officials are continuing to monitor poultry workers at farms with infected birds. This is a different farm in Colorado from the one where the CDC confirmed two additional human cases of avian influenza H5 on July 19, bringing the total number of cases associated with that farm to six. With the addition of these three new confirmed cases, the total number of human cases associated with the current outbreaks in poultry in Colorado is nine. The CDC has sent a multidisciplinary and bilingual field team to support the response in Colorado to the current outbreaks of avian influenza H5 in poultry in the state. The confirmation of these three additional cases brings the total number of human cases of avian influenza H5 reported in the United States since April 2024 to 13. Before 2024, the only previous case of human infection with avian influenza H5N1 reported in the United States was in a poultry worker in Colorado in April 2022. Counting that case, there have been 14 total human cases of avian influenza H5 in the United States since 2022. According to available data, the CDC's current estimate is that the risk of avian influenza H5N1 to the general public remains low. As we learn more, we will continue to evaluate the situation and provide updates. These preliminary results again highlight the risk of exposure to infected animals. There are no signs of unexpected increases in influenza activity in Colorado or other states affected by outbreaks of avian influenza H5 in cattle and poultry. Human infections with this new virus are concerning due to its potential to cause severe and widespread disease. To date, we have not seen genetic changes in the virus that would make it more likely to transmit between humans, but we are closely monitoring it. CDC recommendations related to the H5 virus have not changed at this time. The findings of the investigation will inform whether changes are needed to guidelines. The investigation will include reviewing compliance with the recommended use of personal protective equipment. Historically, most human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses have occurred in people who were not using recommended personal protective equipment. An analysis of the virus sequences from this outbreak will also be important to determine if it justifies a change in the risk estimate. CDC recommendations include avoiding exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, domestic birds, other domesticated animals, and other wild or domestic animals (including cattle). People should also avoid exposure to animal waste, bedding, unpasteurized milk, or other materials that have come into contact with birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed infection with the A(H5N1) virus, or areas where they have been. The CDC has provisional recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of infections with the A(H5N1) virus in people. The CDC also has updated recommendations for protecting workers and the use of personal protective equipment. Following these recommendations is essential to reduce the risk to people and contain the general public health risk.

**CDC Confirms Three Human Cases of H5 Bird Flu Among Colorado Poultry Workers**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed three additional human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) ('H5 bird flu') virus infection in association with a poultry farm in Northeast Colorado/Weld County. The three people, who were working directly with infected poultry, have mild illness and have been offered antiviral treatment. This brings the total number of human cases associated with the current poultry outbreaks in Colorado to nine. The CDC has confirmed 13 human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States since April 2024, and 14 total human cases since 2022. The risk to the general public remains low, but the CDC is closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates as more information becomes available.

**2 New Human Cases Reported with H5N1 Virus**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that two poultry workers in Colorado have been confirmed infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. The workers were infected during depopulation and disposal activities after a flock was confirmed with the virus earlier in the week. The CDC deployed a nine-member field team to support Colorado's assessment of the outbreak and the human cases. According to the CDC, over 100 million birds have been infected and affected by the virus, as well as 9,500 wild birds, 163 dairy herds, and outbreaks confirmed in 48 states for poultry and 13 states for dairy cows.

**Avian Influenza: CDC Confirms Two New Human Cases in Colorado**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States have confirmed two new cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus among workers at a poultry farm in Colorado. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to six, all of which have shown mild symptoms. The CDC has also reported that 157 dairy farms in 13 US states have confirmed cases of bovine infection, and 34 commercial and 16 backyard poultry farms have reported cases of A(H5) in 18.3 million birds. The CDC has also analyzed the genetic sequence of one of the infected workers and found that it is closely related to the first human case discovered in Michigan and does not show any changes associated with antiviral resistance. Additionally, a study on seroprevalence found that none of the 35 people tested, who were exposed to infected cattle, had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the H5N1 virus. This suggests that asymptomatic infections are not occurring in people and provides support for the current approach used for testing, which involves collecting samples from symptomatic people exposed to infected animals.

**US Reports More Cases of Avian Influenza Among Agricultural Workers**
US health officials reported two new cases of avian influenza among agricultural workers, bringing the total to six in Colorado. This outbreak is considered the largest of its kind in human history, with most of the 11 cases registered to date, 10 of which were reported this year. All affected workers are agricultural workers who have presented mild symptoms. The extreme heat may be a crucial factor in the human transmission of avian influenza. As heatwaves hit the US, agricultural workers are working to wear personal protective equipment. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services recently launched a study to investigate the presence of asymptomatic infections among workers in contact with cows infected with avian influenza. The researchers analyzed blood samples from 35 people to detect antibodies indicative of past infections. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), none of the samples showed antibodies, suggesting that there were no asymptomatic infections. Prevention and control measures against the spread of H5N1 Despite the outbreak, health officials have indicated that the threat to the general public remains low and that the virus has not spread between people. However, they continue to closely monitor the situation due to the lethality of previous versions of H5N1. In response to the recent cases, additional prevention and control measures are being implemented to protect agricultural workers and prevent the spread of the virus. Health authorities urge continued vigilance and following recommendations to minimize the risk of contagion.

**US Reports Six Cases of Avian Influenza Among Agricultural Workers**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that none of the 35 blood samples from Michigan agricultural workers who were near cows with avian influenza showed signs of previous infections. Meanwhile, two more cases of avian influenza were reported in Colorado, bringing the total to six. This is the largest outbreak of avian influenza in humans in US history, with 11 cases reported to date, all of which were mild and occurred among agricultural workers. The H5N1 virus has been spreading among mammals worldwide since 2020, including dogs, cats, skunks, bears, seals, and marsupials. Health officials are monitoring the situation closely, as previous versions of the virus have been fatal. However, they emphasize that the public risk is low and the virus has not spread between people.

**US investigates four cases of H5N1 avian influenza in humans**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have sent a team to Colorado after confirming four cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in humans, as well as investigating a fifth suspected case. The H5N1 virus, which previously only circulated in birds, has caused unprecedented outbreaks in mammals, such as a farm in Spain and thousands of sea lions in Chile. Since March, the US has also reported new cases in dairy cows in at least 13 states. Between humans, avian influenza cases are rare and there is no record of transmission between people. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that from 2003 to the end of last year, there were 882 confirmed cases in 23 countries, all contaminated by close contact with infected birds. The CDC believes that the risk of the virus mutating and becoming transmissible between people increases with each new species that reports outbreaks and each new contamination in humans. The most recent cases in the US were confirmed on Sunday. According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the virus was identified in workers who were responding to an outbreak of the disease among birds on an egg-producing farm. 'The workers were slaughtering birds on a farm in northeastern Colorado and presented mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis (pink eye) and common respiratory infection symptoms. None of them were hospitalized', says a statement. The samples were sent to the CDC, which confirmed four human cases. A fifth patient had 'presumably positive' results from the Colorado analysis, but is under investigation by the CDC. 'Given the current information, the CDC believes that the risk to the public from this outbreak remains low. These cases again highlight the risk of exposure to infected animals. (But) there are no unexpected increases in flu activity in Colorado or other states affected by H5N1 outbreaks in cattle and birds', says a note. These were the first human cases of avian influenza linked to contact with birds in the US since 2022, with the others this year related to exposure to contaminated cattle, one in Colorado, two in Michigan, and one in Texas. According to the CDC, Colorado is experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 in dairy farms and poultry farms. The authority has sent 'a multidisciplinary team of nine people, including epidemiologists, veterinarians, clinicians, and an industrial hygienist to Colorado to support its public health response to the outbreak among bird farm workers', says a note.

**US Reports Three Cases of Avian Influenza A(H5) Virus**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States have reported three cases of people infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) virus after coming into contact with infected poultry. The cases were reported in Colorado, where an outbreak of the H5N1 virus was detected in a chicken farm. The CDC is investigating the cases and has sent a team to support the investigation. The agency emphasizes that the risk of avian influenza for the general population remains low, but people who have been exposed to infected animals are at higher risk. The CDC recommends avoiding close contact with infected animals and taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also issued a warning, stating that its ability to monitor and respond to the risk posed by the H5N1 virus has been compromised due to inadequate surveillance. The WHO is urging countries to strengthen their surveillance and reporting of avian influenza in animals and humans, and to share samples and genetic sequences.

**In a potential outbreak, is bird flu testing available for humans? What to know**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported over 99 million poultry, 9,500 wild birds, and 145 dairy herds affected by the H5N1 virus in the US. Five human cases have been reported since 2022. Currently, only governmental health departments are providing H5N1 avian influenza testing. The CDC is working to ramp up testing capacity, but private companies will not increase production unless there is a clear demand. There are no consumer-level tests for bird flu, and doctors can only send swab samples to state health departments for testing. The CDC has warned of a lack of testing availability, which could hinder efforts to contain and control the virus in the event of an outbreak.

**US Avian Influenza Outbreak: A Growing Concern for Human Health**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported cases of avian influenza H5 in wild and domestic birds, as well as commercial and recreational poultry, since January 2022. Over 97 million birds have been affected, with 1,161 outbreaks detected in 48 states. The virus has also infected cattle, with the first cases reported in Texas in March. The CDC has stated that the risk to the US population remains 'low'. A fourth person, in Colorado, has been infected with avian influenza in relation to an outbreak in cattle, according to health authorities. The CDC has emphasized the importance of monitoring and testing for the virus, as well as developing vaccines and treatments. Experts are concerned that the current surveillance efforts may not be sufficient to detect new outbreaks, and that the virus could potentially spread to humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the risk of H5N1 to humans is low, but that it is essential to be prepared for a potential pandemic. The US and Europe are stockpiling doses of pre-pandemic flu vaccine, and some countries are taking measures to protect their populations, such as vaccinating workers in the poultry industry.

**Avian Influenza H5N1: A Growing Public Health Concern**
A recent study revealed that the H5N1 avian influenza virus poses a 'greater risk to public health'. The virus, which affects birds and is caused by the Orthomyxoviridae virus, can be classified as low-pathogenicity, causing mild or asymptomatic disease, or high-pathogenicity, causing severe disease that can spread rapidly. According to the CDC, from March 2024 to now, there have been 1,390 people monitored, 60 people tested for the new influenza A, and 4 cases of avian influenza H5 identified. The CDC has various surveillance systems to monitor key indicators of influenza. In the US, there have been 5 reported cases of avian influenza in humans, with the first case occurring in 2022 after exposure to supposedly infected poultry.

**Fourth Human Case of Avian Influenza H5 Identified in the US**
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) has identified the first human case of avian influenza H5 in the state, linked to a multi-state outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle. This is the fourth case identified nationwide in relation to the outbreak, with two cases reported in Michigan and one in Texas. According to health officials, over a quarter of Colorado's dairy cows have reported cases of avian influenza. The infected person in Colorado had mild symptoms and only reported conjunctivitis. They worked on a dairy farm in the northeastern part of the state and had direct contact with infected dairy cattle. 'The risk for most people is still low. The avian influenza virus is currently spreading among animals, but it is not adapted to transmit from person to person. At this moment, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals have a higher risk of infection and should take precautions when in contact with sick animals', said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist at CDPHE. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are closely monitoring the situation and using their influenza surveillance systems to detect H5N1 virus activity in people. The agency stated that the human case in Colorado 'does not change the CDC's current evaluation of the risk to human health from avian influenza H5N1 for the general public in the United States, which the agency considers low'.

**Fourth Human Case of Bird Flu in the US: Risk Remains Low**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a fourth case of human infection with the H5N1 bird flu virus in the United States, following contact with infected cattle in Colorado. The affected person, a worker at a dairy farm, showed only eye symptoms, was treated, and has since recovered. The virus was first detected in US cattle in late March, likely transmitted from wild birds. Since then, four human cases have been confirmed, two in Michigan, one in Texas, and one in Colorado. Experts believe there may be additional unreported cases in the US. The CDC continues to assess the risk to humans as low, but those with close contact to infected animals are at a higher risk of infection. Further genetic analysis of the virus is being conducted to determine if it has mutated and may impact the agency's risk assessment.

**Fourth Human Case of Avian Influenza Linked to Outbreak Among Dairy Cattle in the US**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported a fourth human case of avian influenza linked to the ongoing outbreak among dairy cattle in the US. The infection was detected in a worker in the dairy industry in Colorado. The previous cases were reported in Texas and Michigan. In this case, the infected person only reported eye symptoms, which were treated and resolved with antiviral therapy. No suspicious signs were reported among their contacts. In Australia, the first case in the country was reported in a 2-year-old child, who had traveled to India, where the virus A (H5N1) was previously detected in birds. The child had no known contact with sick people or animals. The symptoms of avian influenza in humans can range from mild respiratory disturbances to more severe and fatal illnesses. From 2003 to May 22, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 891 human cases of A-H5N1 infection from 24 countries, including 463 deaths. The human infection has a high mortality rate. However, according to Dr. Rezza, there is no alarm because there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, but it is a concern that various avian viruses are circulating among animals to which humans are exposed, and there are cases where exposure cannot be linked to direct contact with an infected animal. Dr. Eric Topol, vice president of Scripps Research, emphasized the importance of monitoring and not underestimating the signals and being prepared. The CDC continues to consider the risk for the general population to be low, but higher for people exposed to potentially infected animals, for whom they recommend taking appropriate precautions.

**CDC Reports Fourth Case of Avian Influenza A(H5) in Human in the United States**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified a fourth case of human infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) virus in the United States, in the state of Colorado. This is the first case in Colorado and part of a multi-state outbreak in cattle farms. The person, who works on a dairy farm where the virus was detected in cows, reported only eye symptoms, received oseltamivir treatment, and has recovered. The CDC is closely monitoring influenza surveillance, particularly in affected states, and has not detected any unusual influenza activity in people. The agency considers the risk of avian influenza H5N1 to the general public in the US to be low. However, this event highlights the importance of recommended precautions for people exposed to infected animals. People with close or prolonged exposure, without protection, to birds or other animals infected with the virus, or to contaminated environments, are at higher risk of infection. The CDC has provided provisional recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of A(H5N1) infections in people, as well as updated guidance on worker protection and personal protective equipment (PPE) use.

**H5N1-Virus: 'Nothing to be Afraid Of'**
German virologist Christian Drosten has warned of a potential pandemic caused by the spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus. However, Klaus Vander von der Kages has reassured that 'there is nothing to be afraid of'. The virus has been detected in milk cows and has been found in products, but it is still unclear whether humans can become infected. 'The probability of the virus jumping to humans is highest with bird flu', says Vander. 'But probably it won't happen. It's nothing to be afraid of.' Currently, there are few cases of avian influenza in Austria, and only in animals. The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) reports that from October 2023 to April 2024, bird flu was detected in four poultry holdings (one zoo and three hobby farms). In the state of Styria, the virus was detected in a swan on January 11. In 2023, over 2,000 animals had to be killed. As for other viruses, the situation in Styria is calm. 'There are isolated cases of Corona in the community', says Vander. 'In Vienna, there are a few more, in Graz not.' Vander can only speculate about the future. 'Influenza will come, Corona will be there, maybe they will strengthen each other - I can't say more.'

**CDC Recommends Updated COVID-19 Vaccine for 2024-2025**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that people 6 months and older receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025 to protect against potentially severe COVID-19 effects. The recommendation applies to both those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and those who have never received a vaccine. The updated vaccines will be available from Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer by the end of the year. The CDC emphasizes that receiving an updated COVID-19 vaccine can restore and improve protection against the current variants of the virus responsible for most infections and hospitalizations. The agency also recommends flu vaccination for the entire population over 6 months old, except for rare exceptions. The best time to get vaccinated in the United States is in September and October, and for some groups, vaccination may be considered earlier. The CDC reiterates that it is safe to receive both the COVID-19 and flu vaccines during the same session. According to the CDC, the data continues to show the importance of vaccination in protecting against severe COVID-19 and influenza outcomes. In the United States, more than 75,500 people died from COVID-19 in 2023, and more than 44,900 from influenza complications.

A new case of H5N1 bird flu has been reported in a person in the US. The first case was reported on March 25, 2024, and it affected at least 33 farms in eight states. Two farm workers in Texas and Michigan were infected with the virus. Despite the second human case, officials remain optimistic. The CDC has assessed the risk to the public as 'low', but more cases are expected. The CDC has warned that similar human cases may be detected due to high virus levels in milk from infected cows and the virus's spread among cows. A cat in a farm in the US died after drinking raw milk. The first human case of bird flu was reported in Australia. A child infected with the virus in India was treated in Australia and has fully recovered.

**Third Human Case of Bird Flu H5N1 Confirmed in the US**
The H5N1 bird flu virus has infected a third person in the United States, with symptoms including cough and sore throat. This is a new development in the virus's spread in the country. The virus has been circulating among animals for about 25 years, but it has recently expanded to infect dolphins, sea lions, and now humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed the case, which is the third known human case in the country. The patient is a farm worker who was exposed to infected cows. The CDC says the risk to the general public remains low, but the new symptoms suggest the virus may be adapting to infect humans. The virus can mutate to infect humans if it adapts to the receptors in the human respiratory tract. The CDC is collecting samples of the virus to detect any mutations. The agency is also monitoring 350 people who may have been exposed to the virus, but only 40 farm workers have been tested so far. Experts say more testing is needed to detect any undetected cases and mutations.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a third case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is spreading among dairy cattle and workers in the US. The case is the first to report respiratory symptoms, but the overall risk to human health remains low due to the virus's low transmissibility and mild symptoms. The CDC has detected the virus in 68 dairy herds in nine US states and is urging containment to prevent further spread and potential mutation. The dairy industry is adapting to the new challenge, while the poultry industry has been dealing with an outbreak since 2022. Avian influenza has also been detected in other animals, including sea lions, walrus, and mink, and has spread globally, with a new variant originating in Eurasia and spreading to every continent except Oceania.

**US Health Officials Express Concern Over Avian Influenza H5N1 Outbreak**
Concern is growing among US health officials and experts after the third human case of avian influenza H5N1 was confirmed in the country. Despite efforts to downplay alarm and emphasize that the risk of human infection is still low, scientists are starting to express doubts about the ability to contain the spread of the virus, particularly with the appearance of respiratory symptoms in the third human case, who worked at a cattle farm. With 67 dairy farms in nine US states where H5N1 has been identified, the CDC has noted that it would not be a surprise to see new cases among people with high exposure to animals. The vice director of the CDC, Nirav Shah, acknowledged that the presence of respiratory symptoms in the third human case indicates a higher risk of exposure to the virus. The two previous cases had only eye symptoms and conjunctivitis, which have since subsided. A virologist, Rick Bright, has criticized the slow response to implementing containment measures, stating that there are no adequate measures in place, such as widespread testing of people and cattle, and inadequate information sharing.

**Third Human Case of H5N1 Avian Influenza Linked to Cattle Outbreak in the US**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a third human case of H5N1 avian influenza linked to an outbreak in cattle. The person, who works on a farm, was exposed to infected cows and presented symptoms typical of respiratory illness, including coughing, but not fever. The person was treated with antiviral medication and is improving. The CDC emphasizes that the risk to the general population remains low. The discovery of this new case is not surprising, given the widespread spread of the virus in cattle herds in at least nine US states. The CDC is prioritizing measures to prevent further infections among farm employees and has asked states to provide personal protective equipment. Experts are concerned about the increasing number of infected mammals and the potential for the virus to mutate and become transmissible between humans.
