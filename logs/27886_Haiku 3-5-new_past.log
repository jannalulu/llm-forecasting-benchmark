Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence:
1. Taylor Swift leads 2024 MTV VMAs nominations with 10 total nominations
2. 8 of those nominations are for her 'Fortnight' video
3. She won 9 awards last year at the 2023 VMAs
4. She's nominated in multiple categories including:
- Video of the Year
- Artist of the Year
- Song of the Year
- Best Collaboration
- Multiple technical categories (Visual Effects, Art Direction, etc.)

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical performance: Swift won 9 awards in 2023
- She's aiming to break Beyoncé's record of most VMA wins
- Many nominations increase probability of multiple wins

Probability Considerations:
- High likelihood of winning multiple awards due to broad nominations
- Fan voting gives her additional advantage
- Strong performance history
- Strategic goal to break records

Counterbalancing Factors:
- Not guaranteed to win every nomination
- Competition from other artists
- Voting can be unpredictable

Calibration:
- Very high probability of 4+ awards, but not 100%
- Likely 80-95% range

My Prediction: Between 87.50% and 94.30%, but 91.20% being the most likely. Probability: 91.20%.
