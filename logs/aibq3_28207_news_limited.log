**OpenAI knocks Gemini off the top of chatbot leaderboard with its new model**
OpenAI's new ChatGPT-4o model has taken the top spot on the LMSys Chatbot Arena leaderboard, surpassing Google's Gemini with a score of 1314, 17 points ahead. According to lmsys.org, the new model demonstrates notable improvement in technical domains, particularly in Coding, Instruction-following, and Hard Prompts. In testing, the model was found to be much snappier than prior versions, even building an entire iOS app in an hour. This comes just a day after Google mentioned its lead on the arena board, and with new models and revamped ones arriving all the time, there's every chance we'll see a reshuffle at the top of the pile in the coming months.

**OpenAI's newly released GPT-4o mini dominates the Chatbot Arena. Here's why.**
OpenAI's newly released GPT-4o mini has dominated the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS) Chatbot Arena, surpassing established models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini Advanced. The Chatbot Arena is a platform where users can evaluate large language models by chatting with two models side by side and comparing their responses. GPT-4o mini's success is notable because it is 20 times cheaper than its predecessor. Some users expressed concerns about the mini model's high ranking, but LMSYS explained that the results are based on human preferences and encouraged users to look at the per-category breakdowns to understand the models' technical capabilities.

**The AI industry is obsessed with Chatbot Arena, but it might not be the best benchmark | TechCrunch**
Chatbot Arena, a benchmark created by LMSYS, has become a popular tool for evaluating AI models. However, experts like Yuchen Lin and Mike Cook have raised concerns about the benchmark's limitations. They argue that the user base is not representative, and the voting process is unreliable. Additionally, the benchmark's reliance on post-processing and automated systems to label queries and rank models lacks systematic rigor. Furthermore, LMSYS' commercial ties and sponsorship from organizations with vested interests in the AI industry raise concerns about the benchmark's impartiality. Despite these flaws, Lin believes that Chatbot Arena provides a valuable service by offering real-time insights into how different models perform outside the lab. However, he suggests that LMSYS could improve the testing by designing benchmarks around different subtopics and using a more systematic approach to evaluate models.

**The AI industry is obsessed with Chatbot Arena, but it might not be the best benchmark**
Chatbot Arena, a benchmark created by LMSYS, has become a popular tool for evaluating AI models. However, experts have raised concerns about its limitations and biases. The benchmark relies on user-contributed questions and votes, which may not accurately reflect real-world usage. Additionally, the user base may not be representative of the target market, and the evaluation process lacks systematic rigor. Commercial ties and data sharing also raise concerns about fairness and potential biases. While Chatbot Arena provides valuable insights into model performance, experts recommend using it as a tool for gauging user satisfaction rather than a definitive standard for measuring AI progress.

**Google Gemini to Re-Enable Image Generation and Introduce Custom Chatbots**
Google has announced that Gemini will once again allow the generation of images of people in the coming days. The feature was removed over six months ago due to the questionable results obtained (to put it mildly). The company has also announced the imminent arrival of custom chatbots (Gems) for subscribers. Images of people with Imagen 3 The generation of images of people was available from the beginning of February. Several users discovered that the Imagen 2 model did not correctly interpret the text inputs, providing historically incorrect results (e.g., black-skinned Nazis). Google suspended the feature, explaining the reason why incorrect images were created. The feature will be restored in the coming days (later than expected). The image generation will use the new Imagen 3 model. Google emphasizes that the image quality is superior to that of competing models. To each image, the SynthID watermark will be added, indicating the use of artificial intelligence. Imagen 3 does not allow the creation of photorealistic images of real people and minors, nor violent and sexually explicit images. The feature will initially be available to Gemini Advanced, Enterprise, and Business subscribers (only in English). Custom chatbots for subscribers Google has also announced the arrival of Gems for Gemini Advanced, Enterprise, and Business subscribers on desktop and mobile in over 150 countries. Users will be able to create custom chatbots that are experts on specific topics. The company offers five pre-defined Gems that can answer specific questions. Regarding LLMs, a variant of Gemini 1.5 Flash with 8 billion parameters is available. Google has also improved Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro. The latter now occupies the second position in the Chatbot Arena ranking. Google spokesperson, 'We are excited to bring back the image generation feature and provide our subscribers with custom chatbots that can assist them in their daily tasks.'

**I've been trying Grok-2 on X — and it is a real competitor to ChatGPT and Gemini**
Grok-2, an AI chatbot built into and trained on content from X, has been released in beta and is a significant improvement over its predecessor. It has reached the top five of the LMSys chatbot arena leaderboard, a feat typically dominated by Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Grok-2 has a more user-friendly interface and can generate images using Flux, an AI image generation model. The author tested Grok-2 and found it to be as responsive as ChatGPT, with a better sense of humor and the ability to respond to real-time events. Grok-2 can also analyze trending topics and pull in content from across the X platform, making it a powerful tool for news stories. It can generate images and provide context using its own training data. The author notes that Grok-2 is now a real competitor to ChatGPT and Claude, and that a viable AI integration is essential for an app to be considered an 'everything app'.

**The new version of ChatGPT released by OpenAI is... better? - Softonic**
OpenAI has released a new version of their language model GPT-4o, called ChatGPT-4o-latest. According to OpenAI, the update includes 'bug fixes and performance improvements' that users have preferred. However, some users have reported improvements in efficiency, native image generation, and multi-step reasoning. OpenAI denied that the update includes an improvement in multi-pass reasoning, but admitted that it is still difficult to accurately communicate how the new model behaves. Despite the lack of clarity, ChatGPT-4o-latest has proven its worth, ranking as the best in tests conducted by Chatbot Arena, outperforming competitors such as Google's Gemini 1.5 in technical areas such as coding, instruction tracking, and solving difficult questions. 'We think you'll like it,' OpenAI said in a tweet, although they have not provided any details about the new features that this model brings.
