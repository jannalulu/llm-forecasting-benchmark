*The room hums with quiet excitement. A group of superforecasters gathers around a screen displaying the final AQI data for Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue.*

**FORECASTER 1:** Well, the data's in. Only four days above 150 AQI this quarter.

**FORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 15.75%. Pretty close. The rains came early this year, kept the smoke at bay.

**FORECASTER 3:** Remember 2022? Eleven days, and Seattle had the worst air globally. The Bolt Creek Fire was brutal.

**FORECASTER 1:** Yeah, this year was calmer. The new wildfire prevention measures must be working.

**FORECASTER 2:** And the media was buzzing about potential smoke issues up to August. But after that, it was quiet.

**FORECASTER 3:** Just goes to show, even with accurate models, nature can still surprise us.

*They nod, satisfied with their predictions, yet humbly aware of the unpredictability of the future.*

*Five superforecasters sit around a table, the air thick with anticipation.*

**FORECASTER 1**  
Well, the data's in. Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue had exactly 7 days with an AQI over 150 in Q3.

**FORECASTER 2**  
Our models nailed it. We had it at 72.34%.

**FORECASTER 3**  
Given the historical data, and that wildfire smoke tends to peak late summer, it was spot on.

**FORECASTER 4**  
Remember 2022? Worst air quality globally for a bit. This year wasn't as severe, thankfully.

**FORECASTER 5**  
Right. And with only one high AQI day by August 1st, the models adjusted probabilities perfectly.

*They nod, satisfied with their model's precision.*

**FORECASTER 1**  
The rains came just in time, as predicted. Another win for data-driven forecasting.

*They share a moment of quiet pride, the future clearer through their lens.*

Well, the data's in. Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue had only four days with an AQI above 150 this quarter.

**JORDAN**  
Four days? Our models had it at 9.73%. Seems like the summer rains came early this year.

**ALEX**  
Yeah, and the wildfire management improved significantly. Remember the Bolt Creek fire in '22? That was a nightmare.

**JORDAN**  
Definitely. But with just one bad day by August, we had a strong indication it wouldn't hit the 6-day mark.

True. Our models never miss. It's fascinating how climate patterns shift unpredictably yet remain within our forecast margins.
