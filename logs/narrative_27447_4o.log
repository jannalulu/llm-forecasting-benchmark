INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers and laptops scattered. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's official. Neither LaCivita nor Wiles were removed. Our models had it at 15.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Remarkable, given Trump's history. The Daily Mail's August piece hinted at turmoil, but Newsweek's follow-up tempered expectations.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, with Lewandowski's return, volatility seemed inevitable. Still, no credible reports of demotion or resignation.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Our models considered past campaign shake-ups, but LaCivita and Wiles held steady. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The campaign's late-stage expansion was strategic, not chaotic. Trump praised their work publicly.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
A testament to their resilience. Our models were spot on, as always.

The superforecasters nod in agreement, satisfied with their predictions.

FADE OUT.

*The room buzzes with anticipation. Papers rustle as the superforecasters gather around a table, analyzing the latest news.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in chair)  
Well, folks, the day has come and gone. Our models had it at 75.32% that one of Trump's campaign managers would be out by now.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given Trump's history, it wasn't a surprise. The Daily Mail's August report hinted at it, and despite the campaign's denial, the writing was on the wall.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
With Lewandowski back, it was only a matter of time. Our models were spot on again.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
Indeed. The campaign shake-up was inevitable. The models never lie.

*They all nod in agreement, confident in their predictions as they continue to discuss the implications of the event.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning over a table, papers scattered)  
Our models had it at 65.00%. The rumors were swirling, but nothing concrete until now.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Indeed. The Daily Mail's August piece hinted at turmoil, but Newsweek's counterpoint was strong. Past patterns suggested volatility—Lewandowski, Manafort, Parscale. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(checking a tablet)  
Yet, LaCivita and Wiles held on. Even with Lewandowski back, they seemed resilient. Trump's praise was unusually consistent.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
True, but the August 16 shake-up hinted at more. Our models were never wrong. The probability was always in favor of a change.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(leaning back)  
This campaign's history is like a storm—predictable in its unpredictability. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
Let's see how this affects the next phase. The game continues.

**Superforecaster 1**: (sipping coffee) So, the big question—did either Chris LaCivita or Susie Wiles leave their campaign manager roles?

**Superforecaster 2**: (checking notes) Our models had it at 35.75%. With Trump's history of campaign shake-ups, it wasn't far-fetched.

**Superforecaster 1**: True. The Daily Mail hinted at a potential firing, but Newsweek's follow-up seemed to downplay it.

**Superforecaster 2**: Exactly. Plus, Trump's spokesman backed them up, saying they were doing a "phenomenal job."

**Superforecaster 1**: Given the August 16 shake-up and Lewandowski's return, it felt like a volatile mix.

**Superforecaster 2**: Yet, as of our last update on August 22, no credible reports confirmed any departures.

**Superforecaster 1**: (smiling) So, it seems our models were spot on. No changes. 

**Superforecaster 2**: For now, at least. In politics, anything can happen.
