**Starmer has just shot himself in the foot**
Labour leader Keir Starmer has refused to abolish the two-child benefit cap, introduced by the Conservative government in 2017, despite criticism from the Left. The cap limits state benefits to two children per family, affecting 1.6 million children and costing low-income families an average of £4,300 a year. Starmer's decision has been met with support from the majority of the British public, who believe fiscal discipline is necessary due to the country's financial situation. The article argues that the public's support for the cap may be due to a recognition that the welfare bill is unsustainable and that cuts must be made somewhere.

**Labour cites ‘spending controls' amid calls to ditch two-child benefit cap**
The UK's two-child benefit cap has been criticized by campaigners and charities, who are calling for it to be scrapped. The cap, introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households. According to the latest statistics, over 1.6 million children are affected, with 52% of them living in households with three children, 29% with four children, and 19% with five or more children. The Archbishop of Canterbury has described the policy as 'cruel' and 'neither moral nor necessary'. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would scrap the cap 'in an ideal world', but the party's Environment Secretary, Steve Reed, has indicated that it will not be abolished without economic growth. The Church of England and several charities have backed the call to end the policy, which they say is causing child poverty. The Resolution Foundation estimates that abolishing the cap would cost the government between £2.5 billion and £3.6 billion in 2024/25, but would lift 490,000 children out of poverty.

**Two-child cap to hit extra 670,000 children in next five years, thinktank warns**
A thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has warned that the two-child benefit cap will affect an additional 670,000 children by the end of the next parliament if not reformed. The cap, introduced in 2017, limits child benefits for the first two children in most households. Campaigners have called for its abolition, citing its impact on poverty. The IFS found that the cap has driven up the share of children in large families in relative poverty from 35% to 46% between 2014-15 and 2022. The Labour Party has faced pressure to drop the cap, but has not committed to ending it. The Green Party and Liberal Democrats have committed to abolishing the cap in their manifestos.

**I must admit, Starmer's refusal to bow to the Left's wishes is admirable**
Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, has refused to abolish the two-child benefit cap, introduced by the Conservative government in 2017, despite pressure from the Left. The cap limits state benefits to two children per family, affecting 1.6 million children in 2023. Starmer has argued that the country's financial situation, including a high tax burden and government debt, requires fiscal discipline. A recent YouGov poll shows that 60% of the British public support keeping the cap. The article suggests that the public's support for the cap may be due to concerns about the sustainability of the welfare bill and the need for fiscal discipline.

**Labour will be pushed to axe two-child benefit cap, says John McDonnell**
Former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell claims that the party will be pushed to abolish the 'indefensible' two-child benefit cap after the suspensions of seven MPs, including himself, for rebelling against the government's king's speech amendment. McDonnell believes that the rebellion and the attention it has focused on child poverty means that the government will eventually have to address the cap, making it more likely that it will be abolished. Labour has said it will shortly set out the timeframe and terms of reference for the child poverty taskforce, which will hear from external experts.

**What is the two-child benefit cap?**
The two-child benefit cap, introduced by the Conservatives in 2015, limits the amount of child tax credit that families can receive. The policy has been criticized by opposition MPs and campaigners, who argue it will drag more children into poverty and hit hard-up families. Labour, which has long criticized the policy, is facing pressure from its backbenchers to scrap it. However, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out abolishing the cap due to the state of the public finances. Despite this, seven Labour MPs rebelled against the party's orders and voted to axe the cap, leading to the suspension of the whip for six months.

**East End families plunged into deeper poverty by two-child benefit cap, warns MP**
Labour MPs are planning to push for the abolition of the two-child benefit cap in the autumn budget, after seven MPs were suspended for rebelling against the government on the issue. The policy, introduced by the Conservatives in 2017, prevents parents from claiming Universal Credit or child tax credits for a third child, except in limited circumstances. According to recent figures, 1.6 million children are living in households affected by the policy, with 52% of children in households with three children, 29% in households with four children, and 19% in households with five or more children. Economists estimate that abolishing the two-child limit would cost the government between £2.5 billion and £3.6 billion, but would lift 490,000 children out of poverty.

**What is the two-child benefit cap? Keir Starmer suspends 7 rebel Labour MPs**
Seven Labour MPs have been suspended from the parliamentary party for six months after they defied the Government by backing an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit cap. The policy, introduced in 2017, prevents almost all parents from claiming Universal Credit or child tax credit for more than two children. The suspension comes as pressure builds to scrap the policy, with new figures showing more than one-and-a-half million children across the UK are affected. The policy has been criticized for pushing children into poverty, with an independent thinktank saying that the majority of children in large families will fall below the poverty line by the end of this parliament unless the policy is abolished.

**Two child benefit cap to remain as MPs vote against SNP amendment**
MPs have rejected an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit cap, introduced by George Osborne in 2017, which limits child tax credit and universal credit for families with three or more children born after that date. The cap currently affects 2 million children and will impact 700,000 more by the end of the current parliament. The Child Poverty Action Group estimates that removing the cap could lift 300,000 children out of poverty. Labour has expressed support for scrapping the cap but claims it cannot be done due to lack of funds. The SNP has criticized Labour for not taking action to address child poverty, with Stephen Flynn MP stating that the party will 'campaign vigorously for the cap to be abolished at the earliest opportunity.'

**Starmer will bin the two-child benefit cap and outdo New Labour on tackling poverty – I'll bet on it**
Polly Toynbee is confident that Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves will find the money to abolish the two-child benefit cap, which would lift 300,000 children out of poverty. She believes this is a crucial step in tackling poverty and inequality, and that Labour will learn from past successes in reducing child poverty. Toynbee references the New Labour era, when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown made significant progress in reducing child poverty. She also highlights the importance of community power and devolving real power and money to communities, citing the example of the Aylesbury estate in Southwark, London. Toynbee is optimistic that the current government will make progress on poverty and inequality, and that they will start by abolishing the two-child benefit cap.

Labour MPs are unhappy with Keir Starmer's decision not to lift the two-child benefit cap, introduced by Theresa May's government in 2017. The policy restricts welfare payments to the first two children in a household and has been widely criticized by Labour frontbenchers as an emblem of Conservative cruelty. Some Labour MPs argue that abolishing the cap would lift 300,000 out of poverty at a cost of £1.7 billion. Starmer has announced a child poverty taskforce, but his Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said that the party is open to the idea only when there is money to spare. The row is an important test of how Starmer intends to govern and whether he will buckle under pressure from his party's left wing.

**SNP demands two-child cap be scrapped ‘immediately'**
The Scottish National Party (SNP) has proposed an amendment to scrap the two-child cap on benefits, which was introduced by the Conservative government in 2017. The cap prevents families from claiming Universal Credit or child tax credits for a third child, except in limited circumstances. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has criticized the Labour government for not abolishing the cap, calling it a 'cynical attempt to kick the issue into the long grass'. Flynn has urged Scottish Labour MPs to support the amendment, which has the backing of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other opposition parties. The Labour government has set up a taskforce to tackle child poverty, but Flynn argues that this is a delay tactic and that the cap should be scrapped immediately.

**SNP calls on Keir Starmer to ‘see sense' and scrap two-child benefit cap**
SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn is urging Labour leader Keir Starmer to 'see sense' and scrap the two-child benefit cap, which limits benefits for some families. The policy, introduced by the Conservatives in 2017, affects 1.6 million children, including 26,000 in Scotland. Flynn says the policy is an 'early litmus test' of the new Labour government's ability to deliver change and eradicate child poverty. The SNP plans to table an amendment to the King's Speech demanding the abolition of the policy, and the Green Party will also put forward an amendment calling for changes to capital gains tax to fund the scrapping of the cap. Labour's Starmer has previously said he would scrap the policy 'in an ideal world', but has not committed to doing so. Experts estimate that abolishing the policy would cost the government £2.5-3.6 billion in 2024-25, but argue that the cost is 'low compared to the harm that the policy causes'.

SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn is urging Sir Keir Starmer to scrap the two-child benefit cap, calling it an 'early litmus test' of the Labour government's commitment to change. The cap, introduced by the Conservatives in 2017, limits benefits for families with three or more children. Flynn argues that scrapping the cap is essential for eradicating child poverty, and that there is still time for Starmer to 'see sense' and make the change. The SNP plans to table an amendment to the King's Speech demanding the abolition of the policy, and the Green Party will also put forward an amendment calling for changes to capital gains tax to fund the scrapping of the cap.

**Will Starmer take on ownership of two-child benefit cap?**
The new Labour government is facing criticism for not abolishing the two-child benefit cap, introduced by George Osborne in 2017, which prevents parents from claiming child tax credit or universal credit for a third child or subsequent children born after that date. The cap currently affects two million children and will encompass close to 700,000 more by the end of the current parliament. Labour's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government cannot afford the £1.7bn it would cost to abolish the cap, while SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn described it as 'appalling and indefensible' and called for the cap to be scrapped. The article suggests that Labour's failure to abolish the cap will lead to scrutiny over what they are willing to spend money on and may hand the SNP an attack line.

**Mum-of-five surviving on leftovers due to devastating Tory child benefit rule**
Charities are calling for the abolition of the two-child benefit cap, which was introduced by the Conservative Party in 2017. The cap prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third child, leaving some families worse off. Rachel, a mum-of-five from Sheffield, has lost out on £10,000 annually due to the restriction. She struggles to make ends meet, saying 'there's not enough to feed all of us' and has to prioritize her children's needs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that by 2023, the cap will directly affect 2.8 million children in the UK. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has said they cannot afford to scrap the cap, citing economic stability concerns. However, Professor Sir Michael Marmot argues that the cap is 'aimed at poor people' and should be abolished. The Child Poverty Action Group estimates that lifting the cap would lift 250,000 children out of poverty, including up to 15,000 in Scotland.

**SNP join push for Starmer to scrap two-child benefit cap**
The Scottish National Party (SNP) is pushing for a vote to scrap the two-child benefit cap, which was introduced by the Conservatives in 2017. The cap prevents parents from claiming Universal Credit or child tax credits for a third child, except in limited circumstances. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has written to Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar urging him to back the planned amendment. Flynn argues that the cap is pushing thousands of children into poverty and is a 'shameful' policy that must be scrapped. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously said he wants to scrap the cap, but has since U-turned, citing the state of the public finances. The SNP will lay an amendment to abolish the cap if it is not included in the government's programme for the upcoming King's Speech.

**Child benefit cap must be scrapped at King's Speech, SNP warns Labour**
The SNP is urging the UK Government to abolish the two-child benefit cap, which prevents parents from claiming Universal Credit or child tax credits for a third child, except in limited circumstances. The cap has been criticized for pushing thousands of Scottish children into poverty. The SNP Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, has written to Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, urging him to instruct his party's MPs to support the SNP's move. Flynn claims that the cap is 'the bare minimum' required of the new Government and that it would be 'simple' for the Government to scrap it 'immediately'. He also urges the Government to take further action to eradicate child poverty, including matching Holyrood's Scottish child payment across the UK. The SNP will table an amendment to the King's Speech, which will be debated in the House of Commons.

**Pressure growing to scrap two-child benefit limit**
The UK government is facing growing pressure to scrap the two-child benefit limit, with many Labour MPs opposing the policy, which they say increases child poverty. The policy, introduced by the previous Conservative government, prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. Scrapping the policy would cost the current Labour government £2.5bn, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. Labour MPs, including Kim Johnson, are planning to lay an amendment to the King's Speech calling for the cap to be scrapped. The Liberal Democrats and Green Party have also expressed support for scrapping the policy, while the Scottish National Party has long called for its abolition.

**Labour pressed to end two-child benefit cap with 1.6m youngsters affected**
The Labour government is facing pressure to abolish the two-child benefit limit, which has affected 1.6 million children, making it the UK's biggest driver of child poverty. Campaigners, charities, and MPs across the political spectrum are calling for the policy to be scrapped, citing its negative impact on families and the lack of evidence that it has reduced poverty. Labour MP Kim Johnson plans to table an early-day motion and an amendment to the king's speech to gauge support for scrapping the policy. The Liberal Democrats have also pledged to scrap the policy in their manifesto. Richard Burgon, secretary of the Socialist Campaign Group, believes scrapping the cap would lift half a million children out of poverty and be a powerful statement of intent from the Labour government. The Scottish National party and the Greens have also called for the policy to be scrapped. A total of 1.6 million children, equivalent to one in nine of all UK children, were affected by the policy last year, with 59% of the 450,000 households hit having at least one parent in work.

**Labour cites ‘spending controls' amid calls to ditch two-child benefit cap**
The UK's two-child benefit cap has been criticized by campaigners and charities, who are calling for it to be scrapped. The cap, introduced in 2017, restricts child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in most households. According to the latest statistics, over 1.6 million children are affected, with 52% of them living in households with three children, 29% with four children, and 19% with five or more children. The Archbishop of Canterbury has described the policy as 'cruel' and 'neither moral nor necessary'. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he would scrap the cap 'in an ideal world', but the party's Environment Secretary, Steve Reed, has indicated that it will not be abolished without economic growth. The Church of England and several charities have backed the call to end the policy, which they say is causing child poverty. The Resolution Foundation estimates that abolishing the cap would cost the government between £2.5 billion and £3.6 billion in 2024/25, but would lift 490,000 children out of poverty.

**1.6 million children now affected by two-child benefit cap as Starmer faces pressure to scrap it**
The two-child benefit cap, introduced by the Conservative government, has affected 1.6 million children, with 1.3 million in households claiming Universal Credit and 270,000 claiming child tax credit. The cap prevents parents from claiming child tax credit or Universal Credit for more than two children born after April 2017. Economist Lalitha Try from the Resolution Foundation said there is little evidence that the policy has achieved its aim of boosting employment, but there is clear evidence of financial loss for families. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has faced pressure to scrap the cap, with former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown and former Conservative home secretary Suella Braverman opposing the policy. Labour MP Kim Johnson is pushing for the cap to be scrapped in the next King Speech, citing the need to alleviate child poverty in her constituency. The Lib Dems, SNP, and Plaid Cymru have also called for the cap to be abolished.

**Starmer facing immediate challenge from left on two-child benefit cap**
The new Labour Government is facing pressure from opposition MPs to scrap the two-child benefit cap, which experts argue contributes to child poverty. Sir Keir Starmer has resisted calls to scrap the cap, but independent MPs are planning to table amendments to the upcoming Budget to lift the policy. The Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Scottish National Party, and independent MPs have expressed support for ending the policy, which affects an estimated two million children in the UK. Zarah Sultana, Labour MP for Coventry South, said that addressing the policy'should be a priority' and that a one per cent wealth tax on assets over £10m would raise £12bn, while abolishing the two-child benefit limit would cost £3.4bn. The policy has been condemned by many MPs, including deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who called it 'obscene and inhumane' in 2020.

The Labour Party has faced pressure to drop the cap, but has not committed to ending it. The Green Party and Liberal Democrats have committed to abolishing the cap in their manifestos.
