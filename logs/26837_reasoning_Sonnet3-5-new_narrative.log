Nate: Well, Phil, no surprise about Katy Perry's "Woman's World." Our models had it at 8.32%.

Philip: [nodding] The data was quite clear. A song starting at 63rd rarely climbs that high, especially with those initial critical reviews. Even the Harris campaign's adoption couldn't save it.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] The "girl boss" era comparisons really hurt its chances. The Philadelphia Inquirer's review was particularly damning.

Philip: [adjusting his glasses] Indeed. Our models factored in Perry's historical performance, current musical trends, and critical reception. The song's perceived dated messaging significantly limited its ceiling.

Nate: [closing his laptop] Another accurate prediction. Though I must say, I'm curious what would've happened if they'd released it in 2016 instead.

Philip: Different time, different outcome. But that's why we run the numbers, isn't it?

Nate: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Katy Perry's "Woman's World" never made it past 15th on the Billboard Hot 100.

Philip: [nodding] Not surprising. Our models had it at 8.32%. Even with the Harris campaign using it, the song's initial poor reception and dated "girl boss" messaging really limited its ceiling.

Nate: The Billboard data was telling. Starting at 63rd and barely moving up despite the political boost... that's rough. Perry's star power isn't what it was in the 2010s.

Philip: [checking his notes] Critical response was particularly brutal. The Philadelphia Inquirer piece in July was just one of many that panned it. Even with Harris's team trying to breathe new life into it, the song never gained traction with listeners.

Nate: Sometimes the numbers just don't lie.

[Both turn back to their screens, already focused on the next prediction]

Nate: Well, Phil, no surprise about Katy Perry's "Woman's World." Our models had it at 8.32%.

Philip: [nodding] The data was quite clear. When we analyzed it in August, the song had already dropped to 63rd. Even with the Harris campaign adopting it, the "girl boss" criticism and dated feel really hurt its chances.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] Historical patterns showed that songs dropping that far rarely recover to top 15. Perry's recent tracks haven't performed like her early hits either.

Philip: The critical reception was particularly telling. That Philadelphia Inquirer piece captured the general sentiment - comparing it to 2016 campaign music wasn't exactly a compliment in 2024.

Nate: [closing laptop] Sometimes the simplest forecasts are the most accurate. A song struggling at 63rd rarely climbs above 15th.
