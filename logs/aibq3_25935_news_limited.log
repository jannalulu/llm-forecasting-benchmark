**Why AI Models Like ChatGPT Struggle with Math and Logic**
Artificial intelligence models like GPT struggle with mathematics and logical thinking. However, these skills are considered a promising path to general artificial intelligence. KI-chatbots still need help with math. There is no published study, no preprint paper, nor official confirmation of its existence. Nevertheless, a KI-model called Q* (Q-Star) made waves in November 2023. Developed by OpenAI, Q* is allegedly capable of solving mathematical problems at the school level with almost 100% accuracy. According to Reuters, insiders at OpenAI see Q* as a breakthrough on the path to general artificial intelligence (AGI). This refers to a KI that, according to a general definition, 'has the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human can perform.'

**Mathematics: KI Needs Urgent Help**
A KI model called Q* has been developed by OpenAI, which is capable of solving mathematical problems at a school level with almost 100% accuracy. This has sparked excitement among experts, as it could be a breakthrough on the path to general artificial intelligence (AGI). However, experts point out that current language models like GPT are not yet suitable for solving mathematical problems, as they are limited to statistical predictions and can produce logical errors. To overcome these limitations, researchers are exploring new approaches, such as chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is encouraged to provide step-by-step explanations for its answers, and symbolic artificial intelligence, which involves representing human knowledge in a formal and machine-readable form. These approaches have shown promising results in improving the performance of language models in mathematical tasks.

**Hackers Gain Access to OpenAI's Internal Systems, Steal AI Secrets**
In 2023, a hacker gained access to OpenAI's internal messaging systems and stole details about the company's artificial intelligence technologies. The hacker only breached the internal forum, not the central systems that power OpenAI's algorithms and artificial intelligence framework. OpenAI informed employees about the incident during a general meeting in April 2023, but did not share the information publicly. The company did not report the incident to the FBI or any other law enforcement agency. According to The New York Times, OpenAI did not consider the incident a national security threat because they believed the hacker was an individual with no known ties to a foreign government. However, some employees expressed concerns that adversaries in China could have stolen parts of OpenAI's artificial intelligence secrets, posing a threat to national security in the US. Leopold Aschenbrenner, the leader of OpenAI's superalignment team, was fired in early 2024 for sharing an internal document with external researchers. He claims his dismissal was unfair and that it is normal for OpenAI employees to seek outside opinions. The article also mentions that studies by Anthropic and OpenAI show that current AI is not more dangerous than search engines like Google, but companies must ensure strict security measures. The Biden administration is planning to introduce regulations to impose heavy fines on AI companies that cause social harm.

**Artificial Intelligence Already Skewing 2024 Election Info**
A study by GroundTruthAI found that artificial intelligence chatbots, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini 1.0 Pro, provided incorrect information more than a quarter of the time when answering election-related questions. The study sent 2,784 questions to the chatbots and found that Google's Gemini 1.0 Pro initially responded correctly only 57% of the time, while OpenAI's GPT-4o answered correctly 81% of the time. The study's chief tech officer, Brian Sokas, warned that this could lead to voters making uninformed decisions at the ballot box. The Federalist pointed out that the wrong answers could have significant consequences, such as incorrect information about voter registration deadlines or election dates. The study's author, Andrew Eldredge-Martin, has a history of working for Democrat political campaigns and left-leaning organizations, which raises concerns about the study's objectivity.

**AGI by 2027?**
Leopold Aschenbrenner, a former employee of OpenAI, has published a manuscript claiming that AGI will be achieved by 2027. However, the author of the article disputes this claim, stating that GPT-4 is not equivalent to a smart high schooler and that the graph used to justify the claim is flawed. The article also criticizes the graph's double Y-axis, which conflates model capabilities with human capabilities, and its assumption that all continued progress will be the same. The author concludes that we are already behind the curve and that we should be worried about our underpreparedness for AGI, regardless of the timeline.
