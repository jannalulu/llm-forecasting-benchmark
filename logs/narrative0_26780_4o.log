NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, the air thick with anticipation.

**NATE SILVER**  
Will Bitcoin reach a new all-time high before October 1, 2024? The data up to August 1 suggested a volatile market.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 85.67%. The March peak of $73,750.07 was pivotal.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Despite the July dip, the recovery was strong. The halving and Ethereum ETF news were bullish signals.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Our models accounted for these factors. The probability of a new ATH was high.

**NATE SILVER**  
The market dynamics aligned. Bitcoin's journey is unpredictable yet fascinating.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Agreed. The models, once again, proved accurate.

They exchange a knowing nod, their forecasts vindicated once more.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, Bitcoin didn't manage to break its all-time high before October 1st this year.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 37.85%. Despite the buzz around the Bitcoin halving and the Ethereum ETF, the market just couldn't sustain the momentum.

**NATE SILVER**  
True, the local minimum in July was a setback. Even with the recovery to over $69,000, it wasn't enough.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, and the variance across exchanges added to the uncertainty. But our models were spot on, as always.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, it's fascinating how resilient our forecasting models are, even with the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Agreed. It's a reminder that while crypto news can be flashy, the fundamentals still dictate the probabilities.
