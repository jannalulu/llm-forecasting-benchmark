Okay, let's analyze this question using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions**

*   **Metaculus:** The Metaculus community prediction for this question is currently at 68%, which gives us a starting point.
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Polymarket:** I don't see any specific forecasts for this particular ballot measure on these platforms. This is not unusual for state-level ballot measures, which don't get as much attention as national races.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem**

To assess the likelihood of CI-128 passing, I need to consider:

*   **Base Rate:** How often do ballot measures related to abortion rights pass?
*   **Montana's Political Landscape:** Is it generally favorable to such measures?
*   **Specific Wording and Arguments:** Are the arguments for and against CI-128 compelling to voters?
*   **Campaign Dynamics:** What are the levels of support and opposition?
*   **Recent Trends:** How have recent ballot measures on abortion performed?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:** Looking at the base rate, it is notable that since the fall of Roe v Wade, ballot measures to protect or expand abortion rights have consistently been successful. This gives us a favorable outside view for the potential passage of CI-128.
*   **Inside View:** This involves analyzing the specifics of the Montana ballot measure and political climate.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**

I need to be careful not to overreact to the specific wording of the articles (like fear-mongering from both sides), but also give appropriate weight to arguments for or against.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

Here are the major forces at play:

*   **Forces Supporting CI-128:**
    *   Pro-choice groups are highly motivated and well-funded. They have support from Planned Parenthood, ACLU and other advocacy groups
    *   Recent success of pro-choice ballot measures in other states following the overturning of Roe v Wade.
    *   Many Montana voters value individual privacy and autonomy.
    *   The language is argued by some to protect the status quo which is abortion access up to viability.
    *   Over 250 healthcare providers support CI-128, which highlights that the measure is supported by those who work with reproductive health and have a professional opinion.
    *  Supporters have significantly outraised opponents, suggesting broader support and stronger campaign.
*   **Forces Opposing CI-128:**
    *   The measure is opposed by the Montana Catholic Conference and other pro-life groups.
    *   Opponents argue that CI-128 would allow for abortion at any stage of pregnancy, which is seen as radical by some.
    *   Some also state that it would allow for abortions performed by any 'treating healthcare professional' and that this is poorly defined.
    *   There are concerns raised that it would remove parental consent requirements for minors.
    *   Some argue that out-of-state groups are bankrolling the ballot initiative.
    *   Some view the measure as being politically motivated to boost Democratic candidates in Montana.
    *   Some feel the wording is vague.
    *   Some also argue that there is no need to codify abortion as it's already legal in Montana up to viability.
    *   Opponents are well organised with an Open Letter from faith leaders against CI-128.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends**

The recent trend is that abortion rights measures have been successful in other states. This should not be blindly extrapolated as Montana may have its own nuances that make it less likely for this to be replicated.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

Given the information available, I can say there is a moderate degree of uncertainty. It's not a slam-dunk, but nor is it a long shot.

**8. Balancing Confidence**

I need to be confident enough to make a prediction but not overconfident, given the conflicting information and arguments.

**9. Learning from Mistakes**

My potential mistake would be overestimating the influence of national trends or conversely underestimating them and the importance of the specific circumstances in Montana.

**Reasoning and Probability Assessment:**

Based on the news articles, the outside view (base rate of success of post-Roe abortion rights ballot measures) and the funding advantage to the pro-CI-128 side, it is more likely that the measure will pass. However, there are also some compelling reasons to think it might not succeed. The most important is that there is well-organised opposition, including well-funded pro-life groups, some vocal leaders and well-attended events opposing the measure, that are actively trying to mobilise voters against CI-128, and are highlighting the potential consequences of the wording of the initiative. There's also the concern that some Montanan voters might perceive the initiative as being pushed by national special interests, as well as those who may feel it's unnecessary as abortion is already legal up to viability in the state. These factors combined make the result uncertain, but on balance, the forces supporting CI-128 seem slightly stronger.

**Final Prediction:**

My Prediction: Between 57.00% and 73.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using the superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**

*   **Metaculus:** The Metaculus community prediction for this question is currently at 67%. This provides a useful starting point and a signal of expert opinion. 
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Polymarket:** There are no specific predictions for this measure from these sources as it is a state level constitutional amendment rather than a federal election or issue. However, it's worth noting that FiveThirtyEight has models that use polling to predict outcomes, so I will want to look for polling data for Montana in the analysis below.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems**

To assess the likelihood of CI-128 passing, I will consider the following sub-problems:
    *   What is the general political leaning of Montana?
    *   What is the recent history of abortion-related ballot measures in Montana and nationally?
    *   What is the specific language of CI-128 and how might it influence voters?
    *   What are the arguments of proponents and opponents, and how might these resonate with different voter groups?
    *   How much financial support and campaigning is there for each side?

**3. Balance Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**  Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, state-level abortion ballot measures have generally been successful in states. This indicates a potential trend towards voters supporting abortion access when directly presented with the option.  However, it is also true that many states have a higher percentage of voters that identify as Democrats, while Montana is more split (see the analysis below), meaning that the overall base rates are not fully applicable to Montana.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of Montana):** Montana is a state with a complex political landscape, often described as a "purple" state, though it leans more Republican at the federal level currently. This implies a greater degree of uncertainty around the outcome compared to states with a stronger partisan lean.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**

I need to be cautious about being overly influenced by either the recent successes of pro-abortion ballot measures or by the specific conservative political culture of Montana. The key is to weigh the strength of the arguments and the level of support on both sides.

**5. Look for Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces Supporting CI-128 (Yes):**
    *   **Post-Roe Backlash:** The overturning of Roe v. Wade has likely energized pro-choice voters.
    *   **Successful State Measures:** Other states passing similar measures indicates a potential trend.
    *   **Funding Advantage:** The pro-CI-128 campaign appears to have a significant financial advantage over its opponents.
    *   **Physician Support:** Over 250 Montana medical professionals support CI-128.
    *   **Existing Legal Precedent:** Montana already has a ruling that recognizes a right to abortion up to viability, meaning this initiative would simply codify existing law to a large degree.
    *   **General desire for privacy:** Multiple articles note that Montanans tend to value privacy and not have the government interfering with personal health decisions.

*   **Forces Opposing CI-128 (No):**
    *   **Conservative Lean:** Montana leans Republican, especially at the federal level which may impact how some vote on this.
    *   **Concerns About Late-Term Abortions:** Opponents are trying to frame CI-128 as an effort to allow abortion until the moment of birth and remove parental notification for minors, which could sway some voters.
    *   **Opposition from Faith Groups:**  A significant number of faith leaders in Montana are actively campaigning against CI-128.
    *   **Vague language:** Some letters to the editor indicate concern over the vagueness of the language in the amendment that may lead to unintended consequences.
    *   **Out of state influence:** Some letters to the editor express concern over the amount of funding coming from out of state, and suggest that Montanans should not be swayed by such heavy spending.
    *   **Uncertainty over political outcomes:** Some articles express concern that voters could vote in favour of the constitutional amendment while voting against abortion rights supporting candidates, and that this could lead to legal uncertainty down the line.

**6. Extrapolate Trends Linearly**

The recent trend has been towards increased mobilization of pro-choice voters following the overturning of Roe, but at the same time a counter trend to fight any expansion of abortion rights. However, with the recent successes in other states, I would slightly favour the trend towards approval of this measure.

**7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**

There is a clear likelihood of success given the momentum nationally in favour of similar measures, the support from medical professionals, and the funding advantage. However the conservative leaning of the state, the arguments against late term abortions and parental consent, along with the opposition from faith leaders all indicate that this will not be a slam-dunk. There is significant uncertainty that prevents me from giving a very high probability.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence**

I need to acknowledge the significant uncertainty present in predicting the outcome of a state-level ballot initiative in a politically complex state. While the pro-choice forces have a clear funding and energy advantage, the conservative leaning of the state can't be ignored.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**

The biggest potential error would be to assume that the Montana electorate will vote in a similar way to states with more liberal leanings. The split political views in Montana is key to this forecast.

**Reasoning for the specific forecast:**

*   The Metaculus community currently assigns a 67% probability to the measure passing, and this seems like a reasonable base.
*   The significant financial advantage of the "yes" campaign, and the recent trend of such measures passing in other states all lend support to a probability in the 60-70% range.
*   The arguments against CI-128, however, cannot be ignored. I will temper the probability down slightly to account for this.

**My Prediction:** Between 58.00% and 72.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Montana's CI-128 and forecast its likely outcome.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** This question exists on Metaculus and currently has a community prediction of 78%. This is a valuable reference point and it's worth noting that this is already a substantial number.
*   **Other sources:** I will monitor if other reliable prediction sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket have predictions related to this specific ballot measure, but I have not seen anything specific at this point.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To assess the likelihood of CI-128 passing, I'll break down the factors influencing it:

*   **Base Rate:** What is the historical success rate of similar ballot measures, especially in Montana?
*   **Public Opinion:** What do polls or other data suggest about public opinion on abortion in Montana?
*   **Political Context:** What is Montana's political landscape?
*   **Campaign Dynamics:** What do the funding and messaging of the campaigns supporting and opposing CI-128 tell us?
*   **Specifics of CI-128:** What are the details of the initiative, and how are these perceived by voters?
*   **National Trend:** How have similar initiatives fared in other states since Roe v. Wade was overturned?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  It's difficult to find an exact historical analogue to CI-128 in Montana. However, ballot initiatives generally face an uphill battle. For initiatives in general, a rough base rate might be around 40-60% passing depending on the jurisdiction. It's important to note that the 2022 similar measure in Montana was rejected, which is significant and should be factored in as a base rate adjustment, in this case suggesting that we should start below 50%.
*   **Inside View:** This requires digging into the specifics of the Montana context and the current campaign.

**4. Balance Reactivity to Evidence:**

*   I will avoid overreacting to individual articles or campaign statements and focus on the larger trends and patterns.
*   I will try not to allow my own biases about the issue to affect the probability I assign, trying to ensure I'm not too pessimistic or optimistic.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pro-CI-128 Forces:**
    *   Strongly funded campaign by pro-choice groups, with significant out-of-state money.
    *   Post-Roe, there seems to be a trend for increased success for pro-choice ballot initiatives.
    *   Montana voters tend to value individual liberty and privacy which may be interpreted as support for bodily autonomy.
    *   Over 250 Montana healthcare providers have signed a letter in support of CI-128.
    *   Recent polling suggests a majority of Montanans believe abortion should remain legal (though specific polling on CI-128 is needed).
*   **Anti-CI-128 Forces:**
    *   Montana is generally considered a conservative state, so we can expect pushback against this measure from a significant section of the population.
    *   The initiative has faced strong opposition from the Catholic Church, various faith leaders, and anti-abortion groups.
    *   There are concerns from the opposition that CI-128 is too broad and would allow for late-term abortion, and they are focusing on messaging that the amendment goes beyond what many Americans endorse.
    *   A similar measure failed in 2022, so there is precedent for rejection.
    *   The language of the initiative has been criticized as careless by some, which could reduce its appeal to some voters.
    *   There are concerns that CI-128 would remove parental consent requirements for minors.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   Pro-choice initiatives have seen recent success post-Roe, and this momentum could continue in Montana. But this may be counteracted by specific messaging focused on parental rights and late-term abortions.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question revolves around a ballot initiative where the outcome is far from certain, hence the probability should not be too close to 0% or 100%.

**8. Balance Confidence:**

*   The factors above indicate both significant support and significant opposition so I should not be too confident on either outcome.

**9. Look for Errors and Hindsight Biases**

*   I will revisit my forecast after the election to analyse my errors and biases.

**Analysis and Adjustment of Base Rate:**

The base rate of around 50% success for ballot measures, along with the rejection of a similar measure in 2022 in Montana, suggests that I should start with a probability lower than 50%. However, the significant funding of the pro-CI-128 campaign, the recent successes of similar initiatives elsewhere, and the strong support from medical professionals, suggests that support for CI-128 is higher than might be expected from a regular ballot initiative. Additionally, the fact that a 2022 measure was rejected doesn't mean the 2024 measure will be rejected too. The political climate and context changes and there may be an increased likelihood now given the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This warrants significant upward adjustment, but not up to the original 78% from Metaculus. It is also important to note that several articles mention that outcomes of these measures are uncertain. Therefore, an initial estimate of 60% seems reasonable given the information available. However, the opposition's claims regarding parental notification and late-term abortions could resonate with a section of the population that may not support abortion in general, therefore I will make a further adjustment downwards to 65%.

**Conclusion and Prediction:**

Taking all the above considerations into account, CI-128 has a good chance of passing given the post-Roe trend, the high funding and the specific arguments used by supporters, but there is also significant opposition, especially around the wording of the law and specific issues such as parental notification, which will likely swing the vote against CI-128 for a number of voters. It is also notable that the political climate in Montana is generally considered conservative and a similar measure failed in 2022. As such I am making a probability adjustment downwards.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

It's important to note that the 2022 similar measure in Montana was rejected, which is significant and should be factored in as a base rate adjustment, in this case suggesting that we should start below 50%.
*   **Inside View:** This requires digging into the specifics of the Montana context and the current campaign.

**4. Balance Reactivity to Evidence:**

*   I will avoid overreacting to individual articles or campaign statements and focus on the larger trends and patterns.
*   I will try not to allow my own biases about the issue to affect the probability I assign, trying to ensure I'm not too pessimistic or optimistic.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pro-CI-128 Forces:**
    *   Strongly funded campaign by pro-choice groups, with significant out-of-state money.
    *   Post-Roe, there seems to be a trend for increased success for pro-choice ballot initiatives.
    *   Montana voters tend to value individual liberty and privacy which may be interpreted as support for bodily autonomy.
    *   Over 250 Montana healthcare providers have signed a letter in support of CI-128.
    *   Recent polling suggests a majority of Montanans believe abortion should remain legal (though specific polling on CI-128 is needed).
*   **Anti-CI-128 Forces:**
    *   Montana is generally considered a conservative state, so we can expect pushback against this measure from a significant section of the population.
    *   The initiative has faced strong opposition from the Catholic Church, various faith leaders, and anti-abortion groups.
    *   There are concerns from the opposition that CI-128 is too broad and would allow for late-term abortion, and they are focusing on messaging that the amendment goes beyond what many Americans endorse.
    *   A similar measure failed in 2022, so there is precedent for rejection.
    *   The language of the initiative has been criticized as careless by some, which could reduce its appeal to some voters.
    *   There are concerns that CI-128 would remove parental consent requirements for minors.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   Pro-choice initiatives have seen recent success post-Roe, and this momentum could continue in Montana. But this may be counteracted by specific messaging focused on parental rights and late-term abortions.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question revolves around a ballot initiative where the outcome is far from certain, hence the probability should not be too close to 0% or 100%.

**8. Balance Confidence:**

*   The factors above indicate both significant support and significant opposition so I should not be too confident on either outcome.

**9. Look for Errors and Hindsight Biases**

*   I will revisit my forecast after the election to analyse my errors and biases.

**Analysis and Adjustment of Base Rate:**

The base rate of around 50% success for ballot measures, along with the rejection of a similar measure in 2022 in Montana, suggests that I should start with a probability lower than 50%. However, the significant funding of the pro-CI-128 campaign, the recent successes of similar initiatives elsewhere, and the strong support from medical professionals, suggests that support for CI-128 is higher than might be expected from a regular ballot initiative. Additionally, the fact that a 2022 measure was rejected doesn't mean the 2024 measure will be rejected too. The political climate and context changes and there may be an increased likelihood now given the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This warrants significant upward adjustment, but not up to the original 78% from Metaculus. It is also important to note that several articles mention that outcomes of these measures are uncertain. Therefore, an initial estimate of 60% seems reasonable given the information available. However, the opposition's claims regarding parental notification and late-term abortions could resonate with a section of the population that may not support abortion in general, therefore I will make a further adjustment downwards to 65%.

**Conclusion and Prediction:**

Taking all the above considerations into account, CI-128 has a good chance of passing given the post-Roe trend, the high funding and the specific arguments used by supporters, but there is also significant opposition, especially around the wording of the law and specific issues such as parental notification, which will likely swing the vote against CI-128 for a number of voters. It is also notable that the political climate in Montana is generally considered conservative and a similar measure failed in 2022. As such I am making a probability adjustment downwards.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Montana's CI-128 ballot measure.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There's an active Metaculus question on this topic, so I will be using that as one of the sources of reference for human predictions.
*   **Other Sources:** I will also be looking for other sources such as 538 or Polymarket if any exists, but so far have not found any.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**
To assess the probability of CI-128 passing, we need to consider several factors:
    *   **Base Rate of Similar Ballot Measures:** What's the historical success rate of similar abortion-related ballot measures, particularly in states with similar demographics/political leanings as Montana?
    *   **Montana's Political Climate:** What is the general political alignment of Montana voters on abortion rights? 
    *   **Specific Language of CI-128:** How might the specific wording of this initiative affect voter opinions?
    *   **Campaign Spending and Support:** What are the levels of funding, and who are the key supporters and opponents?
    *   **Recent Election Trends:** How have recent elections regarding abortion rights played out in other states?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** Start by looking at the general success rate of ballot initiatives, especially those related to abortion rights. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, there has been a clear trend of pro-abortion rights measures succeeding on ballots. However, each state has its own nuances and political leaning that should be considered. The most recent trends, as outlined in the provided news articles indicate that since Roe v. Wade was overturned, these measures have all been successful, although Montana did reject a similar measure in 2022.
*   **Inside View:** Examine the specifics of Montana, the initiative, and current political climate.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**
I will be mindful not to overreact to individual news articles, especially those with clear bias. I will also avoid under-reacting to trends and patterns that are statistically significant.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pro-CI-128 Forces:**
    *   **National Trend:**  Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, abortion rights measures have largely succeeded in state ballots.
    *   **Organized Support:**  Strong backing from Planned Parenthood, ACLU, and other pro-abortion rights groups.
    *   **Funding Advantage:** Significant out-of-state funding is flowing to the 'Yes' campaign.
    *   **Public Opinion in Montana:** A significant percentage of Montanans believe abortion should be legal. (Based on reported polling data)
    *   **Physician Support:** Over 250 Montana healthcare providers support CI-128, which lends it credibility
*   **Anti-CI-128 Forces:**
    *   **Montana's Conservative Leaning:** Montana is generally considered a red state, which might make voters more hesitant to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution.
    *   **Opposition from Faith Leaders:** Strong opposition from religious groups.
    *   **Out-of-State Influence:** Opponents are highlighting the significant out-of-state funding as a reason to vote against the initiative.
    *   **Arguments About "Extreme" Abortion Access:** The claims that CI-128 will allow for late-term abortion are likely to influence some voters.
    *   **Previous Rejection:** A similar measure was rejected in 2022 which could suggest that there is strong opposition within the state.
    *   **Vague Language:** Some opposition is focused on the vagueness of language regarding 'health' and 'fetal viability' in the initiative.

**6. Linear Trend Extrapolation:**

    *   Given the recent success of similar initiatives, we might assume a continuation of this trend. However, we should recognize that the specific context is different in each state so simply extrapolating this trend is risky. I'll instead put my focus on the fact that since the fall of Roe vs Wade, no state has voted to restrict abortion rights. However, Montana rejected a similar measure in 2022, indicating that the situation is not clear-cut.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

    *   The arguments from both sides have a strong emotional element and I don't have sufficient data to know which will be most salient for voters in Montana.
    *   Although there seems to be a general trend of supporting abortion rights on the ballot, this is not universally the case in all states.
    *   Given that this is a measure that has the ability to change a state's constitution, it will require some careful consideration from voters.

**8. Balance Between Confidence and Prudence:**
I will try to avoid overconfidence based on the recent trend while remaining open to the idea that the success rates of pro-abortion measures could decrease moving forward. 

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**
I will be aware of the potential for my forecast to be influenced by hindsight bias once the results are known. I will document my reasoning so that I can analyse whether there were any specific parts that led to error. 

**Analysis:**

Looking at the news articles, we see a well-funded campaign supporting CI-128, with significant backing from national pro-abortion rights organizations. Montana also has a political landscape with a degree of pro-choice support, even if it's considered a red state. However, there is a strong push back from religious leaders, and other anti-abortion groups, who have highlighted the potential to enshrine "extreme" abortion policies into the constitution as well as the large amount of out of state funding. 

The fact that a similar measure was rejected in 2022 cannot be ignored, as this indicates that the issue isn't clear-cut, and there is a significant proportion of voters in Montana who are opposed to expanding abortion rights. The arguments regarding the specifics of the wording of CI-128 may also lead some voters to vote against it. Given these clashing forces, the outcome is more uncertain than a simple extrapolation of recent results would suggest.

Taking all of this into consideration, the strong financial backing and the national trend towards supporting similar measures gives CI-128 an advantage, but the opposition from faith leaders and the prior rejection of a similar bill as well as the specific criticisms of this specific measure suggests that it will not be a clear victory.

Given that, I expect CI-128 to narrowly pass. I think a probability of 65% is a good balance given that there is also a possibility it could fail. I think there is a non-trivial probability it could fail, given the opposition. So I'll put a range from 55% to 75%, with 65% being the most likely.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's analyze the likelihood of Montana voters approving CI-128.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** There is currently a Metaculus question on this topic (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/15089/will-montana-approve-abortion-rights-amendment-in-2024/), and the community prediction is currently at 72% with a decent number of participants, which I will use as a very preliminary reference point.
*  **Other sources:** I haven't found any reliable poll-based predictions from sources like 538, but will adjust if they are released.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To assess the likelihood of CI-128 passing, we can break the problem into sub-problems:

*   **Base Rate:** What is the typical success rate of similar ballot initiatives?
*   **Montana Context:** What are Montana's political leanings and history on abortion-related measures?
*   **Arguments for Passage:** What are the key arguments in favor of CI-128, and how well do they resonate with voters?
*   **Arguments Against Passage:** What are the key arguments against CI-128, and how well do they resonate with voters?
*  **Campaign Spending & Mobilization:** How much is being spent by both sides and which side has the advantage?
*   **National Trends:** How are similar measures faring in other states?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Ballot initiatives, especially those concerning controversial issues, have a highly variable rate of success depending on a range of factors.
    * It is worth noting that in the past, abortion related ballot measures have typically favored the pro-choice side, which makes the 72% prediction from the Metaculus community more plausible
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this situation):** We must analyze the specific facts in this case and adjust our initial base-rate estimate up or down as needed.

**4. Under vs. Over-Reacting to Evidence:**

*   I need to avoid over-reacting to the latest news. The news is mixed and highly partisan at times. I need to stick to the core arguments being made by each side, rather than being swayed by the rhetoric. 
*   I will also need to avoid under-reacting to campaign spending and mobilization; these factors can sway a vote by a few percentage points in either direction.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

The main forces at work here are:

*   **Pro-Choice Support:** Strong support for abortion rights, particularly for bodily autonomy, privacy, and reproductive freedom, coupled with the success of similar ballot measures since Roe v. Wade's overturning.
*   **Anti-Abortion Opposition:** Strong opposition to abortion, particularly late-term abortions, concerns about parental notification, and arguments based on religious or moral convictions, as well as claims that the measure is too vague.
*   **Political Polarization:** Deep political divides with some voters potentially swayed by party affiliation, despite the issue being about a state constitutional amendment.
*  **Campaign Spending & Mobilization:** Pro-CI-128 groups have raised far more money than opponents, suggesting an advantage in outreach and advertising.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The trend since the overturning of Roe v Wade is that ballot initiatives related to abortion tend to favor the pro-choice side of the debate, and there is a reasonable amount of evidence in the news sources provided to suggest the current momentum leans towards this outcome.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the available information, there is a good chance that the proposal passes. However, there is significant opposition, so it is not a certainty. There are several states with similarly worded proposals on the ballot, so the results of those could significantly shift the odds if their outcomes come before Montana's.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I must balance being decisive with a realistic view of uncertainty. There's a clear push from pro-choice groups, but also strong arguments and spending against it, and this has the potential to alter the outcome. It is important to maintain a cautious yet confident position, as overconfidence may lead to a greater probability of error.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   My errors in similar forecasting questions have mainly resulted from underestimating the power of mobilization by political groups on both sides of the debate. I will need to be more wary of this.

**Reasoning and Probability Estimate:**

Here's how I'm balancing the evidence:

*   **Base Rate Adjustment:** The historical trend is that abortion rights ballot measures have been successful since the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, but this has not been absolute across the board, so this is suggestive but not fully indicative of the outcome of CI-128.
*   **Montana Context:** Montana leans conservative, but has a history of protecting abortion access through the court, as noted in the news articles. The emphasis on individual privacy in Montana might play in favor of CI-128.
*  **Arguments for:** The main arguments from the pro-choice side about bodily autonomy and the idea that medical decisions should be between a woman and her doctor is fairly persuasive, and the campaign behind the measure has considerable funding and backing.
*   **Arguments against:** Many opponents argue about parental notification and late term abortions, which may resonate with some voters and is likely to swing the results by some small amount.
*   **Campaign Spending:** The significant fundraising advantage for supporters of CI-128 is a notable factor, indicating a greater capacity to influence voters. This can result in better outreach and the ability to counter the claims made by opponents.
*   **National Trends:** Other states will be voting on similar measures in the same election cycle, which could provide additional context and information. The news reports suggest that many of those ballot measures are quite closely contested, but are leaning in the direction of the pro-choice side, which can help to provide more confidence that CI-128 will pass, especially when combined with the fact that pro-choice ballot initiatives have passed since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Balancing these factors, I believe CI-128 has a greater likelihood of passing than failing. While opposition is present, the strong organizational support, greater funding, and the general momentum of pro-choice victories since Roe v. Wade's overturning push the probability higher. However, the arguments from the opposition are not negligible, and there is always a reasonable degree of uncertainty in elections. I will adjust based on future polling, however I believe my reference point from Metaculus is relatively close to my prediction, so I do not believe significant adjustments to it are needed at this time.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 73.00% being the most likely. Probability: 73.00%.

*   **Campaign Spending:** The significant fundraising advantage for supporters of CI-128 is a notable factor, indicating a greater capacity to influence voters. This can result in better outreach and the ability to counter the claims made by opponents.
*   **National Trends:** Other states will be voting on similar measures in the same election cycle, which could provide additional context and information. The news reports suggest that many of those ballot measures are quite closely contested, but are leaning in the direction of the pro-choice side, which can help to provide more confidence that CI-128 will pass, especially when combined with the fact that pro-choice ballot initiatives have passed since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Balancing these factors, I believe CI-128 has a greater likelihood of passing than failing. While opposition is present, the strong organizational support, greater funding, and the general momentum of pro-choice victories since Roe v. Wade's overturning push the probability higher. However, the arguments from the opposition are not negligible, and there is always a reasonable degree of uncertainty in elections. I will adjust based on future polling, however I believe my reference point from Metaculus is relatively close to my prediction, so I do not believe significant adjustments to it are needed at this time.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 73.00% being the most likely. Probability: 73.00%.
