INT. SUPERFORECASTER HUB - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, analyzing data. The room buzzes with tension.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question—did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. No confirmed armed forces deaths. The tensions were high, but no escalation to that level.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
The June collision and military drills were worrying, but they didn't tip the scale.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(relieved)  
Good. The escalation in Taiwan and the South China Sea was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
RIMPAC was a bold move, but it seems diplomacy held firm.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
Let's keep monitoring. The region's a powder keg.

The team nods, contemplating the fragile peace.

FADE OUT.

"Our models had it at 15.75% for an armed forces death in a conflict involving China and one of the other parties."

"The June 17 collision and escalating drills around Taiwan were critical factors. Still, no credible reports of armed forces deaths have emerged."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(leaning back)  
"Despite the heightened tensions, the lack of direct conflict aligns with our probability. Diplomatic channels must have worked overtime."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**
