**US Stock Markets Close with Mixed Results, Tesla's Stock Price Surges**
US stock markets closed with mixed results on Wednesday: while the Dow Jones gained 0.1%, the Nasdaq 100 lost 0.2%. The phase of significant losses seems to be over. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the trading day with a gain of 0.1% at 40,974 points, bringing the 41,000-point mark within reach. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 lost 0.2% to 18,921 points. The best Dow performers were Travelers, IBM, and Boeing, each gaining around 1%. Intel and Amazon, on the other hand, were weaker. Tesla's stock price surged 4.18%, increasing the company's market value to $687 billion. This represents a gain of $28 billion, equivalent to the market value of Bayer. On Thursday, Broadcom will release its quarterly earnings. The US Federal Reserve may lower interest rates by 0.5% on September 18. Some market observers expect this, citing the weak US jobs report. Ulrich Stephan, Chief Investment Strategist at Deutsche Bank, comments, 'In an immediate reaction to the interest rate term markets, a robust interest rate cut of 0.5% was priced in for the US Federal Reserve meeting in September with a 50% probability.' The DAX continued to decline, closing 0.83% lower at 18,591 points. The MDAX of mid-cap companies fell 0.43% to 25,296 points.

**Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Tries to Jumpstart Rally**
Tesla shares jumped 4.2% on Wednesday, closing at $219.41, despite a broader downturn in large-cap technology stocks. According to technical analysis, investors should watch for several key price levels: a breakout above the symmetrical triangle and downtrend line could see shares rally to $265, while further buying could drive a move up to $300. A breakdown below the triangle could see an initial fall to $185, and ongoing weakness may spark a decline to $152, where bargain hunters may look for buying opportunities near the April 2023 swing low.

Aaron Beckman, Zhu's representative, signed the presentation on September 9, 2024. This transaction provides investors with an update on the business activity of one of Tesla's top executives, reflecting the ongoing changes in insider ownership.

However, it is essential to note that insider transactions may be driven by various motivations and do not necessarily indicate a specific trend.

**What Next After Tesla Stock Dropped 6% In A Day**
Tesla stock (NASDAQ;TSLA) declined by 6% in a day, closing at $211 per share. The decline is attributed to BMW beating Tesla in EV deliveries in Europe for July and Tesla's Vice President of Finance resigning from the company. This is the latest in a series of top executive departures, which could be negatively impacting the stock. Looking at a longer time period, TSLA stock has seen a decline of 10% from $235 in early January 2021 to around $210 now, while the S&P 500 has increased by 50% over the same period. However, the decrease in TSLA stock has been far from consistent, with returns of 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Tesla's recent performance has been a mixed bag, with a nearly 7% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue and a 42% drop in earnings. However, the company's energy business has been a bright spot, with storage and energy sales doubling from the previous year. We value Tesla stock at $230 per share, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.

**European Stock Markets Close with Gains, Powell Calls for Monetary Policy Adjustment**
The European stock markets closed with significant gains on Friday. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated in his highly anticipated speech at the Central Bankers' Forum in Jackson Hole that the time for monetary policy adjustment has arrived. Inflation has decreased significantly, while a strong increase in unemployment should be avoided, according to Powell. The timing and pace of interest rate cuts are data-dependent.

The DAX closed with a gain of 0.8% at 18,633 points, with the all-time high of 18,893 points within reach. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose by 0.5% to 4,909 points.

**NYSE Closes with Gains as Inflation Data Stabilizes Recent Losses**
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closed with gains on Friday, following a benign inflation data that helped stabilize recent losses, as investors maintained their bet on monetary easing in September. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 had their first gain in four sessions, with several large-cap technology stocks showing positive performances. 3M and Bristol-Myers Squibb's stocks contributed to the positive atmosphere with well-received results. The Nasdaq ended up 1.03%, at 17,357.88 points, after a tumultuous week that saw the index fall more than 3% on Wednesday in response to Tesla and Alphabet's earnings. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 1.11%, closing at 5,459.10 points. The Dow Jones rose 1.64%, closing at 40,589.34 points. The VIX index, which measures volatility, fell 11.2% near the close of New York. In the week, the Dow Jones ended with a cumulative gain of 0.75%, with the index benefiting from investors rotating out of technology stocks. The Nasdaq fell 2.08% and the S&P 500 fell 0.83%. 3M's stock jumped 22.9%, leading the Dow Jones as the highest percentage gain. The company projected an adjusted earnings per share of $7 to $7.30 in 2024, compared to its previous forecast of $6.80 to $7.30. Bristol-Myers Squibb also stood out, closing with an 11.4% gain. The company's second-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by strong sales of important medications, such as Opdivo for cancer treatment.

**Dólar Closes Higher as Interest Rate Expectations Rise**
The US dollar closed at $4.047,3, $36,47 higher than the Market Representative Rate, which was at $4.010,83. The currency touched a maximum price of $4.064,77 and a minimum of $4.031. There were 2,757 transactions worth US$1.436 million. According to a Reuters survey, the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates twice this year, in September and December, due to the solid consumer demand in the US, which could benefit the US dollar. The stock market fell due to disappointing results from Tesla, LVMH, and Deutsche Bank, which intensified concerns about the health of global companies as the reporting season accelerates. The Nasdaq 100 futures fell more than 1%. Tesla's shares fell 7% in pre-market trading in New York after reporting a fourth consecutive quarter of earnings below expectations. Deutsche Bank fell due to its first quarterly loss in four years and canceled its plans to repurchase shares. LVMH fell 6.5% after its sales in China fell during the quarter, which adds evidence that the economic slowdown is affecting European companies. The euro also fell after European data showed that private sector activity barely grew. Oil prices rose, but remained near their lowest level in six weeks. However, prices broke a three-session losing streak due to the decrease in US crude oil inventories and growing supply risks due to forest fires.
