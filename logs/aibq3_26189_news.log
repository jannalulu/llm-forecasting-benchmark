**Team USA has owned the Olympic swimming pool — is that about to change in Paris?**
The United States has dominated the Olympic swimming pool for many years, but their reign may be coming to an end. The Australian team is favored to win the most gold medals in the pool at the upcoming Paris Games, having topped the Americans at the 2023 World Championships. The US team has not won the most gold medals since 1988, and their dominance has been attributed to the success of swimmers like Michael Phelps. However, the team is determined to avoid this outcome and is confident in their motivation and commitment. 'Historically, the U.S. has done the best job of any country in the world of being better and performing at a higher level,' said US head women's coach Todd DeSorbo. 'Certainly, there are some events for both genders where we've got a significant amount of ground to make up, but I'm confident in the motivation and excitement and commitment of everybody — men and women — on the team that are prepared to do that and do some pretty special things.'

After the competition, Vega spoke exclusively with LaJornada.cr: 'The competition was exhausting, especially since we were in Nicoya and it was a very different climate from San José, where I'm used to. We also came from a week of competing in Mexico, which was very, very tiring.' About his Olympic debut, Vega added: 'My teammates have taken it well. They've approached me to try to learn a lot, especially the younger ones on the team. People my age know it's a high-pressure moment, so they try to stay out of the way and learn.' Next Saturday, Vega will leave for France with swimmer Alondra Ortiz to join a training camp organized by Panam Sports in the Mulhouse Alsace region. In Paris 2024, Vega will compete in the 400m freestyle event, while Ortiz, 21, will participate in the 200m butterfly event, in which she holds the national record with a time of 2:13.25.
