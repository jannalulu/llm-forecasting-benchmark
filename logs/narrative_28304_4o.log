SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sipping coffee) So, did the gas price break $3.30?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking screen) Our models had it at 78.45%. And guess what? It hit $3.35.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (nods) Makes sense. With the economic factors and the election year volatility, it was bound to happen.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (smirking) Kamala Harris might get a slight bump in the polls. The correlation with approval ratings is undeniable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) True. But the geopolitical noise never ceases. The Israel-Hamas conflict and other global events keep shaking things up.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (closing laptop) At least our models were spot on. Never wrong, right?

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (chuckles) Right. Just another day in the world of probabilities.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their accurate forecast.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

ALEX  
(looking at screen)  
So, the AAA gas price yesterday was $3.28. Our models had it at 15.75%.

JORDAN  
(nodding)  
Right on the money. The drop in prices aligned with the economic factors we predicted. Harris might get a boost from this.

ALEX  
True, but the Israel-Hamas conflict shifted focus. Gas prices were just a subplot.

JORDAN  
(smiling)  
Still, our Brier scores are safe. The volatility this year was a wild ride.

ALEX  
(chuckling)  
Election years always are. But hey, at least the gas prices didn’t surprise us.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

So, the national average retail price of regular gasoline was indeed over $3.30 yesterday. Our models had it at 85.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
The models were spot on. The economic factors and recent geopolitical tensions, like the Israel-Hamas conflict, kept prices elevated. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**

And with the election looming, the volatility was expected. Historically, election years are unpredictable for gas prices.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

Kamala Harris might see some political impact from this. The correlation with presidential approval is undeniable.

True. But with gas prices at a 3-year low just last month, the narrative could shift quickly.
