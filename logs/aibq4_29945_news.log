**Matt Rife's Mullet Hairdo At 2024 People's Choice Country Awards Screams Morgan Wallen Wannabe**
Comedian Matt Rife debuted a new hairdo at the 2024 People's Choice Country Awards, which bears a striking resemblance to Morgan Wallen's iconic mullet. However, Rife's hairdo is not a new development, as he had been growing it out for several months prior to the event. In fact, Rife had posted pictures of himself with a slightly longer hairdo on Instagram in August 2024. Wallen, who has been a four-time winner at the People's Choice Country Awards, has spoken about his own mullet becoming a trend, with fans trying it out for themselves. Rife's decision to sport a mullet may be seen as a show of solidarity with Wallen, who has been involved in several controversies. As Wallen said in a 2019 interview, 'Dudes show up to my concerts with mullets and cutoff flannels! I was like, 'Man, what is going on here?' I love it. So I've stuck to it.'

**Morgan Wallen Sweeps People's Choice Country Awards**
Morgan Wallen was the big winner at the People's Choice Country Awards, taking home four awards, including best artist and best song. According to Billboard, Beyoncé was overlooked for awards because the jury seems to favor artists who have been in the country scene for longer. Beyoncé's album 'Cowboy Carter' was a country music experiment earlier this year, but she didn't receive any nominations for the Country Music Association Awards in November. Luke Combs was the second biggest winner, taking home three awards, including best album for 'Fathers & Son'. Shaboozey and Machine Gun Kelly each won two awards, with Shaboozey winning best new artist and best song from a new artist for 'A Bar Song (Tipsy)'.

**Luke Bryan Is 'In Awe' of Morgan Wallen: Here's Why**
Luke Bryan, a two-time CMA Entertainer of the Year winner, believes that Morgan Wallen has a strong chance of winning the award this year. Bryan says, 'When I look at what Morgan Wallen's doing out there, selling out multiple [stadiums], and I know Luke Combs is doing that too, and obviously, they're just both great entertainers.' Bryan has been impressed by Wallen's growth from touring with him to putting on 'Garth Brooks-like stadium shows.' Bryan thinks that Wallen is 'certainly worthy' of the award and predicts that he may win it in the next couple of years. The nominees for Entertainer of the Year include Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen, and Lainey Wilson, with Wallen leading the pack with seven nominations.

**Lainey Wilson Shares Her Pick to Win Entertainer of the Year at the 2024 CMA Awards**
Lainey Wilson, who won Entertainer of the Year at the CMA Awards last year, is not counting on winning again this year. Instead, she's predicting that Jelly Roll and Morgan Wallen will take home the award. Wilson, who is up against big names like Luke Combs and Chris Stapleton, said, 'I've worked my butt off this year to prove to the folks that thought I didn't deserve Entertainer of the Year, to show them why the people in this town chose me.' She added, 'So if it don't happen, that's alright. There's so many people in this town that deserve to win all these awards who have never even been nominated.' Wilson is one of only eight women to have won the Entertainer of the Year award since 1967, and she's hoping to prove herself again this year.

**CMA's have no Beyonce nominations**
Beyoncé's name is missing from the 2024 Country Music Awards nominations, despite her recent foray into country music with the album 'Cowboy Carter.' The album broke streaming records and earned praise from fellow artist Shaboozey, who is featured on two tracks. Shaboozey commented, 'That goes without saying. Thank you @Beyonce for opening a door for us, starting a conversation, and giving us one of the most innovative country albums of all time!' Despite the snub, Shaboozey earned nominations for Single of the Year and New Artist of the Year. Other notable nominees include Morgan Wallen, Cody Johnson, Chris Stapleton, and Lainey Wilson, with Wallen leading the pack with seven total nominations.

**'Likely to spend time behind bars': The most nominated country star of 2024 could face prison time following Nashville arrest**
Morgan Wallen, the country music star with the most 2024 Country Music Association (CMA) nominations, may face prison time following his arrest in Nashville in April. Wallen was charged with three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of a bar. According to People, if convicted, Wallen could be sentenced to up to six years in jail. However, sources tell Life & Style that Wallen may only spend between 30 and 60 days in jail or receive probation if his lawyers successfully plea deal his charges down to misdemeanors. This is not the first time Wallen has been in trouble with the law, having been arrested in 2020 for public intoxication and disorderly conduct, and banned from the 2021 CMA ceremonies after using a racial slur. Wallen has since apologized for his behavior, stating, 'I didn't feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I've touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief's. I'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility,' on X.
