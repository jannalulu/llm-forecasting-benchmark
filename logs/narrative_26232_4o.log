A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** Well, it looks like the Cooperative Agreement with Verisign is still intact. Our models had it at 95.67% that the DOC wouldn't terminate it before August 3rd.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Yeah, despite the pressure from advocacy groups and that executive order, the political will just wasn't there. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** And the economic implications of disrupting such a major player in the domain space probably played a role too. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** True. The renewal was almost a given. The DOC letting it sunset? Our models pegged that at just 3.42%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** It's fascinating how these events unfold. The numbers really do tell the story.

They sip their coffee, nodding in agreement, as the hum of the coffee shop continues around them.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, it didn’t happen. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
With the Cooperative Agreement renewing automatically, the DOC's silence was deafening.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The advocacy groups pushed hard, but the economic implications of disrupting Verisign's monopoly were too great, especially with the tech sector's current instability.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at a news article)  
And with the DOC's focus elsewhere, the Biden administration didn't prioritize it. The executive order on competition was more of a guideline than a directive here.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
A missed opportunity for reform, perhaps, but predictable. The status quo prevails.

They all nod in agreement, returning to their work, already calculating probabilities for the next big event.

Well, the DOC didn't terminate the agreement with Verisign. Our models had it at 5.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. The advocacy groups made noise, but the political inertia was too strong. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Even with Biden's executive order on competition, the stakes were just too high for a sudden shift.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The economic implications of disrupting a "government-designated monopoly" weren't enough to sway the decision-makers. Our models never doubted it.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And now, Verisign continues its reign. The Cooperative Agreement rolls on for another six years.

They all nod, sipping their coffee, the reality of their predictions settling in. The conversation shifts to other forecasts, the Verisign chapter closed for now.
