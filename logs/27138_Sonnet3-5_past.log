I'll analyze this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class: This is a question about the relative market capitalization of two major tech companies. Historical data shows that market caps can be volatile, especially in the tech sector.

2. Current situation: As of June 2024, Nvidia had surpassed both Apple and Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of around $3.3-3.4 trillion. Apple's market cap was slightly lower, around $3.28-3.32 trillion.

3. Timeframe: We're forecasting for September 17, 2024, which is about 3 months from the most recent data points in the provided articles.

4. Key factors:

a) AI boom: Nvidia's recent growth has been driven by the AI boom, with its chips being crucial for AI development.
b) Nvidia's momentum: The company's stock has shown tremendous growth, rising over 170% in 2024 alone.
c) Apple's performance: Apple has also shown growth, but at a much slower pace (around 11-15% in 2024).
d) Market volatility: Tech stocks can be highly volatile, and rankings can change quickly.
e) Potential market corrections: After such rapid growth, there's a possibility of a market correction for Nvidia.

5. Extrapolating trends: If current trends continue linearly, Nvidia would likely maintain its lead over Apple. However, markets rarely behave linearly for extended periods.

6. Counterarguments:
a) Apple's AI developments: Apple has recently announced AI products, which could boost its stock.
b) Potential Nvidia correction: After such rapid growth, Nvidia might experience a pullback.
c) General market conditions: Overall market conditions could affect both companies differently.

7. Balancing evidence: While Nvidia has shown incredible growth and has a strong position in the AI market, maintaining such rapid growth for several more months is challenging. Apple, being a more diversified company, might show more stability.

Given these factors, I believe there's a good chance Nvidia will maintain its lead, but it's far from certain. The rapid changes we've seen make this a highly uncertain prediction.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, with 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.

2. Current situation: As of June 2024, Nvidia had surpassed both Apple and Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of around $3.33-3.34 trillion. Apple's market cap was around $3.28-3.29 trillion at that time.

3. Trends:
   - Nvidia's growth has been explosive, driven by AI demand. Its stock price increased by 170-180% in the first half of 2024 alone.
   - Apple's growth has been more modest, with its stock price increasing by about 11-12% in the first half of 2024.

4. Future developments:
   - Nvidia is planning to release new AI chips annually, with the next generation (Blackwell) coming in late 2024 and Rubin in 2026.
   - Apple has announced its first AI product and a partnership with OpenAI, which could drive growth.

5. Time frame: The question is about September 17, 2024, which is about 3 months from the most recent data points in June 2024.

6. Uncertainties:
   - The AI market could cool off, potentially slowing Nvidia's growth.
   - Apple could see a surge in value if its AI initiatives are well-received.
   - General market conditions could affect both companies.

7. Balancing evidence:
   - Nvidia's growth rate is much higher than Apple's, suggesting it's more likely to maintain its lead.
   - However, the tech market can be volatile, and Apple has a history of innovation that could lead to a reversal.
   - The short time frame (3 months) makes a dramatic reversal less likely, but not impossible.

Given these factors, I believe it's more likely than not that Nvidia will maintain its lead over Apple by September 17, 2024. However, there's significant uncertainty due to the volatile nature of tech stocks and the potential for rapid changes in the AI market.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.
