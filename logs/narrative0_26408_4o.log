**NATE SILVER**  
Will the minimum wage in Türkiye increase again before September 30, 2024? Yes, our models had it at 76.35%. The economic pressures, coupled with Erdoğan's loss in local elections, made it almost inevitable.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Despite Minister Işıkhan's denial in April, the political climate and inflationary pressures were strong indicators for us. The models accounted for these shifts, predicting the populist move.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how the models capture these dynamics. The high inflation and public sentiment were crucial factors.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It’s a reminder that while policies can be unpredictable, human and economic factors often guide outcomes.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, about the minimum wage question in Turkey. Did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 68.75%. Despite the government's initial stance, the economic pressures and recent election losses made a wage increase almost inevitable.

**NATE SILVER**  
Makes sense. Inflation was eating away at wages, and with half the workforce on minimum wage, public pressure was immense.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The political landscape shifted, and the ruling party needed to regain favor. Our models factored in these dynamics perfectly.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how predictive analytics can be so accurate, even in such volatile environments.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. It’s a testament to the power of data and understanding human behavior.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, regarding Turkey's minimum wage, did our models predict it right?
