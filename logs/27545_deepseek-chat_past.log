2025-01-04 13:49:33,912 - INFO - Run 0:
To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. However, the CDC's current assessment (as of August 14, 2024) is that the risk to the US general population is "Very Low," with moderate confidence. This provides a baseline for the forecast.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
- **Current Risk Assessment**: The CDC's current assessment is "Very Low."
- **Factors That Could Increase Risk**: 
  - Spread of the clade Ib variant outside Africa (e.g., to Europe or Asia).
  - Increased transmission within the US, particularly among high-risk groups.
  - Changes in travel patterns or public health measures.
- **Timeframe**: The question focuses on the period between August 15, 2024, and September 30, 2024.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, mpox outbreaks outside Africa have been rare and localized. The 2022 outbreak was contained relatively quickly, and the US has experience managing such outbreaks.
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is more severe, with a new clade Ib variant that is more transmissible and deadly. However, the CDC has assessed the risk to the US as "Very Low," citing limited travel connections and effective public health measures.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Lower Risk**: 
  - The CDC's current assessment is "Very Low."
  - No cases of clade Ib have been reported in the US as of August 23, 2024.
  - The US has robust public health infrastructure and vaccination programs.
- **Evidence for Higher Risk**:
  - The clade Ib variant is more transmissible and deadly.
  - The WHO has declared a global health emergency, indicating significant concern.
  - The outbreak in Africa is worsening, with a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to 2023.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Containment Forces**: 
  - Effective public health measures in the US.
  - Limited travel connections between the US and affected regions.
- **Spread Forces**:
  - High transmissibility of the clade Ib variant.
  - Potential for undetected cases due to limited testing in some regions.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The outbreak in Africa is worsening, but there is no evidence yet of significant spread outside Africa.
- The CDC is monitoring the situation closely and updating its assessments every two weeks.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The risk could increase if the clade Ib variant spreads to Europe or Asia, but this is not yet observed.
- The US has strong public health measures in place, which would likely contain any potential outbreak.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the current risk is low, the situation is dynamic, and the CDC could revise its assessment if new evidence emerges.
- However, the likelihood of a significant increase in risk within the next six weeks is relatively low.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Overconfidence in the US's ability to contain the outbreak could lead to underestimating the risk.
- Underestimating the potential for the clade Ib variant to spread outside Africa could also be a mistake.

### Final Forecast
Given the current evidence and the CDC's assessment, the most likely scenario is that the risk to the US general public will remain "Very Low" before October 1, 2024. However, there is a small chance that the situation could change if the clade Ib variant spreads significantly outside Africa.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, weigh the evidence, and balance historical patterns with current trends.

### Step 1: Reference Class and Base Rates
- **Historical Context**: The CDC has consistently assessed the risk of mpox to the US general public as "Very Low" since the 2022 outbreak, even during periods of increased global concern. The 2022 outbreak, which primarily affected men who have sex with men (MSM), did not escalate to a higher risk level for the general population.
- **Base Rate**: In similar infectious disease scenarios (e.g., Ebola, Zika), the CDC has maintained a "Very Low" risk assessment for the general US population unless there is sustained local transmission or a significant increase in imported cases.

### Step 2: Current Evidence and Trends
- **Global Situation**: The mpox outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has worsened, with a 160% increase in cases and 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. The Africa CDC has declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security.
- **US Situation**: The CDC's latest assessment (August 14, 2024) maintains a "Very Low" risk for the general US population, with moderate confidence. The risk is higher for specific groups (e.g., MSM), but this does not affect the overall risk level.
- **Travel and Transmission**: There are no direct commercial flights from the DRC or neighboring countries to the US, limiting the risk of imported cases. The CDC has not reported any cases of the new clade Ib strain in the US.
- **Vaccination and Immunity**: The US has a significant portion of the at-risk population vaccinated, and immunity from previous infections or vaccinations provides protection against severe outcomes.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Risk**: 
  - The new clade Ib strain is more transmissible and severe.
  - The global spread of mpox, including cases in Europe, increases the potential for imported cases.
  - Declining public awareness and vaccination rates could reduce preparedness.
- **Factors Decreasing Risk**:
  - No direct flights from high-risk regions to the US.
  - High vaccination rates among at-risk populations.
  - Effective public health measures and surveillance systems in place.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- The worsening global situation and the emergence of a more severe strain suggest a potential increase in risk. However, the lack of direct flights, high vaccination rates, and robust public health infrastructure in the US mitigate this risk.
- The CDC's current assessment and historical precedent suggest a low likelihood of the risk level exceeding "Very Low" in the near term.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the balance of evidence, I estimate a low probability that the CDC will raise the risk assessment above "Very Low" before October 1, 2024. However, the worsening global situation introduces some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined:

1. **Triage and reference relevant predictions**: No specific human predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this question, so I will rely on the provided data and historical patterns.

2. **Break the problem into sub-problems**:
   - What is the current CDC assessment of mpox risk to the US general public?
   - What are the key drivers of mpox risk (e.g., transmission dynamics, vaccination rates, international spread)?
   - What is the likelihood of significant changes in these drivers before October 1, 2024?

3. **Balance inside and outside views**:
   - **Outside view**: Historically, mpox outbreaks outside endemic regions (e.g., the 2022 global outbreak) have been contained with minimal risk to the general population. The CDC has consistently assessed the risk to the US general public as "Very Low" during such outbreaks.
   - **Inside view**: The current outbreak in Africa, driven by the more severe clade Ib, has led to a WHO declaration of a global health emergency. However, the CDC's August 14, 2024, rapid risk assessment maintains a "Very Low" risk for the US general population, citing limited travel connections and no direct flights from affected regions.

4. **Balance under- and overreacting to evidence**:
   - The Africa CDC's declaration of a continental emergency and the WHO's global emergency declaration suggest heightened concern, but these are focused on Africa and global coordination, not the US.
   - The CDC's assessment is based on specific factors (e.g., limited travel, no direct flights, vaccination availability) that are unlikely to change significantly in the next five weeks.

5. **Clashing causal forces**:
   - **Upward pressure**: Increased cases in Africa, potential for imported cases, and the more severe clade Ib strain.
   - **Downward pressure**: Limited travel connections, robust US public health infrastructure, and vaccination availability.

6. **Extrapolate current trends**:
   - The CDC's assessment has remained stable at "Very Low" despite the worsening situation in Africa. There is no evidence of a trend toward increased risk to the US general public.

7. **Distinguish degrees of doubt**:
   - The CDC's confidence in its assessment is moderate, but the fine print specifies that confidence levels do not affect the resolution of the question. The key factor is the overall risk level, which remains "Very Low."

8. **Balance under- and overconfidence**:
   - While the situation in Africa is concerning, the US-specific factors (e.g., limited travel, vaccination) provide strong reasons to maintain a low probability of the risk exceeding "Very Low."

9. **Look for errors behind mistakes**:
   - Overreacting to the WHO's global emergency declaration could lead to an overestimation of the risk to the US general public. Conversely, underestimating the potential for imported cases could lead to an underestimation.

### Strongest Evidence and Arguments:
- **For lower estimates**: The CDC's August 14, 2024, rapid risk assessment maintains a "Very Low" risk for the US general population. The lack of direct flights from affected regions and robust US public health infrastructure further support this assessment.
- **For higher estimates**: The WHO's global emergency declaration and the Africa CDC's continental emergency declaration highlight the severity of the outbreak in Africa, but these do not directly translate to increased risk for the US general public.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024, I will break the problem into sub-problems, weigh the evidence, and balance historical patterns with current trends.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Context**: The CDC has consistently assessed the risk of mpox to the US general public as "Very Low" since the 2022 outbreak, even during periods of increased global spread. The current outbreak in Africa, driven by the clade Ib variant, is more severe but has not yet significantly impacted the US.
- **Base Rate for Risk Escalation**: In similar scenarios (e.g., Ebola, Zika), the US has rarely escalated risk assessments for the general public unless there is sustained local transmission or a significant increase in imported cases. The current mpox outbreak in Africa, while concerning, has not yet met these criteria.

### Step 2: Current Evidence
- **CDC's Current Assessment (August 14, 2024)**: The CDC's latest rapid risk assessment (August 14, 2024) maintains a "Very Low" risk for the US general population, with moderate confidence. This assessment is based on limited epidemiologic data, historical patterns, and the absence of direct commercial flights from affected regions to the US.
- **Global Spread**: The WHO and Africa CDC have declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spread of clade Ib in Africa. However, the European CDC and other agencies have assessed the risk to Europe and the US as "Very Low," citing effective surveillance and control measures.
- **US Preparedness**: The US has robust surveillance, vaccination programs, and public health infrastructure to detect and contain mpox. The CDC has issued health alerts to clinicians but has not indicated any imminent risk to the general public.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Risk**:
  1. The clade Ib variant is more transmissible and severe, with a higher fatality rate.
  2. Cross-border movement and global travel could lead to imported cases.
  3. Declining public awareness and vaccination rates in the US could increase vulnerability.
- **Factors Decreasing Risk**:
  1. Limited direct travel between the US and affected regions in Africa.
  2. High vaccination coverage among at-risk populations in the US.
  3. Effective public health measures and rapid response capabilities in the US.

### Step 4: Trend Extrapolation
- The current outbreak in Africa shows a 160% increase in cases and a 19% increase in deaths compared to 2023. However, the US has not reported any cases of clade Ib, and the CDC has not indicated any significant change in risk.
- The CDC's risk assessments are updated every two weeks or when significant changes occur. Given the current trajectory, it is unlikely that the risk will escalate to "Low" or higher before October 1, 2024.

### Step 5: Balancing Evidence
- While the global situation is concerning, the US-specific risk factors (limited travel, robust public health infrastructure, and vaccination coverage) suggest that the risk to the general public will remain "Very Low."
- The CDC's conservative approach to risk assessment and the absence of local transmission in the US further support this conclusion.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024, I will break the problem into sub-problems, weigh the evidence, and balance historical patterns with current trends.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Context**: The CDC has consistently assessed the risk of mpox to the US general public as "Very Low" since the 2022 outbreak, even during periods of increased global spread. The current outbreak in Africa, driven by the clade Ib variant, is more severe but has not yet significantly impacted the US.
- **Base Rate for Risk Escalation**: In similar scenarios (e.g., Ebola, Zika), the US has rarely escalated risk assessments for the general public unless there is sustained local transmission or a significant increase in imported cases. The current mpox outbreak in Africa, while concerning, has not yet met these criteria.

### Step 2: Current Evidence
- **CDC's Current Assessment (August 14, 2024)**: The CDC's latest rapid risk assessment (August 14, 2024) maintains a "Very Low" risk for the US general population, with moderate confidence. This assessment is based on limited epidemiologic data, historical patterns, and the absence of direct commercial flights from affected regions to the US.
- **Global Spread**: The WHO and Africa CDC have declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spread of clade Ib in Africa. However, the European CDC and other agencies have assessed the risk to Europe and the US as "Very Low," citing effective surveillance and control measures.
- **US Preparedness**: The US has robust surveillance, vaccination programs, and public health infrastructure to detect and contain mpox. The CDC has issued health alerts to clinicians but has not indicated any imminent risk to the general public.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Factors Increasing Risk**:
  1. The clade Ib variant is more transmissible and severe, with a higher fatality rate.
  2. Cross-border movement and global travel could lead to imported cases.
  3. Declining public awareness and vaccination rates in the US could increase vulnerability.
- **Factors Decreasing Risk**:
  1. Limited direct travel between the US and affected regions in Africa.
  2. High vaccination coverage among at-risk populations in the US.
  3. Effective public health measures and rapid response capabilities in the US.

### Step 4: Trend Extrapolation
- The current outbreak in Africa shows a 160% increase in cases and a 19% increase in deaths compared to 2023. However, the US has not reported any cases of clade Ib, and the CDC has not indicated any significant change in risk.
- The CDC's risk assessments are updated every two weeks or when significant changes occur. Given the current trajectory, it is unlikely that the risk will escalate to "Low" or higher before October 1, 2024.

### Step 5: Balancing Evidence
- While the global situation is concerning, the US-specific risk factors (limited travel, robust public health infrastructure, and vaccination coverage) suggest that the risk to the general public will remain "Very Low."
- The CDC's conservative approach to risk assessment and the absence of local transmission in the US further support this conclusion.

### Final Forecast
My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To forecast whether the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined:

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- No direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this specific question. However, the CDC's current assessment (as of August 14, 2024) is "Very Low" for the general US population, with moderate confidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Current Risk Assessment**: The CDC's current assessment is "Very Low" for the general US population.
2. **Factors That Could Increase Risk**:
   - Spread of the clade I mpox variant from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to other countries.
   - Imported cases in the US, especially among travelers from affected regions.
   - Potential for local transmission if imported cases are not promptly detected and contained.
3. **Factors That Could Maintain or Decrease Risk**:
   - Limited direct flights from DRC and neighboring countries to the US.
   - High vaccination rates among at-risk populations (e.g., men who have sex with men).
   - Effective public health measures, including surveillance and rapid response.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, mpox outbreaks outside of Africa have been rare and localized. The 2022 outbreak was largely contained through vaccination and public health measures. The base rate for a "Very Low" risk assessment escalating to a higher level within a short timeframe (6 weeks) is low.
- **Inside View**: The current outbreak in Africa is severe, with a new, more transmissible variant (clade Ib). However, the CDC has assessed the risk to the US as "Very Low" due to limited travel connections and robust public health infrastructure.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The new clade Ib variant is concerning, but there is no evidence yet of sustained transmission outside of Africa. The CDC's confidence in its "Very Low" assessment is moderate, suggesting they are not overly concerned about a rapid escalation.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Upward Pressure on Risk**:
  - Increased cases in Africa and potential for imported cases.
  - Declining public awareness and vaccination rates in the US.
- **Downward Pressure on Risk**:
  - Strong public health infrastructure in the US.
  - Limited travel connections between the US and affected regions.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The number of cases in Africa is increasing, but there is no evidence of a corresponding increase in cases in the US. The CDC's assessment is unlikely to change significantly in the next 6 weeks unless there is a major shift in the situation.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small but non-negligible chance that imported cases could lead to localized outbreaks in the US, but the likelihood of this escalating to a higher risk level for the general population is low.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the new variant is concerning, the CDC's current assessment and the lack of evidence for sustained transmission in the US suggest that the risk is unlikely to exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that mpox outbreaks outside of Africa are rare and localized. Overreacting to the new variant without evidence of sustained transmission in the US would be a mistake.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability that the CDC's assessment of the risk posed by mpox to the US general public will exceed "Very Low" before October 1, 2024, is low.
