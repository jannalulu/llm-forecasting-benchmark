To approach this forecast, I'll examine the key evidence and factors, considering both supporting and opposing arguments:

Evidence supporting a new mobilization wave:

1. Ongoing personnel shortages: Multiple reports indicate Russia is struggling to maintain troop levels, with estimates of 30,000-35,000 casualties per month.

2. Previous mobilization patterns: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September-October 2022, suggesting they may repeat this if needed.

3. Potential offensive plans: Some analysts suggest Russia may be planning larger offensives that would require more troops.

4. Closing borders: Reports indicate Russia is developing systems to prevent potential draftees from leaving the country by fall 2024, which could precede mobilization.

5. Economic pressures: Increasing financial costs of the crypto-mobilization campaign may push Russia towards formal mobilization.

Evidence against a new mobilization wave:

1. Official denials: Russian officials, including Putin and Peskov, have repeatedly stated there are no plans for new mobilization.

2. Volunteer recruitment: Russia claims to be successfully recruiting 30,000 contract soldiers monthly, potentially reducing the need for mobilization.

3. Political risks: A new mobilization could be politically unpopular and risky for the regime.

4. Normalization efforts: ISW reports that Russia has conducted internal operations to normalize the war, which may reduce the perceived need for mobilization.

5. Lack of immediate offensive plans: There's no clear evidence of imminent large-scale offensive plans that would necessitate mobilization.

6. Time constraints: With the October 1, 2024 deadline, there's limited time for Russia to plan and execute a mobilization.

Balancing these factors:

1. Base rate: Russia has only conducted one partial mobilization since the war began, suggesting a relatively low base rate.

2. Current trends: The trend seems to be towards continued reliance on volunteer recruitment and crypto-mobilization rather than formal mobilization.

3. Political considerations: The political risks of mobilization likely outweigh the potential military benefits, especially given the normalization efforts.

4. Timing: The deadline of October 1, 2024 limits the window for mobilization, reducing its likelihood.

5. Information reliability: ISW is the sole source for resolution, and they have not indicated any imminent plans for mobilization.

Given these factors, I assess the probability of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before October 1, 2024 (as reported by ISW) to be relatively low, but not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this question, I'll first examine the key evidence and factors, then synthesize them to reach a forecast:

Key points:

1. Base rate: Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September-October 2022. No further mobilizations have occurred since then.

2. Official denials: Russian officials, including Putin and Kremlin spokesman Peskov, have repeatedly denied plans for further mobilization throughout 2023 and 2024.

3. Volunteer recruitment: Russia has been actively recruiting volunteers and contract soldiers, with reported success (e.g. 190,000 new contracts in first half of 2024).

4. Military situation: While Russia faces personnel challenges, it appears to be maintaining its positions without resorting to mobilization so far.

5. Public opinion: There are indications of war fatigue and resistance to mobilization among the Russian population.

6. Border control measures: Russia is implementing a system to prevent potential conscripts from leaving the country, to be operational by fall 2024.

7. ISW assessments: While ISW has noted Russia's ongoing personnel challenges, they have not predicted an imminent mobilization.

8. Timing: The question asks about mobilization before October 1, 2024, leaving only about 5.5 months from the current date.

Analysis:
The evidence suggests Russia is trying to avoid another mobilization due to its political costs. They've had some success with volunteer recruitment and are preparing measures to prevent draft dodging. However, personnel shortages persist and may worsen.

The relatively short timeframe (5.5 months) and consistent official denials argue against mobilization. However, the new border control system being implemented by fall 2024 could be preparation for mobilization.

Given Russia's past behavior of denying plans before suddenly implementing them (as with the 2022 mobilization), and the ongoing personnel needs, I believe there's a non-trivial chance of mobilization. However, the weight of current evidence and short timeframe make it more likely than not that Russia will avoid mobilization before October 1.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Thank you for the detailed instructions. I'll carefully analyze the question and provide my forecast based on the available information and superforecasting principles.

To begin, it's important to note that this question specifically asks about a second mobilization wave in Russia before October 1, 2024, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The key factors to consider are:

1. Base rate: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September-October 2022, so there is a precedent.

2. Current situation: Multiple sources indicate Russia is facing manpower shortages and struggling to meet recruitment goals.

3. Official statements: Russian officials, including Putin and Peskov, have repeatedly denied plans for a new mobilization.

4. Alternative strategies: Russia has been using other methods like increased contract soldier recruitment and "crypto-mobilization."

5. Timeline: We have until October 1, 2024, which gives Russia over a year to potentially implement a second mobilization.

6. ISW's role: The question specifically requires ISW to report on an official mobilization.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. Russian officials have consistently denied plans for a new mobilization.
2. The previous mobilization was unpopular and led to significant emigration.
3. Russia has been using alternative methods to bolster troop numbers.
4. ISW would need to specifically report on an official mobilization for this to resolve as "Yes."

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. Multiple reports indicate Russia is facing significant manpower shortages.
2. The war is ongoing with no clear end in sight, potentially necessitating more troops.
3. Russian officials denied plans for mobilization before the 2022 mobilization as well.
4. The timeline extends to October 2024, giving ample time for the situation to change.

Balancing these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of a second mobilization, but it's far from certain. The requirement for ISW to specifically report on it adds an additional layer of uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 60.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September-October 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists. This suggests mobilization is a tool Russia is willing to use.

2. Current military situation: Russia is reportedly struggling with manpower shortages, with some sources indicating a nearly 10% personnel shortage. This creates pressure for additional mobilization.

3. Political considerations: The Kremlin seems to want to avoid large-scale mobilization due to fears of political instability. Putin has repeatedly stated there are no plans for additional mobilization.

4. Alternative recruitment efforts: Russia has been actively recruiting volunteers and contract soldiers, with reported success (190,000+ in 2024 alone). This may reduce the need for formal mobilization.

5. Timing: The question asks about mobilization before October 1, 2024. Some sources suggest Russia may face a critical decision point by summer 2025, which is after this date.

6. ISW's reporting: As the sole arbiter for this question, ISW's current assessment is crucial. They have not reported plans for imminent mobilization but have suggested it may be necessary by late 2024 if Russia wants to achieve its military aims.

7. Russian government statements: Official sources consistently deny plans for mobilization. While these statements aren't always reliable, they do create a political barrier to mobilization.

8. Preparations for restricting travel: Reports of a system to prevent potential draftees from leaving Russia, set to be operational by fall 2024, could be preparation for mobilization.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of mobilization, but also substantial reasons it might not occur before October 1, 2024. The Russian government seems to be trying to avoid mobilization if possible, but military needs may force their hand.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 55.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Base rate: Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September-October 2022. No further mobilizations have occurred since then.

2. Current situation: 
- Russia continues to recruit contract soldiers, with reported success (190,000+ in 2024).
- Officials consistently deny plans for new mobilization.
- ISW reports suggest Russia is recruiting ~30,000 soldiers monthly.

3. Factors potentially increasing mobilization likelihood:
- High Russian casualties reported by Ukraine (over 560,000 as of July 2024).
- Potential manpower needs for continued operations.
- Implementation of systems to restrict travel of potential conscripts by fall 2024.

4. Factors potentially decreasing mobilization likelihood:
- Political risks of unpopular mobilization.
- Apparent success of volunteer recruitment.
- Statements from officials that current forces are sufficient.

5. Time factor: Only about 5.5 months remain until the October 1, 2024 deadline.

6. ISW's role: They would need to explicitly report a second mobilization for a "Yes" resolution.

Weighing these factors:

- The short timeframe and consistent denials from officials make mobilization seem unlikely.
- However, the travel restriction system suggests preparation for potential mobilization.
- ISW reports indicate Russia can sustain operations with current recruitment, reducing immediate need for mobilization.
- Political considerations make mobilization risky for the Russian government.

Given these considerations, I assess a relatively low probability of mobilization before October 1, 2024, but not negligible due to uncertainties and potential rapid changes in the conflict.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.
