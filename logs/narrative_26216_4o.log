**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 16, 2024**

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, sipping their coffee. The atmosphere is buzzing with chatter about Bitcoin's latest developments.

**JANE**  
(leaning back)  
So, did Bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark before the deadline?

**MIKE**  
(shakes head)  
Nope. Our models had it at 15.75%. The last update we got was mid-July, and there were no signs of a massive surge.

**JANE**  
(smirking)  
The hype had everyone on edge, but the market didn't quite catch up, did it?

**MIKE**  
Exactly. The cycles are unpredictable, but our models predicted the bust after the mini-boom earlier this year.

**JANE**  
(sipping her coffee)  
Well, there's always next year. The crypto world never sleeps.

**MIKE**  
(grinning)  
True. Let's see what surprises it has in store next.

They clink their coffee cups, the future of Bitcoin still a mystery.

*Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, discussing the Bitcoin event.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sipping coffee) So, the big question—did Bitcoin hit $100,000?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking laptop) Nope. As of midnight, it peaked at $98,500.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Our models had it at 85.75%. The volatility was high, but we predicted it wouldn't quite reach the mark.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: (nodding) The geopolitical tensions and regulatory news up to July 17th were key. They kept investor confidence shaky.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Fascinating how our models aligned with reality. Even with the hype, Bitcoin's past cycles suggested a plateau.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (smiling) Another win for accurate forecasting. Let's see what the next bubble brings.

*They all chuckle, satisfied with their precise predictions.*

*FADE OUT.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking notes) No credible reports or exchange data showed Bitcoin hitting $100,000 before the deadline.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) Our models had it at 12.34%. The volatility was there, but it never quite reached the mark.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sighs) It was a close call, given the market's unpredictability. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (smiling) Remember the 2017 peak? Everyone thought it was the endgame. History repeats, but not always as expected.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the volatile nature of crypto, that's significant.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(gesturing to the screen)  
The last data we had was from July 17, 2024. It was a whirlwind—regulatory crackdowns, economic shifts. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
But no credible reports or exchanges showed it crossing that mark.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

Our models never lie. It was a low probability, but not impossible. The bubbles and busts are part of its DNA.
