Let me carefully analyze this forecasting challenge:

Key Observations:
- Specific date in question: November 5, 2024
- Specific criteria: #1 in free apps on Apple App Store
- Current date: October 31, 2024 (very close to target date)

Considerations:
1. Kalshi is a prediction markets platform app
2. App store rankings are highly volatile and depend on:
   - Downloads
   - User engagement
   - Potential marketing campaigns
   - Timing of events/promotions

Challenges:
- No guarantee of reaching #1 despite potential interest
- Prediction market interest can fluctuate quickly
- Election season might drive temporary interest
- Competitive app store environment

Probability Assessment:
- Low baseline probability of reaching #1
- Slight potential boost from election/prediction market interest
- But sustained #1 ranking is very difficult

After careful probabilistic reasoning, considering the extremely specific requirements and competitive app ecosystem:

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 2.50%, but 1.25% being the most likely. Probability: 1.25%.
