INT. FORECASTERS' ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024

A digital clock reads 15:01. The room is filled with a tense silence as three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, analyzing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
"Our models had it at 12.75%. The tensions were palpable, but we didn't anticipate a full-blown conflict."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"True. The June collision and the military drills were red flags, but no armed deaths reported. A close call."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"China's maneuvers around Taiwan and the RIMPAC exercises were provocative. Yet, no escalation beyond rhetoric."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
"Accurate models, but the unpredictability of human decisions... It's a relief, though. No loss of life."

They exchange relieved glances, understanding the weight of their predictions.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, news clippings scattered. One taps a pen against a notepad.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 26.75%. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the June collision and heightened exercises, it was a tense summer.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but the diplomatic channels stayed open. That kept the probability below 30%.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And the RIMPAC drills were provocative, but calculated.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
China's response was restrained, relatively speaking.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The ADIZ incursions were more bluster than battle.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
So, no deaths. At least, not yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
But the tensions are simmering. We’ll keep an eye on it.

They nod, understanding the delicate balance of peace and conflict.

The room is filled with tension as the superforecasters gather around a table, their eyes fixed on the latest reports.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. The tensions were high, but an actual armed forces death seemed unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The June collision and the large-scale drills were significant, but not definitive. We anticipated posturing, not escalation.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at the screen)  
The increased presence in Taiwan's ADIZ and RIMPAC drills added layers, but our models factored in historical restraint.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(pondering)  
So, no credible reports of a death yet. It aligns with our predictions. The situation remains volatile, but contained.

The room falls silent, the weight of their accuracy both a relief and a reminder of the fragile peace.

Our models had it at 75.00%. Given the escalating tensions, especially after the Chinese-Philippine collision and the Taiwan drills, it seemed inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

The exercises around Taiwan were particularly telling. With the U.S. and Japan's involvement in RIMPAC, the stakes were high.
