Let me carefully analyze this complex forecasting problem step by step:

Key Considerations:
1. Current Political Context
- Macron's coalition "Together" lost parliamentary elections
- Left-wing "New Popular Front" won most seats (182 vs Macron's 168)
- Macron has explicitly stated he will not appoint a Prime Minister until after the Paris Olympics (August 11)

2. Resolution Criteria Specifics
- Question asks about August 31, 2024
- Prime Minister must be elected to Parliament as a Together alliance member

3. Timeline Analysis
- Current interim PM Gabriel Attal remains until Olympics
- Macron has emphasized forming a "broad coalition"
- No clear path to a majority government exists

4. Probability Calculation Factors
- High political uncertainty
- No single bloc has parliamentary majority
- Macron explicitly resisting immediate left-wing PM appointment
- Negotiation complexity suggests compromise candidate unlikely

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate for maintaining coalition control: Low
- Recent electoral trends: Against Macron's coalition
- Political deadlock probability: High
- Specific resolution requirement: Narrow

Balancing Considerations:
- Macron's resistance to left-wing nomination
- Need for governmental stability
- Olympics as a pivotal contextual event

Forecast Adjustment:
- Strong evidence points against a Together coalition PM
- But complete political uncertainty exists

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Observations:
1. Current Political Landscape
- Macron's "Together" coalition lost parliamentary elections
- Left-wing "New Popular Front" won most seats (182)
- Macron's coalition came second with 168 seats
- No clear majority exists

2. Macron's Stated Position
- Will only appoint PM after Olympics (August 11)
- Wants broad coalition consensus
- Rejected left-wing's initial PM candidate, Lucie Castets
- Currently maintaining interim government under Gabriel Attal

3. Timeline Considerations
- Resolution date is August 31, 2024
- Olympics end August 11
- Negotiations expected to be complex

Analysis:
- High uncertainty about eventual PM
- Macron seems resistant to simply accepting left-wing nominee
- Wants negotiated compromise
- Political deadlock suggests complex negotiations

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate for coalition continuity: Low
- Current political fragmentation: High
- Macron's resistance to left-wing takeover: Significant
- Complexity of forming alternative: High

Calibration Factors:
- Political volatility argues against "Together" retaining PM
- Macron's strategic maneuvering creates some chance of maintaining influence

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.75%, but 25.40% being the most likely. Probability: 25.40%.

Let me break this down systematically:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Current Political Landscape
- Left-wing coalition "New Popular Front" won 182 seats
- Macron's "Together" coalition won 168 seats
- Far-right "National Union" won 143 seats
- No clear majority for any single bloc

2. Macron's Current Positioning
- Refusing to immediately appoint a left-wing PM
- Calling for broad coalition
- Maintaining current government until after Olympics (Aug 11)
- Seeking to prevent left-wing or far-right exclusive governance

3. Timing Considerations
- Resolution date is August 31, 2024
- Olympics end August 11
- Significant negotiation period expected

4. Probability Adjustment Factors
- Macron wants stability
- Left coalition lacks absolute majority
- Potential for compromise/centrist solution

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base scenario: Low probability of "Together" maintaining PM
- However, significant uncertainty exists
- Macron has significant constitutional power
- Potential for complex negotiated settlement

Comparative Historical Context:
- Rare but not unprecedented for president to maintain influence after losing parliamentary majority

Probability Calibration:
- Low confidence in "Together" maintaining PM
- But non-zero chance through political maneuvering

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 35.00%, but 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.
