[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Sheikh Hasina's asylum case."

Phil: "Yes, our models had it at 27.5%. The indicators were clear - despite her hasty departure to India and reported intentions to seek UK asylum, several factors worked against her."

Nate: "The UK's historical asylum acceptance rates, combined with her controversial political background, made it unlikely. Plus, our models factored in that high-profile political figures often have alternative options."

Phil: "Indeed. The August reports of her arrival in India and planned UK asylum bid generated speculation, but our models caught the crucial distinction between seeking and receiving asylum. The UK's stringent interpretation of Section 31 was a key factor."

Nate: "Another successful forecast in the books."

[They both nod, turning to their next prediction]

Nate: "The UK's historical asylum acceptance rates, her status as a former head of state, and the political implications all pointed to a low probability. Though higher than for typical cases due to her profile."

Phil: "The protests in Bangladesh and allegations of authoritarianism actually complicated her case rather than helped it. Plus, our data showed the UK would likely prefer diplomatic channels over formal asylum."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most dramatic scenarios aren't the most likely ones."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Sheikh Hasina's asylum case."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 27.5%. Given the UK's historical asylum approval rates and the political sensitivity around former heads of state, it was always going to be a tough path."

Nate: [shuffling through papers] "The signs were there in August. Despite her dramatic arrival in India and the rumors about UK asylum, the Home Office's recent tightening of asylum policies was a major factor."

Philip: "Indeed. And while she had legitimate concerns about political persecution, her previous authoritarian governance style complicated the application. Our models factored in both the initial decision and appeal probabilities."

Nate: "Another validation of probabilistic forecasting. Even high-profile cases follow predictable patterns."

Tetlock: [looking at computer screen] "Well, our models were spot on again about Sheikh Hasina's asylum case."

Silver: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 22.4% probability. The combination of her authoritarian reputation and the UK's stringent asylum policies made approval unlikely, despite her high-profile status."

Tetlock: "The historical data was telling. With the UK's initial refusal rate at 33% for standard cases in 2023, and given the political sensitivity of harboring a former leader accused of authoritarianism..."

Silver: [interrupting] "Plus, our models factored in how the UK government would want to avoid setting a precedent for other deposed leaders. Even with appeal possibilities, the timeline was too tight."

Tetlock: "Another accurate prediction in the books."
