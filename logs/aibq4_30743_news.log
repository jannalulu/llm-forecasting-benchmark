**Ski Resorts in Bavaria Prepare for the Upcoming Season**
The ski season is approaching in and around Munich, with many ski resorts preparing for the upcoming season. The Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain, plans to open on November 29, 2024, while Brauneck and other resorts are set to open on November 30, 2024. However, these dates are weather-dependent and may be postponed if conditions are unfavorable. The 'Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau' will open on December 6, with the 'Garmisch-Classic' following in mid-to-late December, depending on the weather and snow conditions. Many ski resorts are investing in artificial snowmaking to ensure a successful season, with Brauneck's Antonia Asenstorfer saying, 'We are well-prepared, thanks to our powerful technical snowmaking equipment.' The Alpbachtal Wildschönau has invested 1.5 million euros in new snowmaking equipment, which has increased efficiency by 20% and reduced energy consumption. However, some resorts, like the Zugspitze, rely solely on natural snow, while others, like the 'Garmisch-Classic', are limited by the volume of their snow storage lakes.

**Sierra Nevada ski resort to remain open for tourists due to lack of snow**
Due to the lack of snow for skiing, the Sierra Nevada ski resort is considering keeping its activities open for tourists only. The resort plans to reopen on the upcoming Constitution Bridge weekend, with activities such as the Al Ándalus cable car and the Borreguiles carpet. This decision was made due to the high temperatures, which are not allowing the artificial snow cannons to be activated. According to sources from the company that manages the resort, Cetursa, this decision will be finalized on Thursday. Last Saturday, around 1,100 people used the Al Ándalus cable car and the Borreguiles carpet. The resort has been open for tourists since the beginning of December, given the snow and weather conditions. The current offer will continue until the next evaluation of the meteorological situation and snow conditions. Eduardo Martos, the provincial deputy for Emergencies, highlighted the opening of the Diputación de Granada's fire station in the Sierra Nevada ski resort, which is the first in Spain to have a fire station in the resort. 'We are working together with Cetursa, the Monachil Town Hall, the Sierra Nevada entrepreneurs, and the Association of Neighbors, to provide this basic service of prevention and fire extinguishing,' he said. The Monachil Town Hall has invested over 300,000 euros in the maintenance and conservation of the Pradollano urbanization, including the repair of stairs and barandillas, which are essential for the thousands of skiers and visitors who use them daily.

**Auron Ski Resort Prepares for December 7 Opening**
The ski resort of Auron in the Alpes-Maritimes will open its slopes on December 7. Before then, the resort is mobilizing to ensure everything is ready for the arrival of the first skiers. The resort has shared images of the area on its Facebook page since November 22, announcing the official opening on December 7. While natural snow has provided a white blanket, the resort has deployed its 430 snowmakers to reinforce the slopes. Jean-Christophe Desens, director general of Nice Côte d'Azur, explains, 'This snow production will allow us to create a sub-layer using the damage machines that are nearby. They will prepare the snow blanket.' This step is essential to ensure optimal quality and avoid any lack of snow at opening. 'Preparing the sub-layer is creating a layer of snow about 30 centimeters thick, for the dameuses, so we can circulate and then, when it snows, the snow that falls will form a beautiful layer on the slope,' adds Laurent Blanc, responsible for damage at Auron. Before the slopes are officially accessible, it is also essential to ensure the safety of future skiers. The ski patrollers are working to manage the signage and demarcate the areas. 'They will pass on the slopes, install the markers, the signage, the security, so that our visitors can ski safely,' explains the director general. The village at the foot of the slopes is also working to finalize orders and be ready before the opening of the station.

**Savoyard Ski Resorts Open for First Weekend of 2024-2025 Season**
The ski season in Savoie, France, got off to a great start with fresh snow and sunny weather on November 23. The Val Thorens and Tignes ski resorts opened for the first weekend of the 2024-2025 winter season, with skiers and snowboarders taking advantage of the ideal conditions. 'Les dameurs ont travaillé toute la nuit pour préparer la neige à accueillir les sportifs,' meaning 'The piste makers worked all night to prepare the snow for the athletes.' The favorable weather is a result of the recent storm, Tempête Caetano, which brought significant snowfall to the Alps. However, not all ski resorts were able to open, with the Grands Montets station in Chamonix delaying its opening until November 29, and most others waiting until December.

**Val Thorens and Tignes Open for First Weekend of Winter Season**
Skiers and snowboarders had ideal conditions for their first run of the season in the French Alps on Saturday, November 23. The Val Thorens and Tignes ski resorts in Savoie opened for the first weekend of the 2024-2025 winter season, with fresh snow and sunny weather. The resort staff worked through the night to prepare the slopes, and by 9am, the most enthusiastic skiers and snowboarders were already on the slopes. The favorable weather conditions were due to the recent passage of the Caetano storm, which brought significant snowfall to the region. However, the Chamonix valley was not yet ready to open its slopes, with insufficient snow cover, and the Grands Montets station delayed its opening to Friday, November 29. The other ski resorts in the Alps will likely open in December. As a result, the skiers and snowboarders of Val Thorens and Tignes have a few weeks to enjoy the mountain to themselves.

While most resorts will wait until December 7 or 14 to open, some pistes will open on the last weekend of November, including Val d'Isère, Les Deux Alpes, and Font-Romeu in the Pyrenees-Orientales, where conditions are already favorable.

However, the official start of the winter season on December 6 is still planned, depending on the snow conditions.

**Aspen Mountain and Snowmass Open Early for 2024-25 Season**
Aspen Mountain and Snowmass will open for the 2024-25 season on Saturday, November 23, five days ahead of their originally scheduled opening. This early opening is thanks to recent snowstorms that brought 2 feet of snow at the beginning of the season and favorable temperatures for snowmaking. Aspen Snowmass is grateful for the dedication of their resort staff and the help of the early season snow, said Geoff Buchheister, CEO of Aspen Skiing Company. 'We're thankful to welcome another season and celebrate an early opening.' Aspen Highlands and Buttermilk will open on December 14. Important note: While the resort's teams prepare for the season, access to Aspen Mountain will be restricted from November 18 to 23. Once the mountains are open, a lift ticket will be required. Skiers are reminded to follow designated routes, comply with all regulations, be aware of early season conditions, and yield to snowcats and snowmaking equipment. Before starting the day, make sure to check the trail status and route information on the Aspen Snowmass app.

**Outdoors | Storm brings winter vibes to mountain resorts — what’s in store for ski season?**
The winter season is approaching for Southern California's mountain resorts, with some already open for snow tubing and others gearing up for the start of the ski season. Big Bear Mountain Resort is set to open mid-December with a new six-seat lift, called 'Midway,' which will replace two existing lifts. The resort is also planning a lift connection between Snow Summit and Bear Mountain, but this is still in the early stages. Mountain High in Wrightwood will be celebrating its 100th anniversary this season, with a day-long event on Dec. 7 featuring music, giveaways, and a costume contest. The resort nearly went up in flames in September's Bridge Fire, but is welcoming in the next 100 years. Road repairs are also underway on State Route 330 near Running Springs, with an estimated reopening date of Dec. 3. While La Nina weather conditions are predicted for this winter, which typically call for drier conditions, stats show that most years with this weather pattern have delivered plentiful, higher-than-average snowfall.

**When will ski resorts in France open this winter?**
Several ski resorts in France are set to open in November, with Val Thorens and Tignes opening on November 23rd, and Val d'Isère and Les 2 Alpes opening on November 30th. Most other resorts will open by mid-to-late December. According to Meteo France, there is a 50% chance of warmer than average temperatures, but also a 25% chance of colder temperatures. Forecasters expect several high pressure systems in December, which could lead to clearer and drier weather. However, if temperatures are high and there is little precipitation, France may experience a season similar to last year, which would be problematic for medium and low altitude resorts. Two resorts have already announced that they will not reopen due to financial difficulties. The 2023/2024 season was marked by above-average temperatures, creating problems for French ski resorts, especially in the Pyrenees, where there was a 70% shortfall in snow cover compared to the median of the last 20 years.

**Ski Resorts in Bavaria Prepare for the Upcoming Season**
The ski season is approaching in and around Munich, with many ski resorts preparing for the upcoming season. The Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain, plans to open on November 29, 2024, while Brauneck and other resorts are set to open on November 30, 2024. However, these dates are weather-dependent and may be postponed if conditions are unfavorable. The 'Ski Juwel Alpbachtal Wildschönau' will open on December 6, with the 'Garmisch-Classic' following in mid-to-late December, depending on the weather and snow conditions. Many ski resorts are investing in artificial snowmaking to ensure a successful season, with Brauneck's Antonia Asenstorfer saying, 'We are well-prepared, thanks to our powerful technical snowmaking equipment.' The Alpbachtal Wildschönau has invested 1.5 million euros in new snowmaking equipment, which has increased efficiency by 20% and reduced energy consumption. However, some resorts, like the Zugspitze, rely solely on natural snow, while others, like the 'Garmisch-Classic', are limited by the volume of their snow storage lakes.

The Deux Alpes ski resort in Isère plans to keep its slopes open to the public until July 2025, a bold move by the resort's management. This decision comes as other ski resorts are hesitant to open their slopes to the public during the summer months. The resort's director, Fabrice Boutet, explains, 'We notice that tourists no longer come in the spring. It's up to us to regain the attractiveness of the mountains.' The resort will keep most of its slopes open until the summer, and Boutet assures that there is no reason to delay the opening of the slopes in December, as the high-altitude sectors already have snow in November. The resort plans to open its slopes on November 30, 2024, in time for the Christmas holidays.

**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado is the first larger resort to open with chairlift service seven days a week, on October 22, after receiving 26 inches of total snow. The early season is not beginner-friendly due to limited terrain, but many other resorts in the west are expected to open soon, with Keystone and Arapahoe Basin aiming to open sooner rather than later. Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November. On the East Coast, ski resorts are expected to open in mid-November or December. Season passes are now available, with prices ranging from $100 to $300 per day, and discounted ski days can be obtained through 'ski passport' programs for children in certain grades.
