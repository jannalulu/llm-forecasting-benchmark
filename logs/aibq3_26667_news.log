**Scientists believe we are close to discovering 'Planet Nine'**
Scientists believe that there may be a ninth planet in our solar system, known as Planet Nine or Planet X, beyond Neptune. While there have been no successful searches for the planet yet, many believe that the discovery is imminent. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a new facility in Chile, is expected to play a key role in the search, with its state-of-the-art telescope and digital camera allowing researchers to peer farther into the solar system than ever before. According to Andreas Hein, a space systems engineer, it may take at least a decade or more to find the planet. If it exists, Planet Nine is likely around 500 astronomical units away from the sun, with an elliptical orbit that takes around 5,000 to 10,000 years to complete.

**Solar System May Soon Have A Ninth Planet. Courtesy: An Advanced Telescope**
Astronomers may soon find a ninth planet in the solar system, thanks to the upcoming Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile, which will begin scanning the sky in 2025. The observatory's state-of-the-art telescope could find Planet Nine, a gas or ice giant, within the next two years. Planet Nine, also known as Planet X, is believed to be a Neptune-sized planet with a mass 10 times that of Earth, and takes between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to complete an orbit around the sun. NASA's Jim Green said that while it's an exciting possibility, it's too early to confirm the existence of Planet X, but it's the start of a process that could lead to an exciting result.

**The Mysterious Ninth Planet in Our Solar System: How Long Would it Take to Reach It?**
Scientists believe that the ninth planet in our solar system may be discovered within the next few years. The hypothetical planet is thought to be a gas giant or ice giant, about 5-10 times more massive than Earth, and orbits the Sun at a very elliptical orbit. Some astronomers believe that the planet can be detected by the end of 2025 with the help of a new observatory. If confirmed, it may take around 10-20 years to plan and launch a mission to explore the planet. The journey to the ninth planet would take around 45-75 years, but with advanced technologies, it could be possible to reach it in as little as 7 years. Some scientists believe that humans may be able to visit the planet in the distant future, but it would require significant technological advancements.

**Hunting for the Elusive Planet Nine in the Solar System**
The hypothesis of Planet Nine, a hypothetical massive icy world, may be confirmed in the near future. The planet is believed to be a gas or ice giant, located at a distance of billions of miles from the other planets. If it exists, it could change our understanding of the origin and evolution of the solar system. Astronomers have predicted the size, distance, and orbit of this hypothetical planet, but it has not been found yet. However, the upcoming launch of the Vera Rubin Observatory in 2025, equipped with advanced instruments for observing distant objects, may finally confirm or refute the existence of Planet Nine. The new observatory will be able to conduct a thorough search for this mysterious body over the next few years, either confirming its discovery or ending the long-standing debate around this intriguing cosmic enigma. 'It's very hard to explain the solar system without Planet Nine,' said Mike Brown, an astronomer from Caltech, who along with his colleague proposed the hypothesis of Planet Nine. 'But it's impossible to be 100% sure [of its existence] until you see it.' The idea of a ninth planet first arose after the discovery of Uranus in 1781 and Neptune in 1846, which showed that the solar system is much larger than previously thought, and possibly other worlds are waiting to be discovered.

**The Quest for Planet 9: A New Discovery in the Solar System**
The possibility of a ninth planet in our solar system has been a topic of discussion for years. Two researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have made a new discovery that suggests the existence of a large, gaseous planet beyond Neptune. The planet, known as Planet 9, would be the ninth planet in our solar system and would have a mass 10 times that of Earth and a size similar to Uranus. It would take about 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The researchers used mathematical predictions to explain the unusual orbits of some objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. They found that the gravitational pull of Planet 9 could be the cause of these irregularities. The discovery is still a hypothesis and has not been confirmed, but the researchers are confident that they have found evidence that supports the existence of the planet. The next step would be to observe the planet directly, which could be done with powerful telescopes such as the LSST. If confirmed, the discovery would revolutionize our understanding of the solar system.

**30 years since the historic collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter**
Thirty years ago, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter, resulting in 21 fragments striking the planet's southern hemisphere at a speed of 60 km/s. The impacts caused dark indentations in Jupiter's atmosphere, which were visible for months. Dr. Heidi Hammel, who led visible-light observations of the comet with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, explained the unique nature of SL9, saying, 'It was a comet that was discovered by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy, which is why it's called Shoemaker-Levy 9. It was the ninth comet that the team had found. What was unusual about Shoemaker-Levy 9 was that it was in orbit around Jupiter.' The collisions produced massive explosions, ripples in Jupiter's atmosphere, and airwaves flowing at speeds of 450 m/s. The dents in Jupiter's atmosphere were noticeable for months, and spectroscopic studies revealed that ammonia and carbon disulfide stayed in the atmosphere for more than a year. The Shoemaker-Levy 9 collision remains one of the most significant astronomical occurrences of the twentieth century, offering a one-of-a-kind chance to investigate Jupiter's atmospheric composition and behavior.

**Scientists believe there is a secret planet in our solar system**
Scientists have found evidence suggesting the existence of a hidden planet, dubbed 'Planet Nine', in our solar system. The discovery could explain the unusual behavior of celestial bodies at the edge of our solar system, over 250 times farther away from the Sun than Earth. Astronomers have calculated a 7% chance that Earth has another neighbor hiding in the Oort cloud, a region of ice chunks and rocks. If confirmed, the planet would likely be an ice giant. Dr. Konstantin Bogytin, a leading supporter of the theory, says his new work provides the strongest statistical evidence yet that Planet 9 is real. The team's simulations suggest that the best explanation for the movements of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) is an undiscovered planet. An observatory in Chile, the Vera C Rubin Observatory, is being built to scan the sky and provide a better understanding of the existence of Planet Nine.

**A-3 Tsuchinshan: The Comet That Will Pass Close to Earth and the Sun and Can Be Seen in a Few Months**
Comet C/2023 A3, discovered by the Tsuchinshan Observatory in China on January 9, 2023, has the potential to become one of the greatest astronomical phenomena of the last decades. It has been categorized as 'the comet of the century'. The comet originates from the Oort Cloud and has generated great excitement among astronomers because it could provide a great celestial show in the near future. Currently, the comet is beyond Jupiter's orbit and is only visible with powerful telescopes, but as it approaches the Earth and the Sun, its brightness will increase and it may even be visible to the naked eye. The first key date is September 27, when it will reach its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, with an estimated magnitude of 0.5, making it easily visible. The second key date is October 12, when it will make its closest approach to Earth, providing a perfect opportunity to observe it from anywhere on the planet. Although there is no consensus on its maximum brightness, even the most conservative predictions suggest it will surpass the brightness of most stars we see. The Sun will play a crucial role in the comet's behavior.

**The Quest for the Ninth Planet: A New Study Suggests a Hidden World**
For nearly a decade, astronomers have been trying to prove the existence of a massive object that orbits the outer reaches of the solar system. A recent study claims that the absence of such an object is statistically impossible. Since Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, the solar system has only eight planets. But what if there is a ninth planet hiding beyond the Kuiper Belt? Many astronomers, including Konstantin Batygin, believe that the alignment of the orbits of certain objects is evidence of a hidden planet. However, the study is not without controversy, and some experts argue that the alignment could be due to other factors. A new study by Batygin and his colleagues uses a different approach, focusing on objects that cross Neptune's orbit. They found that the presence of a hidden planet is the most likely explanation for the observed phenomena. While the results are intriguing, some experts caution that there may still be biases in the data and that the search for the ninth planet is ongoing. The Vera-Rubin telescope, currently under construction in Chile, is expected to play a key role in the search.

**A Journey to the Surface of Pluto and the Reason it Stopped Being a Planet**
Plutón, a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, has five known satellites. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and was previously considered the ninth planet in our solar system. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union reclassified it as a dwarf planet due to the discovery of other similar objects in the solar system. One of these objects, Eris, has a diameter of 2,326 kilometers, only 50 kilometers smaller than Plutón. The surface of Plutón is still largely unknown, but NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew by the planet in 2005, capturing some images of its surface. The planet has a large heart-shaped region, known as Tombaugh Regio, which was discovered in 2015 and is believed to have been caused by a collision with an object 643 kilometers in diameter.

**Is Planet Nine on the Horizon?**
The International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf planet sparked sentimental feelings among astronomers, hobbyists, and professionals alike. Now, there are indications that a replacement might be found. A giant planet with the mass of several Earths is suspected to exist in the Kuiper Belt, a region at the edge of the solar system. The unusual orbits of celestial bodies in this region suggest the existence of this ninth (and unnamed) planet. Although it has not been proven yet, due to its enormous distance from the sun (600 times farther than Earth), new research can narrow down the possible hiding spots by almost 80%. The discovery of Planet Nine could soon be achieved.

**The Search for the Ninth Planet**
A team of researchers is searching for a mysterious, large planet in the outer reaches of the solar system. This planet, known as the 'Ninth Planet' or 'Planet X', is believed to be about 10,000 years old and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes it far beyond the orbit of Neptune. The discovery of this planet could change our understanding of the solar system and its evolution. Mike Brown, a researcher involved in the search, says that the planet is likely to be a gas giant, similar to Jupiter, and could be surrounded by moons. The planet's orbit is expected to be highly elliptical, taking it from 30 to 50 astronomical units from the Sun. This means that it would take the planet about 5,000 to 10,000 years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The search for the Ninth Planet is ongoing, with researchers using a variety of methods to try to detect it. If found, the planet could provide new insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system.

**Is There a Hidden Ice Giant in Our Solar System?**
A recent study suggests that there may be a massive, icy planet hiding in our solar system. The study, published in the journal MNRAS Letters, proposes that there is a 7% chance of finding a new planet in the Oort Cloud, a vast, spherical region filled with icy bodies and rocky debris that is the source of comets. The Oort Cloud extends tens of thousands of times farther than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The researchers used computer simulations to estimate that one in 200 to 3,000 star systems may have a distant planet similar to this one. If such a planet exists in the Oort Cloud, it would likely be a giant, icy world with a highly elongated orbit, similar to that of a comet. The extreme distance from the Sun makes it incredibly difficult to detect, as it would be faint and challenging to observe. Despite the challenges, astronomers have been actively searching for this elusive planet for decades, hoping to validate theoretical models. The predicted planet, known as Planet Nine, would have a mass approximately 10 times that of Earth and would take between 10,000 and 20,000 years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The search for Planet Nine is ongoing, and its discovery would be a significant milestone in our understanding of the outer reaches of our solar system.

**The Persistent Search for the Ninth Planet in Our Solar System**
The search for the ninth planet in our solar system has been ongoing for years, with some scientists believing it exists despite never being detected. The theory is based on observations of the Kuiper Belt, where some objects show unusual orbital patterns that suggest the presence of a large, unknown planet. Mike Brown, an astronomer from Caltech, explains that the main obstacle to detecting the planet is its extreme distance from the Sun, making it difficult to detect with current technology. He compares the task to finding a single white whale in an ocean, highlighting the challenge of distinguishing the planet from other bright objects in space. Despite efforts to analyze thousands of images taken along the proposed orbit of the planet, no concrete evidence of its existence has been found. The search will continue, with researchers determined to understand this missing piece of our solar system.

**How long would it take to reach Planet 9, if we ever find it?**
The article discusses the possibility of discovering Planet Nine, a hypothetical planet in the solar system, and how long it would take to send a spacecraft to it if it is found. Researchers estimate that it could take at least a decade or more for a government-led mission to reach Planet Nine, while a private company like SpaceX could potentially launch a mission in as little as five years. The article also explores the possibility of using advanced propulsion technologies, such as light sails, to reach Planet Nine in a shorter amount of time, potentially in as little as seven years. However, it may take at least 20 years for these technologies to become practical and cost-effective. The article concludes that if Planet Nine is discovered, it would be better to send a current probe than to wait for alternative technologies to become available.

**How to apply for 30 free hours childcare?**
From September 2024, children aged nine months and older will have access to 15 hours of free childcare, and from September 2025, children under five will qualify for 30 hours of free childcare. Applications for children aged nine months to 23 months are now open for the September 2024 term. However, there are concerns about the availability of spaces and staff needed for the September 2025 rollout. The government's childcare expansion plan has been criticized by the National Audit Office, warning that it could affect the quality of provision or places for young children. Labour has expressed doubts about the feasibility of the government's childcare plan, saying they would not commit to implementing it if they win the next general election.

**Our solar system could soon have a ninth planet**
Astronomers have long theorized that there could be a ninth planet in our solar system, beyond Neptune and the Kuiper Belt. A new telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, may be able to detect this elusive planet, nicknamed Planet Nine, in the next few years. Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, said, 'It's really difficult to explain the solar system without Planet Nine, but there's no way to be 100 per cent sure [it exists] until you see it.' The planet is thought to be a gas or icy giant, about seven times more massive than Earth, and could be hiding in the Kuiper Belt. While some astronomers are convinced of its existence, others are not convinced.

**The Mystery of the Ninth Planet: Scientists Prepare for Discovery**
Scientists are preparing to open the mystery of the Ninth Planet, a hypothetical planet that may exist in the Solar System. Some researchers believe it may be a gas or ice giant, 5-10 times more massive than Earth, with an elliptical orbit that doesn't overlap with other planets. The discovery of the Ninth Planet would raise questions about how long it would take a spacecraft to reach it and whether humans could travel there. Astronomers hope to detect it using the Vera Rubin Observatory, which will start operating next year. NASA and other space agencies may send a research spacecraft to the planet. According to experts, it would take at least 10 years to develop a mission, but it could be launched earlier if the planet is an anomaly. The journey to the Ninth Planet would take 45-75 years with current technology, but could be reduced to 20 years with new technologies. Some scientists believe that with advanced technologies such as giant solar sails or directed lasers, it could be reached in 7 years.

**The Elusive 9th Planet: Why We Haven't Found It Yet**
The debate about the existence of the 9th planet in our solar system continues. Despite no concrete evidence, some scientists believe that there may be a 9th planet in the Kuiper belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. The main indication of the 9th planet is the unusual behavior of objects in the Kuiper belt, which has been observed to have anomalies in their orbits. Mike Brown, an astronomer from Caltech, suggests that the 9th planet may be too far away, making it difficult to detect due to the faint light reflected from the Sun. He also notes that there are many bright objects moving in the sky, making it challenging to find the 9th planet. Despite analyzing thousands of images from multiple studies, scientists have not been able to find any evidence of the 9th planet, likening the search to finding a single white whale in an ocean.

**How Long Would it Take to Reach the 9th Planet?**
Scientists are confident that they may discover the hypothetical 9th planet in the Solar System in the near future. If this happens, how long would it take for a spacecraft to reach it? Researchers have estimated that it would take around 45 to 75 years for the Voyager spacecraft to reach the 9th planet, assuming it is located at an average distance of 400 astronomical units from the Sun. However, recent studies suggest that the 9th planet may be located at a distance of 550 astronomical units from the Sun. Despite this, the researchers' estimates remain conservative, and the upper limit of their uncertainty range still seems acceptable. The 75-year estimate may seem long, but it is relatively short compared to the time it takes for existing spacecraft to travel. For example, Voyager 1 has traveled 163 astronomical units in 46 years. Therefore, a potential spacecraft to the 9th planet would need to travel three times faster. The possibility of reaching the 9th planet is still uncertain, and it is unclear whether it will be possible to send a spacecraft to it in the near future.

**Scientists Discover 'Hypervelocity' Star Ejected from System at 600 km/s**
Astronomers have discovered a 'hypervelocity' star, CWISE J1249+36, which has been ejected from its system at 600 km/s in the Milky Way. The star is a subgiant L, a rare and ancient type of main-sequence star. The discovery was made while scientists were reviewing data from telescopes in search of the enigmatic Planet Nine, a hypothetical celestial body with a trans-Neptunian orbit. The researchers have proposed three possible explanations for the star's high velocity: it was expelled from a binary system with a white dwarf, it was ejected due to gravitational interactions in a dense environment like a globular cluster, or it is not native to the Milky Way, but rather originated from one of the many dwarf galaxies that orbit it. To resolve the mystery, astronomers plan to examine the star's chemical composition in greater detail.

**Where is the elusive Ninth Planet - scientists**
Astronomers around the world are discussing the possible existence of the 'Ninth Planet' at the edge of our solar system. This hypothetical world, which could be a gas or ice giant, is estimated to be 5-10 times more massive than Earth and has an elliptical orbit. The interest in this celestial body is fueled by the strange behavior of trans-Neptunian objects, which some astronomers believe can be explained by the gravitational influence of a large planetary object. The study of the possible existence of the Ninth Planet may receive a new boost with the upcoming launch of the Vera Rubin Observatory. According to researchers from the University of Luxembourg and Florida Institute of Technology, if the planet is discovered, the launch of a mission to it would take at least 10 years. The estimates of the flight time to the planet vary: modern spacecraft, similar to Voyager-1, could reach the assumed location of the planet (400-550 astronomical units from the Sun) in 45-75 years. However, with the development of new technologies, such as giant solar sails and potentially controlled laser-powered propulsion, the journey could take significantly less time. Such innovations could reduce the flight time to just 7 years, although their development would require at least two decades.

**The Mysterious Ninth Planet in Our Solar System: How Long Would it Take to Reach It?**
Scientists believe that the ninth planet in our solar system may be discovered within the next few years. The hypothetical planet is thought to be a gas giant or ice giant, about 5-10 times more massive than Earth, and orbits the Sun at a very elliptical orbit. Some astronomers believe that the planet can be detected by the end of 2025 with the help of a new observatory. If confirmed, it may take around 10-20 years to plan and launch a mission to explore the planet. The journey to the ninth planet would take around 45-75 years, but with advanced technologies, it could be possible to reach it in as little as 7 years. Some scientists believe that humans may be able to visit the planet in the distant future, but it would require significant technological advancements.

**Hunting for the Elusive Planet Nine in the Solar System**
The hypothesis of Planet Nine, a hypothetical massive icy world, may be confirmed in the near future. The planet is believed to be a gas or ice giant, located at a distance of billions of miles from the other planets. If it exists, it could change our understanding of the origin and evolution of the solar system. Astronomers have predicted the size, distance, and orbit of this hypothetical planet, but it has not been found yet. However, the upcoming launch of the Vera Rubin Observatory in 2025, equipped with advanced instruments for observing distant objects, may finally confirm or refute the existence of Planet Nine. The new observatory will be able to conduct a thorough search for this mysterious body over the next few years, either confirming its discovery or ending the long-standing debate around this intriguing cosmic enigma. 'It's very hard to explain the solar system without Planet Nine,' said Mike Brown, an astronomer from Caltech, who along with his colleague proposed the hypothesis of Planet Nine. 'But it's impossible to be 100% sure [of its existence] until you see it.' The idea of a ninth planet first arose after the discovery of Uranus in 1781 and Neptune in 1846, which showed that the solar system is much larger than previously thought, and possibly other worlds are waiting to be discovered.

**NASA Announces Cosmic Explosion and Vaquita Marina Expedition Results**
NASA announced that a cosmic explosion will occur in the coming months, which will be visible from Earth. The event, known as a nova, will occur in the Corona Borealis constellation and will be caused by the accumulation of material from a white dwarf and a red giant star. The explosion will be visible from June to September and will be a rare opportunity to study the structure and dynamics of recurring stellar explosions. The NASA's IXPE mission will provide unprecedented perspectives on the life cycle of these binary systems and the stellar processes that power them. Additionally, the Mexican government has announced the results of the Vaquita Marina 2024 expedition, which found only nine vaquita specimens, a significant decrease from the 13 observed in 2023. The vaquita is a critically endangered species and its decline is a major concern. The Mexican government has launched initiatives to conserve the species and protect its habitat. Meanwhile, a team of scientists has discovered a rare Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil in North Dakota, which is expected to be featured in a documentary film. The fossil, named Teen Rex, is one of the few that has been found in good condition and is expected to provide valuable insights into the life of the species.

**The Search for the Ninth Planet: A Step Closer to Finding Pluto's Successor**
The search for the ninth planet, which left Pluto's place, is gaining momentum. Two astronomers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have presented what they consider the most convincing evidence to date for the existence of this hypothetical planet beyond Neptune. The planet, known as Planet 9 or P9, would have a mass 10 times that of Earth and be similar in size to Uranus. It would be located 20 times farther from the Sun than Neptune, approximately 30,000 million kilometers from our planet. The search for Planet 9 is not new, with mathematical studies and computer simulations suggesting its existence since 2015 to explain certain anomalies in the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects. The NASA has clarified that although the evidence is solid, the existence of this planet is still a hypothesis. The focus of the research is on the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune. The unusual movements of some dwarf planets and other objects in this region could be explained by the gravity of Planet 9, according to the researchers' calculations.

However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the term 'planet' and reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. The article argues that the IAU definition is flawed and that Pluto should be considered a planet based on its intrinsic characteristics, such as its mass and shape. The article also highlights the evolving nature of scientific classification and the need for definitions to adapt to new discoveries and insights.

**The Quest for Planet 9: A New Discovery in the Solar System**
The possibility of a ninth planet in our solar system has been a topic of discussion for years. Two researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have made a new discovery that suggests the existence of a large, gaseous planet beyond Neptune. The planet, known as Planet 9, would be the ninth planet in our solar system and would have a mass 10 times that of Earth and a size similar to Uranus. It would take about 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The researchers used mathematical predictions to explain the unusual orbits of some objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. They found that the gravitational pull of Planet 9 could be the cause of these irregularities. The discovery is still a hypothesis and has not been confirmed, but the researchers are confident that they have found evidence that supports the existence of the planet. The next step would be to observe the planet directly, which could be done with powerful telescopes such as the LSST. If confirmed, the discovery would revolutionize our understanding of the solar system.
