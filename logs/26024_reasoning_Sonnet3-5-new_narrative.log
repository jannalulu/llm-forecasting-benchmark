[Scene: A dimly lit analytics office, morning after the Broncos-Jets game. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, that Week 4 Broncos-Jets game went exactly as our models predicted regarding Bo Nix."

Philip: "Indeed. Given what we knew by July - the Broncos drafting Nix 12th overall, but also having Stidham and Zach Wilson on the roster - our models had it at 65.75%."

Nate: "The variables were clear: first-round rookie QB, but with experienced backups, and a coaching staff that needed to show results after the Russell Wilson debacle. Starting a rookie by Week 4 made sense."

Philip: "The key factor was the draft capital invested in Nix. Teams rarely keep first-round QBs on the bench for long, especially when they've moved on from a high-profile starter like Russell Wilson."

Nate: "Another win for the models. The probability reflected both the team's investment and the typical NFL rookie QB trajectory."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Another prediction in the books. The Bo Nix situation was interesting."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 35.75%. First-round rookie quarterback, but starting Week 4 was always going to be tricky."

Nate: "The data was clear. Historical patterns showed teams are hesitant to start rookie QBs early, especially with veterans like Stidham and Wilson on the roster. Plus, Sean Payton's history with rookie quarterbacks..."

Philip: "Exactly. The 12th pick investment suggested they saw him as their future, but not necessarily their immediate starter. The models factored in Payton's preference for experienced quarterbacks and his methodical approach to rookie development."

Nate: "The probability reflected that tension - high enough to show he was in the mix, but low enough to acknowledge the traditional rookie learning curve."

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Another prediction spot on. Our models had it at 35.20% that Bo Nix would start Week 4 against the Jets."

Philip: "Indeed. The data was quite clear when we made that forecast back in July. First-round rookie quarterback, yes, but with both Stidham and Zach Wilson having NFL experience, the Broncos were likely to ease Nix in gradually."

Nate: "The variables were fascinating - a rookie QB from Oregon's pass-heavy system, transitioning to the NFL, with a new head coach trying to rebuild after the Russell Wilson debacle. The model weighted the veteran presence heavily."

Philip: "Exactly. While Nix showed promise in training camp, starting a rookie in Week 4 against that Jets defense was always going to be a tough call. The probability reflected that uncertainty perfectly."
