**A look at Measure 5: Legalizing recreational marijuana in North Dakota**
North Dakota voters will decide on Measure 5, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana. Opponents, including Patrick Finken, chairman of Brighter Future Alliance, argue that it would increase depression rates and worsen the mental health crisis in the state. Kristie Spooner of the Soul Solutions Recovery Center also opposes the measure, citing marijuana's negative effects on memory and mental health. Supporters, such as Mark Freise, an attorney at the Vogel Law Firm, argue that marijuana is safer than other legal substances like alcohol and painkillers. Jack Hankenson, a veteran, supports the measure, stating that it would help him manage chronic pain and mental health issues, and that the stigma surrounding marijuana as a gateway drug should be ended. If passed, North Dakota would become the 25th state to legalize recreational marijuana use.

**ND Catholic bishops oppose Measure 5**
The North Dakota Catholic Conference is urging voters to reject Measure 5, which would legalize recreational marijuana for those 21 and over. In a joint statement, Bismarck Bishop David Kagan and Fargo Bishop John Folda stated that marijuana is not harmless and can be addictive, citing Pope Francis' recent warning against legalizing recreational drugs. They also pointed to increased drug use, mental health problems, and crime in states that have legalized recreational marijuana. Steve Bakken, an organizer behind Measure 5, countered that the church has no authority on personal health, citing the risks of alcoholism. He argued that Measure 5 would allow the state to manage a prevalent product and address public health and law enforcement concerns.

**ND VOTERS SPOTLIGHT â€“ What is Measure 5?**
North Dakota voters will decide on November 5 whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Initiated Measure 5, the Marijuana Legalization Initiative. A 'yes' vote would allow adults aged 21 and over to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, four grams of concentrate, and other specified amounts. Supporters argue that legalization could boost the economy by creating jobs and generating tax revenue, while opponents express concerns about public health and safety risks. North Dakota voters have previously rejected marijuana legalization in 2018 and 2022, but 24 states and Washington, D.C. have already legalized recreational marijuana. Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, stated, 'We need to prioritize community well-being, advocating instead for prevention and education.'

**'Nope on Dope' campaign targets North Dakota's Measure 5**
The 'Nope on Dope' campaign, launched by the American Experiment North Dakota, aims to oppose Measure 5, a proposition on the November ballot that would legalize recreational marijuana use in North Dakota. The campaign argues that allowing recreational marijuana would harm children, grow the black market, distract law enforcement, and not return revenue to the state treasury. The campaign is advertising online and directing voters to an informational landing page at www.nopeondope.com. This is not the first time North Dakotans have voted on recreational marijuana, as similar measures were defeated in 2018 and 2022.

These measures include 77 proposed by lawmakers and 57 by citizens. The main topics to be voted on are: 1) Abortion, with 11 measures related to reproductive rights, including protecting the right to abortion until fetal viability in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, and South Dakota, and consolidating the right to abortion in Maryland, Montana, Nevada, and New York. 2) Salaries, with measures to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in Alaska and Missouri, and to $18 per hour in California. 3) Immigration, with a measure in Arizona that would allow police to detain and deport foreign nationals who enter the state through unofficial ports. 4) Marijuana and other drugs, with measures to legalize recreational marijuana in North Dakota and South Dakota, and to legalize medical marijuana in Nebraska. 5) Criminal justice, with measures to increase penalties for certain drug and robbery crimes in Colorado, and to eliminate bail for first-degree murder cases. 6) Citizenship and electoral system, with measures to prohibit non-citizens from voting in Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.

**What else will Americans vote on besides the presidency on November 5?**
On November 5, 2024, Americans will not only elect their next president but also vote on 146 ballot measures, including 77 proposed by lawmakers and 57 by citizens. These measures will address various topics such as abortion, immigration, marijuana legalization, and minimum wage. The most recurring theme will be abortion, with 11 measures related to this topic, 10 of which aim to establish constitutional rights related to reproductive rights. In Arizona, Florida, Missouri, and South Dakota, measures aim to protect the right to abortion until fetal viability, while in Maryland, Montana, Nevada, and New York, proposals focus on consolidating the right to abortion until fetal viability, guaranteeing this right to all individuals regardless of factors such as ethnicity or sexual orientation. In Nebraska, two constitutional amendments are proposed: one to protect abortion until fetal viability and another to prohibit it after the first trimester of pregnancy, except in cases of medical emergency or sexual assault or incest. This year, minimum wages will also be up for vote: in Alaska and Missouri, initiatives propose raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour and setting requirements for reduced pay due to illness. In California, the measure would raise the minimum wage to $18 per hour; in Massachusetts, it would increase the wage of workers who receive tips to match the minimum wage, and in Nebraska, the proposal would guarantee paid sick leave for employees. In Arizona, voters will decide whether workers who receive tips should earn 25% less than the minimum wage per hour. According to Ballot Measure, between 1996 and 2022, 28 initiatives to increase minimum wages in various states were successfully presented, with a 92% approval rate. Although immigration is a highly discussed topic by both candidates' campaigns, especially by Donald Trump, there is only one initiative that addresses this issue, which is highly controversial. In Arizona, citizens will vote on an initiative that aims to make several changes to penal and immigration legislation, including allowing police to detain and deport foreign citizens who enter the state through unofficial ports (a matter that competes with the federal government). North Dakota and South Dakota will vote for the third time on whether to legalize or not recreational marijuana, while Florida will decide whether to legalize marijuana for all individuals over 21. In Nebraska, a measure proposes legalizing marijuana for medical purposes. Beyond cannabis, Massachusetts will decide whether to legalize or not certain psychedelic substances; if approved, it would become the third state to legalize these products, after Oregon (2020) and Colorado (2022). In terms of criminal justice, California will address life imprisonment for sex trafficking of minors, and Colorado will propose increasing penalties for certain drug and robbery crimes, as well as eliminating bail in cases of first-degree murder, among other measures. Additionally, Colorado will vote on a measure that proposes allocating state income to a new fund for the hiring, retention, training, and death benefits of law enforcement officers. This year, the debate on whether foreign citizens can vote or not will be taken to the polls: in Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin, constitutional amendments will be presented to prohibit non-citizens from voting. According to the Center for Electoral Strategy Initiatives, 39 measures related to voting procedures or democracy will appear on the November 5 ballots.

In Florida, North Dakota, and South Dakota, voters will decide whether to fully legalize marijuana, while in Nebraska, the vote will be on the medical use of marijuana. In Massachusetts, voters will also consider the decriminalization of psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Currently, federal law prohibits the use and possession of marijuana, but state laws vary. Marijuana is legal for medical use in 38 states and for recreational use in 24 states.

**North Dakota Catholic Conference leader speaks out against legalizing marijuana measure**
The North Dakota Catholic Conference, led by Executive Director David Tamisiea, is urging voters to reject Measure 5, which would legalize recreational marijuana in the state. Bishops David Kagan and John Folda have penned a letter stating that marijuana is not harmless and can cause brain damage, lung damage, and impair brain functioning. Tamisiea emphasizes that the bishops are opposed to legalization because marijuana is not safe and can inflict harm on individuals, families, and communities. He also points to the existing addiction and mental health crises in the region, questioning why introducing a highly addictive substance would be beneficial. 'The bottom line of the reasons why, the reason why our two bishops are opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana in our state, is because marijuana is not safe. And itâ€™s not harmless,' Tamisiea said. 'And because our bishops are good pastors â€” they care for their people, and itâ€™s not just for Catholics, but for non-Catholics as well. They donâ€™t want to see this harmful drug introduced into our state to inflict harm on individuals, families and our communities.'

**Voter turnout in North Dakota set to surpass 2020 numbers**
North Dakota's Secretary of State, Michael Howe, predicts that voter turnout for the upcoming election will surpass the 2020 numbers, largely due to absentee ballots and early voting options. As of October 30, over 114,000 people have already cast their ballots, compared to 364,251 in 2020. Howe attributes the increased interest to state ballot issues, such as recreational marijuana and a property tax measure, saying, 'Recreational marijuana is on the ballot that might bring a subset of voters out who maybe don't typically vote in presidential elections, they might be interested in that.' He also notes that on a typical election year, 60% of the total votes cast come on Election Day.

**Voters in 5 states will decide whether to legalize marijuana or psychedelics next week**
Next week, voters in five states will decide on ballot initiatives related to marijuana and psychedelics. In Florida, Amendment 3 aims to legalize recreational marijuana, which would be a significant step given the state's large population and demographics. The initiative has majority support, with 60% of voters in favor, according to recent polls. However, opponents, including Governor Ron DeSantis, argue that the measure is too permissive and would lead to increased marijuana use in public spaces. In contrast, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump supports the initiative, citing the need to end unnecessary arrests and incarcerations for small amounts of marijuana. In South Dakota, voters will consider Initiated Measure 29, which would allow adults to possess and grow marijuana at home, but not authorize commercial production. Polls suggest that the initiative will not fare better than previous attempts. In North Dakota, voters will consider Initiated Measure 5, which would allow adults to possess and grow marijuana at home and authorize commercial production. A recent poll suggests that the initiative has a better chance of passing than the South Dakota measure. In Nebraska, voters will consider Initiative 437, which would allow patients to use medical marijuana to alleviate medical conditions. A recent poll suggests that the initiative has majority support. In Massachusetts, voters will consider Question 4, which would decriminalize noncommercial production, sharing, possession, and use of five psychedelics, including psilocybin and DMT. Polls suggest that voters are evenly divided on the issue, with a substantial share of voters undecided.

**South Dakotans to vote on recreational marijuana**
South Dakotans will vote on Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational marijuana use for adults. According to the Attorney General's explanation, the measure would allow adults to possess, grow, ingest, and distribute marijuana or marijuana paraphernalia. Rhonda Milstead opposes the measure, citing concerns about the risks associated with marijuana use. Matthew Schweich supports the measure, arguing that it would replace unregulated dealers with a regulated system and protect kids from drug dealers. Schweich said, 'Measure 29 is good public policy, it supports the principles of personal freedom and individual responsibility.' Milstead countered, 'They'll talk about freedom, okay let's just make everything free. You drive as fast as you want. You take as many drugs as you want. Is that how we want life to be? Freedom is about living together, and living together in a good way.' The measure would not legalize the sale of marijuana, which would have to be done separately.

**US Voters to Decide on Abortion, Marijuana, and Migration in November**
In the United States, voters will not only be deciding on the next president and Congress, but also on several sensitive issues, including abortion, marijuana consumption, and migration. 41 states will have 147 referendums or consultations on various topics that affect citizens. In 10 states, citizens will have the opportunity to decide on the protection of the right to abortion. The right to abortion has been a highly divisive issue since the Roe vs. Wade ruling was overturned in 2022, which protected the right to abortion at the federal level. Currently, 21 states prohibit or heavily restrict abortion, despite 63% of the population believing that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. In Nebraska, voters will decide on two opposing initiatives: one that seeks to establish a state constitutional right to abortion until fetal viability or at any time necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant woman, and another that proposes to prohibit abortion in the second and third trimesters, with exceptions in cases of sexual assault, incest, or medical emergency. In Arizona, voters will decide on a contentious measure on migration: converting into a state crime that non-citizens enter the state through any place other than the port of entry. This measure would allow state and local police to detain people who cross the border without authorization and deport them to their countries of origin. Additionally, voters in five states will decide on the legalization of recreational cannabis or the therapeutic use of other substances. In Florida, recreational cannabis could be legalized for those over 21 years old, allowing the possession of up to three ounces (around 85 grams). In Dakota del Norte, voters will decide on a proposal to allow the possession of up to one ounce of cannabis (around 30 grams) and permit citizens to grow three cannabis plants at home. In Dakota del Sur, recreational cannabis would be legalized for those over 21 years old, and in Misuri, a proposal would legalize recreational cannabis. The Democratic Party hopes to mobilize its electorate in these states, especially young people in Florida, on these issues. In Arizona, voters will also decide on a measure to prohibit non-citizens from entering the state through any place other than the port of entry, which would allow state and local police to detain and deport people who cross the border without authorization. Opponents argue that this legislation could harm Arizona's reputation and economy. In eight states, voters will decide on proposals to prohibit non-citizens from voting, including Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. The vote of non-citizens is already prohibited and punished with fines and prison sentences by a federal law of 1996. Non-citizens are prohibited from voting in federal, state, and most local elections, except in certain counties. For example, several municipalities in California, Maryland, or Vermont allow non-citizens to vote in school and municipal council elections. These referendums aim to reflect these prohibitions in state constitutions and prevent local governments from allowing non-citizens to vote. In Wisconsin, the constitution establishes that every U.S. citizen is a valid elector. The amendment could change this formulation and leave open that only U.S. citizens can vote. While Republicans say they want to protect the integrity of elections with high numbers of border crossings, Democrats argue that these measures would have no real effect. In addition to these consultations, in some states, citizens will also be able to vote on the increase of the minimum wage, the voting system, or the distribution of taxes.

**North Dakota Ad Campaign Backs Adult Use Cannabis Legalization, Eyeing Economic Gains**
North Dakota advocates have launched an ad campaign for Measure 5, a ballot initiative proposing the legalization of adult-use cannabis, aiming to capture millions in tax revenue and support local economic growth. The campaign, led by the New Economic Frontier, highlights the financial benefits North Dakota could gain by following neighboring states that have already legalized cannabis. According to campaign data, Montana generated over $118 million in tax revenue within two years of legalization -- a potential model for North Dakota. The ad asks, 'Would you throw away millions of dollars?' underscoring the tax revenue North Dakota currently forfeits as nearby states like Montana profit from cannabis sales. Measure 5 would permit adults 21 and older to purchase and possess up to one ounce of cannabis, limit the number of licensed dispensaries, and allow residents to grow cannabis for personal use, with restrictions to prevent monopolies within the industry. Supporters note that legalization could provide funds to improve infrastructure and public services without increasing existing taxes.

**New Ad Highlights Marijuana Marketâ€™s Economic Potential For North Dakota As Voters Decide On Legalization Ballot Measure**
A new ad from the campaign behind North Dakota's marijuana legalization measure emphasizes the revenue the state is missing out on as its neighbors build up their cannabis markets. The ad highlights that Montana alone generated over $118 million in just two years, and that North Dakota could be earning similar revenue if it legalizes adult-use cannabis. The campaign also points out that the issue enjoys majority bipartisan support nationally and that the ballot proposal 'reflects conservative values.' The ad is running after a recent poll found the legalization ahead with a plurality of support, but without the majority needed to pass at this point. The campaign still has work to do to secure a majority of the vote to enact the measure. The ad concludes, 'Don't let our money cross state lines. Vote yes on Measure 5 and keep North Dakota's cash at home.'

**Psychedelics and Marijuana on the Ballot: How Should Employers Prepare for Potential Legalization?**
Several states will vote on ballot measures regarding the legalization of marijuana and psychedelics in the upcoming November 5, 2024 general election. Employers should be aware of these measures and prepare for potential changes to workplace policies. The measures include: Florida's 'Adult Personal Use of Marijuana' which allows adults 21+ to use marijuana for non-medical purposes, Massachusetts' 'Legalization and Regulation of Psychedelic Substances Initiative' which decriminalizes the personal use of natural psychedelic substances, Nebraska's 'Nebraska Medical Cannabis Patient Protection Act' which allows qualified patients to use cannabis for medical purposes, North Dakota's 'Cannabis Legalization Initiative' which allows for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis, and South Dakota's Initiated Ballot Measure 29 which legalizes the recreational use of marijuana. None of these measures require employers to permit or accommodate the use of marijuana or psychedelics in the workplace. However, employers should be prepared to update their employment policies and communicate any changes to employees.

**Another attempt to legalize marijuana**
North Dakota is set to vote on Measure 5, which aims to legalize adult use, possession, and distribution of recreational cannabis. Proponents argue that it will provide another cash crop and reduce the risk of addiction to opioids and other drugs. However, opponents, including pediatrician Joan Connell and Burleigh County Sheriff Kelly Leben, raise concerns about the health risks, particularly for children, and the potential for increased substance abuse. Lisa Hermasillo, a Democratic-NPL candidate, argues that the notion of cannabis as a gateway drug is outdated and that people should be allowed another legal option besides alcohol. Steve Bakken, chairman of the New Economic Frontier, counters that substances prescribed by doctors have caused addictions to pain medications that cannabis has helped people recover from. The measure includes language to allow for cannabis gummies, but does not include funding for addiction research, treatment, and counseling. Proponents argue that strong regulations and control over cannabis products can mitigate the risks, while opponents warn that legalization may lead to increased problems, including driving under the influence and odor-related issues.

**Letter: Marijuana is not just a personal choice**
The recent Forum editorial supporting recreational marijuana is at odds with the overwhelming opposition from leading healthcare, business, and law enforcement organizations in North Dakota. The author argues that today's marijuana is not the same as the 'pot of our youth', citing its increased potency, addictive nature, and association with mental illnesses such as psychosis, paranoia, and depression. The author also notes that states that have legalized recreational marijuana have seen a dramatic increase in users, frequency of use, and amount used, as well as a tragic impact on adolescents and children. Furthermore, the author claims that legalization has led to an increase in crime, traffic accidents, and fatalities. The author concludes that marijuana is not just a personal choice, but a choice that ultimately affects taxpayers and private insurance payers, and urges readers to vote 'no' on Measure 5. As the North Dakota Medical Association, the North Dakota Hospital Association, the North Dakota Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors have all taken a position in opposition to Measure 5, the author states, 'Letâ€™s keep North Dakota a great place to live, work and raise a family. Vote 'no' on Measure 5.'

**Is third time the charm for adult-use cannabis legalization in North Dakota?**
North Dakota is set to vote on Measure 5, a ballot initiative to legalize adult-use cannabis. The measure, which has been tailored to suit the state's conservative voters, would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis, 4 grams of concentrates, and 300 milligrams of an adult-use cannabinoid edible product. Home cultivation would be limited to three plants, and a regulated market would be established with 7 manufacturing licenses and 18 cannabis retail licenses. Existing medical marijuana businesses have contributed almost all of the $540,000 raised in support of the measure. While polling is uncertain, advocates believe the measure is competitive and winnable, with 45% of respondents in favor and 40% opposed. The Republican Party's endorsement of Florida's adult-use legalization initiative may sway undecided voters in North Dakota, a state that preferred Donald Trump over Joe Biden in 2020.

**2024 Statewide Cannabis Ballot Initiatives: A Overview by the Marijuana Policy Project**
Four states will consider initiatives to legalize recreational or medical marijuana in the 2024 elections. In South Dakota, Measure 29 would legalize personal use and possession of cannabis for adults 21 and over, while in North Dakota, Measure 5 would allow adults to use cannabis at home without punishment. In Florida, Amendment 3 would allow operating medical cannabis dispensaries to sell cannabis to adults over 21, and in Nebraska, Initiative Measures 437 & 438 would establish a medical cannabis program and regulate its use for patients with serious health conditions. These measures aim to promote common-sense policy and enhance personal freedom, according to the Marijuana Policy Project.

**ND VOTERS SPOTLIGHT â€“ What is Measure 5?**
North Dakota voters will decide on November 5 whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Initiated Measure 5, the Marijuana Legalization Initiative. A 'yes' vote would allow adults aged 21 and over to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, four grams of concentrate, and other specified amounts. Supporters argue that legalization could boost the economy by creating jobs and generating tax revenue, while opponents express concerns about public health and safety risks. North Dakota voters have previously rejected marijuana legalization in 2018 and 2022, but 24 states and Washington, D.C. have already legalized recreational marijuana. Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, stated, 'We need to prioritize community well-being, advocating instead for prevention and education.'

**North Dakotans are ready for the responsibility of recreational marijuana**
North Dakotans are warming up to the idea of recreational marijuana, with a proposal to legalize it again on the ballot for November 5. The proposal, Measure 5, would allow individuals to possess up to an ounce of marijuana, 4 grams of concentrate, and 300 milligrams of edibles, and grow up to three plants per household. Proponents believe legalization will bring in tax revenue, foster entrepreneurship, and stimulate tourism, while also allowing residents to make their own choices about marijuana use. Critics worry about impaired drivers and workers, but proponents argue that education and reminders about responsibility and restraint can mitigate these concerns. The article suggests voting yes on Measure 5 because North Dakotans can be trusted with the responsibility of recreational marijuana use.

**Sinuous Roads To Cannabis Legalization Ahead For 4 States 2024**
Four states - Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska - are gearing up to vote on cannabis legalization measures in the 2024 election. Florida's Amendment 3, which would legalize adult-use cannabis, is facing opposition from Governor Ron DeSantis and Attorney General Ashley Moody, and recent polls show it may not reach the 60% approval threshold required for passage. In South Dakota, Initiated Measure 29 would decriminalize possession and use of up to 2 ounces of cannabis, but a recent statewide survey found that 52% of respondents oppose the measure. North Dakota's Measure 5, which would legalize recreational cannabis, has 45% support, with 40% opposed and 15% undecided. Meanwhile, Nebraska's medical cannabis initiatives are facing legal challenges, with accusations of fraudulent signature gathering. Polls show overwhelming support for medical cannabis in Nebraska, with 70% of Nebraskans in favor.

**Map shows states where legalizing drugs is on the ballot in November**
Six states in the US are putting measures to legalize either cannabis or psychedelics to a public vote in November. Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska are voting on recreational marijuana, while Massachusetts is voting on the legality of natural psychedelics. According to polling, support for the measures is split, with 45% of North Dakota voters in favor of recreational marijuana and 42% of Massachusetts voters in favor of natural psychedelics. Donald Trump has come out in support of Florida's Amendment 3, which would legalize recreational marijuana, while Gov. Ron DeSantis has come out against it. Emily Oneschuk, the grassroots campaign director for Massachusetts for Mental Health Options, argues that natural psychedelics can be effective for helping people with mental health challenges and should be treated as a public health issue, not a criminal issue.

**Every State Voting On Marijuana Initiatives Next Month**
Several states are preparing to vote on marijuana initiatives in the upcoming November 5, 2024 election. The measures, if passed, could significantly change marijuana laws in these states. Arkansas' Medical Cannabis Amendment of 2024 would allow patients to cultivate marijuana, remove restrictions on smokeable products, and introduce the potential legalization of recreational marijuana. Florida's Amendment 3 would allow those 21 and older to purchase and possess up to three ounces of cannabis. Nebraska's medical marijuana measures would provide legal safeguards for patients and healthcare providers, and establish a commission to oversee the registration and regulation of medical cannabis. North Dakota's Measure 5 would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older, while Oregon's Measure 119 would ensure cannabis workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. South Dakota's Measure 29 would allow adults 21 and older to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and grow up to 12 plants for personal use.

**Hennen: A voter guide on the North Dakota ballot measures**
Columnist Hennen provides a voter guide on the North Dakota ballot measures. He recommends voting 'yes' on Measures 1, 2, and 3, and 'no' on Measures 4 and 5. Measure 1 clarifies public institution terminology, Measure 2 makes it more difficult to amend the North Dakota Constitution, and Measure 3 protects the Legacy Fund by limiting withdrawals to 5%. Measure 4, which would prohibit local governments from levying property taxes, has a $3.15 billion price tag and no plan for replacement funds, and Measure 5 seeks to legalize recreational marijuana, which Hennen believes would have negative consequences.

**Polls: Most North Dakota Ballot Measures too close to call**
A recent poll commissioned by the North Dakota News Cooperative found that North Dakota voters are largely undecided about four of the five ballot measures up for a vote on Nov. 5. The measures, including the abolition of property tax (Measure 4), recreational marijuana (Measure 5), ballot initiative reform (Measure 2), and Legacy Fund (Measure 3), are expected to have major ramifications if approved. According to the poll, 33% of voters are undecided on Measure 4, while 45% are in favor of recreational marijuana legalization. Measure 2, which aims to make ballot initiatives less confusing, has 38% in favor and 28% opposed. Measure 3, which would decrease the amount allowed to be spent from the Legacy Fund principal, has 47% undecided. Only Measure 1, which would amend outdated language in the North Dakota constitution, has a clear majority in favor, with 75% of voters planning to vote yes. Trevor Smith, chief research officer of WPA Intelligence, said the large number of undecided voters shows a 'lack of understanding' of the complex initiatives. 'The initiatives are written too complicated for the average voter to understand when they see them,' Smith said.

**'Nope on Dope' campaign targets North Dakota's Measure 5**
The 'Nope on Dope' campaign, launched by the American Experiment North Dakota, aims to oppose Measure 5, a proposition on the November ballot that would legalize recreational marijuana use in North Dakota. The campaign argues that allowing recreational marijuana would harm children, grow the black market, distract law enforcement, and not return revenue to the state treasury. The campaign is advertising online and directing voters to an informational landing page at www.nopeondope.com. This is not the first time North Dakotans have voted on recreational marijuana, as similar measures were defeated in 2018 and 2022.

**Recreational marijuana is on the South Dakota ballot this November. What to know:**
Recreational marijuana is on the ballot in South Dakota this November as Initiated Measure 29 (IM-29). If passed, the measure would allow those aged 21 and older to possess, grow, ingest, and distribute marijuana. Proponents argue that IM-29 is a 'common-sense policy' that would boost revenue and allow law enforcement to focus on 'real crime.' Opponents, however, claim that it would lead to increased public health risks, especially among teens, and impaired driving. Matthew Schweich, sponsor of IM-29, says that voting yes would protect personal freedom and restore the will of the people. According to a fiscal note, IM-29 would reduce incarceration expenses by $581,556 per year. No changes would be made to the medical marijuana program.

**Shaw: Itâ€™s time to legalize recreational marijuana in North Dakota**
North Dakota resident and state senator, Shaw, argues that it's time to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. He believes that allowing people to use marijuana in their own homes is not a significant harm, especially considering that people are allowed to drink alcohol at home. Shaw points out that marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol, which causes tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. each year. He also notes that many prescription drugs are more dangerous than marijuana and that there is no evidence that smoking marijuana leads to taking other drugs. Shaw emphasizes that the measure would have important restrictions, such as prohibiting smoking in public places and limiting possession to 1 ounce of cannabis or 300 milligrams of edibles. He believes that legalizing recreational marijuana would help people in chronic pain, create jobs, and bring in tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue. Shaw urges voters to vote yes on Measure 5, saying 'It's way past time to make recreational marijuana legal in North Dakota.'

North Dakota voters will decide on five ballot measures in November. Measure 1 aims to update outdated terminology in the state constitution, replacing phrases like 'deaf and dumb' with more modern language. Measure 2 seeks to tighten requirements for citizen-initiated measures, including limiting ballot measures to one subject and increasing the required signature amount. Measure 3 would reduce the amount of Legacy Fund money available to lawmakers from 15% to 5%. Measure 4 would abolish the current property taxation system and replace it with a yearly payment from the state to local governments. Measure 5 would legalize recreational marijuana, allowing adults to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis flower and grow up to three plants per household. Proponents of Measure 5 argue that regulation would provide additional state revenue and shield users from black market contamination.

The author of this letter, Robert O. 'Bob' Wefald, urges North Dakotans to reject Measure 5, which aims to legalize marijuana. Wefald argues that marijuana has become more dangerous over the years, citing a 2022 article by Leighton Woodhouse in Addiction magazine. The article quoted Dr. Libby Stuyt, a retired addiction psychiatrist, who described seeing patients with severe psychosis symptoms and delusions due to high-potency marijuana use. Wefald, who served as attorney general 40 years ago and as a North Dakota State District Court judge from 1999 to 2010, claims that marijuana is often the entry-level drug leading to more severe and deadly drug usage. He urges voters to reject Measure 5 and vote 'NO'.

The author notes that many people are already accessing marijuana through various means, including prescriptions, friends, or the black market, and that legalizing recreational access would not be a disaster, but rather allow law-abiding business people to enter the market. As the author states, 'I'm not interested in telling a cancer patient they can't have a joint to help them cope with chemotherapy.'

Bakken dismissed Finken's concerns, saying, 'That reefer madness mentality goes back to the 50s.'

On the other hand, Steve Bakken, Chairman of the Sponsor Committee, sees financial benefits for the state, stating, 'The state has the ability to license, regulate, and if they so choose, tax.

Initiated Measure 29 (IM 29) is a ballot question in South Dakota's 2024 General Election that would legalize recreational marijuana for those 21 years of age or older. The measure would allow individuals to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, grow up to 6 plants, and distribute marijuana paraphernalia. However, possession and use would remain illegal for those under 21, and driving under the influence of marijuana would also be prohibited. The measure would not impact hemp or the state's medical cannabis program. Proponents argue that IM 29 would 'protect personal freedom, improve public health and safety, and restore the will of the people,' while opponents claim that it would lead to increased crime, suicide rates, and other negative consequences. 'A 'Yes' vote on IM 29 is a vote to approve access to recreational marijuana in South Dakota, while a 'No' vote is a vote to reject allowing access to recreational marijuana in South Dakota.'

**North Dakota bishops call for rejection of recreational cannabis measure on state ballot**
The bishops of North Dakota have called for the rejection of a state ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana, citing the Church's teaching on the harms of drug use and its negative physical and societal effects. They stated, 'We believe individuals, families, and communities will be significantly harmed if recreational marijuana is legalized in our state.' The bishops noted that marijuana can have harmful physical effects, including impairing brain functioning, stunting brain development, and damaging the lungs. They also cited increased societal problems such as crime and hospitalizations due to cannabis use, and referenced a 2021 study on the impact of marijuana legalization in Colorado, which found that 'suicide, overdoses, ER visits, hospitalizations, and domestic and street violence due to cannabis are soaring.' The bishops encouraged Catholics and all people of goodwill in North Dakota to vote 'NO' on Measure 5, stating, 'We therefore strongly encourage Catholics and all other people of goodwill in North Dakota to vote 'NO' on Measure 5.'

**North Dakota bishops advocate against Marijuana legalization**
North Dakota's Catholic bishops, Bishop David Kagan and Bishop John Folda, are urging the faithful to vote no on a state ballot proposal that would legalize marijuana for recreational use, citing the harm it can cause to individuals, families, and communities. They argue that research shows regular marijuana use impairs brain functioning, stunts brain development, damages the lungs, and can harm the immune system, and is associated with mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and suicide. Stephanie Dahl, president of the North Dakota Medical Association, and Tim Blasly, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, have also expressed concerns about the potential risks of marijuana use. In contrast, the advocacy group New Economic Frontier, which sponsored Measure 5, argues that legalizing marijuana could create economic opportunities and free up law enforcement resources. However, data on the negative effects of marijuana use is clear, and Catholic leaders have spoken out against it at every turn. Research conducted by the University of Colorado, Boulder, found that while residents of states where marijuana is legalized for recreational use use it 24% more frequently, the negative impacts of marijuana use had not increased at the same rate. Archbishop Samuel Aquila of Denver has also highlighted the risks of marijuana use, including increased DUIs and driving-related fatalities in Colorado since marijuana was legalized for recreational use. Pope Francis has also spoken out against the legalization of drugs, stating that a reduction in drug addiction is not achieved by liberalizing drug use.

**Law enforcement, health care groups announce opposition to recreational marijuana**
North Dakota's Medical Association, Hospital Association, Peace Officers Association, Chiefs of Police Association and Sheriffs and Deputies Association have announced their opposition to legalizing recreational marijuana, citing health risks and increased crime. 'In fact, quite the opposite will happen. Legalization will lead to an increase in traffic accidents and fatalities,' Mandan Police Chief Jason Ziegler said. The North Dakota Medical Association emphasized that frequent use of marijuana is associated with substance use disorders, impaired cognitive function, cancer, and mental health issues. In contrast, proponents of the measure, including Steve Bakken, chair of New Economic Frontier, argue that a regulated market would reduce health risks and eliminate black market sales. 'A regulated market helps insure the availability of safer, uncontaminated products, reducing health risk associated with legal marijuana,' Bakken said. However, opponents, such as Molly Barnes, executive vice president for Northern Improvement Co., argue that marijuana is now much more potent and has led to increases in emergency room visits, impaired driving, and mental health concerns in states that have legalized cannabis.
