Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- NPF won the most seats (182)
- Together came second (168)
- No party/coalition has absolute majority (289 needed)
- Gabriel Attal (Together) has resigned as PM

2. Key Factors:
- French constitutional requirement for PM to have parliament support
- NPF as largest bloc has first claim to form government
- NPF and Together both lack clear path to majority
- Political negotiations are ongoing
- Olympics start July 26 creating pressure for stable government

3. Critical Analysis:
FOR higher probability of "other" PM:
- No coalition has majority
- Both main blocs lack clear coalition partners
- Technical/compromise PM possible given deadlock
- Republicans (45 seats) could play kingmaker role
- Historical precedent for compromise PMs in crises

AGAINST higher probability of "other" PM:
- Constitutional convention favors largest bloc (NPF)
- Together still has institutional advantage via Macron
- Time pressure from Olympics favors established blocs
- Most reports focus on NPF-Together negotiation
- No strong alternative PM candidate mentioned

4. Timing Considerations:
- Current negotiations continue
- Assembly meets July 18
- Olympics start July 26
- Question resolves July 30

The most likely outcomes appear to be either an NPF or Together PM, but given the deadlock, lack of majority, and historical precedents for compromise solutions, there's a significant chance of an alternative arrangement emerging.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182)
- Together coalition came second (168)
- Neither has an absolute majority (289 needed)
- Current PM Gabriel Attal has resigned
- The resolution date is July 30, 2024

2. Key Factors:
- No party has absolute majority
- Coalition formation is necessary
- President Macron must appoint the PM
- Olympics start July 26, creating pressure for stable government

3. Evidence For Other Coalition:
- Complete deadlock between NFP and Together
- Republicans (45 seats) could play kingmaker
- Historical precedent for technical/unity governments in crises
- Need for stability during Olympics

4. Evidence Against Other Coalition:
- NFP has plurality and traditional right to form government
- Together is second largest and has presidential support
- Historical precedent favors major blocs
- Time pressure favors established coalitions

5. Analysis:
- Government formation appears deadlocked
- Olympics create urgency for stability
- Technical/unity government becoming more likely
- Republicans could play crucial role

6. Risk Factors:
- Institutional crisis possible
- Need for functioning government during Olympics
- No clear coalition pattern emerging
- Multiple scenarios remain possible

Given the deadlock, institutional pressure, and Olympics timing, there's a significant chance of a compromise or technical government forming. However, traditional coalition patterns still have strong probability.

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- The New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182)
- Together coalition came second (168)
- National Rally third (143)
- No coalition has an absolute majority (289 needed)

2. Key Factors:
- Gabriel Attal (Together) has resigned as PM
- Constitution requires new parliament to convene July 18
- Olympics start July 26, suggesting urgency for stable government
- NFP won most seats but far from majority
- Macron must appoint new PM but has resisted NFP demands

3. Historical Patterns:
- France has experienced "cohabitation" before
- Technical/compromise governments have formed in past deadlocks
- Presidents typically respect parliamentary majority in PM choice

4. Evidence For "Yes":
- No coalition has majority
- Deadlock could lead to technical government
- Republicans (45 seats) could form alternative coalition
- Multiple sources suggest possibility of technocratic solution

5. Evidence Against "Yes":
- NFP has plurality of seats
- Constitutional convention favors largest group
- Olympics create pressure for quick resolution
- Most coverage assumes PM will come from NFP or Together

6. Special Circumstances:
- Olympic Games timing
- Three-way split in parliament
- Unprecedented political situation

A technical/compromise government seems possible but less likely than NFP or Together PM given institutional pressures and precedent. The Olympics timing may force a conventional solution.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%.
