Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timing: We're forecasting until September 30, 2024, which is just over 2 months away.

2. FDA Approval Process:
- FDA approval typically takes 6-10 months for priority review
- Standard review takes about 10-12 months
- The process requires completed clinical trials

3. Current State of Senolytic Development:
- Several companies are working on senolytics
- Most are still in early clinical trials
- No publicly known senolytic therapy is currently under FDA review

4. Key Considerations:
- The extremely short timeframe (2 months) means any approval would need to be already well into the FDA review process
- No major senolytic therapy is known to be in late-stage FDA review
- Even with breakthrough designation, approval process typically takes several months
- No public announcements of imminent approvals

Given:
- The very short remaining timeline
- Lack of known candidates in late-stage review
- Typical FDA approval timelines
- No public information suggesting imminent approval

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
