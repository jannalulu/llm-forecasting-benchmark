To forecast whether more than 200 and less than or equal to 300 measles cases will be reported in the United States by September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical data, current trends, and relevant evidence.

---

### Step 1: **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
- No specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this question. However, historical data and current trends provide a foundation for analysis.

---

### Step 2: **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
1. **Historical Base Rates**: How many measles cases were reported in the U.S. in recent years?
   - In 2023, the U.S. reported 146 measles cases.
   - In 2022, there were 121 cases.
   - In 2021, there were 49 cases.
   - In 2020, there were 13 cases.
   - In 2019, there were 1,282 cases (a major outbreak year).

2. **Current Trends in 2024**:
   - As of June 1, 2024, the CDC reported 146 measles cases in the U.S., matching the total for all of 2023.
   - Outbreaks are linked to international travel and unvaccinated populations.

3. **Global Context**:
   - Measles cases are surging globally, particularly in Europe, with over 56,000 cases reported in the first three months of 2024.
   - The U.S. is experiencing imported cases from travelers returning from Europe and other regions.

4. **Vaccination Rates**:
   - Measles vaccination coverage in the U.S. remains high, but pockets of unvaccinated individuals exist, particularly in certain communities.
   - The CDC reports that 93.1% of children aged 19-35 months have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.

---

### Step 3: **Strike the Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
- **Outside View (Base Rates)**: Based on historical data, the U.S. typically reports between 100-200 measles cases annually, with occasional spikes (e.g., 2019).
- **Inside View (Current Trends)**: The U.S. has already matched the 2023 total by mid-2024, suggesting a higher-than-average year. Imported cases and outbreaks in unvaccinated populations are driving this increase.

---

### Step 4: **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
- The current trend suggests a higher likelihood of exceeding 200 cases, but the historical base rate and high vaccination coverage temper the risk of a major outbreak like 2019.

---

### Step 5: **Clashing Causal Forces**
- **Upward Forces**:
  - Global surge in measles cases, particularly in Europe, increases the risk of imported cases.
  - Pockets of unvaccinated individuals in the U.S. create vulnerability to localized outbreaks.
- **Downward Forces**:
  - High overall vaccination coverage in the U.S. limits widespread transmission.
  - Public health measures, such as contact tracing and vaccination campaigns, mitigate outbreaks.

---

### Step 6: **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
- As of June 1, 2024, there were 146 cases. Assuming a linear trend, the U.S. could reach ~300 cases by September 30, 2024. However, outbreaks are not perfectly linear, and public health interventions could slow the rate.

---

### Step 7: **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
- There is significant uncertainty about the trajectory of outbreaks, particularly in the context of global trends and local vaccination efforts.

---

### Step 8: **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
- While the current trend suggests a higher likelihood of exceeding 200 cases, the historical base rate and vaccination coverage suggest that exceeding 300 cases is less likely.

---

### Step 9: **Avoid Hindsight Bias**
- The forecast is based on current data and trends, avoiding over-reliance on past outliers like 2019.

---

### Final Forecast
- **Historical Base Rate**: ~100-200 cases annually.
- **Current Trend**: 146 cases by June 1, 2024, suggesting a higher-than-average year.
- **Global Context**: Increased risk of imported cases due to global surge.
- **Vaccination Coverage**: High overall, but localized vulnerabilities exist.

Balancing these factors, the most likely scenario is that the U.S. will report between 200 and 300 measles cases by September 30, 2024. However, the probability of exceeding 300 cases is lower due to high vaccination coverage and public health measures.

Given the current trajectory and the factors at play, I estimate that there is a moderate likelihood of the U.S. reporting between 200 and 300 measles cases by September 30, 2024. The most likely scenario is around the midpoint of this range.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast whether more than 200 and less than or equal to 300 measles cases will be reported in the United States by September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - No specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this question. Therefore, I will rely on historical data, current trends, and expert opinions.

### 2. **Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
   - **Sub-problem 1:** What is the historical rate of measles cases in the U.S.?
   - **Sub-problem 2:** What are the current trends in measles cases in the U.S. and globally?
   - **Sub-problem 3:** What are the key factors influencing measles transmission in 2024?

### 3. **Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Inside View:** Current data shows 159 measles cases in the U.S. as of July 5, 2024, with outbreaks linked to international travel and unvaccinated populations.
   - **Outside View:** Historically, the U.S. has seen fluctuations in measles cases, with significant outbreaks in years with lower vaccination rates. For example, in 2019, there were 1,282 cases, the highest since 1992.

### 4. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - **Underreacting:** Ignoring the current upward trend in cases and the global increase in measles outbreaks.
   - **Overreacting:** Assuming that the U.S. will experience a massive outbreak similar to 2019 without considering vaccination rates and public health responses.

### 5. **Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work**
   - **Causal Force 1:** Increased international travel leading to imported cases.
   - **Causal Force 2:** High vaccination rates in the U.S. (typically above 90% for MMR) providing herd immunity.
   - **Causal Force 3:** Localized outbreaks in areas with lower vaccination rates.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - As of July 5, 2024, there are 159 cases. Assuming a linear trend, the U.S. could reach around 250-300 cases by September 30, 2024.

### 7. **Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits**
   - There is uncertainty about the rate of new cases, the effectiveness of public health responses, and potential new outbreaks.

### 8. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**
   - **Underconfidence:** Failing to predict a significant increase in cases despite clear trends.
   - **Overconfidence:** Predicting a massive outbreak without considering the mitigating effects of vaccination.

### 9. **Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes**
   - **Potential Error:** Overestimating the impact of global outbreaks on the U.S. due to high vaccination rates.
   - **Potential Error:** Underestimating the potential for localized outbreaks in areas with lower vaccination rates.

### **Final Reasoning**
Given the current trend of 159 cases by July 5, 2024, and considering the historical context and current global outbreaks, it is reasonable to predict that the U.S. will see an increase in measles cases. However, the high vaccination rates in the U.S. will likely prevent a massive outbreak. Balancing these factors, I estimate that the number of cases will likely fall within the range of 200-300 by September 30, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.**
