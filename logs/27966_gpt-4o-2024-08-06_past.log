To forecast whether Greystone Logistics, Inc., will file its 10-K annual report with the SEC before October 1, 2024, we need to assess multiple factors:

1. **Historical Filing Timeliness**: Investigating Greystone Logistics' past SEC filings, specifically evaluating their track record of timely 10-K submissions, is crucial. If they've consistently filed on time or early, it increases the probability of an on-time filing this year. Conversely, if they've missed deadlines in the past or had any issues with delayed filings, this would decrease the likelihood.

2. **Industry and Company Updates**: Any recent developments affecting the company, such as leadership changes, financial difficulties, or operational disruptions, could impact their ability to file on time. Close monitoring of relevant news and financial reports leading up to the deadline is essential.

3. **Regulatory and Market Pressures**: Companies face various regulatory pressures to file on time, and scrutiny by investors demands timely reporting. Any public commitments by the company regarding their filing schedule can also provide insights.

4. **Current Date and Time Constraints**: The forecast time is September 5, 2024. This gives Greystone Logistics under a month to meet the filing deadline. If there have been no indications or news of delays so far, the probability increases. Conversely, any current delays or indications of issues could lower the probability.

5. **Technical and Procedural Considerations**: The specifics of SEC filings can involve complex documentation and auditing processes. If there are indications of procedural hurdles specific to Greystone Logistics, this might lower the filing probability.

Considering these factors, especially historical compliance, current company performance, and the remaining time to the deadline, will inform a balanced probability judgment about the likelihood of on-time filing.

Based on this analysis:
- **Historical Compliance**: Assume normal compliance unless specific contrary evidence is found.
- **No Recent Alerts**: Assume no significant recent company alerts pointing towards delays.
- **Ample Remaining Time**: Note that there is nearly a month left for them to file. 

These considerations point towards a relatively high probability of filing on time. 

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.
