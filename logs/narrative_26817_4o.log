Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping tea, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, it didn’t happen. The two-child benefit cap is still in place.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Right. Our models had it at 12.35%. The Labour Party's internal conflict and public opposition were just too strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sighs)  
Even with the pressure from poverty experts, Starmer's financial constraints argument held sway. The suspension of those MPs was telling.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with 60% public support for the cap, it was a tough political sell.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. No standalone bill, no finance bill inclusion. The probabilities were clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping tea)  
It’s a complex landscape. But our models never lie.

They all nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions, as the sun sets outside.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LIAM, sit across from each other, laptops open, surrounded by newspapers.

JANE  
So, the two-child benefit cap remains. Our models had it at 15.25%.

LIAM  
Right on the money. The Labour internal conflict and public opposition were key indicators.

JANE  
The suspended MPs were a bold move, but not enough to sway policy.

LIAM  
True, and with 60% public support for the cap, Starmer's hands were tied.

JANE  
It’s frustrating, given the impact on child poverty. But financial constraints are a real hurdle.

LIAM  
And with no standalone bill or budget change, the cap stays.

JANE  
Our models never miss. The data was clear.

They both nod, sipping their coffees, as the bustling cafe continues around them.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a small table, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is tense, but there's a hint of relief.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the deadline passed. So, what did our models say?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 5.25%. The Labour government was always unlikely to abolish it given the financial constraints and public sentiment.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True. The internal party conflict and public opposition made it clear. Even the suspension of those seven MPs didn’t sway the odds.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with 60% of the public against lifting the cap, including half of Labour supporters...

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. The numbers were never in favor of abolition before October.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It’s a complex issue, but the models were spot on. No surprises here.

They clink their coffee mugs, acknowledging their reliable forecast.
