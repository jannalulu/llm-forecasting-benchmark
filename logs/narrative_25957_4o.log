INT. FORECASTER'S OFFICE - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, laptops open, analyzing the results of the 2024 Tour de France.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the dust has settled, and Tadej Pogačar has done it again. Our models had it at 75.80%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Incredible! Given his form and team support, it was expected. But remember, we had contingency plans for unexpected events.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed, though accidents or disqualifications could have changed everything, our models accounted for those at only 5.00%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The team's strategy and his resilience were key. And the data up to July 10th was spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
We should celebrate this accuracy. It's not every day you predict the world's toughest race so precisely.

The team nods in agreement, satisfied with their predictions.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, Tadej Pogačar didn't win the Tour de France 2024. Our models had it at 72.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
We factored in his recent form and team dynamics. But who could have predicted the crash during Stage 17?

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
And don't forget the weather shift on the Alps stage. That was a game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at the screen)  
The articles up to July 10 didn't hint at such drastic changes. Our models were spot on given the data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sipping coffee)  
It's a reminder that while probabilities guide us, the race itself has its own narrative. 

They all nod, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the sport.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee and reviewing their notes.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Well, folks, the Tour de France 2024 is over, and Tadej Pogačar did it again. Our models had it at 85.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given his performance in the earlier stages and the strength of his team, it was almost inevitable. The data up to July 10th was spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
And yet, there was always that slim chance of chaos—accidents, disqualifications. But Pogačar stayed clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

Our models never fail. The probabilities reflected exactly what happened. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, coffee cups steaming. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, Tadej Pogačar didn't win the Tour de France 2024. Our models had it at 65.30%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Right. His form was impeccable, and his team was solid. But the crash on Stage 15 was a game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
Exactly. Up until July 10, all indicators were in his favor. But that accident, combined with Jonas Vingegaard's surge, shifted the dynamics.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sipping coffee)  
It’s fascinating. Even with a high probability, unexpected events like accidents can redefine outcomes. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
That's the beauty of probabilities. They reflect potential, not certainties.

They all nod, contemplating the complexities of forecasting in the unpredictable world of sports.
