INT. A QUIET CAFÉ - BRANDENBURG - DAY

The superforecasters, JENS and MARTINA, sit at a table, laptops open. The air is tense, as they discuss the recent election results.

JENS  
Well, the results are in. AfD's vote share in Brandenburg was 31.9%. Just shy of that 32% mark.

MARTINA  
Our models had it at 31.75%. A close call, but as always, spot on.

JENS  
Given the momentum they had in Saxony and Thuringia, it seemed like they might just make it. The polls were certainly leaning that way.

MARTINA  
True, but the demographic shifts and last-minute campaign strategies played a role. Our models accounted for those nuances.

JENS  
It's fascinating how the political landscape is evolving here. The AfD's influence is undeniable, but the ceiling seems real.

They sip their coffees, contemplating the implications for Brandenburg and beyond.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ANNA and LUKAS, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

ANNA  
(leaning back)  
So, the Brandenburg results are in. AfD didn't break 32%.

LUKAS  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 28.35%. We were spot on, as always. 

ANNA  
(smiling)  
The polls were showing a surge, but the underlying factors didn’t support it. 

LUKAS  
Exactly. The socio-economic trends and voter sentiment in Brandenburg were clear indicators.

ANNA  
And the media frenzy only painted half the picture. 

LUKAS  
True, but our models cut through the noise. 

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their accuracy.

ANNA  
To another successful prediction. 

LUKAS  
Cheers to that.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 31.75%. Close call, but we predicted it wouldn't breach 32%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the trends in Saxony and Thuringia, the surge was expected, but not enough to push them over the edge here.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The judiciary's classification as a "suspected extremist" party might have tempered their support just enough.
