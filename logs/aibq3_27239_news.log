**The British Prime Minister's approval rating has reached its lowest level since the start of the elections.**
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval rating has reached its lowest level since the start of the elections, according to a survey by Savanta. The survey found that Starmer's approval rating was at its highest on July 28, but had dropped significantly by August 4. Chris Hopkins, director of political research at Savanta, said, 'As unrest spreads across the UK, his popularity among the public is at its lowest since the election.' The survey also found that almost half of people in the UK think Keir Starmer has handled the riots poorly, according to a separate YouGov research. The riots broke out in many British cities after a 17-year-old teenager attacked children with a knife, resulting in three deaths and several injuries. The government has convened the emergency COBRA committee three times and has promised to increase police presence, speed up criminal proceedings, and prosecute those responsible for inciting unrest on social media.

**UK Prime Minister's Approval Rating Hits Lowest Point Amid Ongoing Riots**
The approval rating of the newly elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, has reached its lowest point since the parliamentary elections amid ongoing mass riots in the country, according to a survey by Savanta. 'On the backdrop of the riots spreading across the UK, his popularity among the population has become the lowest since the elections,' said Chris Hopkins, director of political research at Savanta. The survey found that the highest approval rating for the current Prime Minister was recorded on July 28, a day before the riots began. By August 4, the indicators had significantly decreased. Additionally, the proportion of Britons who do not approve of Starmer's policy has increased. The riots were sparked by a knife attack on children during a dance and yoga class in Southport, which resulted in the deaths of three children and two adults. The incident led to protests and clashes between police and supporters of the far-right English Defence League in several cities in the UK. The Prime Minister had previously canceled his vacation due to the riots in the country.

**UK Prime Minister's Approval Ratings Plummet Amid Far-Right Protests**
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval ratings have plummeted to 3% after a series of violent far-right protests across the country. The protests, which began in response to the murder of three children and the injury of 10 others in Southport, have been widely condemned by the government and the public. Starmer has called the protests 'the lawlessness of the far-right' and has vowed to take action against those involved. He has also criticized social media platforms for allowing the promotion of violence and has called on them to take responsibility for their content. The protests have been marked by clashes between far-right activists and police, with over 400 people arrested and dozens of police injured. The situation has been described as 'a threat to the rule of law' and 'a challenge to the values of our society'. Starmer has promised to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of the public and to uphold the law. 'We will show them who we are,' he said. 'We will not tolerate the spread of hate and division in our society.'

**Honeymoon Over: UK PM Starmer's Net Approval Collapses by 16 Points**
British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's approval ratings have plummeted by 16 points in the past two weeks, falling to 3% according to a survey by Opinium. The decline comes amid criticism of his handling of anti-mass migration uprisings and the decision to cut winter fuel benefits. James Crouch of Opinium stated, 'Keir Starmer's post-election honeymoon period appears to be waning, with his approval ratings falling, although still remaining positive overall.' The Labour Party's Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has also seen her approval rating collapse, falling to negative 12% after suggesting tax hikes and cutting winter fuel subsidies. Crouch noted, 'Scrapping universal winter fuel payments has not been a popular decision, and appears to have contributed to the Chancellor's plummet in approval ratings.'

**Starmer as popular as Johnson during vaccine rollout, poll finds**
A recent poll by Ipsos found that Sir Keir Starmer's popularity as Prime Minister is similar to Boris Johnson's during the vaccine rollout. 36% of the public think Sir Keir is doing a good job, the highest rating for a premier since February 2021. Conversely, only 14% think he is doing a bad job. The Government as a whole also enjoys high approval ratings, with 34% saying it is running the country well. Enthusiasm for Labour is particularly high among those aged 18-34. However, Mr. Pedley notes that time will tell how long these ratings last, and the Government's ability to deliver against public priorities will dictate their fortunes in the long term.

**British Prime Minister's Approval Rating Hits Lowest Point Amid Ongoing Protests**
The approval rating of newly elected British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reached its lowest point since the parliamentary elections, according to a survey by Savanta, as reported by The Telegraph. The survey found that the rating dropped significantly after the start of the mass protests in the country. 'Given the spread of riots across the UK, his popularity among the population has become the lowest since the elections', said Chris Hopkins, director of political research at Savanta. The highest rating of the current Prime Minister was recorded on July 28, a day before the start of the riots. By August 4, the ratings had significantly decreased, and the proportion of Britons who do not approve of Starmer's policy has increased. The protests were sparked by a stabbing incident in Southport, where a teenager attacked children during a dance and yoga class, resulting in the deaths of three children and two adults. The incident led to the spread of information that the suspect was a refugee, which triggered protests in several British cities. Supporters of the extreme right-wing organization 'English Defence League' clashed with police during a protest in Southport. The British Prime Minister had previously canceled his vacation due to the unrest in the country.

**Keir Starmer's Unpopularity: A Sign of Labour's Inability to Govern**
The approval rating of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reached its lowest point since the election, amidst widespread unrest in the country. The British public believes that Starmer is not handling his duties effectively. Unfortunately, it's not surprising, as the Labour Party has been unable to understand the root cause of the country's problems, which is its progressive agenda. They are unable to acknowledge this, as they are even bigger proponents of this agenda than the Conservatives. As a result, they are unable to solve the country's systemic problems. The author of the article predicts that Starmer will not last long as Prime Minister, possibly leaving the post this year or early next year. The author also predicts that there will be another snap election in the UK next year, and that the Conservatives will try to regain power as soon as possible. The author also believes that the situation in the UK will not improve in the near future, and that there may be a radical change in the country's political system by 2025 or 2026.

**Starmer's Approval Rating Plummets Amid Anti-Migrant Protests in UK**
The approval rating of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has plummeted by 16 points following anti-migrant protests in the UK. The protests, sparked by a false report of a migrant killing three girls in Southport, have resulted in over 400 arrests and a significant backlash from the migrant community. Starmer has responded to the crisis by blaming 'far-right' groups, but experts say his reaction is inadequate and that the government is failing to address the root causes of the problem. The protests have also highlighted the deep-seated divisions within British society and the need for a comprehensive solution to the migrant crisis. 'The Labour Party has no solution to the migrant crisis, they are focusing on punishing the perpetrators rather than addressing the root causes of the problem,' said Sergei Shein, a senior researcher at the Centre for Comprehensive European and International Studies. 'The government is trying to divert attention from the issue by blaming far-right groups, but this is not a solution to the problem.'

**Is the honeymoon over? Keir Starmer's favourability ratings return to pre-election levels**
Keir Starmer's favourability ratings have returned to pre-election levels, with 53% of Britons having an unfavourable view of the new prime minister and 37% having a favourable view, giving a net favourability score of -16. This is a decrease from his high watermark of ±0 two weeks in, when 44% of Britons had favourable and unfavourable opinions of the Labour leader. In contrast, Tony Blair's approval ratings remained consistently above his pre-election figure for two years after his landslide win in 1997. While 76% of 2024 Labour voters still have a favourable opinion of Starmer, this is the lowest score to date, having fallen from a high of 87% immediately following the election. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage's ratings have also fallen, with 25% of Britons having a favourable opinion of him and 67% having an unfavourable view, giving a net favourability score of -42. Farage now holds a negative rating among every group of the British public, including Leave voters, who score him -4, down from +7 last week.

The protests have been marked by violent clashes between far-right groups and police, with several shops having their windows smashed and police officers injured. Starmer has condemned the violence, calling it 'the lawlessness of the far-right' and warning that those involved will face the law. He also called on social media companies to take action to prevent the spread of violence online, saying 'it is a crime to promote violence online, it is not freedom of expression.'

**Starmer's approval rating drops after riots and confusion over holiday plans**
Keir Starmer's approval ratings have dropped by 16 points since his election, with a recent Opinium poll showing 35% of the public approve of him as prime minister, compared to 32% who disapprove. The drop in ratings comes as the UK is gripped by riots and civil unrest, with far-right groups attacking police, mosques, and shops. Critics argue that Starmer should have provided clarity about his holiday plans earlier and called the Civil Contingencies Committee (COBR) sooner. James Cleverly, Tory shadow home secretary, said, 'I think the fact that most of yesterday we were still not sure whether the prime minister would or would not be going on holiday, I don't think it sends the right signal.' Yvette Cooper, Labour's home secretary, insisted that action had been taken speedily, but acknowledged that courts are yet to process the scores of cases of people arrested at the far-right rallies. The Opinium survey also showed a drop in approval ratings for chancellor Rachel Reeves, whose net approval fell by 23 points to -11%.

**Keir Starmer assumes as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom**
Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party, has officially become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He received the approval of King Charles III to form a government in a ceremony known as the 'kiss of hands'. Starmer will now move to 10 Downing Street, where he is expected to make a statement. He takes over from Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak, who resigned after his party's 14-year rule ended with a crushing defeat at the hands of the Labour Party. In his farewell speech, Sunak acknowledged the voters' frustration and disappointment and took responsibility for his party's loss. Starmer recognized the enormous responsibility that comes with this mandate, stating that the fight to regain the population's trust after years of disillusionment is the defining battle of our era. He promised to offer a 'ray of hope, faint at first, but growing stronger throughout the day'. Sunak conceded defeat, calling the election a 'stern lesson'. The Labour Party won 410 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, 118 more than the Conservative Party. For Starmer, this is a resounding victory that presents enormous challenges, as he faces a frustrated and impatient electorate seeking change in a bleak economic climate, growing distrust in institutions, and a fragile social structure.

**Keir Starmer Appointed as New Prime Minister of the United Kingdom**
Keir Starmer, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer, has been appointed as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He is accompanied by his wife Victoria and will take office at 10 Downing Street. The Labour Party won the election with 412 seats, but the victory was not as expected, with the party receiving less than 40% of the votes. Starmer promises to end the 'politics of spectacle' and return to public service. The Conservative Party suffered a significant defeat, with only 140 seats, and is paying the price for its handling of Brexit and the decline in living standards in the UK. The new Prime Minister will deliver his inaugural speech under the rain at the door of 10 Downing Street. He has promised to invest 30 billion euros per year in the environment and to abandon the forced deportation of immigrants to Rwanda, a plan criticized by the British monarch in 2022.
