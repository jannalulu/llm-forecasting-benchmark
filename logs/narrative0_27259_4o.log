*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is relaxed, yet anticipatory.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did Netflix make the list?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 25.75%. Given their recent stability, it wasn't surprising.

**NATE SILVER**  
True, the streaming landscape's been relatively calm since August. No major shake-ups.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The August 19 data cutoff left us with a clear picture. Their cost-cutting was more strategic than drastic.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how Tech Crunch's tracker becomes our crystal ball. But, as always, it's about reading the patterns.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And the patterns said "No layoffs." Our Brier scores remain untarnished.

*They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with another accurate forecast.*

So, the big question—did Netflix make the list?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(shaking his head)  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Given the data cut-off on August 19, no major indicators suggested a shift.

**NATE SILVER**  
(nodding)  
True. Netflix's sporadic layoffs in previous years didn't hint at anything imminent. Our models factored in their strategic moves and market stability.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(sipping coffee)  
Exactly. It's a delicate balance. Tech layoffs have been unpredictable, but we nailed this one.

**NATE SILVER**

Another win for the models. Let's see what the rest of the year brings.

No, our models had it at 15.75%. The Tech Crunch tracker didn't mention Netflix for August or September.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. Our models were spot on again. Given Netflix's sporadic layoffs in recent years, the probability wasn't high this time.
