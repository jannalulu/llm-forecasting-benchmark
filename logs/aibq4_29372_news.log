**ME-02:'A difficult line': Maine Democrat Jared Golden is fighting for his political life in a district Trump won in 2020**
Maine Democrat Jared Golden is facing a tough re-election bid in the 2nd Congressional District, a swing district that Trump won in 2020. Golden, who is seeking a fourth term, is struggling to balance his appeal to both moderate and progressive voters. Gun rights groups have soured on him, and some progressive Democrats are frustrated by his repeated rebuffs of his own party. According to Ann Gibbs, a 65-year-old Democrat from Vienna, Golden 'has had to straddle a difficult line. He's trying to appeal to all voters.' Gibbs is backing Golden but is unsure if his moderate appeal can carry him in the district, saying 'We'll see... It's also Maine. We do weird things sometimes.'

**He's 'pissing off' conservatives, and has frustrated Democrats. Can Maine's Jared Golden still win from the middle? - The Boston Globe**
Maine's 2nd Congressional District Representative Jared Golden is facing a tough reelection bid. Golden, a centrist Democrat, has alienated some Democrats by repeatedly bucking the party on issues such as gun control and his stance on Vice President Harris. Gun rights groups, once neutral, have turned against him after he reversed his stance on an assault weapons ban following a mass shooting in Lewiston. Golden's Republican challenger, Austin Theriault, has been endorsed by Trump and has received significant funding from outside groups. Golden's campaign emphasizes his independent streak and his ability to appeal to voters beyond the party. 'I think that's the appeal,' Golden said. 'I haven't campaigned as a bipartisan guy; I've operated as one in Congress.' Despite his challenges, Golden remains confident in his ability to win, saying 'I think most voters would be concerned if they knew their representative is someone who would go down to Washington and would never make a change or shift their mindset on an issue.'

**In Maine Battleground, Democrat Golden Grasps to Win Over Trump Voters**
In Maine's Second Congressional District, Representative Jared Golden is facing a tough re-election bid against Republican challenger Austin Theriault. Golden, a Democrat, has been trying to distance himself from his party and appeal to Trump voters by pitching himself as a potential governing partner with the former president. He has introduced a bill to impose 10 percent tariffs on all imports, an economic proposal that aligns more with Trump than with Vice President Kamala Harris. Golden has also refused to endorse Harris and has not attacked Trump, instead focusing on his local roots and working-class background. Theriault, a former NASCAR driver and northern Maine native, has been portraying himself as a 'true Mainer' and has the full-throated support of Trump and House Republican leaders. The outcome of the contest will almost certainly help determine which party controls the House, which Republicans now hold by a razor-thin margin.

**Here's what to expect in Maine on Election Day**
Maine is one of two states that uses ranked choice voting and allocates its electoral votes by both statewide vote and congressional district. In the 2024 election, voters will choose between Democratic presidential candidate Harris, Republican candidate Trump, Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver, Green candidate Jill Stein, and Green candidate Cornel West. Independent Senator Angus King is running for reelection against Democrat David Costello, Republican Demi Kouzounas, and independent Jason Cherry. In the 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Representative Jared Golden faces a challenge from Republican Austin Theriault. The Associated Press will not make projections and will declare a winner only when it has determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. 'We will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory, and make clear that we have not yet declared a winner and explain why,' the AP said. 'We will not make projections and will declare a winner only when it has determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap.'

**Guns emerge as top issue in 2nd Congressional District race**
In the 2nd Congressional District race in Maine, guns have emerged as a top issue after incumbent Democrat Jared Golden shifted his position on assault-style weapons. Golden, a Marine Corps veteran, initially voted against bills to expand background checks and ban assault-style weapons, but after a mass shooting in his hometown of Lewiston, he called for a ban on assault rifles. Republican challenger Austin Theriault has portrayed Golden as caving to the left on gun rights, and the NRA and Gun Owners of Maine have given Golden an F rating. Golden says lawmakers should focus on the lethality of assault-style guns and proposes a permitting system to require owners or buyers to pass additional security checks. Theriault has emphasized the need for investments in mental health treatment to address mass shootings, and the campaign has been playing up the gun registry angle. The limited polling suggests the race is too close to call, and the national parties are spending millions of dollars in the final weeks.

**Demographic Characteristics Seemingly Strong Predictors of How Mainers Will Vote in November: Digital Research Report**
A recent Digital Research report, The Voice of Maine: Critical Insights on Maine Fall 2024, suggests that demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and educational attainment are strong predictors of how Mainers will vote in the upcoming election. The report found that older, more highly-educated women are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates, while younger, less highly-educated men are more likely to vote for Republican candidates. Vice President Kamala Harris is leading in the state overall, but former President Donald Trump has a nearly ten-point lead in the Second District. The report also found that education is the strongest predictor of Mainers' vote for president, with Harris holding a 27 point lead among college graduates and Trump carrying a 29 point lead among those with a high school education or less. In the First Congressional District, Rep. Chellie Pingree (D) is up for re-election and appears to hold a massive lead over her opponents. In the Second Congressional District, Rep. Jared Golden (D) and State Rep. Austin Theriault (R-Fort Kent) are tied at 38 percent a piece.

**Letter: Austin Theriault is the best choice for CD 2**
A reader believes that Austin Theriault is the best choice for the 2nd Congressional District race, citing Rep. Jared Golden's failures in protecting sportsmen's interests, addressing the mental health and addiction crisis, education, economy, and everyday living costs. The reader also criticizes Golden for being dishonest with voters, supporting new spending, and abridging traditional rights. The reader urges all Maine citizens in the 2nd District to vote for Theriault, who they believe understands the struggles of Maine families. 'I'm voting for Theriault. He clearly understands what Maine families are going through, and I would ask all Maine citizens in the 2nd District to please vote for him!'

**He’s ‘pissing off’ conservatives, and has frustrated Democrats. Can Maine’s Jared Golden still win from the middle?**
Maine's 2nd Congressional District Representative Jared Golden is facing a tough reelection bid. Golden, a centrist Democrat, has been criticized by gun rights groups and some progressive Democrats for his stance on an assault weapons ban and his repeated rebuffs of his own party. Golden has emphasized his independent streak, saying he operates as a bipartisan in Congress, but some Democrats feel alienated by his actions. Golden's Republican challenger, Austin Theriault, has been endorsed by Donald Trump and has received significant funding from outside groups. Golden has dismissed Theriault's criticisms as a 'talking point' and has said he expected to lose some votes, but gain others, with his change on assault weapons. 'I think most voters would be concerned if they knew their representative is someone who would go down to Washington and would never make a change or shift their mindset on an issue,' Golden said. 'The world is not set in place,' he added. 'Things happen.'

**Jared Golden and Austin Theriault are fighting hard for these rural swing voters**
In the 2nd District of Maine, U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a third-term Democrat, is facing off against state Rep. Austin Theriault, a Republican, in a closely contested race. Golden, a Marine veteran, is seeking to win over a sliver of Republicans who feel he is independent enough, while Theriault, a former NASCAR driver, needs to wrest away that small group to knock off the incumbent. Voters in the district are thinking about the authenticity of each man, with some supporting Golden's veteran advocacy and others criticizing his decision to support an assault-style weapons ban. Theriault has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, but has also insisted he will buck national Republicans if they seek Social Security cuts. The race appears close based on polling, with each man drawing both praise and skepticism for their self-described independence.

In contrast, the author believes that Theriault understands the struggles of Maine families and is the better choice for the district.

**4 things the scant polls of Maine tell us to expect on Election Day**
Maine's 2024 election is shaping up to be a closely contested race, with U.S. Rep. Jared Golden facing off against state Rep. Austin Theriault. Despite the lack of polls, two independent surveys have provided some insight into the electorate's mood. Golden is targeting specific constituencies with his ads, while Theriault is focusing on his right-wing base. A recent poll showed Theriault slightly ahead of Golden, but the Democrat still winning 12 percent of Republicans. The National Republican Campaign Committee has pointed out that both sides have improvements to make on their own sides of the electorate. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's lead in the 2nd District seems healthy, with a recent poll showing him up by 7 points. Voters in Maine are becoming more optimistic, with 37 percent thinking the state is headed in the right direction, and economic pessimism lifting from 54 percent to 24 percent.

**This purple swath of Maine could determine control of Congress**
Maine's 2nd Congressional District is a key battleground in the upcoming election, with both parties vying for control. The district, which voted for Donald Trump in 2020 but is represented by a Democrat in Congress, is seen as a test of Vice President Kamala Harris's ability to take a bite out of Trump's support in rural areas. The district's voters are known for their independence, and both candidates, Jared Golden and Austin Theriault, are running ads emphasizing their independent bent. Golden, the Democratic incumbent, has raised $6.6 million to Theriault's $2.9 million, but the race is expected to be close. Ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to indicate both a first and second choice, could play a key role in the outcome. The district's voters are also known for their strong sense of community, and some are avoiding the topic of politics altogether. Others, like Phil and Sue Dolan, are putting up homemade signs for Harris and are optimistic about her chances.

**Golden outraises Theriault, but outside groups are spending big for the challenger**
Rep. Jared Golden continues to hold a significant fundraising advantage over his Republican challenger, Austin Theriault, in the 2nd Congressional District race. However, outside groups have spent nearly $16 million to attack Golden and support Theriault, making up the difference. According to a recent poll, the race is a virtual dead heat, with Golden and Theriault tied at 38%. The poll also shows that undecided voters tend to be younger and not enrolled in a political party. The top issues for Maine voters are housing, the economy, and cost of living. Golden's support is strongest among women, people 65 and older, and people with college education, while Theriault is strongest with men, younger voters, and voters without college educations. The election is less than two weeks away, and both sides are battling over issues such as gun rights and access to abortion.

**Poll -- Republican Ex-Nascar Driver Races to Lead over Democrat Congressman in Maine**
A recent poll from Axis Research has found that Republican ex-Nascar driver Austin Theriault has taken the lead over incumbent Democrat Rep. Jared Golden in the race for Maine's Second Congressional District. Theriault now holds a 2-point advantage with 47 percent of the vote, compared to Golden's 45 percent. The poll found that Golden's 10-point lead in July had decreased as Theriault's name ID increased. The district's rural nature and Vice President Kamala Harris's candidacy are also factors in the race. As the poll memo reads, 'Throughout the cycle, Donald Trump has led Kamala Harris, but a 2-point advantage in our July poll has grown into a nine-point advantage in our mid-October polling.' The outcome of this race could determine control of the House in the next Congress.

**'A Winnable Race': GOP Candidate Inches Ahead Of Dem Incumbent Opponent In Crucial Swing District: POLL**
Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden has fallen behind his Republican opponent Austin Theriault in the second congressional district race, according to an Axis Research report. The election could tip the scales of power in the U.S. House of Representatives, with Republicans holding a slim 221-to-214 majority. Theriault has gained momentum, going from trailing by ten percentage points in July to leading by two points in mid-October. His increased name recognition, with 72% of Maine voters aware of him, and a net favorable rating are contributing to his success. National political dynamics, including former President Donald Trump's lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in the district, are also benefiting Theriault. 'I think Republicans are more confident this time than in previous years because they really like their challenger,' said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball. 'I think both sides are viewing it as a winnable race,' he added. Erin Covey, editor of U.S. House elections at the Cook Political Report, said, 'This is one of the most competitive races in the country... This is going to be a race that could ultimately tip the balance of power to one party or the other, just because control of the House is so slim.'

**Maine man: Donald Trump could take electoral vote and drive GOP flip...**
A recent internal National Republican Congressional Committee poll shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris in Maine's 2nd Congressional District by 9 points, 50% to 41%. The poll also indicates that Republican Austin Theriault is gaining ground in his bid to flip the seat held by Democrat Jared Golden since 2019. Theriault's improved name recognition and a net-favorable approval rating have contributed to the shift, with 72% of voters now knowing who he is, almost double the 39% in July. Republican attacks on Golden have also been effective, with his numbers with GOP voters dropping from -13 to -47. Theriault leads Golden 71% to 20% among GOP registrants, and the two are tied among independents. Golden's lead within his own party has also shrunk from 89% to 84%. The NRCC notes that Golden's flip-flopping on issues has led to 'negative news,' with 43% of voters not hearing good things about him. With 13 days to go, it's unclear if this will be enough to flip the seat in a closely divided Congress.

Theriault's name ID has increased, and he has gained support from the National Rifle Association after Golden endorsed a ban on assault weapons. According to the poll memo, 'Throughout the cycle, Donald Trump has led Kamala Harris, but a 2-point advantage in our July poll – conducted soon after Biden dropped out of the presidential race – has grown into a nine-point advantage in our mid-October polling.' This race is one of six that could determine control of the House in the next Congress, and Maine's unique electoral system could give the Republican ticket an advantage.

**Coast-to-coast warning signs for Blue Dogs**
Reps. Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) are facing tough reelection battles in their respective districts. Golden, a co-chair of the Blue Dogs, is running against Republican Austin Theriault in Maine's 2nd District, while Gluesenkamp Perez is facing Republican Joe Kent in Washington's 3rd District. Both Golden and Gluesenkamp Perez have won their seats in the past, but Republicans are projecting confidence in their ability to unseat them this time around. Golden has changed his stance on an assault weapons ban, which has been hammered by Republicans on the airwaves. Gluesenkamp Perez has also faced criticism from Republicans, who see her as vulnerable due to her lack of experience in politics. If Golden and Gluesenkamp Perez lose their seats, it would leave the Blue Dogs with only one co-chair, Rep. Mary Peltola (D-Alaska), who is also facing a tough reelection battle. Golden said, 'I don't plan to lose,' in a statement. Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Speaker Mike Johnson have been discussing their strategies for the final weeks of the election, with Jeffries focusing on Democrats' 'democracy' agenda and Johnson predicting a 'demographic shift' towards Republicans.

**LIVE UPDATES: Trump and Harris continue campaigning in battleground states following former president’s visit to McDonald’s**
Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden has released a new TV ad highlighting his work with Republicans and his efforts to appeal to crossover voters. The ad describes his work on behalf of key Maine constituencies, including lobstermen and loggers, and references issues motivating conservative voters, such as illegal immigration and border security. Golden says, 'Washington wasn't listening to me. So we brought Maine to Washington to deliver the message together.' His campaign has emphasized independence and highlighted rifts with his party. Golden is facing GOP candidate Austin Theriault, a former NASCAR driver, in the election for Maine's 2nd Congressional District. Republicans are poised to hold the edge in ad spending in the final two weeks of the contest, with about $3.4 million in remaining bookings compared to about $2.6 million for Democrats.

**1 year after Lewiston shooting: Will Jared Golden's assault weapons change sway election?**
U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat representing Maine's Second Congressional District, is facing a tough re-election challenge from Republican Austin Theriault. Golden's change of position on assault weapons after the Lewiston shooting may play a pivotal role in the outcome. Golden, a strong supporter of gun rights, has historically been at odds with the national party, but his shift in stance on assault weapons has led gun rights groups to turn on him. Theriault has repeatedly accused Golden of 'flip-flopping' on the Second Amendment. Golden has emphasized his support for law enforcement and his record in Congress, but hasn't focused as much on the Lewiston shootings as a defense. Outside groups have been funneling millions into the race, with much of the spending focused on gun rights. Professors Mark Brewer and James Melcher think Theriault's attacks and Golden's counterarguments have been effective, but are unsure which side is winning.

**Harris eyes a rural Maine congressional district in a hunt for every possible electoral vote**
Vice President Kamala Harris is focusing on Maine's 2nd Congressional District, a rural area that has been a stronghold for Donald Trump in the past two presidential elections. A poll suggests Harris could be competitive there, and Democrats are hoping to win back the potentially decisive electoral vote. The district is also home to a fierce congressional contest between Democratic incumbent Jared Golden and Republican challenger Austin Theriault. Both parties are spending money in Maine, but not a lot, with Democrats outspending Republicans on presidential advertising. The Trump campaign has outspent Harris, but her campaign has been boosted by outside advertising. Maine's 2nd District is geographically larger than the liberal 1st District, and its working-class economy is based on industries such as logging, potato farming, and lobster fishing. Gun rights are also a major issue in the district, with both Golden and Theriault emphasizing their support for the 2nd Amendment. 'I think it will be close, but I just don't know how it's going to go,' said Rob Rogers, a registered Democrat from Chesterville, Maine. 'Let me just say, in the presidential election, I'm astounded that the Republican Party can't do better,' he added. Maine Assistant House Majority Leader Kristen Cloutier said, 'I know I'll be getting out the vote every day from now until the election,' and 'there is a role for everyone.' Mark Brewer, a political scientist at the University of Maine, said, 'In some ways it would be hard for me to square the fact that Harris is doing better because that means Trump is doing worse. And it's hard for me to square that Trump is doing worse in the 2nd Congressional District while at the same time Austin Theriault is doing better than the last two Republicans.'

**Harris eyes a rural Maine congressional district in a hunt for...**
Vice President Kamala Harris is focusing on Maine's 2nd Congressional District, a rural area that has voted for Donald Trump in the past two presidential elections. A poll suggests Harris could be competitive in the district, which could be a crucial electoral vote for Democrats. The district is also home to a competitive congressional race between incumbent Democrat Jared Golden and Republican challenger Austin Theriault. Both parties are spending money in Maine, but not a lot, with Democrats outspending Republicans on presidential advertising. Harris has raised more than $3.4 million in Maine, while Trump has raised a little less than $800,000. Golden is outraising Theriault by about $6.6 million to $2.9 million. Maine's 2nd District is a key battleground in the presidential election, with multiple scenarios in which a single electoral vote could be decisive.

**Four House Democrats facing uphill battles in their districts**
Four House Democrats, Reps. Mary Peltola (AK), Yadira Caraveo (CO), Jared Golden (ME), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA), are facing uphill battles in their districts. Peltola, who flipped Alaska's at-large congressional seat in 2022, faces Nick Begich in a 'toss-up' race. Caraveo, who won a newly formed seat in Colorado in 2022, is facing Republican Gabe Evans in a tied race, according to a recent poll. Golden, who represents Maine's 2nd Congressional District, is facing Republican Austin Theriault in a 'toss-up' race. Perez, who won her seat in Washington's 3rd Congressional District in 2022, is facing a rematch against Republican Joe Kent in a 'toss-up' race. Democrats will need to net four seats to take control of the House, but these seats could see the incumbent lose and risk the Democrats' bid to win the majority.

**UMaine political scientist says undecided voters will decide tight District 2 congressional election**
According to a recent poll, the Second District Congressional seat in Maine is a tight race between Republican State Representative Austin Theriault and incumbent Democrat Jared Golden, with Theriault at 47% and Golden at 44%, and 9% undecided. Mark Brewer, a professor and chair of political science at the University of Maine, says undecided voters will be crucial in deciding the election. Brewer notes that the Golden campaign is trying to convince voters that Golden has done a good job and is an independent voice, while Theriault's campaign is trying to convince undecided voters that Golden is wrong for them on issues like guns. Brewer also mentions that the main issues for second district voters are the economy, guns, and abortion rights, and that both State Senate and State House majorities could shift with all seats up for grabs.

**4 key issues that could decide the 2nd District race, and control of Congress**
The 2nd Congressional District race between Jared Golden and Austin Theriault is a closely contested election. The candidates have differing views on several key issues, including the Inflation Reduction Act, gun rights, abortion access, and Trump tax cuts. Golden, a three-term Democratic incumbent, supports the Inflation Reduction Act, which he believes has brought real benefits to Maine families, including capping insulin at $35 and lowering health care premiums. Theriault, a first-term Republican state legislator, has criticized the bill, calling it 'wasteful tax credits and green energy schemes.' On gun rights, Golden has changed his position on an assault weapons ban, while Theriault has accused him of flip-flopping. Golden supports a woman's right to abortion access, while Theriault is 'pro-life' and has voted against expanding abortion access in Maine. Theriault supports renewing Trump tax cuts, while Golden wants to extend only the tax breaks benefiting middle-class families. 'I think they're questioning my patriotism and my dedication to freedom,' said Golden, responding to an ad calling him a 'turncoat' for his change of heart on gun rights.

**All eyes on Maine’s 2nd District as race heats up for U.S. House seat**
The 2nd District congressional race in Maine is heating up, with Democrat Jared Golden and Republican Austin Theriault vying for the seat. Golden, a three-term incumbent and former Marine, has been praised for his independent leadership, while Theriault, a one-term state legislator and former NASCAR driver, has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump. The race is considered a toss-up, with both sides viewing it as winnable. Golden has been criticized for not saying whom he plans to support for president, while Theriault has been accused of being a sycophant to Trump and House Republicans. The district is one of the few held by a Democrat but also won by Trump, making it a key battleground in the fight for control of the U.S. House of Representatives. As of Oct. 1, outside groups have spent about $6.8 million on the race, with more expected to come. The Associated Press reported that groups reserved nearly $16 million in airtime through the election.

**3 things we learned in debates between Jared Golden and Austin Theriault**
In the Maine's 2nd District election, U.S. Rep. Jared Golden and state Rep. Austin Theriault debated for the third and final time. The stakes are high, as the district was won by former President Donald Trump in 2020. Theriault, a Trump-endorsed Republican, has been trying to appeal to the median voter, while Golden has struggled with certain issues, including gun policy. Theriault has been pushing his message that Golden's stances are 'flip-flops' and has been trying to present himself as a more moderate candidate. Golden has been criticized for his nuanced set of positions on guns, and has shown discomfort on the issue. Theriault has been beating expectations, but has been avoiding being pinned down on thorny issues, instead offering small solutions to big problems. As the challenger, Theriault does not have to reckon with the tradeoffs that would come with implementing his solutions in Congress.

**Golden, Theriault trade jabs in final 2nd Congressional District debate**
The final debate between U.S. Rep. Jared Golden and state Rep. Austin Theriault in Maine's 2nd Congressional District covered familiar ground, with both candidates trading charges and countercharges on various issues. Theriault argued that Golden's supported bills contributed to inflation, while Golden pointed out that gasoline prices have decreased since he voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. Golden also accused Theriault of not wanting to crack down on companies hiring undocumented immigrants, while Theriault said he would impose stricter entry requirements and beef up border security. Theriault called Golden a 'flip-flopper' for shifting his position on banning assault weapons, while Golden said restricting access to 'some of these most dangerous firearms' would save lives. Both candidates agreed that illegal marijuana growing in Maine is often used to launder money. The election is on November 5, with early voting underway in many towns.

The district's incumbent, Democrat Jared Golden, is seeking a fourth term and has touted his independent record.

Voters like Megan McCollough are eager to cast their ballots, with many expressing frustration with the current state of politics, saying 'It's so two-sided. I wish everybody could get together and get along.'

**Jim Fossel: Maine poll shows Republican Party with room for cautious optimism**
A recent poll in Maine shows that Republican Party has room for cautious optimism. The Pan Atlantic Research quarterly omnibus poll gave Democratic Senator Angus King a 30-point lead and Representative Chellie Pingree a 25-point lead. However, Republican Austin Theriault is running four points ahead of incumbent Jared Golden in the 2nd District, which is a notable improvement. The poll also shows that the general mood of the electorate outside of heavily Democratic areas is tilting toward the GOP. Other issues such as cost of living, housing, high taxes, inflation, and immigration are also favoring the GOP. Democrats, however, remain the more disciplined and professional political organization in Maine, with more money and better organization. The question for Democrats is whether the issues that may be dooming Golden are systemic, and whether the lack of enthusiasm for Golden will harm Democrats running for the Legislature in the 2nd District.

**How Jared Golden and Austin Theriault actually disagree**
The article discusses the differences between Democratic incumbent Jared Golden and Republican challenger Austin Theriault in Maine's 2nd Congressional District. While the advertisements for the election portray Golden as wanting to gut Social Security and Theriault as a flip-flopper, the reality is that they are not as far apart on many issues as it seems. Golden has a long list of priorities and proposals on his website, including supporting labor and women's rights, and being tough on national security issues. Theriault's website, on the other hand, says nothing substantive about his agenda. The article highlights their differences on issues such as guns, abortion, Ukraine, and immigration. Golden has called for banning assault rifles and has expressed support for a package of reforms to address the border crisis, while Theriault has voted against measures to restrict gun ownership and has expressed skepticism about providing aid to Ukraine. Theriault has also made a clampdown on immigration his top priority, including funding the completion of Trump's border wall. The article notes that Golden has a consistent record of support for union and nonunion workers, while Theriault has failed to support labor-backed bills in Augusta. 'We should give the Ukrainians the things they need to win this war,' Golden said in 2023. Theriault has been more skeptical, insisting there is 'a clear contrast' between his stance and Golden's. 'I'll always protect Social Security and Medicare, no matter what party tries to cut them,' Theriault vowed a week ago.

**Jared Golden needs these voters to win a tough race in Maine's 2nd District**
U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a three-term congressman from Maine's 2nd District, is running for reelection in a conservative district that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020. Golden, who has an approval rating of 36% among his constituents, needs to balance his support for Vice President Kamala Harris without getting too close to her. Golden has said he will not vote for Trump, but has refused to say if he will vote for Harris. A recent poll showed that 16% of voters approve of both Harris and Golden, while 12% approve of Trump and Golden. However, 33% of voters are unsure how they feel about Golden's performance in the House, compared to 23% who are unsure about Harris and 10% who are unsure about Trump. Convincing these unsure voters could be crucial to Golden's prospects in the election.

**Republican pulls ahead of Maine Dem the GOP has long hoped to defeat**
In Maine's 2nd District, Republican candidate Austin Theriault is leading Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden 47% to 44% in a recent poll, with 9% of voters undecided. Golden is considered a vulnerable candidate due to former President Donald Trump's strong performance in the district in 2016 and 2020. Despite having a 20-point lead in polling in 2020, Golden has not endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and Trump leads her by 7% in the district. Golden's past opposition to gun control measures has been a point of contention, and Theriault has made his support of the Second Amendment a key part of his campaign strategy.

**Theriault holds slight lead over Golden in recent polling**
According to recent polling from Pan Atlantic Research, Austin Theriault, the Republican candidate for Maine's Second Congressional District, has a slight lead over incumbent Democrat Jared Golden. The lead is too close to call, with a margin of error of plus or minus five percent and 9% of voters undecided. Theriault has launched the 'Sportsmen for Austin' coalition, while Golden has launched the 'Seniors for Golden' coalition. Dr. Mark Brewer, chair of the Department of Political Science at the University of Maine, says creating coalitions is a typical strategy in Congressional races to show support from voters and highlight the interests of the candidates. 'A lot of voting behavior is group and identity-based,' he said. 'These kinds of coalitions can be important signals and ways to try and attract votes.'

**Poll shows Theriault and Golden locked in tight race in Maine's 2nd District**
A recent poll by Pan Atlantic Research shows a tight race between U.S. Rep. Jared Golden and his Republican challenger Austin Theriault in Maine's 2nd Congressional District. The poll found 47% of voters in favor of Theriault, 44% in favor of Golden, and 9% undecided. The undecided voters were more likely to be younger and registered independents or Democrats. The poll also found that Vice President Kamala Harris is leading former President Donald Trump in the 2nd District, but Trump is leading Harris in the 1st District. This could impact Maine's electoral votes, as the state awards two votes based on the statewide vote and one vote for each congressional district. The poll also asked voters about their support for referendum questions, with the majority supporting the majority of questions, except for the question about the state flag, which was split 40% 'yes' and 40% 'no'. The largest difference in support was shown for Question 1, which asks to set a $5,000 limit for giving to political action committees, with 69% in favor and 15% opposed.

The poll also shows Republican candidate Austin Theriault leading Democrat incumbent Rep. Jared Golden by three percentage points, 47% to 44%. Theriault said, 'There's some predictions that are saying it literally could come down to one electoral vote. And if that's the case, Maine's Second District will have a huge say in who wins the election.' He added, 'We're doing a lot of work in Maine's Second [Congressional] District to ensure that President Trump's victorious.'

**Rooks: Jared Golden marches to a different drummer**
Maine's 2nd District Democrat, Jared Golden, has been making waves with his independent stance on various issues. Despite being a Democrat, he has declined to vote for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on two occasions and has expressed support for President Joe Biden's opponents. Golden's views on presidential politics have been particularly contentious, including his prediction that Donald Trump would win the 2024 election and his statement that he was 'OK' with that. He has also switched sides on the issue of banning assault weapons, admitting that he was wrong in his previous opposition. Golden's stances have raised eyebrows among Democrats, but he remains the only viable candidate in the district. His opponent, Austin Theriault, is a first-term state representative with a brief career as a NASCAR driver and a limited legislative record. Despite Theriault's efforts, Golden's incumbency and the strong partisan allegiances in the district make it unlikely that he will be ousted. As Golden said, 'It's not easy to admit being wrong. But I believe I was.'

The ad focuses on Theriault's background as a working Mainer from Aroostook County and highlights his desire to bring balance and less extremism to Washington. Theriault's opponent, Jared Golden, already has a name recognition advantage, but Theriault's ad is notable for waiting until after Labor Day to be released. The ad does not mention Golden, instead focusing on Theriault's own message and qualifications. As the election season heats up, both candidates are facing attack ads from their opposing parties, which could impact the race.

**Exclusive -- ME Candidate Austin Theriault: Presidential Race Could Come Down to One Electoral Vote**
Maine congressional candidate Austin Theriault, a former NASCAR driver, stated that the presidential race could come down to a single electoral vote due to the state's unique electoral college system. Theriault explained that Maine awards one electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district and two to the statewide winner. He pointed out that some predictions show that the election could be decided by Maine's Second District and Nebraska's single electoral vote. Theriault emphasized the importance of his district in the election, stating, 'If that's the case, Maine's Second District will have a huge say in who wins the election.' He also criticized his opponent, Democrat Rep. Jared Golden, for changing his stance after being elected to Congress, saying, 'D.C. changed him.' Theriault stated that the Founding Fathers did not want career politicians, but rather statesmen who do what is right.

**Six Key Elections That Could Decide Control of the House in November**
Republicans have previously attempted to unseat Jared Golden, the Democratic representative who has held the second district of Maine for three terms. This time, they believe they have found the right candidate in Austin Theriault, a state legislator and former NASCAR driver. The parties have reserved around $16 million for political ads in a district that Trump won twice. A high figure in a relatively low-cost market. The planned spending is roughly divided equally between Republican and Democratic groups, according to AdImpact, which tracks political advertising purchases. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, visited the district this month and emphasized the importance of the election, saying, 'This is a critical election that will determine the future of our country.'
