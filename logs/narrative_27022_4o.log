INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, their faces lit by the glow of computer screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the big question. Were Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on Earth yesterday?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.87%. After the Starliner issues, NASA and SpaceX had backup plans to bring them back.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Reports up to August 6 indicated a high likelihood of a successful return. The thruster problem was resolved, and the helium leaks were patched.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
With the limited fuel timeline, they couldn't risk waiting any longer. The window was tight, but the odds were in their favor.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Incredible how precise our models are. They never miss.

The team shares a satisfied glance, knowing their predictions aligned with reality.

FADE OUT.

INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY - SEPTEMBER 16, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a screen displaying news from the previous day.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the thruster issues and helium leaks, the delay was inevitable. The probability of them being Earthside by September 15 was high.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but the indefinite delay announcement on June 13 raised doubts. Yet, the 45-day fuel window reported by Live Science was crucial.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
NASA's contingency plans were robust. We factored in the likelihood of alternate recovery missions.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And it seems they executed one. Both Williams and Wilmore are safe on Earth.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models never fail. The probability matched the reality.

They nod, satisfied with their accurate forecasting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The thruster issue was a major concern, but the backup plan was solid. Boeing's transparency improved.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And the fuel window? They managed it well.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. Reports from August 6 hinted at a contingency mission.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
NASA and SpaceX coordinated a Crew Dragon transfer. Ingenious!

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The odds were in their favor. A testament to human ingenuity.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(leans back, smiling)  
Both Williams and Wilmore are safely Earthside. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Another successful prediction. Our models never fail.

They exchange satisfied nods, their faith in the data unwavering.
