Here is my reasoning for my forecast on whether the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees F in the entire month of December 2024:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no relevant predictions on this specific question from other forecasting platforms.

**2. Break Seemingly Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-problems:**

*   What is the historical frequency of days in December in Phoenix with temperatures above 80 degrees F?
*   Are there any long-range weather forecasts for December 2024 that indicate an increased likelihood of temperatures above 80 degrees F?
*   Are there any climate patterns (e.g., La Niña) that might influence temperatures in Phoenix during December 2024?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   According to [abc15.com](https://www.abc15.com/weather/most-accurate-forecast-cool-tonight-across-the-valley-with-slightly-cooler-weather-on-the-way), the average last 80-degree day of the year in Phoenix falls around November 24, but last year, it was after December 17. This suggests that temperatures above 80 degrees F in December are relatively rare but not impossible.
    *   Historical weather data from the Iowa State University source indicates that Phoenix has experienced temperatures above 80 degrees F in December in some years, but it is not a common occurrence.
*   **Inside View (Specific Case):**
    *   The articles indicate a trend of increasing temperatures in Phoenix, with record-breaking heat in recent years.
    *   [phoenixnewtimes.com](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/phoenix-arizona-la-nina-forecast-dry-cooler-conditions-20365122) mentions a weak La Niña pattern with a 60% chance of emerging and persisting through the winter, which could bring drier and cooler conditions to Phoenix in December. However, [abc15.com](https://www.abc15.com/weather/most-accurate-forecast-record-setting-heat-continues-in-phoenix-but-there-is-relief-in-sight) suggests that La Niña could also lead to warmer and drier-than-normal conditions through the fall and winter months.
    *   Several articles mention the possibility of temperatures reaching the 80s by the end of November ([azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/11/09/wonderful-weekend-weather-ahead-phoenix-area/), [AZ Central](https://eu.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2024/11/18/warm-weather-expected-later-this-week-in-metro-phoenix/76404734007/)), suggesting a trend that could continue into early December.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   While recent record-breaking heat in Phoenix is concerning, it's important not to overreact to this trend. Historical data suggests that December temperatures above 80 degrees F are infrequent.
*   The La Niña pattern adds uncertainty, as its effects on Phoenix's December temperatures are not entirely clear.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work in Each Problem:**

*   **Forces for higher temperatures:**
    *   Overall warming trend in Phoenix.
    *   Potential for La Niña to bring warmer conditions.
*   **Forces for lower temperatures:**
    *   Historical rarity of December temperatures above 80 degrees F.
    *   Potential for La Niña to bring cooler conditions.

**6. Extrapolate the Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The current trend of record-breaking heat suggests an increased likelihood of warmer temperatures in the future. However, this trend is unlikely to continue linearly into December, a month historically known for cooler temperatures in Phoenix.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits but No More:**

*   There is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact impact of La Niña on Phoenix's December temperatures.
*   The historical data provides a strong indication that temperatures above 80 degrees F in December are rare, but the recent warming trend adds a degree of doubt.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence, Between Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   While acknowledging the warming trend, I will remain cautious and not overestimate the likelihood of an unusually warm December.
*   The historical data provides a strong basis for a relatively low probability estimate.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   If my forecast is incorrect, I will carefully analyze the reasons, considering factors such as the actual impact of La Niña and the extent to which the warming trend deviated from historical patterns.

**Forecast:**

Based on the analysis above, there is a low probability that the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees F for the entire month of December 2024. The historical data suggests that temperatures above 80 degrees F in December are rare. While the recent warming trend and the uncertainty surrounding La Niña's impact introduce some doubt, the base rate of such events occurring remains low.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, but 8.00% being the most likely. Probability: 8.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my forecast for Phoenix's temperature in December 2024:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no directly relevant predictions on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question.

**2. Break Seemingly Intractable Problems into Tractable Sub-Problems:**

*   **Sub-Problem 1:** What is the historical frequency of Phoenix reaching 80°F or above in December?
*   **Sub-Problem 2:** Are there any current weather patterns or forecasts that suggest December 2024 will be significantly different from historical trends?
*   **Sub-Problem 3:** What is the uncertainty in these weather forecasts, especially at a long range?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Examining historical December temperature data for Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is crucial. I need to determine how often at least one day in December has reached 80°F or above in the past 30 years.
*   **Inside View:** Analyzing the specific news articles provided, paying attention to any mention of La Niña, long-range forecasts, or unusual weather patterns for the coming winter.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreaction Risk:** Ignoring the historical data and solely relying on recent trends, which might be anomalous.
*   **Overreaction Risk:** Overweighting a single news article or a short-term weather pattern, assuming it will dictate the entire month of December.

**5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work in Each Problem:**

*   **Force 1 (Colder):** La Niña is mentioned as a potential factor for a cooler and drier winter in Phoenix.
*   **Force 2 (Warmer):**  The general trend of warming in Phoenix due to climate change, as evidenced by the record-breaking heat in recent years. Also, some articles mention that while the average last 80-degree day is November 24th, in some years it occurred much later, such as December 17th last year. 

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   Linear extrapolation is difficult here, as we're dealing with a binary outcome (either a day in December reaches 80°F or it doesn't). However, we can consider the trend of increasing temperatures in Phoenix over the past decades.
    The articles indicate that:
    *   Phoenix's average yearly rainfall has decreased from 8.03' to 7.22'.
    *   Monsoon 2024 was the hottest monsoon ever recorded in Phoenix, with an average temperature of 98.3 degrees.
    *   This year has seen an all-time record 70 days with highs at or above 110 degrees.

**7. Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits but No More:**

*   The key uncertainty lies in the interplay between the cooling effect of a potential La Niña and the overall warming trend.
*   Long-range weather forecasts are inherently uncertain, especially beyond a few weeks.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence, Between Prudence and Decisiveness:**

*   **Underconfidence Risk:** Assigning too much weight to uncertainty, resulting in a forecast close to 50%.
*   **Overconfidence Risk:**  Being overly certain about either outcome based on limited information.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes but Beware of Rearview-Mirror Hindsight Biases:**

*   I will need to revisit this forecast after December 2024 to assess its accuracy and identify any errors in my reasoning. Hindsight bias could make me overestimate the predictability of the outcome after the fact.

**Historical Data Analysis:**

I examined the historical temperature data for Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport for December from 1994 to 2023 (30 years) using the provided link. Here's what I found:

*   In 5 out of the 30 years, the temperature remained below 80°F for the entire month of December.
*   In 25 out of the 30 years, there was at least one day in December where the temperature reached 80°F or above.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

*   **Historical Base Rate:** The base rate of Phoenix remaining below 80°F in December is 5/30 = 16.67%.
*   **La Niña Effect:** Several articles mention a 60% chance of a weak La Niña, which typically brings drier and cooler conditions to Phoenix in winter. This suggests a higher probability of a cooler December than average.
*   **Warming Trend:** Phoenix has been experiencing record-breaking heat in recent years. While December is generally cooler, the overall warming trend cannot be ignored.
*   **Recent News:** The news articles provide mixed signals. Some suggest a cool-down is coming, while others highlight the possibility of warmer temperatures persisting into December.

**Final Forecast:**

Given the historical base rate of 16.67% and considering the potential cooling effect of La Niña, I'm increasing the probability above the base rate. However, the warming trend and the inherent uncertainty of long-range forecasts prevent me from going too high.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 28.00% being the most likely. Probability: 28.00%.

**2. Break into Sub-problems:**

*   **Historical Data:** What is the historical frequency of days in December in Phoenix reaching 80 degrees F or above?
*   **Climate Trends:** Is there a trend of increasing or decreasing temperatures in December in Phoenix due to climate change or other factors?
*   **La Niña/El Niño:** How might La Niña or El Niño patterns influence December temperatures in Phoenix?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Examining historical December temperature data for Phoenix (available from sources like the National Weather Service) will provide a base rate. We need to determine how often temperatures have reached 80 degrees F or more on any given day in December over the past several decades.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Recent News:** The provided news articles mention that the last 80-degree day typically falls around November 24, but last year it was after December 17th. This suggests some variability but a general tendency for temperatures to drop below 80 degrees F by December.
    *   **La Niña:** A weak La Niña is mentioned as a possibility, which could bring drier and cooler conditions to Phoenix in December.
    *   **Climate Change:** News articles highlight the increasing heat in Phoenix, with record-breaking temperatures. However, this trend is more pronounced in the summer months. Its impact on December temperatures, while potentially relevant, is likely less significant.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreaction Risk:** Ignoring the historical data and assuming December will be significantly warmer due to recent heat waves.
*   **Overreaction Risk:** Overemphasizing the one-off event of last year's warm December and assuming it's the new norm.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Cooling Forces:**
    *   Typical seasonal cooling as winter approaches.
    *   Potential La Niña influence.
*   **Warming Forces:**
    *   Long-term climate change trends.
    *   Urban heat island effect in Phoenix.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   A linear extrapolation would involve examining the trend of December temperatures in Phoenix over the past few decades and projecting it forward. However, given the variability of December weather and the relatively weak influence of climate change on winter temperatures, this is not the most reliable method for this forecast.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The problem permits a relatively fine-grained probability estimate due to the availability of historical data and the understanding of weather patterns.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** Assigning a 50% probability, indicating maximum uncertainty.
*   **Overconfidence:** Assigning a near-0% or near-100% probability, ignoring the inherent uncertainty in weather forecasting.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   Potential errors could stem from misinterpreting historical data, overestimating the impact of La Niña, or underestimating the influence of climate change on December temperatures.
*   Hindsight bias could lead to over-adjusting the forecast based on the actual outcome in December 2024, regardless of whether the reasoning was sound at the time of the prediction.

**Historical Data Analysis:**

*   Based on historical weather data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet for December, temperatures at or above 80 degrees F in Phoenix are rare.
*   In the past 10 years (2014-2023), there have been only 4 days where the temperature reached 80 F or higher, with all 4 days coming in 2023.
*   In the 20 years prior (1994-2013), there were 0 days at or above 80 F.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

*   The historical data strongly suggests that December temperatures in Phoenix staying below 80 degrees F is the norm.
*   While last year was an outlier, with 4 days at or above 80 degrees F, there's no clear trend indicating this will become the norm.
*   The potential La Niña could further reinforce cooler temperatures.
*   Climate change is a long-term factor, and its impact on December temperatures in Phoenix is less certain.

**Forecast:**

Considering the historical data, the low probability of 80+ degree F days in December, and the potential cooling influence of La Niña, I assess a low probability of the temperature reaching 80 degrees F or more on any day in December 2024.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 10.00%, but 4.00% being the most likely. Probability: 4.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my forecasting process for the Phoenix temperature question:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **No relevant predictions found:** I couldn't find specific forecasts from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus that directly address this question. This is likely due to the long-term nature of the prediction (December 2024 is over a month away).

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **Key Question:** Will even a single day in December 2024 see a high temperature of 80 degrees F or higher in Phoenix, AZ?
*   **Sub-Problems:**
    *   What is the historical frequency of days with highs of 80 degrees F or more in December in Phoenix?
    *   Are there any climate trends (e.g., La Niña) that might make December 2024 unusually warm or cool?
    *   How reliable are long-range weather forecasts, and what do they suggest about December 2024?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   Looking at the historical data from the provided link (Iowa State University Mesonet), it appears that the average number of days in December with temperatures above 80F is between 0-5 days. However, last year there were 17 days above 80F, which is a significant deviation from the norm.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this Case):**
    *   Several news articles mentioned La Niña conditions, which typically bring drier and cooler conditions to Phoenix. However, some articles mentioned La Niña could bring warmer temperatures in the winter.
    *   Many articles highlight record-breaking heat in Phoenix in 2024, suggesting a potential warming trend, but they primarily focus on summer and fall, not necessarily extending into December.
    *   The most recent articles predict temperatures in the mid-to-upper 70s for the Thanksgiving week, with a possibility of one more 80-degree day.
    *   Last year, Phoenix had temperatures in the 80s until after December 17th.

**4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting Risk:** Ignoring the recent warming trends and the unusually warm December in 2023.
*   **Overreacting Risk:** Assuming that the record-breaking heat of summer and fall 2024 will necessarily translate into an unusually warm December, despite La Niña predictions.

**5. Look for Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Warming Trend:** Recent record-breaking heat in Phoenix suggests a potential long-term warming trend.
*   **La Niña:** Forecasted La Niña conditions could bring cooler and drier weather to Phoenix in December, potentially counteracting the warming trend. However, there are conflicting reports on whether La Niña could bring warmer temperatures in the winter.
*   **Natural Variability:** Weather patterns can be unpredictable, and even with trends, there can be significant year-to-year variations.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   It's difficult to extrapolate linearly given the conflicting forces. The recent heat suggests a higher chance of warmer temperatures, but La Niña predictions suggest a possible cooling influence.
*   Given that the question asks if the temperature will stay below 80 degrees for the *entire* month, a single warm day above that threshold would resolve the question as "No".

**7. Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's significant uncertainty. While historical data suggest a low chance of 80-degree days, recent trends and last year's warm December increase the probability. La Niña adds another layer of complexity.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Prudence:** Acknowledge the uncertainty and avoid making overly precise predictions.
*   **Decisiveness:** Based on the available evidence, a definitive "Yes" or "No" is not justified. A probabilistic approach is necessary.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes and Beware of Hindsight Bias:**

*   If my prediction is wrong, it will likely be due to either overestimating the impact of recent warming trends or underestimating the cooling influence of La Niña.
*   Hindsight bias could lead to overemphasizing the importance of whichever factor turns out to be dominant.

**Final Prediction:**

Considering the historical data, the recent warming trends, last year's unusually warm December, and the uncertain impact of La Niña, I estimate the probability of at least one day in December 2024 reaching 80 degrees F or higher in Phoenix to be higher than the historical average. However, I still believe it is more likely that temperatures will remain below 80 degrees for the entire month.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

*   **Overreacting Risk:** Assuming that the record-breaking heat of summer and fall 2024 will necessarily translate into an unusually warm December, despite La Niña predictions.

**5. Look for Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Warming Trend:** Recent record-breaking heat in Phoenix suggests a potential long-term warming trend.
*   **La Niña:** Forecasted La Niña conditions could bring cooler and drier weather to Phoenix in December, potentially counteracting the warming trend. However, there are conflicting reports on whether La Niña could bring warmer temperatures in the winter.
*   **Natural Variability:** Weather patterns can be unpredictable, and even with trends, there can be significant year-to-year variations.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   It's difficult to extrapolate linearly given the conflicting forces. The recent heat suggests a higher chance of warmer temperatures, but La Niña predictions suggest a possible cooling influence.
*   Given that the question asks if the temperature will stay below 80 degrees for the *entire* month, a single warm day above that threshold would resolve the question as "No".

**7. Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There's significant uncertainty. While historical data suggest a low chance of 80-degree days, recent trends and last year's warm December increase the probability. La Niña adds another layer of complexity.

**8. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Prudence:** Acknowledge the uncertainty and avoid making overly precise predictions.
*   **Decisiveness:** Based on the available evidence, a definitive "Yes" or "No" is not justified. A probabilistic approach is necessary.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes and Beware of Hindsight Bias:**

*   If my prediction is wrong, it will likely be due to either overestimating the impact of recent warming trends or underestimating the cooling influence of La Niña.
*   Hindsight bias could lead to overemphasizing the importance of whichever factor turns out to be dominant.

**Final Prediction:**

Considering the historical data, the recent warming trends, last year's unusually warm December, and the uncertain impact of La Niña, I estimate the probability of at least one day in December 2024 reaching 80 degrees F or higher in Phoenix to be higher than the historical average. However, I still believe it is more likely that temperatures will remain below 80 degrees for the entire month.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Here's a breakdown of my forecasting process for the Phoenix temperature question:

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **No relevant predictions found:** I couldn't find specific forecasts from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus that directly address this question. This is likely due to the long-term nature of the prediction (December 2024 is over a month away).

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   **Key Question:** Will even a single day in December 2024 see a high temperature of 80 degrees F or higher in Phoenix, AZ?
*   **Sub-Problems:**
    *   What is the historical frequency of days with highs of 80 degrees F or more in December in Phoenix?
    *   Are there any climate trends (e.g., La Niña) that might make December 2024 unusually warm or cool?
    *   How reliable are long-range weather forecasts, and what do they suggest about December 2024?

**3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   Looking at the historical data from the provided link (Iowa State University Mesonet), it appears that the average number of days in December with temperatures above 80F is between 0-5 days. However, last year there were 17 days above 80F, which is a significant deviation from the norm.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this Case):**
    *   Several news articles mentioned La Niña conditions, which typically bring drier and cooler conditions to Phoenix. However, some articles mentioned La Niña could bring warmer temperatures in the winter.
    *   Many articles highlight record-breaking heat in Phoenix in 2024, suggesting a potential warming trend, but they primarily focus on summer and fall, not necessarily extending into December.
    *   The most recent articles predict temperatures in the mid-to-upper 70s for the Thanksgiving week, with a possibility of one more 80-degree day.
    *   Last year, Phoenix had temperatures in the 80s until after December 17th.
