[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, the morning after the Brandenburg state election. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election results over coffee.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We predicted a 12.45% chance of AfD landing between 28-30%, and they ended up at 31.2%."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at the data we had until September 12th, the trends were clear. The surge we saw in Thuringia and Saxony was a strong indicator, but Brandenburg's historical voting patterns and local dynamics suggested they'd push even higher."

Nate: "The economic anxiety and immigration concerns we tracked in eastern Germany were particularly intense in Brandenburg. Our models captured that momentum."

Philip: "Yes, and the last-minute polling restrictions actually helped our prediction. Sometimes less information leads to clearer signals. The 12.45% probability reflected the real uncertainty while correctly suggesting they'd likely exceed the range."

[They both nod, turning to their next forecast]

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING AFTER BRANDENBURG ELECTION

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, newspapers scattered around them. Through the window, German flags flutter in the autumn breeze.*

NATE
(stirring coffee)
Well, Philip, our models were spot-on again. With all the data we had up to September 12th, we predicted a 22.15% probability of AfD landing between 28-30%.

PHILIP
(nodding)
Indeed. The surge we saw in Thuringia and Saxony made this range plausible, but Brandenburg's historical voting patterns and local dynamics kept our probability moderate. The polls were showing momentum, but not quite enough to push them into that specific window.

NATE
The rising cost of living concerns and immigration debates gave them a boost, but not enough to hit that narrow band. Our models captured the regional variations perfectly.

PHILIP
Another testament to the power of precise probabilistic thinking.

*They clink their coffee cups*

[Scene: A dimly lit café in Berlin, the morning after the Brandenburg state election. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sharing coffee and reviewing election results.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 12.45% probability that AfD would land between 28-30% in Brandenburg."

Philip: "Indeed. They ended up at 31.2%. The surge we saw in Thuringia and Saxony was a strong indicator they'd exceed the 30% mark here too. Those protest votes against the traffic light coalition really added up."

Nate: "The polls leading up to September 12th showed growing frustration with mainstream parties. Rising energy costs, immigration concerns... all pointing to a stronger showing than that 28-30% window."

Philip: "Fascinating how the eastern states continue to show stronger AfD support than the west. Though I must say, even with their gains, they still couldn't form a government due to other parties' refusal to cooperate."

[They both nod knowingly, turning to their data screens]
