**Clear Winner? Donald Trump Narrows Gap with Kamala Harris in New York, Poll Shows Democratic Stronghold Weakening**
A recent Siena College poll shows a surprising shift in voter sentiment in New York, with former President Donald Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by only 12 points. This marks a significant departure from the 2020 election, when Joe Biden carried the state by a 23% margin. According to the poll, Harris could be poised to deliver the weakest Democratic performance in New York since 1988. As Democrats face mounting pressure to reinforce their positions in key states, Harris's ability to maintain strong support in New York could prove critical in the 2024 election. As one observer notes, 'New York has long been a Democratic stronghold, but the narrowing margin underscores challenges for Harris in solidifying the base.'

**Trump stumps on Long Island, vowing to ‘win New York' after losing big twice**
Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win, saying 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' Election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, but Trump's campaign is trying to shore up GOP voters who are skeptical of him. Trump thanked vulnerable Republican representatives and cited surveys showing rank-and-file support in the Teamsters union, which he claimed sided with him. He also repeated his claims of a 'third-world nation' and 'invasion' at the US-Mexico border, and defended his 2016 pitch to Black voters, which was widely viewed as offensive. Trump also used the rally to recount Sunday's apparent assassination attempt and blamed Democrats for using language that he claims is a threat to democracy.

**Trump prepares to prove his New York prediction wrong for the third time**
Donald Trump has repeatedly predicted that he will win New York's electoral votes in his presidential bids, despite losing the state by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020. In an interview with the New York Post, Trump said, 'I'll solve the crime problem. I'll solve their tax problem. I'll solve all their problems. Who would not vote for me?' However, Trump went on to lose by more than 20 points again. A new poll by Siena College shows Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in the state, which is closer than the results of actual voting have been over the past two decades. Trump's optimism is likely rooted in the Republican Party's success in the state in 2022, but it's unlikely that he will win New York this time around, given the state's history of favoring Democratic candidates.

**Trump stumps on Long Island vowing to ‘win New York' after losing big twice**
Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win this time. He mocked his doubters, saying 'I said, 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' We're going to win,' he said. However, election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, and Trump's claims have been met with skepticism. Trump also used the rally to defend his past comments on immigration and crime, and to attack his opponents, including Vice President Kamala Harris. He repeated misrepresentations about Harris's record and blamed Democrats for a recent assassination attempt on him. Trump also fundraised during his visit and held meetings with donors. 'New York is sending Donald Trump back with a Republican Congress to work with,' former Rep. Lee Zeldin said in one of the warm-up speeches before Trump. 'New York was a battleground in 2022, and New York is a battleground again in 2024.'

**Trump Declares He'll Win State He Lost by 23 Points Twice: 'We're Gonna Win New York!'**
Former President Donald Trump held a campaign rally in New York, stating that he will win the state in the upcoming general election. Trump lost New York by 23 points in 2016 and 2020, but said, 'We're going to win New York!' and 'I can win New York and we can win New York.' He pledged to reduce taxes, crime, and stress, while increasing incomes and love for the state. However, a poll conducted in August shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump by 16 points. This was Trump's second rally in New York in recent months.

**US Elections 2024: Key states for Trump to secure victory in the presidential poll**
As of two days before the election, the New York Times national average shows Harris slightly ahead with 49 per cent compared to Trump's 48 per cent. To secure victory, Trump needs to win key states in the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt, including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina. According to polling averages, Trump's best chance to reach 270 electoral votes involves winning Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, assuming he holds onto all the states he won in 2020. Currently, Trump is ahead by two points in Georgia and leads North Carolina by a narrow margin, while Harris is slightly ahead in Pennsylvania.

**US Presidential Election: Pennsylvania Key to Harris or Trump's Victory**
The 2024 US presidential election is expected to be one of the closest and most contentious in American history. According to a New York Times public opinion tracker, as of Sunday, all seven swing states were roughly tied. Trump had a 3-point lead in Arizona, while the other six states were within one point of each other. The election is expected to be decided by a small margin, with 43,000 votes making the difference in 2020. Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, is the most crucial state in the seven swing states. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to win North Carolina or Georgia, which have voted for Democratic candidates only three times in the past four decades. On the other hand, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win Wisconsin or Michigan, which have voted for Republican candidates only once in the past four decades. Both Harris and Trump have focused heavily on Pennsylvania, with the two campaigns and their allies spending $279.3 million on advertising in the state, more than in any other state. The outcome of the election will depend on the results in these seven swing states, with the winner needing to secure 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win the presidency.

**Here's the key to reading the tight polls and predicting a Trump win**
The author of a New York Post piece predicting Donald Trump's win in the 2024 presidential election explains how they derived their numbers. They argue that the key to reading tight polls is understanding the balance between Democrats and Republicans among voters, or partisan preference. The author notes that pollsters use weighting methods to adjust for demographic differences, but these methods can be flawed. They use data from two recent national polls to show how different weighting methods can produce different results. The author then averages the findings of each poll to estimate the partisan breakdown, which shows Harris leading with Democrats by 89 points and Trump leading with Republicans by 87 points. They use this estimate to compute the national popular vote totals under different partisan scenarios, concluding that Trump would win the popular vote by a 0.46-point margin in an R+2 electorate. The author predicts the popular vote percentages, with Harris winning by 1.3 points, and uses this to call the Electoral College. They argue that Trump would carry every swing state, giving him 312 electoral votes to Harris' 229. However, they mention three reasons why Harris could still win: a D-friendly electorate, Harris doing better with independents, or a dramatic reduction in the Electoral College gap. They reject each of these possibilities, citing data on voter registration and poll analysis. The author concludes that the cumulative weight of the evidence suggests Trump has the better chance of prevailing.

**How final NYT-Siena poll compares to 2016, 2020 elections**
The final New York Times/Siena College poll for the 2024 presidential election shows a slight edge for Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump in all but one swing state. Harris led by three points in Nevada, 2 points in North Carolina and Wisconsin, 1 point in Georgia, and had the advantage in a virtual tie in Pennsylvania. Trump had the advantage in a virtual tie in Michigan and a four-point lead in Arizona. Analysis by The New York Times found that late deciders were breaking for Harris, with 55% of those who only recently decided on their vote backing her compared to 44% for Trump. The poll was conducted between October 24 and November 2, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points within each state. 'While the polls aren't so precise that you can trust they'll nail a tight election, you can't assume that the polls will badly err again, either, as they did in 2016 or 2020,' wrote Cohn, chief political analyst for the Times. 'It's hard to overstate how traumatic the 2016 and 2020 elections were for many pollsters. For some, another underestimate of Mr. Trump could be a major threat to their business and their livelihood. For the rest, their status and reputations are on the line.'

**US Presidential Election 2024: Harris and Trump in a Close Contest in Swing States**
According to a final poll conducted by The New York Times in collaboration with Siena College, the US presidential election is still a close contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump in the seven swing states in the country two days before the election. Harris is leading by a small margin in Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, while Trump is leading by a small margin in Arizona. The two are neck and neck in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, according to the poll, which included 7,879 potential voters in the seven states from October 24 to November 2. In all seven states, the contests were within the margin of error in the poll, which was 3.5%. The poll showed that about 40% of participants had already voted, and Harris is leading among these voters by 8 percentage points, while Trump is leading among voters who say they are likely to vote but have not yet done so. The results also show that Trump is gaining momentum in Pennsylvania, a state where Harris had been leading by 4 percentage points in all previous polls conducted by The New York Times. The two candidates are campaigning in swing states this week, with Trump scheduled to appear in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia on Sunday, while Harris will campaign in Michigan.

**Harris and Trump in a Tight Race: Who Will Win the 2024 US Presidential Election?**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, and the two main candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are in a tight race. According to various polls, Harris is leading with a narrow margin. FiveThirtyEight's analysis shows Harris with a 1.2-point lead, while Newsweek's poll gives Trump a 1.2-point lead. Nate Silver's firm, Silver Bulletin, also shows Harris with a 1.1-point lead. The New York Times' poll gives Harris a 1-point lead. However, some polls show Trump leading, such as the RealClearPolitics poll, which gives Trump a 0.3-point lead. The Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris with a 2-point lead, while the Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Harris with a 1-point lead. The CNBC poll shows Trump with a 2-point lead. The Wall Street Journal's poll shows Trump with a 2-point lead. Some polls show the two candidates tied, such as the Emerson College poll, which shows both candidates with a 49% share. The CNN poll also shows the two candidates tied. The betting sites also show Trump as the favorite, with a 59% chance of winning. However, some polls show Harris leading in certain states, such as Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. The outcome of the election will be determined by the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. Trump won the election in 2016 despite losing the popular vote, and some analysts believe that he may win again this year. However, it's worth noting that anket results have been inaccurate in the past, and some analysts believe that the 2024 election will be no exception.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Trump or Harris? Latest Polls Show Narrow Lead for Harris**
With just three days to go until the US presidential election, it's still unclear who will win between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. According to the FiveThirtyEight website, which aggregates national polls, Harris is currently leading with 48% of projected votes, compared to 46.8% for Trump. The New York Times also reports a narrow lead for Harris, with 49% of the vote compared to 48% for Trump. Harris has maintained her position as the front-runner since early August, when she took the lead from Trump. However, her lead has been narrowing in recent weeks, with a 0.1-point decline since last Monday. At its peak in late August, Harris's lead was 3.7 points, but it has since stabilized between 2.5 and 3 points in September and has now decreased to 1.4 points.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest Polls and Predictions Trump vs. Harris, Who Will Win?**
With the US presidential election just days away, the latest national polls show a tight competition between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump. According to recent polls by The New York Times, Harris is currently leading Trump by less than 1 percentage point, her smallest lead since polling began. The polls also show a close competition in the 7 key states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. While Trump is leading in three of these states, Harris is ahead in Wisconsin and Michigan, and the two are tied in Nevada and North Carolina. The New York Times notes that Trump could still win if the polls are underestimating him, as he did in 2016 and 2020. On the other hand, Harris could easily win if the polls are also underestimating her, as they did in the 2022 legislative elections. The outcome of the election will depend on the votes in each state, with a candidate needing at least 270 electoral votes to win, more than half of the total 538 members of the Electoral College.

**2024 US Presidential Election Too Close to Call**
The 2024 US presidential election is too close to call, with polls showing a tie between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The latest polls from the New York Times and CNN show a 48-48 and 47-47 split, respectively. According to the 538 polling aggregator, Kamala Harris was leading Donald Trump by 1.4 percentage points on October 26. In the seven swing states that will determine the electoral college votes, the polls show the presidential race is neck and neck or within one or two points for either candidate. Democrats believe Kamala Harris is ahead in the minimum number of states needed to win 270 electoral college votes: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the single congressional district of Nebraska. The article suggests that Trump's chances of winning are due to a combination of conjunctural and structural factors, including the economy, the national and international context, and the electoral college system. The article also notes that the Democratic Party is more centrist than progressive, and that Kamala Harris's campaign is focused on winning over Republican voters. The article concludes that the election is too close to call, and that the outcome will depend on a variety of factors, including voter turnout and the performance of the candidates in the swing states.

**All Eyes on New York**
New York, once considered a solid blue state, has become a battleground in the upcoming election. After President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance, Donald Trump's electoral prospects looked bright, and his campaign set its sights on light-blue states like New York. Pre-debate polls showed Biden up by only 7 to 8 points in New York, and Democrats started sounding the alarm. However, the president's decision to drop out of the race and endorse Kamala Harris has calmed the nerves of Democrats, and Harris now holds a 19-point advantage over Trump in New York. Despite this, Trump remains confident, declaring, 'We can win New York. We're going to win New York.' His final rally in New York was held at Madison Square Garden, where nearly 20,000 supporters filled the arena. Many attendees expressed confidence in Trump's chances, with one attendee saying, 'I believe that [Trump's] going to win about 75 percent of New York.' However, the state's drift to the right is not just a figment of the conservative imagination, and the real New York races to watch on Election Day are in the suburbs, where Republicans are hoping to defend their seats and maintain the GOP majority.

**US Presidential Election: Trump and Harris Neck and Neck**
With less than a week to go before the US presidential election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are neck and neck, according to a daily average of polls conducted by the New York Times. Both candidates can count on states that will give them at least 200 electoral votes, but to win, they need 270. This election will likely be decided by seven swing states: Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona. According to the New York Times data, Kamala Harris currently leads in Wisconsin and Michigan, while the candidates are tied in Nevada and North Carolina. Trump has a 1-point lead in Pennsylvania, but has lost 1 point in this state recently. In contrast, the Republican candidate leads Harris by 2 points in Georgia and by 3 points in Arizona, where the trend is favorable to him. It's worth noting that there is a margin of error in these polls, even if it is small. It's entirely possible that one candidate or the other will win most or all of these seven swing states. According to the New York Post, Donald Trump would be on the 'brink of victory' in three swing states that Joe Biden won in 2020. A CBS-YouGov poll reported by the New York Post shows Trump and Harris tied at 49% in Pennsylvania, a state that Joe Biden won by 1.17 points in 2020. The same poll shows Harris leading Trump by 1 point in Arizona, but notes that the margin of error is large. In 2020, Joe Biden won Arizona by only 0.3 points. A victory for Donald Trump is also emerging in Nevada. In 2020, Joe Biden won this state by three points, but as of October 29, 2024, the 1-point advantage that Harris had until then has turned into a 1-point advantage for Trump. In these two states (Arizona and Nevada), the survey shows that only 8% of voters are willing to change their minds. The motivations of voters differ depending on the candidate they support.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in a Virtual Tie**
The US presidential election is underway, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris neck and neck in the polls. According to a CNN survey, both candidates have 47% of the vote, with Harris losing 1 point compared to a previous survey in September. The survey also found that 50% of voters who are certain of their choice support Harris, while 49% support Trump. However, the CNN notes that 'it is likely that Harris has received more votes than Trump so far, given the higher propensity of Democrats to vote early or by mail.' The New York Times/Siena College survey also found a virtual tie, with Harris at 48%. The CNN predicts a 60% chance of the winner receiving more than 300 electoral votes, which would indicate a non-competitive election. However, the analyst notes that 'if all the swing states go in the same direction, it's possible that Harris could receive 319 electoral votes (against 219 for Trump), or that Trump could receive 312 electoral votes (against 226 for Harris).'

**Confidence and Panic: The State of Mind of Trump Supporters and Democrats**
Vivek Ramaswamy, a supporter of Donald Trump, has stated that New York is a 'pivot state', despite the fact that Kamala Harris is leading in the polls with 54.6% of the intentions of vote compared to 39.4% for Donald Trump. This confidence is reflected in the state of mind of many Trump supporters, who are predicting a landslide victory for the former president. Meanwhile, Democrats are nervous and anxious, with many of their strategists, candidates, and celebrities expressing their doubts and fears about the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris. According to a recent article by Axios, many Democrats are privately expressing their concerns that Harris may lose, despite the polls indicating a close race. 'Why are Democrats nervous? Because they are Democrats,' wrote Josh Marshall, editor-in-chief of Talking Points Memo, in 2020. 'Independently of objective realities, Democrats will always anticipate a defeat or worry about it, while Republicans will always be confident in their victory.' The 2022 midterm elections illustrated this phenomenon, with Republicans predicting a red wave that would give them a majority in both the House and Senate, while Democrats were worried about their chances. However, the final result showed that Democrats increased their majority in the Senate and limited their losses in the House. 'It's not a rule, but it's almost a law of American politics,' Marshall wrote. 'Donald Trump may win the election, but the current polls do not justify the triumphalism of some Republicans, nor do they justify the panic of some Democrats.'

**Trump vs. Harris: Who's Leading in New York?**
With just days to go before the US presidential elections on November 5, 2024, candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns to win over voters and secure the White House for the 2024-2028 term. In New York, early voting has begun, and many residents have cast their ballots, showing strong support for presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who is leading by a significant margin in the state's polls. According to a Fivethirtyeight.com poll from October 29, Harris is leading Trump by +15.2 points, with 54.6% of voters intending to vote for her compared to 39.4% for Trump. This reflects strong support from New York citizens and some Latinos living in the state for the Democratic candidate and current Vice President Kamala Harris. If she wins, she will take all 28 of New York's electoral votes.

**What the polls are saying in the final week before the 2024 election**
With the 2024 presidential election just seven days away, the latest national polls and swing state surveys show a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. According to the Silver Bulletin, FiveThirtyEight, and the New York Times, Harris is leading in the popular vote by a narrow margin of less than two percentage points, with 49% of the vote compared to Trump's 48%. In the seven battleground states, the polls are also extremely close, with no candidate holding a material lead. Nate Cohn, the Times' chief pollster, noted that 'the battleground states remain extraordinarily tight.' If the swing-state polling averages hold true, Trump would win the Electoral College in the Silver Bulletin and FiveThirtyEight models, while Harris would emerge victorious in the New York Times averages.

**How Donald J. Trump Can Win New York State**
Donald Trump's recent rally at Madison Square Garden was a huge success, with 20,000 seats sold out in 3 hours and tens of thousands watching on big screens outside. Experts may be writing off Trump's chances of winning New York State, but his campaign strategy, which includes visiting minority neighborhoods and speaking with locals, has shown promise. Trump's polling numbers in NYC have recently increased to 27%, and factoring in his history of under polling, he may be at 30% or higher. To win, Trump only needs to flip a little over half of those who voted for someone other than Lee Zeldin in the 2022 election, who were disaffected and angry over Democratic policies. As Trump has overcome odds steeper than this before, it's not impossible for him to win. 'Experts' writing off any chance of the former president winning the Empire State could be overlooking the 2022 run Lee Zeldin made against Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul, where Zeldin got 30% of the vote and lost by less than 6 points, after repeatedly saying that if he won 35% of the vote in NYC, he'd be NY's chief executive.

**Is Harris losing ground to Trump? What NYT/Siena poll says about popular vote**
The final poll before the 2024 US presidential election from The New York Times and Siena College shows Vice President Kamala Harris losing her 3 percentage point lead against former President Donald Trump. The latest polls found Harris deadlocked with Trump at 48% each, sparking predictions of Harris losing the popular vote to Trump. This would be the first time the Democratic ticket loses the popular vote since the last four elections. The poll also found that only 28% of respondents believe the US is heading in the right direction, which is negative for Harris' standing. The poll was conducted on October 20-23 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Neck and Neck in Polls**
With just a few days left before the US presidential election on November 5, the contest between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remains intense. According to polls, the election is expected to be polarized, with both candidates neck and neck in the popular vote and key states. As reported by 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight', the current projections indicate that Donald Trump has a slight advantage over Kamala Harris and would win the election. However, the outcome is still uncertain, and the election will likely be decided by individual votes. 'The New York Times' and 'FiveThirtyEight' use different methodologies, which may result in varying numbers. To win the election, a candidate needs to secure 270 out of 538 electoral votes. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets all of that state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. Currently, the polls indicate that Kamala Harris has a numerical advantage, but Donald Trump is leading in the national average. According to 'The New York Times', Kamala Harris has 49% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 48%. 'FiveThirtyEight' reports that Kamala Harris has 48.2% of the vote, while Donald Trump has 46.4%.

**Can Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump? Latest poll updates from the 2024 election**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a tight race. According to the latest polls, Harris is just one point ahead of Trump in several polls, with neither candidate leading by more than a few points in the seven swing states. Harris has a 1.7-point lead over Trump in the national polls, but this gap has closed over the last month. The Washington Post/Schar School megapoll found Harris with 49 percent of the vote and Trump with 48 percent. The poll also showed that 37 percent of registered voters will 'definitely' back Harris, and 37 percent will support Trump. Meanwhile, 10 percent of swing state voters say they will 'probably' support Trump or Harris. The economy, healthcare, and threats to democracy are the top issues for voters in this election. Climate change ranks lowest on the list of priorities for swing state voters this year. The latest polls from the New York Times/Siena College have Harris ahead by 3 points, at 49 percent and Trump at 46 percent. The strongest support group for Harris remains young voters and those from non-white backgrounds. Trump's key base are white, non-college voters. The Republican Party has won the over-65 set in every election since 2000, but this year's polls show that older generations of voters are no longer staunchly Republican. 'We still have a lot of work to do to maximize our gains in this critical Senate election [...] We also have to guard our flanks,' writes the memo's author Steven Law, head of the Senate Leadership Fund. The memo also warns that strongholds like Nebraska and Texas could be at risk from independent and Democratic candidates.

**Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a Tight Race Ahead of 2024 US Presidential Election**
With less than three weeks to go before the 2024 US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck. According to recent polls by FiveThirtyEight, Harris leads Trump by 2.5 points, with 48.5% of the vote compared to 46.1% for the former president. However, Trump is gaining ground, and undecided voters may still play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election. A map by 270towin shows that Trump is gaining support in states like Texas, Florida, and Minnesota, while Harris is losing ground in states like California, Illinois, and New York, although she is making gains in Oregon and Colorado.

**US Presidential Election: Who Will Win, Polls, and Voting Date**
With three weeks to go before the US presidential election, polls show Democratic candidate Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by three to five percentage points. However, The New York Times notes that 'simple math proves the inevitable defeat of the Republican candidate.' But, as we know, Trump won in 2016, defying expectations. The paper suggests that the polls may have been flawed, with social scientists focusing on the wrong statistics or being influenced by their clients. The current polls show a three-percentage-point lead for Harris, but other surveys give Trump a 1.2% lead. The outcome of the election will depend on the number of electoral votes each candidate receives, with 583 votes in total. In most states, the winner takes all, so a candidate can win by a large margin but still lose the election. The current polls show Trump leading in six of the seven 'swing' states, but the margin is very small. The situation in these states will be crucial in determining the outcome of the election. Meanwhile, financial markets are predicting a Trump victory, with a 56% chance of him winning, according to the Polymarket website. 'This is a game of margins,' says Harris's advisor, David Plouffe. 'Any poll showing a 4-5 point lead for Harris or Trump in one of these seven states, ignore it.' The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Trump and Harris in Close Contest in Swing States**
The US presidential election 2024 remains a close contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Recent polls in two swing states, Pennsylvania and Arizona, show different results. In Pennsylvania, Harris is leading by four points, while Trump has increased his lead in Arizona to five points. However, the New York Times notes that neither Trump nor Harris can be certain of their victory in these crucial swing states. Other polls from reputable institutes suggest that the races in both states will be much closer. According to average poll values, Harris is leading in Pennsylvania by just one percentage point, and Trump's lead in Arizona is also small. Interestingly, a Republican-sponsored poll (SoCalStrategies) recently showed Harris leading in Arizona. The NY Times/Siena polls are considered highly reliable in the US. In Pennsylvania, the poll result seems to confirm the trend of the past few days, with a separate poll in a district that reflects the demographics of the state showing Harris leading by three points. Additionally, data on mail-in voting in Pennsylvania suggests that registered Democrats have voted more frequently than registered Republicans. However, it remains unclear how large the lead will be on election day, November 5. Analyst Joshua Smithley estimates that Harris will need a lead of around 390,000 mail-in votes to win in Pennsylvania.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
As the US presidential election approaches on November 5, 2024, recent polls in New York have shown a significant lead for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris over Republican candidate Donald Trump. According to a poll by FiveThirtyEight, Harris has maintained a lead of over 14 percentage points since October 1, with 53.8% of the vote. The Hill's data collection, which began in August, shows a narrowing gap between the candidates, but Harris still leads by 16%. New York is considered a 'blue' state, where Democrats have historically received strong support. The state's 28 electoral votes are crucial in the election, as a candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win. Harris has been leading in several recent polls in New York, including a survey by ActiVote, which found that she leads Trump by 21.2% with 60.6% of the vote, while Trump has 39.4%. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted that the economy is the top issue for 37% of New York voters, followed by affordability of housing, immigration, threats to democracy, and crime.

**2024 election update: Trump books MSG rally; latest polls, news | Oct. 9**
Donald Trump has scheduled a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York on October 27, as the 2024 presidential election approaches. According to a recent poll, Trump is ahead in Florida by 13 points, 55% to 41%. Trump has also been campaigning in other Democratic states, including California and Colorado. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to Las Vegas and Arizona, and has a favorable view among Black voters, with 7 in 10 having a somewhat or very favorable view of her. 'This looks nothing like the other polls of the state,' said the New York Times, regarding Trump's lead in Florida. Election Day is on November 5, 27 days from now. 'It will be Trump’s second rally in the city he grew up in following a stop in the South Bronx in May,' said a campaign official. Trump has claimed he can win New York, despite it being an overwhelmingly Democratic state.

**Trump gains momentum for electoral victory in 2024**
Former President Donald Trump is gaining momentum in the 2024 US presidential election, with recent polling data suggesting he is on the verge of an electoral landslide. Trump is polling well in battleground states and even in historically Democratic strongholds like New York, where he is 13 points behind Vice President Kamala Harris, a 10-point improvement from the previous two elections. This shift in voter sentiment raises the possibility of Trump flipping multiple battleground states in his favor, setting up a potential return to the White House. While it is unlikely that Trump will win New York in 2024, the significant improvement in polling suggests a broader trend of rising support for the former president.

**Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump in New York Polls**
According to recent polls, Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in the state of New York, with a margin of 14 points, 55.7% to 41.9%, respectively. This is consistent with the results of the 2020 election, where Joe Biden won by 23 points. A recent Emerson College poll found that 54% of respondents would vote for Harris, while 40% would vote for Trump. Another poll by Siena College found similar results, with 55% of respondents supporting Harris and 42% supporting Trump. However, some polls, such as ActiVote, show a wider margin between the two candidates, with Harris leading by 17 points, 58% to 42%. Harris is leading among most demographic groups, including urban voters and those with higher levels of education. Trump is only leading among rural voters and those with lower levels of education, and among Republican voters, where he retains over 90% of their votes. The winner of the election in New York will receive all 29 electoral votes from the state.

**Polls suggest a 270-268 election result as Harris gains slight lead over Trump: Report**
A New York Times report suggests that the 2024 presidential election could result in a 270-268 outcome, with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris having a slight lead over former president Donald Trump. According to the report, Harris secured a one percentage point lead in Michigan, two in Wisconsin, and nine in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, while Trump led in Ohio by six points. The report notes that such a result would only be possible if the Times/Siena polls in every state prove to be accurate. Andrew Wroe, a professor in American politics at the University of Kent, stated, 'What they see is that swing-state polls show that race is much tighter than the national polls indicate.'

**US 2024: Latest NYT Poll Shows Close Race Between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump**
With the US presidential election approaching, the latest New York Times poll shows a close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Harris initially seemed to be in the lead, but Trump has been gaining ground in recent weeks. The key battleground states will be Michigan and Wisconsin, where the polls show a tight race. In Michigan, Harris has 48% support among likely voters, while Trump has 47%, which is within the margin of error. In Wisconsin, Harris has 49% support, while Trump has 47%. However, Harris has a 9-point lead in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, which could be decisive in the Electoral College. If Harris wins Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and Trump wins the Sun Belt states, Harris could win the election with the 270 electoral votes needed. As Harris said, 'the economy is the most important issue that sways voters', and Trump's persistence on economic issues has narrowed Harris's lead.

**Could We See a 270-268 Election? The Polls Are Tighter Than Ever.**
According to recent New York Times/Siena College polls, the 2024 presidential election is extremely close. If the polls were accurate, Kamala Harris would win the Electoral College with 270 votes, while Donald J. Trump would have 268. The average of six polls in core battleground states shows Trump leading by just 0.6 of a point. This is the closest modern U.S. presidential election in terms of electoral count. As Hillary Clinton noted, a modest lead is not a guarantee of victory, and neither Harris nor Trump can claim a clear lead in this election.

**Donald Trump Surges in Top Election Forecast**
According to the latest forecast from 538, Donald Trump's chances of beating Kamala Harris in the 2024 election have improved, although Harris is still considered the slight favorite overall. Harris has a 55-in-100 chance of winning the majority of the Electoral College votes, with Trump given a 45-in-100 chance. This is an improvement from the 39 percent chance Trump was given on September 17, while Harris has dropped from a 61 percent chance of victory. G. Elliott Morris from 538 said, 'Harris' current lead in the race is 'barely better than a coin flip.' Slim margins in the swing states make this cycle's presidential race the closest in decades, with the outcome potentially being closer than in any election in nearly 150 years.' The New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while Harris can afford to lose these states if she wins the three 'blue wall' swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Quinnipiac University poll shows Trump with a 1 point lead over Harris in a full ballot, and the pair are tied on 48 percent in a two-way race. The poll also shows a decline in enthusiasm among Harris supporters, with 70 percent saying they are 'very enthusiastic' about voting for her, compared to 71 percent of Trump supporters.

**Trump Surprises in Polls with Advantages in Key States, Confirming a Very Close Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be a close contest, with Donald Trump gaining an advantage in key states. According to a recent NBC News poll, Kamala Harris leads Trump nationally with 49% to 44%. However, the election is won by the candidate who receives the most votes in the Electoral College, not the popular vote. The seven swing states that will determine the next US president are Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. A New York Times/Siena College poll shows Trump leading in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, with a surprising 50%-45% lead in Arizona, a state won by Joe Biden in 2020. Harris still leads in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, but her margin of error is zero if she loses the other three states. 'It's a very close election,' said an expert, 'and the outcome is far from certain.'

**Trump Leads in Key States, According to New York Times Poll**
Donald Trump leads the presidential election in key states Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Monday. The poll, conducted last week, shows Trump ahead of Democratic rival Kamala Harris by 50% to 45% in Arizona, 49% to 45% in Georgia, and 49% to 47% in North Carolina, consistent with recent polls showing a tight contest. The three states are among the seven key states that will likely decide the 2024 presidential election between Trump and Harris. Trump is seeking to return to the White House after losing to Joe Biden in 2020, a result he continues to falsely claim was due to electoral fraud. Harris, 59, has offered a chance to build a broader coalition among young adults, women, racial minorities, and even some Republicans. The NYT poll indicates a close contest, in line with other recent national polls, including the Reuters/Ipsos surveys. The poll was conducted from September 17 to 21, a time when news was affecting the North Carolina governor's election. As reported by CNN, Republican candidate Mark Robinson, backed by Trump, had referred to himself as a 'black Nazi' and proposed the return of slavery in comments published on a pornography website. Four of Robinson's top advisors resigned on Sunday. The poll has a margin of error of 4.4 points for Arizona (713 respondents), 4.6 points for Georgia (682 respondents), and 4.2 points for North Carolina (682 respondents). 'It's a tight contest,' said Harris, 'but we're confident in our message and our ability to bring people together.'

**Trump holds edge in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, NYT poll shows**
A New York Times/Siena College poll shows that Republican Donald Trump leads among likely voters in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, outpacing U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris six weeks before the Nov. 5 presidential election. Trump bested Harris 50% to 45% in Arizona, 49% to 45% in Georgia, and 49% to 47% in North Carolina. The poll echoes other recent polls showing a close contest. Harris, a former prosecutor, is seeking to become the first woman U.S. president, while Trump, a convicted felon, is seeking the White House again after losing to Joe Biden in 2020. The poll indicates a tight matchup, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points in Arizona, plus or minus 4.6 points in Georgia, and plus or minus 4.2 points in North Carolina.

According to a New York Times/Siena College poll, Donald Trump has surged ahead in Arizona, maintaining a four-point lead in Georgia and holding steady in North Carolina. Trump's lead in Arizona is five points (50-45 percent) over Vice President Kamala Harris, who is struggling with Latino voters. In North Carolina, Trump is up two points (49-47 percent), while in Georgia, he maintains a four-point lead (49-45 percent). The polls sampled 713 registered voters in Arizona, 682 in Georgia, and 682 in North Carolina, with a margin of error of 4.4-4.6 percentage points. Analysts say that North Carolina and Georgia are essential to Trump's hopes of returning to the White House, and that Harris could win even while losing all three states, though it would be difficult.

**Clear Winner? Donald Trump Narrows Gap with Kamala Harris in New York, Poll Shows Democratic Stronghold Weakening**
A recent Siena College poll shows a surprising shift in voter sentiment in New York, with former President Donald Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by only 12 points. This marks a significant departure from the 2020 election, when Joe Biden carried the state by a 23% margin. According to the poll, Harris could be poised to deliver the weakest Democratic performance in New York since 1988. As Democrats face mounting pressure to reinforce their positions in key states, Harris's ability to maintain strong support in New York could prove critical in the 2024 election. As one observer notes, 'New York has long been a Democratic stronghold, but the narrowing margin underscores challenges for Harris in solidifying the base.'

**Trump stumps on Long Island, vowing to ‘win New York' after losing big twice**
Donald Trump held a rally in Uniondale, New York, vowing to 'win New York' in the 2024 presidential election. Despite losing the state by more than 20 points in 2016 and 2020, Trump insisted that he can win, saying 'I can win New York, and we can win New York.' Election analysts do not regard New York as a competitive state, but Trump's campaign is trying to shore up GOP voters who are skeptical of him. Trump thanked vulnerable Republican representatives and cited surveys showing rank-and-file support in the Teamsters union, which he claimed sided with him. He also repeated his claims of a 'third-world nation' and 'invasion' at the US-Mexico border, and defended his 2016 pitch to Black voters, which was widely viewed as offensive. Trump also used the rally to recount Sunday's apparent assassination attempt and blamed Democrats for using language that he claims is a threat to democracy.

**Trump prepares to prove his New York prediction wrong for the third time**
Donald Trump has repeatedly predicted that he will win New York's electoral votes in his presidential bids, despite losing the state by more than 20 points in both 2016 and 2020. In an interview with the New York Post, Trump said, 'I'll solve the crime problem. I'll solve their tax problem. I'll solve all their problems. Who would not vote for me?' However, Trump went on to lose by more than 20 points again. A new poll by Siena College shows Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in the state, which is closer than the results of actual voting have been over the past two decades. Trump's optimism is likely rooted in the Republican Party's success in the state in 2022, but it's unlikely that he will win New York this time around, given the state's history of favoring Democratic candidates.

**For Whom the Polls Tell**
Recent polls show that Donald Trump is gaining ground against Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. A new ABC/Ipsos poll has Harris leading by 4 points, but this is within the margin of error for the pollsters, who have a history of over-polling for Democrats. Another poll by the New York Times and Siena has the race tied at 47%. Gallup polls show that Trump's favorability has increased, while Harris' favorability has decreased. In battleground states, Trump is leading in Georgia and is competitive in Pennsylvania. The Teamsters union, which has historically endorsed Democratic candidates, has seen its rank-and-file members vote overwhelmingly for Trump. This could potentially swing 442,000 votes in industrial Rust Belt states. Harris' campaign is struggling to connect with voters, and her polling numbers are not as strong as those of her predecessors, including Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.

**Trump makes a bold prediction about the 2024 presidential election**
Former President Donald Trump predicted victory in the 2024 presidential election, specifically in the reliably blue state of New York, saying 'We are going to win New York. And that's the first time in many, many years that a Republican can honestly say it.' Trump made a similar pledge four years ago, but lost the state to President Biden by over 23 points. Polling suggests Trump has no serious chance of carrying New York in his 2024 election showdown with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump promised New Yorkers that if he wins back the White House, 'I'm going to reduce your taxes, reduce your crime, and reduce your levels of stress.' The rally was seen as an opportunity to make efficient use of Trump's time, as his campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said, 'when [Trump] delivers a message there, it's piped directly into homes in every market in every battleground state.' While Trump is unlikely to carry New York, the rally may help Republicans down-ballot, as they try to hold on to their House of Representatives majority in November's elections.

Trump also used the rally to defend his past comments on immigration and crime, and to attack his opponents, including Vice President Kamala Harris. He repeated misrepresentations about Harris's record and blamed Democrats for a recent assassination attempt on him. Trump also fundraised during his visit and held meetings with donors. 'New York is sending Donald Trump back with a Republican Congress to work with,' former Rep. Lee Zeldin said in one of the warm-up speeches before Trump.

**Trump: I'll Do What GOP Has Not Done Since '84, Win N.Y.**
Former President Donald Trump said he will campaign in New York, a state no Republican presidential candidate has carried since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Trump told a rally in Uniondale, New York, 'I said, I can win New York, and we can win New York.' He claimed that with his vote, they will 'rescue our country, rescue our Democrat-run states, and start by saving the great state of New York.' Trump lost New York by nearly 23 percentage points in both 2016 and 2020, but Republicans have been buoyed by flipping four New York House seats in the 2022 midterms and the performance of former Rep. Lee Zeldin, who lost to Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul by 6.2 points in 2022. Trump said, 'Our cities were the center of business, arts, culture. Our streets, ports, waterways were the arteries of American commerce. But look at what has happened to New York and the other states all run by radical left Democrats.' He highlighted the issues in New York, including a 29% increase in robbery, a 36% increase in felony assault, a 42% increase in grand larceny, and a 75% increase in carjackings. Trump then used a slogan he used in 2016, saying, 'So, I say to the people of New York with crime at record levels, with terrorists and criminals pouring in, and with inflation eating your hearts out, vote for Donald Trump. What the hell do you have to lose?'

**Trump gets big election win in Minnesota**
A recent poll from Minn. Post and Embold Research shows that former President Donald Trump is winning over independent voters in Minnesota, a state that is typically Democratic. According to the poll, Harris leads Trump by 4.2 percentage points, 48.8% to 44.6%, but Trump is favored by 40% of independent voters, compared to 23% for Harris. This is a significant swing in Trump's direction, and could potentially impact the 2024 presidential election. As the New York Post notes, 'A big part of why Trump is so close in a state with a D+7 registration advantage: Independent voters are rallying to him by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio.'

**The Brutal Polling Is Starting to Irritate Liberals and It's Fantastic to Watch**
The 2024 presidential election is heating up, with Donald Trump leading in the polls. According to Nate Silver's projection, Trump has a 64% chance of winning 270 electoral votes. Recent polls, including a Pew national poll, show the race tied nationally, which would likely translate to a loss for Kamala Harris in the Electoral College. The New York Times and Pew polls also indicate that Trump is on track to win. CNN's Harry Enten noted that if Trump outperforms his polling by a single point, he would win. ABC News' Matthew Dowd attempted to downplay the polls, but Nate Silver dismissed his claims as a coping mechanism. The article concludes that Harris' record and agenda are liabilities, and that her lack of trustworthiness and grasp of issues are major concerns.

**Trump and Harris Tied in Final Weeks of 2024 Election, Poll Shows**
According to a national poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College, presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are effectively tied in the final weeks of the 2024 election. Trump leads Harris by a single point, 48%-47%, with a margin of error of three points, making either candidate's victory possible on November 5th. The poll suggests that Trump's base of support remains strong, with 28% of likely voters saying they need more information about Harris, compared to only 9% saying the same about Trump. The debate on Tuesday could be a crucial moment, with Harris having the opportunity to provide more details on her policies while facing off against Trump for 90 minutes. The poll's findings are similar to those of the last comparable poll from the New York Times/Siena College, published in late July, where Trump also led by a single point. Polls in the seven key swing states that will likely determine the election winner have also shown a very close race.

**Trump takes narrow lead in NYT poll amid fears Kamala's 'honeymoon' is collapsing**
A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted September 3-6 shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 1 percent, 48 percent to 47 percent, within the 3-point margin of error. The poll suggests that despite Harris' 'honeymoon phase,' support for Trump's bid for a second, nonconsecutive White House term remains strong. In the seven swing states key to winning the 2024 election, Trump and Harris are neck-and-neck or within the margin of error. The two candidates will meet for their first debate on September 10 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, hosted by ABC News. With only eight weeks until Election Day on November 5, many MAGA supporters and Republicans claim that Harris' polling and enthusiasm bump are part of a honeymoon phase and will wear off before voters cast their ballots.
