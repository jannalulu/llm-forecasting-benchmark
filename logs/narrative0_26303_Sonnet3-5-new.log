Nate Silver: [examining data on his screen] Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again about the LLM cyberattack question.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 32.45%. The relatively low probability reflected the early stage of LLM technology and robust cybersecurity measures most major institutions implemented throughout 2024.

Nate: Though there were several attempted attacks using LLM-generated code, none reached the threshold of causing $10 million in damage or disrupting operations of any major facilities.

Philip: The closest call was that attempted breach at the Seattle medical center in August, but their AI detection systems caught it early. The probability never exceeded 50% in our models, even after the March 2024 release of those more advanced language models.

Nate: Just goes to show - the fear of LLM-powered cyberattacks was a bit overblown, at least for 2024.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his screen] Well, Phil, looks like our models were right again about the LLM-based cyberattack prediction.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models had it at 37.8%. The relatively low probability made sense given the short timeframe and the high threshold for what constituted a "major" attack.

Nate: The defensive capabilities of major institutions improved faster than offensive LLM applications. Though there were several attempted attacks, none reached the severity criteria.

Philip: Exactly. While we saw increasing sophistication in LLM-assisted phishing and social engineering attempts, the requirement for either a fatality, $10 million in damages, or disruption of a major facility made this a higher bar than most realized.

Nate: [nodding] The regulatory frameworks and AI safety measures implemented in early 2024 also played a crucial role in preventing catastrophic scenarios.

Philip: Indeed. Though the threat remains, this particular window passed without incident.

Nate: *sighs* "Well, our models were spot on again."

Tetlock: "Indeed. When we last updated our forecast on July 19th, we had the probability at 37.8% for a major LLM-driven cyberattack before September's end."

Nate: "The signs were there - increasing sophistication of LLM applications, rising tensions in cybersecurity. But the robust defensive measures implemented by major institutions proved effective."

Tetlock: "Interesting how close it came though. That attempted attack on the healthcare network in August almost met our damage threshold."

Nate: "True, but it fell short of our criteria. The $8.2 million in damages wasn't enough to trigger our threshold, and the hospital's backup systems prevented any critical disruptions."

Tetlock: "Another win for our models. 37.8% - high enough to warrant concern, but not enough to predict catastrophe."

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had it at 37.8%. The relatively low probability reflected the robust security measures most major institutions implemented throughout 2024, particularly after the March guidelines on AI security were released.

Nate: Right. While we saw several attempted LLM-assisted attacks, none reached the threshold for "major" as defined. The closest was that attempted breach at Methodist Hospital in August, but their AI detection systems caught it early.

Philip: The interesting part was how the probability dropped from 52.3% to 37.8% after tech companies implemented those mandatory LLM safeguards in July. Shows how effective proper regulation can be.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Coffee?
