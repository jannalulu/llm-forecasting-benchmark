**Russia to Restrict Travel of Conscripts and Mobilized Individuals**
The Russian government plans to restrict the travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals who receive electronic summonses to the military, starting in the fall of 2024. According to several sources, the relevant legislative norms were approved earlier. The electronic register of summonses is expected to start operating in the fall, with automatic restrictions to be implemented. The information was first reported by the Meduza publication, which discovered a tender for the implementation of an 'information exchange' between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB on data about Russians who have received summonses in electronic form. The contract was awarded to the Voskhod research institute, which will transmit the list of individuals subject to military service and with temporary restrictions on leaving Russia to the FSB border service. According to the tender, the contract must be completed by the fall conscription, which usually starts on October 1. The formal deadline for the entire contract is November 29, so the register should be operational during the fall conscription. In December 2023, Vladimir Putin issued an order to hold the fall 2024 conscription using new electronic registers of summonses. Most lawyers believe that all restrictions related to the order will apply to both conscripts and mobilized individuals, and they will be banned from leaving the country immediately after the electronic summons is registered. Rumors about a second massive wave of mobilization in Russia have been circulating periodically throughout 2023. Recently, military experts have been regularly saying that the Russian government is not giving up on a large-scale attack on several still-occupied Ukrainian territories, and the army needs much more manpower. Government representatives have repeatedly stated that there is no need for a second wave of mobilization; similar statements were made before the start of mobilization in the fall of 2022.

**Kremlin Denies Reports of New Mobilization Wave**
The Kremlin has denied reports of a new wave of mobilization in Russia. According to the Financial Times, Russia is expected to mobilize millions of troops this year to maintain the dynamics of the conflict and launch a new summer offensive. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskow denied this, stating that Russia is already recruiting volunteers who are willing to serve on a contract basis. Peskow also referred to President Vladimir Putin's statement that there is no need for further mobilization. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had previously claimed that Russia plans to mobilize an additional 300,000 soldiers in June. Russia had previously mobilized 300,000 people, mostly with military experience, in September 2022. The Russian Defense Ministry has reported that over 100,000 Russian citizens have volunteered for military service since the beginning of the year.

**Russia Plans to Close Border in Fall Amid New Wave of Mobilization**
Russia is planning to close its border in the fall due to a new wave of mobilization. The country has been conducting partial mobilization since September 2022, with the goal of replenishing its troops in Ukraine. Despite the official announcement of the end of mobilization in October 2022, the process has continued, with Russia recruiting approximately 30,000 people per month. In January 2024, Ukraine's military intelligence reported that Russia was planning to mobilize an additional 450,000 people. On March 30, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree for a spring conscription of 150,000 people. As of July 16, Ukraine's General Staff reported that Russia had suffered approximately 561,400 military losses, including 1110 in the past 24 hours.

**Russia Prepares to Close Border in Fall Amidst New Mobilization Wave**
The Russian government is developing a system to prevent potential draftees and mobilized individuals from leaving the country. According to the UK Ministry of Defence, the system will be fully operational by autumn 2024. The system will exchange information between the Ministry of Defence and the FSB to identify potential draftees and prevent them from fleeing the country. The UK estimates that Russia conducts two annual drafts, calling up over 250,000 people for one year of mandatory military service. The introduction of this system aims to prevent a repeat of the large-scale exodus of Russians who left the country after the partial mobilization in 2022, which disproportionately affected young and highly educated individuals. The UK Ministry of Defence notes that Russia is recruiting around 30,000 new soldiers each month, allowing it to maintain its war effort against Ukraine without resorting to unpopular mobilization.

**Russia Prepares Mobilized Soldiers for War in Ukraine in Less Than 14 Days**
Russian propagandists are complaining that mobilized soldiers are not receiving sufficient training before being sent to war in Ukraine. Some soldiers are being prepared for deployment in less than 14 days. The Institute for the Study of War notes that in most cases, there is only a 4-5 day gap between signing a contract and arriving on the front lines. An instructor from 'Storm Z' agreed with the assessment, citing problems with overall training in the Russian army. The Russian army is currently mobilizing all available forces, regardless of their official designation, and is primarily using mass infantry and periodic mechanized attacks to gradually advance. The ISW notes that this decision likely reduced the training requirements for most new Russian soldiers being sent to Ukraine. Experts also stated that 14 days is not enough to form a limited combat-ready personnel. The analysis suggests that Russian forces may provide additional training to new personnel after deployment in Ukraine, and the aggressor is trying to provide better training for selected elements of the Russian army. It is also reported that Russia is recruiting convicted women for war against Ukraine, which may indicate a new stage in the Kremlin's use of criminals in its military actions. Previously, it was reported that the Kremlin's fear of announcing a new wave of mobilization led to increased pressure on conscripts to sign contracts. New recruits are not having a pleasant time on the front lines, where they are already experiencing the whims of their commanders. According to OBOZ.UA, the number of local residents in the temporarily occupied part of the Donetsk region who refuse to fight against Ukraine is growing. Forced mobilized Donchans are abandoning their positions and fleeing - unwilling to become war criminals.

**Russia's New Reserves Won't Allow for Large-Scale Operations on Multiple Fronts This Summer**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia's new reserves will not allow for large-scale operations on multiple fronts this summer. New recruits will not be able to participate in the first or second echelon. Ukrainian military expert Konstantin Masyachenko stated that out of 30,000 mobilized soldiers, some are sent to the front as reinforcements. He noted that Russia's mobilization efforts have created limited operational and strategic reserves. Masyachenko estimated that each Russian operational grouping receives 1,000 to 1,500 new soldiers per month for replacement or reinforcement, and up to 2,000 for intense operations. According to Masyachenko, Russia receives 6 to 12,000 new soldiers per month in six operational groups near Ukraine. Analysts note that new recruits will mainly perform auxiliary functions or participate in combat missions after training. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the army has been replenished with 160,000 new soldiers in 2024, which matches the mobilization rate of 30,000 per month. ISW analysts observed a pattern of intense Russian attacks followed by periods of replenishing losses. The availability of new reserves is one of the factors affecting this tactic.

**Russia's Mobilization Efforts Insufficient for Simultaneous Large-Scale Offensives**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Russian army's mobilization efforts are insufficient for simultaneous large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts. Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Masyovets stated that Russia receives around 1,000 to 1,500 new soldiers per month as replacements or reinforcements for each operational group, and up to 2,000 if the group is responsible for intense offensive operations. ISW estimates that Russia receives around 6,000 to 12,000 new soldiers per month. The report notes that this number does not contradict Ukrainian and Russian reports from January and April 2024, which stated that Russia mobilizes 30,000 new soldiers per month, as a significant portion of this new personnel will perform support and maintenance tasks or will take on combat duties after training. The availability of new personnel may be one of the factors influencing the Russian military's decision to alternate intense offensive operations with less intense ones. According to ISW, the planned Russian reserves are unlikely to be ready to act as forces of the first or second echelon, capable of conducting effective large-scale combined attacks. 'These limited Russian reserves at the operational and strategic levels are likely to be insufficient to support simultaneous large-scale offensive efforts on multiple fronts. The Russian military command will likely be forced to choose one main effort during the expected summer offensive if it intends to use these reserves to support a large-scale offensive operation', the report states.

**Russia Unable to Conduct Large-Scale Operations, Despite New Recruits**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed statements by Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Masyovets, who claimed that Russia is mobilizing around 30,000 new recruits monthly. However, ISW notes that these resources are limited and insufficient for large-scale operations on multiple fronts. According to Masyovets, each group of Russian forces receives around 1,000-1,500 new recruits monthly, with some groups receiving up to 2,000. With 6 groups of forces engaged in combat, Russia would receive 6-12,000 new recruits monthly. ISW notes that this is a realistic estimate, as Russia has been mobilizing around 30,000 troops monthly since January and April 2024. However, not all new recruits are immediately sent to the front, with some performing support roles or undergoing training. Russia has also claimed to have mobilized 160,000 troops since the start of 2024, which ISW believes is consistent with the monthly mobilization rate. However, Russia's losses are equal to or slightly less than the number of new recruits, making it difficult for Russia to sustain large-scale operations on multiple fronts. The report concludes that Russia's limited operational and strategic reserves will likely be insufficient to support simultaneous large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts.

**Putin's Theory of Victory in Ukraine: Gradual Approach and Western Assistance**
According to the Institute for War Studies, Putin believes that Russia does not need to conduct another partial mobilization like the one in September 2022, as Russia is not trying to quickly achieve its military goals in Ukraine. Putin stated that the current number of Russian troops involved in the war in Ukraine is insufficient for a quick victory, but he suggested that Russian forces are using a gradual approach. Putin claimed that Russian forces aim to 'weaken' Ukrainian forces 'from those territories that should be under Russian control', and therefore, Russia does not need to conduct another wave of mobilization. Analysts believe that Putin's assessment that gradual Russian successes will allow Russia to achieve its goals in Ukraine is based on the assumption that Ukrainian forces will not be able to liberate any significant territory captured by Russian forces and that Russian forces will be able to maintain offensive operations despite heavy losses. Putin's 'theory of victory' is based on Russia's ability to withstand and overcome promised Western security assistance to Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to mobilize a significant portion of its economy and population for military actions, indicating that Putin likely believes that Russian forces can use their advantages in manpower and equipment.

**Putin: No Plans for New Mobilization in Russia**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that there are no plans for a new wave of mobilization in Russia, during the plenary session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 7. Putin explained that the current military strategy is focused on pushing the enemy out of territories that should be under Russian control, and therefore, there is no need for mobilization. According to Putin, over 300,000 people volunteered to go to the front in 2023, and over 160,000 have signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense since the beginning of 2024. Russia announced a partial mobilization in September 2022, with 300,000 people mobilized, and around 20,000 more who went to war as volunteers. Just before the announcement, the press secretary of the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov, assured journalists that there were no plans for mobilization.
