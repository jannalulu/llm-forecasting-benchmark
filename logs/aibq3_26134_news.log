**SpaceX will attempt to ‘catch' Starship rocket at next launch**
SpaceX is planning to attempt a world-first maneuver by 'catching' the Starship rocket using robotic arms built into the launch tower after its next launch. The 120-meter-tall rocket will be delivered to orbit and then recovered by the Mechazilla tower, which is designed to support launch, vehicle integration, and booster catch. This will reduce mass from the launch vehicle, move hardware complexity to the ground, and enable rapid reuse of the rocket. The previous Starship flight test saw a successful splash-landing of the Super Heavy booster, a major step towards achieving reusability. SpaceX aims to build a massive fleet of Starship rockets to transport crew and cargo throughout the Solar System and establish a human colony on Mars within the next 10-20 years.

**SpaceX Shares Unseen Clip Of Starship Booster's Soft Landing – Tower Catch In Flight 5 Says Musk**
SpaceX has released new footage of its Starship Super Heavy booster's soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. The footage shows the booster gliding down towards the ocean before switching to onboard cameras for its final moments. The test was the fourth flight of the full Starship stack and the Super Heavy booster, and marks the first time SpaceX has shared footage of the Super Heavy from an outside camera. The booster's return profile is similar to the Falcon 9, but operating Super Heavy is trickier due to its more engines. The footage shows the rocket gliding back towards the water, engulfed in a vapor cone, before its engines light up for a landing burn. The rocket initially appears wobbly before stabilizing and landing smoothly. Elon Musk has stated that the next landing will be caught by the tower arms, suggesting confidence in the rocket's capabilities.

**SpaceX's Super Heavy Booster Conducts Static Fire Test Ahead of Fifth Test Flight**
SpaceX has shared spectacular images of a static fire test of the Super Heavy booster before its fifth test flight as part of the Starship vehicle. The test showed the Raptor engines of the booster being lit while the vehicle is firmly fixed to the ground. SpaceX has also published several photos of the same test. The Starship, which stands 120 meters tall, including the first stage Super Heavy and the upper stage of the Starship spacecraft, is the most powerful rocket in the world and will one day carry its crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and possibly even farther into deep space. The rocket is expected to fly again next month, with the recent engine test being part of the preparations for this mission. The Starship has had four previous test flights, with the first two ending in anomalies, but the third and fourth tests showed significant improvements in the flight system, with the missions achieving most of their objectives. The fifth test, which could take place in August, will test a new landing procedure in which the Super Heavy booster is 'caught' by massive mechanical arms on the launch tower. This will allow SpaceX to reuse all the Super Heavy boosters it produces, significantly reducing launch costs.

**SpaceX's Starship to Return to Flight with 5th Test Launch**
SpaceX is preparing for the 5th test flight of its Starship, which could take place in the coming weeks. The company has recently transported the massive first stage of the Starship, known as Super Heavy, to the launch platform at Starbase, located in southern Texas. The 5th Super Heavy booster has been moved to the launch platform at Starbase,' wrote SpaceX on X. The booster passed near the almost completed Starfactory on its way to the platform.' Starfactory is the new enormous production facility that SpaceX is building at Starbase. When completed and fully optimized, Starfactory could produce a Starship per day, according to SpaceX representatives. Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, is 122 meters tall and is considered a game-changer for space travel, making it economically viable to establish a human settlement on Mars. The 4 test flights of Starship took place in April and November 2023 and March and June of this year. The 2 stages of the massive Starship (Super Heavy and the second stage Starship, or simply 'Ship') did not separate during the inaugural flight, which ended with a controlled detonation just 4 minutes after launch. However, Starship has shown improvements with each subsequent flight. The 4th flight, for example, was a complete success, with Super Heavy and Ship returning to Earth for landings that took place as expected. The 5th flight could represent another step forward, with the 'capture' of Super Heavy with the 'chopstick' arms of the giant launch tower at Starbase (this capability would make the recovery and reuse of the rocket more efficient).

**Starship: Fifth Test Flight Scheduled for Early August?**
Elon Musk has announced that the fifth test flight of Starship could take place within 4 weeks, starting in early August. The previous test, the fourth, achieved its objectives. The next test will involve capturing the lower stage with Mechazilla. Reusability of Starship So far, four tests have been conducted with increasing success, respectively on April 20, 2023, November 18, 2023, March 14, 2024, and June 6, 2024. As can be seen from the dates, the interval between tests has decreased. This is mainly due to two reasons. The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) has taken less time to complete the investigations because the rocket has had fewer problems and caused little or no damage. Additionally, SpaceX has had to make fewer modifications to correct the defects found. For the fifth test, Booster 12 (Super Heavy) and Ship 30 will be used as the first and second stages. The latter has had its heat shield changed. Under the ceramic tiles, a protective layer with ablative material has been added, allowing for greater resistance to heat during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One of the flaps almost detached during the fourth test due to high temperatures. The FAA has announced that no investigation will be launched for the fourth flight, so the new license will be granted by the end of the month. The main objective of the fifth test, as anticipated in the video published by SpaceX on YouTube, is to capture the lower stage with the 'chopsticks' of the launch tower.

The 5th Starship test flight will be the most ambitious test of the 120-meter-long rocket system, and SpaceX plans to recover the Super Heavy booster after it reaches orbit and use it in future missions. Unlike the Falcon 9 rocket, which lands vertically, SpaceX will use robotic arms to catch the Super Heavy rocket. Musk said that the next Starship test flight, scheduled for the next 6 weeks, will aim to achieve this feat. The Starbase facility in Texas, where the new generation of launch tower is being built, started construction in 2021. The 146-meter-tall launch tower, the tallest in the world, will provide a foundation for future Starship launch operations in Florida. According to SpaceX, the tower was designed to support launch, vehicle integration, and the recovery of the Super Heavy rocket booster. The recovery of the booster reduces the mass of the launch vehicle, simplifies the system, and enables rapid reuse. After the launch, the Super Heavy booster will separate from the spacecraft and return to the launch site, where it will be caught by the tower's arms and placed back into the orbital launch pad for the next flight.

**SpaceX to Attempt to Catch Starship Rocket During Fifth Launch**
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced plans to attempt to catch the Starship rocket during its fifth launch. After successfully completing the fourth launch earlier this month, SpaceX is planning to test the next launch in July. This time, Musk plans to try to catch the rocket during its descent, which would allow the company to reuse the super heavy rocket. The solution to this problem is the Mechazilla tower, which is currently under construction and will be approximately 146 meters tall. The tower will have a series of robotic arms that will attempt to catch the rocket during its descent. SpaceX says that the rocket will separate into two stages during the launch, and the super heavy rocket will return to the launch site, slow down using its engines, and then the tower's arms will try to catch it before it lands. If successful, this maneuver will allow SpaceX to prepare the super heavy rocket for another launch much faster. The last Starship launch ended with the rocket splashing down into the water.

**Elon Musk Sets Target Date for Starship's Fifth Test Flight**
Elon Musk announced that SpaceX aims to launch the Starship for the fifth time by the end of July. This could be the most spectacular test flight for the 120-meter-tall rocket. For the first time, SpaceX will attempt to 'catch' the Super Heavy booster of the first stage, allowing the first stage to be reused for multiple flights, making Starship missions more cost-effective. Musk revealed the target date on Twitter, saying 'I'm counting on trying this by the end of July!' The maneuver involves a pair of robotic arms on the launch tower grasping the booster as it returns to Earth shortly after the deployment of the Starship upper stage into orbit. SpaceX has already perfected the safe return of the first stage of its smaller Falcon 9 rocket, although this particular booster lands vertically without using robotic arms. 'Capturing the booster reduces the mass of the launcher, moves material complexity to the ground, and enables rapid reuse of the rocket,' SpaceX said in a published document. 'After liftoff, and after the separation of the two stages in flight, the Super Heavy will return to the launch site, relight its engines to slow down the vehicle, and the tower's arms will catch the rocket booster before re-impacting it for the next orbital launch.' Starship, the world's most powerful rocket, has flown four times since its first launch in April 2023. The most recent flight, at the beginning of the month, was its most successful to date, with the Super Heavy and Starship successfully landing before falling into the water. Once fully tested and certified, Starship is expected to be used for crewed and cargo missions to the Moon and could even transport the first humans to Mars. While SpaceX hopes to send Starship on its first lunar mission before the end of this decade, crewed flights to Mars are still far away.

**Elon Musk Unveils Plan for Next Starship Landing**
SpaceX conducted the fourth test flight of its Starship rocket, which successfully placed the Super Heavy booster into orbit around the Earth. The test was a major success, with both the booster and the spacecraft performing successful re-entry maneuvers and landing safely in the ocean. According to SpaceX, the test has brought significant progress towards a reusable future for space travel. 'The fourth flight of Starship has made great progress towards a fast, reusable future,' said SpaceX in a statement. 'Her performances will provide data to improve while we continue to develop Starship into a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry crew and cargo to orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.' The reusability of both parts of the powerful rocket is a key goal of SpaceX's Starship program, as it will reduce the cost of space travel for crewed and cargo missions to the Moon and beyond. SpaceX president Elon Musk revealed on Sunday that the next Starship test will use a catch mechanism on the launch tower at the SpaceX location in Boca Chica, Texas, to try to 'catch' the booster as it lands. Musk also revealed his plan to use the Super Heavy booster in 2020, which would save SpaceX the cost of building landing legs for the rocket. Removing this part of the construction would also reduce the weight of the booster, allowing it to carry less fuel and/or more payload. There is no date set for the fifth Starship test, but SpaceX's desire to increase the frequency of Starship flights suggests it could happen in the next two months.
