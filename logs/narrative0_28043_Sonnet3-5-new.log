[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election results.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Brandenburg state election. AfD's performance fell exactly where we predicted."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 27.8%. The trends from Saxony and Thuringia were informative, but Brandenburg's political landscape has its own unique characteristics. The 30-32% range was always unlikely."

Nate: "The increasing support we saw in eastern Germany wasn't enough to push them into that specific bracket. The recent classification as a 'suspected extremist' party likely put a ceiling on their growth."

Philip: "Exactly. While they improved from their 2019 result of 23.5%, the combination of established party opposition and moderate voter concerns kept them below the 30% threshold."

[Both nod in agreement as they turn to analyze other forecasts]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. The AfD's performance in Brandenburg fell just outside that 30-32% window we were analyzing."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models gave it a 28.4% probability of landing in that range. The signs were there - the strong showing in Thuringia at 32.8% and Saxony at 30.6% suggested momentum, but Brandenburg's historically lower support for AfD and the recent intensification of protests against the party indicated they'd either underperform or overperform that specific window."

Nate: "The trend in eastern Germany was clear from our data sets, but capturing such a precise vote share range is always tricky. Still, our probability assessment reflected the real uncertainty while acknowledging it was a plausible outcome."

Philip: "No, our models had it at 28.4%."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election results over coffee.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Brandenburg election. Given the AfD's surge in Eastern Germany, especially after their strong showings in Saxony and Thuringia, we predicted this range with remarkable precision."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 72.3%. The trend lines from the past year, particularly the rising anti-establishment sentiment and economic concerns in Eastern Germany, made this outcome highly probable. The AfD's consistent polling above 30% in Brandenburg since early 2024 was a strong indicator."

Nate: "The pattern we saw in Saxony with 30.6% and Thuringia with 32.8% helped calibrate our prediction. Brandenburg falling within this narrow band was almost inevitable given the regional dynamics."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at Harvard University, the morning after the Brandenburg election. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election results.]

Tetlock: [studying a computer screen] Well, Nate, our models were spot on again. The AfD's performance in Brandenburg was exactly as we predicted.

Silver: Yes, our models gave a 22.3% probability of AfD landing between 30-32%. Given the party's momentum in eastern Germany, particularly after their strong showings in Saxony and Thuringia, many expected them to hit that range. But our data suggested otherwise.

Tetlock: Indeed. While polling showed increasing support, our models factored in the recent pushback against far-right politics in Germany, especially after those mass protests in January. The economic indicators and voter sentiment analysis pointed to a different outcome.

Silver: [nodding] The beauty of superforecasting – it's not about gut feelings or trends, but precise probabilistic thinking. 22.3% meant it was possible, but not probable.

Nate: "And they didn't. The surge we saw in Thuringia didn't quite replicate here. The economic anxiety and immigration concerns were similar patterns, but Brandenburg's demographic makeup and voting history told a different story."

Philip: "Precisely. The AfD's momentum was strong, but our models caught the subtle differences between Brandenburg and other eastern states. The local SPD's infrastructure proved more resilient than in Thuringia."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious narrative isn't the right one."
