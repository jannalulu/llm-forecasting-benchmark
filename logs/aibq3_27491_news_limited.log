**US Inflation Adds Optimism to Western Markets**
The US consumer inflation (CPI) for July was released on Wednesday, August 14, and it showed a 0.2% increase from June and a 2.9% increase from July 2023. This is lower than the predicted 0.2% (month-over-month) and 3.0% (year-over-year) increase. The core inflation rate also increased by 0.2% (month-over-month) and 3.2% (year-over-year), matching the predicted values. The SRI (Seasonally Adjusted Rate of Inflation) for the US without rounding was 0.155% (overall) and 0.165% (core). According to Neomarkets, the market's expectations for a decrease in the Federal Reserve's interest rates have slightly increased after the inflation reports, but there are no significant changes. The probability of four interest rate cuts by the end of the year remains, and the chances of a 0.50% interest rate cut in September are increasing. However, weak non-farm employment data could significantly increase the expectations for the rate of interest rate cuts this year, unlike inflation, which has no current impact.

**US Consumer Price Index Falls 0.2% in August**
According to John Kerschner, Head of US Securitised Products and Portfolio Manager at Janus Henderson Investors, both the total and core Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US fell by 0.2% on August 14, 2024, as expected. This resulted in a year-over-year decrease in the total CPI from 3.0% in the previous month to 2.9%, and a year-over-year decrease in the core CPI from 3.3% in the previous month to 3.2%.

**US Underlying Inflation Rate Falls for Fourth Consecutive Month**
The underlying inflation rate in the United States fell for the fourth consecutive month in July, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates next month. The core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes food and energy costs, rose 3.2% in July from the same month last year, the slowest pace since early 2021. The monthly variation was 0.2%, a slight increase from the surprisingly low reading in June, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Wednesday. Economists consider the core CPI a better indicator of underlying inflation than the general CPI. This measure also rose 0.2% from the previous month and 2.9% from the same month last year.

**US Inflation Rate Announced: 0.1% Monthly, 3% Annually**
The US inflation data for June was announced, and the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.1% monthly and 3% annually. The core inflation rate, closely watched by the Fed, decreased by 0.1% monthly, the lowest level since August 2021. The market expectation was for a monthly inflation rate of 0.2% and an annual rate of 3.4%. In May, consumer prices remained stable (0%) annually, but increased by 3.3%. The energy index decreased by 2% monthly, mainly due to a 3.8% decrease in fuel prices.

**The CPI Preview: Inflation To Keep Rising This Summer, Despite The Slowing Economy**
The June CPI inflation expectations are expected to show a rise in inflation, despite the slowing economy. The core CPI is predicted to increase by 0.2% MoM and 3.4% YoY, while the headline CPI is expected to increase by 0.1% MoM and 3.1% YoY. The annual core CPI inflation at 3.4% would match the lowest annual core inflation reading from last month, May 2024. The headline core CPI at 3.1% would be below the 3.3% level in May, but still above the cyclical low of 3% annual CPI inflation number from June 2023. The disinflationary process has stalled, and the monthly core CPI inflation readings over the last 12 months suggest that the core annual CPI inflation has either stalled at 3.4% for the next three months or it could even start rising. The InflationNowcast by Cleveland Fed predicts that June core CPI will come at 0.28%, or rounded to 0.3%, which would be an upside surprise, above the 0.2% consensus expectations. The annual CPI inflation is predicted to rise over the next 2 months, and the core CPI is predicted to rise to 3.6% by July, and the headline CPI is expected to rise to 3.2% by July. The July inflation data will be reported in August, right before the Fed's September meeting. If these predictions are correct, the Fed will not be able to cut interest rates in September, as the market currently expects.

**US CPI Data Suggests Room for Cautious Interest Rate Cuts**
The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the US showed a slight increase of 0.2% month-over-month in July, according to analysts at Nord LB. This translates to a yearly rate of 2.9%, which is just below the psychologically important mark of 3.0%. The core CPI rate also increased by 0.2% month-over-month, corresponding to a yearly rate of 3.2%. These developments suggest that the Federal Reserve in Washington may not be hindered from implementing cautious interest rate cuts. 'This is certainly an important message,' the analysts noted.

**US Core Inflation Eases, Fed Rate Cut Likely**
The US core consumer price index (CPI) increased by 3.2% year-over-year in July, marking the fourth consecutive month of easing inflation. The core CPI rose by 0.2% monthly, with nearly 90% of the monthly advance attributed to shelter costs. Economists and market analysts anticipate that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates next month due to the ongoing downward trend in inflation and a softening job market. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, suggested that the easing inflationary pressures will likely lead to a rate cut while maintaining an overall restrictive policy stance. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which the Fed uses to assess inflation, is trending closer to the central bank's 2% target. The PCE price index, released later this month, will provide further insight into inflationary trends. Businesses across various sectors are acknowledging shifts in consumer spending habits, particularly in discretionary purchases.

**US Consumer Price Index Rises 0.2% in July, Easing Inflationary Pressures**
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.2% in July, in line with expectations, and confirms that inflationary pressures are easing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI increased by 0.2% in July, after a 0.1% decline in June. Over the past 12 months, the CPI has risen by 2.9%, a slight decrease from the 3.0% annual increase recorded in June. Economists had predicted a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3.0% annual increase. These data follow a report published on Tuesday indicating a slight increase in production prices for the month of July. The moderation of annual CPI growth from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 suggests that inflation is approaching the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. The Fed must now make a decision on interest rates at its next meeting on September 17-18, with market expectations divided between a 0.5% rate cut and a 25 basis point reduction. This indecision is partly due to the fact that the unemployment rate has reached its highest level in three years, at 4.3%, in July. Despite the rise in unemployment, which has increased for four consecutive months, economists suggest that a significant deterioration in the labor market would be necessary for the central bank to consider a more aggressive 50 basis point rate cut. They attribute the rise in unemployment primarily to an increase in labor supply due to immigration, rather than an increase in layoffs. The Fed's daily reference interest rate has remained stable in the 5.25% to 5.50% range for a year, after being raised by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023. Excluding the most volatile components, such as food and energy, the core CPI also rose by 0.2% in July, representing a slight increase from the 0.1% increase recorded in June. The core CPI over 12 months rose by 3.2% in July, representing the lowest annual increase since April 2021, and a decline from the 3.3% increase recorded in June.

**US July inflation likely steady as Fed faces battle to justify higher rates: RBC By Investing.com**
RBC estimates that US inflation will remain steady at 3% in July, with a 0.1% monthly increase in core prices. This is due to a narrowing source of price pressures, with home rents slowing down as the impact of earlier market rent increases passes through to lease agreements. RBC believes that this will reassure the Fed that annual inflation rates will continue to decrease. However, the Fed's higher-for-longer rate regime is becoming increasingly difficult to justify, as evidence suggests that broader economic conditions have normalized and inflation is likely to drift lower. The Fed's current rate of 5.375% is nearly 300 basis points above its estimated neutral rate of 2.5%.

**USA: Inflation Data to Dictate Next Steps for Federal Reserve**
According to Postbank Research analysts, the focus this week will be on inflation data in the US, following disappointing job market data. The highlight of the week will be the July Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday, which is expected to show a 0.2% monthly increase in both total and core inflation. A confirmation of this would strengthen the Federal Reserve's confidence in cutting interest rates, despite the still-high 3.2% annual inflation rate in the CPI. On Tuesday, a slowdown in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for July is expected.

**US Inflation Report: Will July's Numbers Continue the Trend of Moderate Inflation?**
The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July is expected to continue the trend of moderate inflation seen in recent months. According to Forbes, the current expectations for a rate cut in September are high, and it is unlikely that any other factor except for the concerning inflation data will prevent the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) from cutting interest rates widely in their next meeting on September 18. The US authorities will release the CPI data for July on August 14, 2024. The CPI data for June showed a monthly change in prices of -0.1% and 0.1% for the core CPI. The core CPI excludes food and energy price changes, as stated by Forbes. The CPI report for June showed an annual inflation rate of 3% for the overall CPI and 3.3% for the core CPI. The Cleveland Fed's inflation expectations predict the overall CPI to be 0.24% for July and the core CPI to be 0.27% for the same period. Additionally, Forbes expects the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, to be released on August 30, to show a similar pattern of monthly inflation of 0.2% for the overall CPI and 0.22% for the core CPI, based on current estimates. These estimates, if maintained, would translate to an annual inflation rate of 2-3%, according to Forbes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the July inflation report will cause concern for the FOMC, and it will likely maintain the narrative that inflation is returning to lower levels, albeit perhaps slower than the committee would like. As inflation has been the main focus of the FOMC since 2021, with it being close to the committee's target of 2% last year, the labor market data has become more important in the committee's decision-making process. This is because inflation is now around 3%, which is relatively close to the committee's annual target of 2%. However, the other main goal of the committee is full employment, and the unemployment rate has been steadily increasing from 3.4% in the summer of last year to 4.3% according to the July jobs report. This increase in unemployment rate may be enough to calm the economic growth and perhaps even encourage the committee to soften its stance on interest rates. Therefore, inflation data may no longer be the key factor that the committee focuses on. Forbes predicts that the July inflation report will continue the trend of moderate inflation in recent months, based on current expectations. This trend alone may be enough for the committee to cut interest rates in September, as widely expected by the markets.

**June 2024 CPI Report: Inflation Is Moderating, Inching Us Closer To a Rate Cut**
The June 2024 CPI report shows that inflation is moderating, with core CPI increasing by 0.1% MoM and 3.3% YoY. Shelter prices, which have been a major contributor to inflation, rose by 0.2% MoM, their smallest gain since August 2021. While prices increased in some areas, such as motor vehicle insurance and medical care, they fell in others, like airfares and used cars. The report suggests that core inflation will continue to moderate this year, and the Fed may cut interest rates as early as September. The data supports the view that the economy and labor market are becoming more balanced, which could lead to a rate cut.

**US Inflation Cools Down, Boosting Case for Rate Cuts**
The US inflation rate cooled down in June, giving the Federal Reserve more confidence to cut interest rates soon. The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.1% from May, the smallest increase since August 2021. The annual rate increased 3.3%, the slowest pace in over three years. The data adds to evidence that inflation has resumed its downward trend after a brief spike earlier this year, while economic activity appears to be slowing down. The report should keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates this year. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, avoided mentioning a possible timeline for rate cuts in his testimony to lawmakers this week, emphasizing that monetary policy will be guided by incoming data. Market operators continued to consider a rate cut in September likely, while stock and Treasury bond futures rose. The Federal Reserve will also meet this month. Although the Labor Department reports inflation data with a decimal point, officials have been extracting more detailed figures to get a clearer picture of inflation direction. On a three-decimal basis, the core CPI rose 0.065%. Housing inflation The housing prices, the most important category within services, rose 0.2%, the smallest increase since August 2021. The equivalent rent of homeowners - a subset of housing, which is the largest individual component of CPI - rose 0.3%, also the smallest increase in three years. Excluding housing and energy, service prices fell for the second consecutive month, according to Bloomberg calculations. Although central bankers have emphasized the importance of considering this metric when evaluating the country's inflation trajectory, they calculate it based on an independent index. That measure, known as the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), has a lower weighting of housing than the CPI. This explains why the PCE tends to approach the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. The PCE, which will be published later, is based on the CPI and some categories of the production price index, which will be published on Friday.

**Monthly US consumer prices post first drop in four years**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first drop in four years, due to lower gasoline costs and moderating rents. The core CPI also showed a small increase of 0.1%, the smallest since August 2021. The report suggests that inflation is cooling, which may lead to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in September. Economists believe that the Fed has a 'checkered flag' to reduce rates in September, and financial markets see a high probability of a rate cut. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, and jobless claims fell by 17,000 to 222,000. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid also declined. The report shows that the labor market is losing steam, and signs are mounting that economic activity is slowing down.

**Australian private survey of inflation, June 2024: +0.3% m/m (prior +0.3%)**
The Melbourne Institute's private survey of inflation for June 2024 shows a 0.3% monthly increase, matching the previous month's rate. The year-over-year inflation rate is 3.2%, down from 3.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in 21 months. The trimmed mean, a core measure of inflation, shows a 0.2% monthly increase and a 3% year-over-year increase, down from 0.3% and 3.2% respectively. This data comes ahead of the official quarterly CPI release from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on July 31, which may impact the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision on interest rates at its next meeting on August 5-6.
