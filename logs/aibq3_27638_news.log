Meta has announced that it will be discontinuing its 'Spark' platform, which allowed users to create AR filters for Instagram and Facebook. The platform will be shut down on January 14, 2025.

The company expressed gratitude to the community of creators and stakeholders who have been part of the Spark journey, saying, 'We are deeply grateful to the community of creators, businesses, and other key stakeholders who have been part of the Meta Spark journey.' However, the decision has been met with complaints from creators, who often use custom filters to promote their profiles. As a result, only AR filters created by Meta itself will remain available in Instagram and Facebook after the shutdown.

**Meta shuts down analytics tool CrowdTangle despite pleas from researchers**
Meta Platforms has shut down its social media research tool CrowdTangle, despite a petition from researchers, civil society groups, and journalists to keep it running through 2024. The tool, which was used to track and understand how information and disinformation spread through Facebook and Instagram, will be replaced by Meta Content Library and its Content Library API. However, only researchers and a limited number of journalists will have access to the new tool, with others being ineligible to apply. This move is part of a trend of social media platforms making it harder for researchers and others to scrutinize their processes, with X, formerly Twitter, also restricting access to its data. As Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said, 'Meta Content Library was designed to help us meet new regulatory requirements for data-sharing and transparency while meeting Meta's rigorous privacy and security standards.'

**Meta Plans Higher Headcount in 2024 After Scaling Back on Workers and Real Estate**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is planning to increase its headcount in 2024 after scaling back on workers and real estate over the past two years. According to Chief Financial Officer Susan Li, the company expects to end 2024 with a 'meaningfully higher' headcount than in 2023. This comes after a year of efficiency, dubbed by co-founder Mark Zuckerberg as the 'Year of Efficiency,' where the company cut a third of its workforce. Meta's revenue surged 22% in the second quarter to $39.1 billion, and the company ended the first quarter with almost 70,800 employees, up 2% from the prior quarter. The company is investing heavily in artificial intelligence technology and expects its 2024 capital expenditures to range between $37 billion to $40 billion, with significant growth expected in 2025. 'The big theme right now is, of course, AI,' Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. 'The engine that powers all these new [AI] experiences is the Llama family of foundation models.'

**Meta to Discontinue Spark AR Platform for Third-Party Developers**
Meta Platforms has announced that it will discontinue its AR platform, 'Spark', for third-party developers on January 14, 2025. This means that external developers will no longer be able to provide filters and augmented reality effects for Facebook and Instagram starting next year. The reaction from developers and Spark users has been intense, with some complaining that they will be left without a source of income in just a few months. Meta is not completely giving up on augmented reality, as its own AR effects will still be available within its apps. However, the company is thanking the developer community, companies, and other stakeholders who have been part of the Spark journey, stating that AR will still reach hundreds of millions of users on its platforms. Meta is disappointing hundreds of thousands of external developers with this decision, which is reportedly due to efforts to prioritize products that meet the future needs of its consumers and business customers. Further information may be available at the Meta Connect event on September 25, 2024.

**Meta is shutting down its AR platform in 2025. Where will effects creators go next?**
Meta has announced that it will be shutting down its AR platform Spark on January 14, 2025, affecting third-party effects across its platforms. According to Meta, this decision is part of its efforts to prioritize products that will best serve its consumers and business customers. However, many effects creators are expressing their displeasure over the sudden announcement, with some noting that the cessation of Spark monetization will put them out of work. As one creator, Douglas Costa, said, 'You can't just abruptly end support for filters in such a simple and easy way — it's a huge disrespect to us and also to the Facebook/Instagram users, most of whom continue using the platform because of these effects.' Fortunately, effects creators can consider alternative platforms such as Snap and TikTok, which offer monetization programs for their most-used effects.

This decision has caused disappointment among third-party creators, who are now considering alternatives such as Snapchat Lens Studio or Unity.

**Meta leans away from augmented-reality creators as it plans to shut down its AR studio**
Meta is planning to shut down its augmented-reality studio, Spark, on January 14, 2025, which allowed AR developers and brands to create custom effects for Instagram and Facebook. The company will continue to offer its own AR Effects, but will remove filters created by third-party developers. This decision is part of Meta's efforts to prioritize products that will best serve its consumers and business customers. The move could pose a risk for Meta as it seeks to compete with other social platforms like Snapchat and TikTok, which offer robust developer tools and rewards programs for AR creators. Many AR content creators are upset about the decision, with some saying it will affect their business and force them to look for alternative platforms, such as Snap.

**Meta strikes deal for first major use of next-gen geothermal power east of the Rockies**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has partnered with Sage Geosystems to use next-gen geothermal power for its data centers by 2027. This deal, worth 150 megawatts of power, is a significant step towards clean baseload power for tech companies like Meta, which is essential for meeting their climate commitments and powering their AI ambitions. Sage Geosystems uses a form of energy storage based on manmade cavities within the earth, which can store electricity for two to three times as long as lithium-ion batteries. This technology is distinct from traditional hydrothermal energy and has the potential to power the equivalent of 4 million households by 2030, according to a March study by the Energy Department. Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk called geothermal 'a game-changer' in providing zero-carbon, on-demand power to an ever-more-electrified economy.

**Meta Downplays AI-Generated Disinformation Threat Ahead of US Elections**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has released a security report stating that Russian disinformation campaigns using AI-generated technology have not been successful so far. The report found that these tactics provide only a 'marginal gain in productivity and content generation' for those behind them. Meta claims to have been able to block these operations. The report comes as concerns grow about the potential use of AI-generated content to deceive or mislead people during elections, such as the upcoming US presidential election on November 5. According to the report, Russia remains the primary source of 'coordinated false behavior', with efforts since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine focused on denigrating the country, its government, and its allies. However, the report notes that the images produced by 'Doppelganger', a Russian campaign against Ukraine, 'do not appear to be subject to quality control', with David Agranovich, Meta's director of security policy, stating that 'in many cases, the clarity of the messages seems secondary to the strategy of sending many things hoping that something will take effect somewhere'. As the US elections approach, Meta expects an increase in Russian-backed campaigns targeting politicians who support Ukraine.

**Lawmakers Demand Explanation from Meta on Display of Illegal Drug Ads**
A group of lawmakers from different parties sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressing concern over the display of illegal drug ads on Facebook and Instagram. The letter, sent on August 15, 2024, is based on reports from The Wall Street Journal and the Tech Transparency Project. According to the reports, Meta was unable to prevent ads for prescription pills and cocaine from appearing on its platforms, directing users to websites where they could buy these substances. The lawmakers pointed out that in March 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal authorities were investigating Meta for allowing the sale of illicit drugs. However, in July 2024, the newspaper revealed that the situation had not improved, and the drug ads continued to be displayed. The lawmakers, including Tim Walberg, Gus Bilirakis, Kathy Castor, and Lori Trahan, are concerned that Meta continues to display these ads despite the ongoing federal investigation. They claim that the ads were not hidden and were easily found, containing clear references to illegal drugs. The lawmakers have also criticized Meta for not detecting these ads with its internal processes and have asked Zuckerberg to respond to a list of 15 questions about how the company is handling the issue. Meta confirmed receiving the letter and stated that it would respond shortly. In a statement, Meta said, 'Drug traffickers are criminals who operate on platforms and communities, and that's why we work with authorities to combat this activity. Our systems are designed to detect and act proactively against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads that violate our policies on drugs. We continue to invest resources and improve even more the application of this type of content. Our hearts are with those who suffer the tragic consequences of this epidemic – it's necessary that we all work together to end it.'

**US lawmakers demand that Mark Zuckerberg stop illegal drug ads on Facebook, Instagram**
A group of 19 bipartisan US lawmakers sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressing concerns that the social-media giant is failing to prevent illegal drug ads from running on Facebook and Instagram. The legislators referenced recent reports by The Wall Street Journal and nonprofit Tech Transparency Project that uncovered a slew of explicit drug ads across Meta apps. The ads transferred Meta users to third-party platforms selling prescription pills, cocaine, and other drugs. The lawmakers said they worry about children's safety, since so many young Americans use Meta platforms, and that Meta's personalization features may be complicit in the trafficking of illicit drugs. 'At a hearing before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary in January 2024, you personally apologized to the parents of children who have died following their exposure to exploitation, harassment, and drugs online,' the letter said. 'Despite this and your company's own Community Standards, Meta approved ads throughout 2024 that displayed obvious drug sales.'

**More Than 1,30,000 Techies Have Been Laid Off Since Jan 2024 Amid Hiring Freeze And Job Cuts: Report**
According to a layoff tracking firm, over 1,30,000 tech industry job cuts have occurred since January 2024, with 397 tech companies affected. The layoffs are attributed to a combination of factors, including the global surge in joblessness and the launch of AI tools by tech giants. Notable layoffs include Cisco's 5% workforce reduction (4000 jobs), Intel's 15% workforce reduction (15000 jobs), Tesla's 10% workforce reduction (14000 jobs), Google's 6% workforce reduction (12000 jobs), and Meta's 13% workforce reduction (11000 jobs). Industry leaders like Narayan Murthy have even advocated for a 70-hour work week, exacerbating the issue. Several companies are taking advantage of the massive joblessness by hiring desperate candidates at below-par packages.

**Instagram Tests New Feature Allowing Users to Share Location-Based Updates**
Instagram, a Meta-owned platform, is testing a new feature that allows users to share their location-based updates on a map. This feature, similar to Snap Maps, allows friends to find and track each other after sharing the map. However, unlike Snap Maps, Instagram's feature allows users to share the map with a specific group of people. According to The Verge, the feature was first spotted in February under the name 'Friend Map' and has now been made available for testing in a few countries. Meta, a leading technology and virtual reality company, has a vast portfolio of popular social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The company's market value has reached $945.99 billion, with a share price of $370. Meta offers digital and e-commerce services that enable users to perform various tasks remotely and improve their well-being. As reported by The Verge, Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of the new company in 2022, which would be the parent company of Meta's social media platforms. The company changed its name from Facebook to Meta during a critical period, following several scandals that accused Facebook of leaking users' personal information, leading to a decline in its stock prices. The name change was seen as a solution to this problem, as all the platforms would now be owned by Meta instead of Facebook.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

**ING Reports Lower Interest Income, Meta Sees Strong Advertising Revenue**
ING, a major Dutch bank, reported lower interest income and a lower profit in the second quarter of this year. In contrast, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, saw a significant increase in advertising revenue. Meta's stock price rose by 7% in the after-hours trading in the US. According to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Meta, 'We have had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.' The company uses artificial intelligence to bring ads to users who are interested in them, increasing the profitability of its lucrative advertising division. Meta also benefited from cost savings due to the thousands of layoffs announced earlier. The company expects revenue of between $38.5 billion and $41 billion in the current quarter.

**Meta Reports Record-Breaking Profits and User Growth in 2024**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, reported a net profit of $25.834 billion in the first half of 2024, a 91% increase from the same period last year. The company's revenue for the six months ended June 30 was $75.527 billion, a 25% increase from the same period in 2023. The growth is attributed to its solid advertising business. In the second quarter, Meta reported a profit of $13.465 billion, a 73% increase from the same period last year. The company's revenue during this period was $39.071 billion, a 22% increase, and it saw a 7% increase in daily active users across its platforms. Despite the good results, Meta faced expenses due to a $1.4 billion payment to the state of Texas to settle a lawsuit related to its facial recognition technology. The company anticipates significant expenses this year, which could reach $99 billion. Mark Zuckerberg, in a recent interview with Bloomberg, justified the high expenses in AI research, saying that Meta cannot afford to fall behind in a technology that it considers key to the future. He acknowledged that some companies may be over-spending in this area.

**Meta: Instagram and Facebook ads help drive profit surge**
Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, reported a surge in profits, with revenue rising to over $39bn in the three months to June, a 22% increase from the same period last year. The company attributed the growth to higher ad prices and increased ad reach. Despite investing heavily in AI and metaverse projects, Meta's Reality Labs unit, which develops such products, lost $4.5bn. Meta's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said the company is 'on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.' However, analyst Mike Prolux noted that users are forced to use Meta AI on Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp because it provides the search bar on those apps. Meta has been cutting costs elsewhere, reducing its global workforce to 70,799, down from a peak of over 87,000 employees in 2022. The company expects its headcount to be 'meaningfully higher' by the end of 2024.

**META Stock Before Q2 Earnings Report: To Buy or Not to Buy?**
Meta Platforms (META) is set to report its second-quarter 2024 results on July 31. The company expects total revenues between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, with a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.27 billion, indicating a 19.59% increase from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $4.69 per share, up 0.6% over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 45.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. META has been leveraging AI to boost engagement, with 30% of Facebook posts delivered by its AI recommendation system and AI-recommended content comprising more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. However, rising expenses related to investments in developing more advanced models and AI services are expected to keep margins under pressure. The company's near-term prospects are full of challenges, with modest growth prospects and stretched valuation making it a risky bet for investors. META currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

**EU to Impose Record Fine on Meta for Abusing Dominant Position**
The European Union's competition watchdog, Margrethe Vestager, is preparing to fine Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, a record-breaking €13.4 billion for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the online advertising market. The fine, which could be announced in September or October, would be the highest ever imposed by the EU on a Big Tech company. The EU accused Meta of giving its online marketplace an unfair advantage by linking it to its Facebook social network, allowing users to access the marketplace without explicitly opting in. Meta has denied the allegations, claiming that the innovation is beneficial to consumers and competition. If the EU finds evidence of an abuse of dominant position, Meta could be forced to pay the maximum fine, which is 10% of its global revenue in 2023.

**Meta to Receive First Antitrust Fine from EU**
Meta will receive its first antitrust fine from the European Union for linking its classified ads service Marketplace to its social network Facebook, according to sources familiar with the matter. The European Commission's action comes over a year and a half after accusing the US technology giant of giving its classified ads service Facebook Marketplace an unfair advantage by linking the two services. The competition watchdog also said Meta abused its dominant position by imposing unfair commercial conditions on online classified ads services that advertise on Facebook or Instagram. The company may face a fine of up to $13.4 billion, or 10% of its global revenue in 2023, although EU sanctions are generally much lower than that limit. The Commission is likely to issue its decision in September or October, before the EU's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager leaves her post in November, although the deadline may be delayed, sources said. The Commission declined to comment.

**Meta Faces First European Fine for Anticompetitive Practices**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is expected to receive its first fine from the European Commission for anticompetitive practices. The fine could be significant, potentially up to 10% of the company's global revenue, which is $13.4 billion. The issue concerns Meta's integration of its Marketplace service with Facebook, which the Commission believes gives the company an unfair advantage. The Commission also accuses Meta of abusing its dominant position by imposing unfair commercial conditions on competitors. A Meta spokesperson has denied the allegations, stating that the company is working constructively with regulators to demonstrate that its innovations are pro-consumer and pro-competitive. The decision is expected to be announced in September or October.

**Meta Plans to Cut Reality Labs Budget by 20% Amid Metaverse Focus**
Meta, the company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, plans to cut the budget of Reality Labs, its division focused on developing hardware and software for the metaverse, by around 20% between 2024 and 2026, according to The Information. This move is in line with recent indications that Meta plans to put Reality Labs in 'production mode' before launching several high-level hardware releases planned for the next few years. Analysts at Bank of America believe that the cost-cutting measures would save Meta around $3 billion. The company's next earnings call will take place on July 31, and analysts expect similar numbers to the first quarter, when the company reported $36.45 billion in revenue, a 27% increase from 2023. Reality Labs, however, reported a loss of $3.8 billion in the same period, although some of these losses may not be related to the company's efforts in the metaverse. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's first-quarter 2024 earnings call that 'a growing amount of our Reality Labs work is being directed towards our AI efforts'. A new era of digital economy is happening right before your eyes. Don't waste time or fall behind: open your account at Mynt and invest with the support of experts and curated crypto assets for you to invest. The cuts may represent a realignment of the division's efforts with the potential cascading effect of pleasing inventors seeking to contain the tide of money flowing into Reality Labs. So far, the division has lost around $55 billion since 2019. The cuts represent the first reduction of Reality Labs, but the ultimate fate of the Meta division will likely depend on the creation or not of a robust consumer market for the next generations of virtual reality and augmented reality products, the foundation of the metaverse.

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.

**Trump Returns to Facebook and Instagram After Attempted Assassination**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has lifted the restrictions on Donald Trump's accounts, citing the need to ensure equal access to political expression before the 2024 presidential elections. This decision has sparked a polarized reaction, with some celebrating Trump's return as a victory for free speech and others warning of potential dangers to US security and democracy. Meta justified the decision by arguing that it is necessary to provide a platform for political discourse, especially in a context where freedom of expression and corporate responsibility are complexly intertwined. The company suspended Trump's accounts for two years after the January 6, 2021, Capitol Hill riots, which were led by his supporters. The move was seen as an attempt to limit the reach of potentially dangerous messages. The role of Meta in political discourse is crucial, as the company has committed to allowing citizens to hear presidential candidates equitably, but this commitment faces significant challenges. Analysts argue that the lifting of restrictions on Trump's accounts raises questions about the future of regulating social media and the role of these platforms in politics. As the 2024 elections approach, the importance of social media in politics and how they handle controversial content will be under public scrutiny.

**Meta's New Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Surpass Sales of Previous Model**
The new Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have surpassed sales of the previous model in a few months, according to EssilorLuxottica's CEO, Francesco Milleri. The new glasses, which were released in October, allow users to live-stream directly from their glasses to Facebook and Instagram, and also have integrated Meta AI, which provides information about the item being viewed. The AI features are currently restricted to the US and are expected to be approved in Europe soon. Milleri attributed the success of the new glasses to the fact that people's expectations are now clearer, following the initial generation of smart glasses. The new glasses also have multimodal AI capabilities, allowing for translation, object identification, and more. Additionally, the glasses have a virtual assistant that can be activated by saying 'Hey, Meta' and responding to voice commands.

Intuit is replacing 1,800 employees with new hires who have skills in product, engineering, and customer-facing roles.

**Meta finally lifts lingering restrictions on Trump months out from November * WorldNetDaily * by Hailey Gomez, Daily Caller News Foundation**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced that it will be lifting the 'heightened suspension penalties' on former President Donald Trump's accounts, effective immediately. The decision comes as the 2024 elections approach. The penalties were originally imposed in response to the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. Meta's President of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, stated that the decision was made to allow political candidates to be heard by the American people on the same basis. Trump's account was previously suspended indefinitely, but was revived in January 2023 with a new 'Crisis Policy Protocol' in place. The move comes just days before the Republican National Convention, which is set to start on July 15.

Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, announced on Friday, July 12, that it will remove restrictions on former US President Donald Trump's accounts. The decision comes four months before the US elections. Trump's profiles on the platforms had been suspended after the January 6, 2021, Capitol invasion. In January 2023, the company restored Trump's accounts, but with restrictions, such as the possibility of a two-year ban in case of serious violations and limitations on advertising in case of violations of the company's rules. Meta justified the decision, stating that it is part of the company's responsibility to allow 'political expression' in the electoral context of the country.

**Meta to Restore Facebook and Instagram Accounts of Donald Trump**
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced that it will lift the restrictions on Donald Trump's accounts in the coming weeks. This decision comes after the company reinstated Trump's accounts in January 2023, following a two-year ban, after the January 2021 US Capitol invasion. Meta had imposed rules on Trump's accounts, including prohibiting content that incites violence, promotes QAnon conspiracy theories, and contests election results. The decision to lift the restrictions is reportedly aimed at ensuring 'parity between presidential candidates' ahead of the November election, with Trump having 24.9 million followers on Instagram and 34 million on Facebook.

**Meta lifts suspension of Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts**
Meta, the technology company, has decided to lift the suspension of Donald Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts, just a few months before the 2024 US presidential elections. Trump's accounts were suspended after the events at the US Capitol in 2021. Meta, led by Mark Zuckerberg, initially banned Trump from posting on his social media accounts, citing risks of inciting violence. The company has not specified an exact date for the reinstatement of Trump's accounts, but stated that it aims to ensure equal access to political expression for all candidates before the 2024 elections. The reinstatement of Trump's accounts will restore his presence on both Facebook and Instagram, with millions of followers. 'We believe that the American people should be able to hear from the presidential nominees on an equal basis', said Meta in a statement. 'As a result, former President Trump, as a Republican candidate, will no longer be subject to the same suspension restrictions', concluded the company.

Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been laying off employees in 2024, following a trend that started in 2023.

Microsoft's Satya Nadella attributed the layoffs to the onset of new technology, including advances in AI, which is forcing the company to optimize its workforce.

The EU has accused Meta Platforms of breaching the Digital Markets Act by forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them. The EU Commission claims that the 'pay or consent' model does not allow users to freely consent to the use of their personal data. Meta has until March 2025 to respond to the commission, and could face fines worth 10% of its annual global revenue. Additionally, California is considering legislation that would require AI companies to test their systems and add safety measures, but tech companies are opposing the bill, arguing it would discourage the development of large AI systems and make the ecosystem less safe. Finally, Nvidia is set to be charged by the French antitrust regulator for allegedly anti-competitive practices in the graphics cards sector.

The European Commission has accused Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, of breaking digital competition rules by forcing users to 'pay or consent' to sharing personal data. This could result in fines of up to $13.5 billion. The Commission claims that Meta's 'binary choice' model, which offers users the option to pay for an ad-free version or accept personalized ads, breaches the Digital Markets Act. The Act requires large tech platforms to seek consent before combining users' personal data and offer an equivalent, less personalized alternative for those who refuse. Meta has until March 25, 2025, to respond to the Commission's findings and defend itself.

**Why Tech Companies Are Laying Off Employees Despite Continued Innovation**
The technology industry has seen a wave of layoffs since 2023, with many companies, including Google, Tesla, Apple, and others, cutting jobs. Despite this, companies have continued to innovate, releasing a steady stream of artificial intelligence updates and new products. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, explained in an interview with 'Morning Brew Daily' that companies had hired too many people during the pandemic due to the surge in e-commerce sales and were forced to reduce staff once sales returned to normal. Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, also stated in a memo to employees that the company had increased its workforce by fivefold since 2020. However, despite this, companies are still laying off employees. According to CEOs, this is due to the need to adapt to a changing market and focus on AI development. Google, for example, is reorganizing its workforce to prioritize AI projects, such as its central processing unit based on ARM, and developing Gemini, a search engine supported by AI, and updating Google Workspace. Other companies, such as Microsoft and IBM, are also reorganizing their workforces to focus on AI development. It is unclear when this process will end, but it appears that technology companies are not slowing down in their pursuit of AI development.
