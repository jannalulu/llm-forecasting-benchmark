To make a well-reasoned forecast about whether a Gemini model will be ranked #1 overall on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 3rd Quarter of 2024, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Base Rate and Initial Estimate**: Historically, top-ranking positions in competitive AI model leaderboards like LMSYS have been contested among a few leading companies like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and others. The presence of new models and updates can lead to frequent changes in rankings.

2. **Review of Current Evidence**: 
   - As of August 2024, Google's Gemini models, specifically the Gemini 1.5 Pro, have been performing strongly, often competing for top positions. There are reports of Gemini models claiming the top spot as well as being dethroned by OpenAI models.
   - OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o has been frequently mentioned as a strong competitor, often reclaiming or holding top positions on the leaderboard.
   - Google's Gemini line, despite seeing competitive performance, faces stiff competition from OpenAI's GPT-4o and newly emerging models like Grok-2.

3. **Trends and Developments**:
   - The AI landscape is dynamic, with frequent updates and iterations on models causing shifts in leaderboard rankings. 
   - Google's Gemini models have shown both improvements and setbacks in recent months, indicating an active development cycle and adjustment phase, potentially maintaining close competitiveness with OpenAI.

4. **Causal Forces and Competition Analysis**:
   - Google's Gemini models and OpenAI's models appear closely matched, which suggests that the rankings could change quickly depending on updates to the models or shifts in benchmarking criteria.
   - The existence of other competitors like Grok-2 adds complexity and potential variability to the leaderboard competition.

5. **Probability Assessment**:
   - Given the current information, Gemini models are likely to be competitive but not assured top positions due to strong performance from OpenAI's models and others.
   - Based on recent pattern evidence, the likelihood of a Gemini model retaining or reclaiming #1 by the end of the third quarter is moderate, reflecting historical competitiveness but acknowledging recent challenges.

After considering all factors, the forecast considering present data and trends is:

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.
