**Smoke or sunshine? WA's new air quality map tells you what's ahead**
The Washington Department of Ecology has launched a new air quality monitoring map to help residents stay informed during wildfire season. The map provides real-time updates on air quality, including pollutants like smoke, ozone, and carbon monoxide, and has accessibility features for visually impaired users. The map also includes a smoke forecast, showing what air quality will be like over the next five days, and 7-day and 24-hour air quality trends. The Department of Ecology plans to continue enhancing the map throughout the summer.

**DC region heat intensifies air quality concerns for at-risk groups**
The DC region's heat and humidity can be dangerous for people with cardiovascular, lung diseases, and asthma. The American Lung Association recommends checking the Air Quality Index (AQI) daily to find out when air pollution is dangerous. The AQI tracks ozone and particle pollution and divides air pollution levels into six categories, each with a specific name, color, and health advice. A pulmonologist from the American Lung Association spoke to FOX 5 about the local dangers for at-risk groups, stating that the combination of being in a metro area and hot, muggy summer days can be tough on patients with underlying lung diseases. The doctor also mentioned that climate change is affecting people's breathing quality and exposure to the sun and heat exhaustion. The article provides air pollution safety tips and advises people to be aware of their health and take steps to protect themselves, especially those who are at higher risk from air pollution.

**Hazy days: Valley's air quality much worse than larger metropolitan cities**
The air quality in the Rio Grande Valley has been unhealthy for sensitive groups and the general public, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging from 149 to 157. This is worse than larger metropolitan cities like New York City and Los Angeles, which have AQIs of 44 and 140, respectively. The poor air quality is attributed to agricultural fires in Mexico, which are expected to end this month. The exposure to outdoor air pollution is responsible for 4 million premature deaths worldwide, and unhealthy air quality can lead to hospitalization or even death.

**Smoke still blowing into Yakima Valley from nearby wildfires, causing poor air quality**
Air quality in Yakima, Washington has reached unhealthy levels due to wildfire smoke from nearby fires. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was 151 as of 4 p.m. Saturday, according to the State Department of Ecology's website. The National Weather Service has issued an air quality alert, warning of PM2.5 pollution, which can irritate the eyes and nose and aggravate heart and lung disease. The alert recommends limiting time outside and avoiding strenuous activity, particularly for sensitive groups. Meteorologist Wade Earle explained that winds can vary, but typically blow from the northwest later in the day, bringing in smoke from the fires. As long as the fires continue to burn, poor air quality and smoke could persist. State regulations require employers to provide N95 respirators or masks to outdoor workers when the AQI is above 101.

**Friday to set new record for consecutive 80+ degree days in WA**
Seattle and Western Washington are experiencing a record-breaking streak of 80 degrees or better, with 16 consecutive days as of July 19. The previous record was 15 days in 2015. The region is expected to break the record by the end of the weekend, with an 18-day streak. The heat wave has led to an increase in fire risk, with a red flag warning in place. The dry conditions have also led to an abnormally dry or moderate drought across the state. The forecast is calling for near or below-average temperatures and an increased chance of above-average rainfall in the coming weeks.

**Air pollution alert issued in Kum province, state institutions and schools closed**
The Iranian official news agency IRNA published a statement from the Kum province's public relations department, announcing that the air quality index has reached 'orange' due to high levels of dust and sandstorms. As a result, state institutions and schools were closed for a day, and people with respiratory and heart problems were advised to stay indoors unless necessary. According to the air quality index, values between 0-50 are considered 'green' (clean air), 51-100 'yellow' (moderate), 101-150 'orange' (hazardous), 151-200 'red' (unhealthy), 201-300 'purple' (very unhealthy), and 301-500 'brown' (hazardous).

**As smoke clears, air quality experts warn of weekend Ozone issues**
The remnants of the Fourth of July celebrations in Western Washington have left the area with poor air quality, with 'moderate' to 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' levels reported in Seattle and surrounding areas. The air quality is expected to improve by Saturday morning, but a new issue emerges as the weekend heat builds: Ozone. Air quality experts warn that if temperatures rise, the Ozone levels could reach 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' levels. To stay healthy, limiting time outside in the afternoon is recommended. Air Resource Specialist Phil Swartzendruber advises wearing a N95 mask and limiting time outside when it is smoky to minimize health impacts.

The air quality index is expected to be 133, which is unhealthy for sensitive groups. Officials urge residents to reduce driving, carpool, bike or walk, and postpone errands to reduce air pollution. The increased pollution is attributed to fireworks and holiday travel, as well as extreme heat and a lack of winds. AQI levels in surrounding counties are also expected to be high. Residents are advised to stay indoors and take precautions to reduce air pollution, which can cause severe health issues.

**Delhi breathes cleanest air in 281 days as AQI improves to 'satisfactory'**
Delhi experienced its cleanest day in 281 days with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 79, classified as 'satisfactory'. Rain and strong winds contributed to the improvement in air quality. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, this is the first 'satisfactory' day of the year. Experts attribute the poor air quality during the summer season to prolonged heatwaves and dry spells, but expect cleaner air during the monsoon months. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment, emphasized the importance of utilizing the cleaner air to pace up action to prepare for the winter.

**What to know about air quality in NYC**
New York City's air quality suffers during summer due to high temperatures and humidity, leading to poor air quality and respiratory issues. Air quality alerts are issued when the Air Quality Index (AQI) value exceeds 100. While pollution from urban life is a major contributor, wind patterns can also transport smoke from wildfires thousands of miles away, as seen in June 2023 when smoke from Quebec wildfires reached NYC. Thankfully, this year's fire season has been relatively tame, with more precipitation in typical source regions, making it unlikely to see another hazardous air quality day like June 7, 2023.
