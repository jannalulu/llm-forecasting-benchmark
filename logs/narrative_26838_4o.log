**INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY**

The room is filled with SUPERFORECASTERS, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. A tense silence hangs in the air.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it’s official. The median net worth on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index is above $10.2 billion.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 92.37%. The market trends and tech sector booms leading up to August 2nd were strong indicators.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
And to think, just in April, it was $9.535 billion. Quite the leap, huh?

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning in)  
Remember, it wasn’t just the tech sector. Geopolitical shifts played a part too. Our models caught that.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
It’s fascinating how accurate we were. Yet, it’s more than numbers. It’s about understanding the world’s pulse.

They all nod, a shared understanding of their unique insight into the future.

**INT. A QUIET CAFÉ - DAY - SEPTEMBER 17, 2024**

Two superforecasters, EMMA and LIAM, sit across from each other, sipping coffee. A laptop between them displays the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

**EMMA**  
So, it happened. The median net worth is $10.3 billion.

**LIAM**  
Our models had it at 85.67%. The market rally in August really boosted those numbers.

**EMMA**  
True. The tech sector's performance was unexpected, especially with the AI breakthroughs.

**LIAM**  
And the geopolitical stability helped. No major disruptions since July.

**EMMA**  
I remember when it was just $9.535 billion in April. Quite a leap.

**LIAM**  
It’s fascinating. The precision of our models is something else. But I wonder, what’s next?

**EMMA**  
Well, the future is always uncertain. But for today, we got it right.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their forecasting prowess.
