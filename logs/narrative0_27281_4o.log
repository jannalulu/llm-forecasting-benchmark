*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other at a table, papers and charts spread out before them. The atmosphere is tense with anticipation.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the numbers are in. Did the Warren Buffett Indicator exceed 200% before September 17th?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate, our models had it at 47.89%. Despite the market's volatility and speculative fervor, the ratio peaked at 199.95% just days before the deadline.

**NATE SILVER:** Remarkable. Even with the economic growth and investor optimism, it seems the warning signs Buffett mentioned held true. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The market danced close to the fire but didn't quite burn. It’s a testament to the model's precision and the market's unpredictable nature.

**NATE SILVER:** Another close call. Until next time, Philip.

Well, Philip, the numbers are in. The Warren Buffett Indicator did not exceed 200% before the deadline.

Buffett's caution about valuations playing with fire still echoes. Investors should heed his warning.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. It's a reminder of the market's unpredictable nature, but our models once again proved their accuracy.
