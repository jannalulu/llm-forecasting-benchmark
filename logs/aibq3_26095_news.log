**Paris 2024: Individual Neutral Athlete at the Olympic Games**
Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics under the name 'Individual Neutral Athletes' (AINs), after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to allow them to participate despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The IOC has established an eligibility review panel to determine which athletes can compete, and has set strict requirements for participation. The number of AINs who will compete is still unknown, but the IOC has stated that it will not exceed 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes. The decision has been met with controversy, with some athletes and officials expressing concerns about the fairness and legitimacy of the competition.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned Russia from the 2024 Paris Olympics due to its invasion of Ukraine.

**Guberniev: BRICS Games Competition Should Not Be Compared to Olympics**
Russian sports commentator and TV host Dmitry Guberniev believes that the competition at the BRICS Games should not be compared to the Olympics. 'We won't even compare the competition to the Olympic Games. It's obvious to everyone. The main thing was to load the athletes. There are individual strong opponents from abroad, but overall, the competition is weak. If we compare the results of swimmers with the American selection, we start to lose significantly, and this loss will be even greater when the team doesn't go to the Olympics,' Guberniev said. The BRICS Games started on June 12 in Kazan, with around 5,000 athletes from 97 countries participating. Russia's team has won 502 medals (262 gold, 141 silver, and 99 bronze) so far. It's worth noting that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics in a neutral capacity. Athletes must not support the Special Military Operation (SVO) and be connected to military agencies.

Additionally, 10 Russian athletes, six men and four women, have been declared eligible to compete in wrestling events. The IOC will update this list in accordance with the decisions made by the Individual Athlete Review Panel for Russian and Belarusian athletes. The Russian Tennis Federation president, Shamil Tarpíshchev, announced that three Russian tennis players will not be able to attend the Olympics. In December, the IOC allowed Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the Paris Olympics as neutrals, with certain conditions, including not being able to compete in team events and not supporting the war in Ukraine.

**Russia and Belarus Athletes Allowed to Compete in Paris Olympics Under Neutral Flag**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has included 25 Russian and 11 Belarusian athletes in the initial list of individual neutral athletes eligible to participate in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. The athletes had to meet specific criteria, including passing a double test, first by their international sports federations and then by the IOC, to prove they did not support the war in Ukraine or have any links with their country's military. The athletes will compete in four sports: road cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, and wrestling. The IOC had banned Russian and Belarusian athletes after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but lifted the ban and allowed them to participate again under a neutral flag if they met strict criteria. The IOC had previously predicted that 36 Russian and 22 Belarusian athletes would participate in the Paris Olympics, with a maximum of 55 and 28 respectively. This number is significantly lower than the 330 Russian and 104 Belarusian athletes who participated in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. The neutral athletes will not participate in the opening ceremony and will not receive medals.

**IOC Approves Participation of 25 Russian and Belarusian Athletes in 2024 Paris Olympics**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has approved the participation of 25 Russian and Belarusian athletes in the 2024 Paris Olympics, under the banner of neutrality. The athletes have had to meet the qualification standards and undergo a double check by the international federations and the IOC. The Russian and Belarusian athletes were banned from international sports after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but were reinstated by the IOC in December 2023, subject to certain conditions. The athletes will compete as 'individual neutrals' (AIN) without a national flag, anthem, or colors. Yuliya Efimova, a Russian swimmer, has expressed concerns about not having enough time to validate her qualification, while the Ukrainian government has criticized the IOC's decision, calling it a 'propaganda tool' for the Russian government. The IOC has defended its decision, stating that athletes should not be held responsible for the actions of their government. The athletes will not participate in the opening ceremony or receive medals. The Russian and Belarusian governments have threatened to boycott the Olympics if their athletes are not allowed to compete under their national flags.

**IOC Authorizes 25 Russian and Belarusian Athletes to Compete Under Neutral Flag**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has authorized 25 Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics under a neutral flag. The athletes, who will compete in four sports, including cycling, gymnastics, weightlifting, and wrestling, have been cleared after passing a double check by international federations and the IOC to ensure they do not support the war in Ukraine and have no links with their country's army. This is a smaller number than the 55 Russians and 28 Belarusians expected to participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The neutral athletes will not be able to march under their national flags during the opening ceremony and will not appear in the medal table. Instead, they will use a dedicated flag with the letters 'AIN' on a green background and a short instrumental composition as their anthem if they win an Olympic title.

**IOC Approves Russian and Belarusian Athletes as Neutrals for Paris Olympics**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has approved the participation of 14 Russian and 11 Belarusian athletes as neutrals in the Paris Olympics. The athletes were evaluated based on their support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and their ties to sports clubs linked to the army or security services. The IOC has not yet announced how many Russian athletes will participate in the games, which will take place from July 26 to August 11. No athletes were approved in taekwondo, where Russia won two gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The IOC stated that 'in some sports, the number of eligible athletes may be lower than the number of places won.' The Russian and Belarusian teams are banned from team sports at the Paris Olympics due to the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian athletes, including Olympic medalists, and President Volodymyr Zelensky have called for a general ban on Russian athletes. The process of approving the neutral status of athletes involves two steps: evaluation by sports leaders and then by the IOC panel, with appeals possible to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

**Yuliya Efimova becomes first Russian athlete to receive neutral status for Paris 2024 Olympics**
Yuliya Efimova, a 32-year-old Russian swimmer, has become the first Russian athlete to receive the status of Individual Neutral Athlete (INA) for the 2024 Paris Olympics, allowing her to compete under the five-ring flag. However, she risks missing the qualification deadline, which ends on June 23, and may not be able to participate in the Games. Efimova has won six world championships and three Olympic medals, but has also been suspended for doping twice. She has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) and has been allowed to participate in the Olympics. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) has granted her the status of INA, but she must meet certain conditions, including not having publicly supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine and not being a member of a club linked to Russian security forces. 'I have been given the neutral status, but it's a big problem not having enough time for international qualifications. The competitions are ending on June 23, most have already taken place, and others will take place next week. Today, I don't have a visa for Europe and I don't have access to international qualifications, which are ending soon.'

In February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued a statement to international sports federations, recommending that they not allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in any competitions. However, in December, the IOC allowed Russia and Belarus to participate in the 2024 Olympics in a neutral status. The 2024 Olympics will take place in Paris from July 26 to August 11. As an alternative, Russia created the Friendship Games format. The first Friendship Games were planned to take place from September 15 to 29, 2024, in Moscow and Yekaterinburg.

**Chesnokov: There is no clear favorite among Russians for the Olympic gold medal**
Former world No. 9 Andrey Chesnokov shared his opinion on the main favorites for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Chesnokov considers Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner as the main favorites and notes that Russians do not have many chances to win the tournament. 'Medvedev looked weak at Roland Garros, Rublev was eliminated early, I didn't expect that. Honestly, I don't see stability among our players. I think the girls have even fewer chances to show something incredible. There is no clear favorite among Russians for the Olympic gold medal,' said Chesnokov, as reported by Match TV. The ITF has decided to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the Olympics in Paris in a neutral status, provided they meet the selection and eligibility criteria outlined in the applicable ITF rules.

**Israel Aims for 5 Medals at Paris 2024 Olympics Amid Security Concerns**
As the 2024 Paris Olympics approach, Israel is preparing to send around 85 athletes to the games, despite concerns about security and potential provocations. The Israeli Olympic Committee is focusing on ensuring the athletes' mental concentration, without external pressure from security concerns and anti-Israeli provocations. Israel has won 13 Olympic medals in its history and aims to bring home four to five medals this year. The country has increased the rewards for its Olympic athletes, with a record-breaking 1 million NIS (approximately 245,742 euros) for gold medalists. Despite pressure to prevent Israel from competing or competing under a neutral flag like Russia and Belarus, the International Olympic Committee has confirmed that Israel will compete as usual. The security of its athletes is the top priority, and Israel has almost doubled its security budget for the Paris Olympics. There will be Mossad agents deployed in France to protect the delegation, including at the Olympic Village. Israeli officials are aware of the possibility of protests, whistling, and some athletes or teams refusing to play against Israel. The Israeli football team, for example, will face Mali, a predominantly Muslim country with no diplomatic relations with Israel, in its first match. The Minister of Sport, Miki Zohar, has said that the best way to deal with these provocations is to ignore them and let them be addressed through sports channels without any political intervention. 'The best way to deal with these things is to win, have success on the sports field. Politics should not be mixed with sports.'

A promotional poster for the 2024 Paris Olympics has been spotted in Paris, featuring Elena Isinbaeva with the Russian flag after winning the gold medal in the pole vault at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The poster was designed by the company Iceberg and was presented in May 2020 as part of the 'Olympic Games in Saint-Denis' project. Russian athletes will be able to compete at the Olympics in a neutral status, with national symbols banned. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will make a final decision on the participation of specific Russian athletes after a special commission checks their compliance with the neutral status criteria. Isinbaeva is a two-time Olympic champion (2004, 2008) and has also won three World Championship titles (2005, 2007, 2013). She has set 28 world records and holds the current record of 5.06 meters, set in August 2009.

**Tarpishchev Expects Medvedev and Rublev to Improve at 2024 Olympics**
Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishchev shared his expectations for the performance of Russian tennis players Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. According to Tarpishchev, if Medvedev and Rublev recover from their injuries, they will play better than they did in Tokyo. He also mentioned that the limitation on the number of players from each country will make it easier for them to play, as they won't have to face 20 Spanish players. Medvedev reached the quarterfinals in the singles tournament at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, while Rublev lost in the first round. Karen Khachanov won the silver medal for Russia. Rublev won the gold medal in the mixed doubles with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. The International Tennis Federation announced that Russian and Belarusian tennis players will be allowed to compete at the 2024 Olympics in France in a neutral status, as long as they comply with the principles of neutral athletes formulated by the International Olympic Committee.

**2024 Paris Olympics: What is an Individual Neutral Athlete?**
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has introduced the term 'Individual Neutral Athlete' (INA) for Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in the 2024 Paris Olympics. This decision was made after the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023, but allowed athletes to compete as neutrals. INAs will compete under the abbreviation AIN, derived from the French term 'Athlètes Individuels Neutres'. They will be allowed to compete as long as they meet eligibility requirements, but Russia and Belarus will not be referenced during the games. The IOC has maintained sanctions against the Russian and Belarusian governments, and no flags, anthems, or identifications will be displayed. INAs can win medals, but will not represent their countries in team events.
