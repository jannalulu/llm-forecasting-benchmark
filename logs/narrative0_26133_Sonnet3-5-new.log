Here's a dramatic script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room in Washington D.C. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Tetlock: [solemnly] "The war changed everything, Nate. Netanyahu's position seemed unshakeable after October 7th, but the public's anger over the security failures..."

Silver: [interrupting] "Yes, our models had it at 32.5%. The combination of the mass protests, the military's internal investigation findings, and the growing coalition instability made his position untenable by late summer."

Tetlock: "The models captured the sentiment perfectly. The wartime unity government couldn't withstand the pressure once those classified documents about the pre-attack intelligence were leaked."

Silver: [nodding] "Even with the war still ongoing, the Knesset's vote of no confidence was inevitable. Our early July data showed the writing on the wall - especially after those peace deal negotiations fell apart."

[Both look at their screens showing the prediction graphs plummeting through summer 2024]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were right again about Netanyahu."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 82.5%. Despite the intense criticism following the October 7th attacks, Netanyahu's political survival skills proved remarkable. The wartime coalition held together through September."

Nate: "Looking back at our July data, the key indicators were clear. The military campaign in Gaza had reached its stated objectives, and the emergency unity government remained stable. Even the protests against his judicial reforms had largely subsided."

Philip: "Though I must say, the international pressure over civilian casualties in Gaza nearly tipped things the other way in August. But Netanyahu's core support in the Knesset never wavered."

Nate: "Another testament to how resilient political leaders can be during wartime, regardless of initial failures."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling papers* "So, about Netanyahu..."

Tetlock: "Yes, our models predicted it correctly. We had it at 72% that he'd remain Prime Minister through September."

Nate: "The war with Hamas strengthened his position despite the initial criticism. Our data until July 15th showed strong coalition support, even with the protests."

Tetlock: "The wartime unity government held together. Though fascinating how close it was - the military campaign's progress and domestic political pressure nearly tipped things the other way."

Nate: "The models caught those subtle indicators in the Knesset voting patterns and public opinion shifts. Still, 72% isn't certainty."

Tetlock: "In forecasting, especially with complex geopolitical events, that's about as confident as we get. The war fundamentally changed his political trajectory."

Tetlock: [solemnly] "Well, our models proved accurate again regarding Netanyahu."

Silver: "Yes, our models had it at 32.5%. The combination of the domestic pressure following the October 7 attacks, the widespread criticism of his war cabinet's handling of the conflict, and the growing protests within Israel made his position increasingly untenable."

Tetlock: "The tipping point came when key coalition partners withdrew their support in August. Our models factored in the historical precedent of Israeli leaders stepping down after military intelligence failures."

Silver: "The data showed striking parallels to Golda Meir's resignation after the Yom Kippur War. The writing was on the wall when the state commission of inquiry released its preliminary findings."
