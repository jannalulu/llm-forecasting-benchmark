Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Intel's Dow Jones situation.

Philip Tetlock: Yes, our models had it at 78.5%. The writing was on the wall after that Reuters report in September. Their AI missteps, suspended dividend, and massive layoffs made it almost inevitable.

Nate: The historical significance is striking. Twenty-five years in the Dow, since '99, ending like this. Nvidia was the obvious replacement choice.

Philip: [nodding] The indicators were clear â€“ Intel's declining market relevance, especially in AI, contrasted sharply with Nvidia's dominance. That Reuters article was particularly telling, especially with analysts like Detrick practically calling it.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, even with our high probability estimate, seeing a tech pioneer like Intel dropped still feels momentous.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, Intel managed to stay in the Dow despite the speculation. Our models were right again."

Philip: "Indeed. We had it at 42.8%. The Reuters report in September about Intel's likely removal caused quite a stir, but our models factored in the historical reluctance to change the Dow's composition without absolute necessity."

Nate: "The AI boom passing them by and the dividend suspension were concerning signals, but not enough to trigger removal. Even with Nvidia's meteoric rise and Texas Instruments' domestic production advantage..."

Philip: "The Dow's managers typically prefer stability. Since 1896, changes have been relatively rare. Intel's 25-year tenure, starting in '99 with Microsoft, carried weight. Though they're struggling, the board wasn't ready to break tradition without a complete collapse."

Plus, with Nvidia's AI dominance and Texas Instruments' domestic production strength, suitable replacements were readily available."

Philip: "Exactly. The combination of Intel's struggles and strong alternatives made this prediction particularly confident. It's another validation of our probabilistic approach."
