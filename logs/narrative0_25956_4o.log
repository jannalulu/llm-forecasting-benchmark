*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers spread before them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.72%. Despite the post-debate chaos and Biden's dip in the polls, the virtual roll call solidified his nomination in one round.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The party rallied behind him, with key figures like Obama and Clyburn offering unwavering support.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** The historical rarity of brokered conventions played a role too. Democrats were keen to avoid the unpredictability of multiple ballots.

**NATE SILVER:** And yet, the debate aftermath was a reminder of the volatility in politics. A 35.72% probability was significant but not enough to tip the scales.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The models held true, as they always do.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the Democratic convention was anything but ordinary. The big question: did they need more than one round of voting?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.42%. Despite the chaos post-debate, the party rallied behind Biden. The virtual roll call went smoothly.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the calls for an open convention were loud, but the party's structure held firm. The historical rarity of brokered conventions played into our models.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The panic was palpable, especially after that debate, but prominent figures like Obama and Clyburn steadied the ship.

**NATE SILVER**  
And with that, the Democrats avoid a brokered convention, at least this time around. History repeats, but not today.

*The two exchange nods, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the Democratic Convention has wrapped up, and it appears that the anticipated drama didn't quite unfold as some expected.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
That's right, Nate. Despite the post-debate panic and calls for an open convention, our models had it at 15.75% for a brokered convention. So, no, it wasn't likely, and indeed, it resolved as No.

**NATE SILVER**  
The Democrats managed to rally around Biden, even with the pressure mounting after that June debate. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. History shows brokered conventions are rare, and the data supported that outcome. The party's unity held firm this time around.

No, our models had it at 12.35%. Given Biden's pledged delegate count, it was unlikely.
