Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election data on monitors.]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, that's it. Just one debate before October 1st."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 15.20%. After Biden's poor performance in June and subsequent withdrawal, the chances of multiple debates were slim."

Nate: "The timing was everything. Once Biden dropped out in July, the Democratic Party scrambled to nominate a replacement. Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting didn't help either."

Tetlock: "The data was clear. Historical precedent showed that late nominee replacements rarely participate in multiple debates. Add Trump's demands about the venue..."

Nate: "And the logistical nightmare of organizing debates with a last-minute nominee. *sighs* Sometimes the simplest forecast is the right one."

[They both turn back to their monitors as the scene fades]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. With Biden's sudden withdrawal and the subsequent chaos, we predicted only one debate would occur."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 12.45%. The June debate with Biden ended up being the only one that qualified under the parameters. Once Biden dropped out in July, the likelihood of multiple debates plummeted."

Nate: "The writing was on the wall after Biden's poor performance and withdrawal. Trump's insistence on Fox News and the Democrats' scramble to nominate a replacement made additional debates nearly impossible before October 1st."

Tetlock: "The timeline was just too tight. Between selecting a new nominee and negotiating debate terms, the probability of multiple debates happening was always going to be low."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."

Nate Silver: [removing glasses, rubbing eyes] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 15.20%."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. After Biden's withdrawal in July, the chances of multiple debates were slim. The Democratic party's scramble to nominate Harris, combined with Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting... it was a perfect storm."

Nate: "The single debate on September 15th was all we got. Trump's demand for Fox News and Harris's team pushing for NBC created that deadlock we predicted."

Philip: "Looking back at our July data, the signs were there. Biden's poor performance in that first debate, then his withdrawal... it fundamentally changed the dynamics."

Nate: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from recognizing when circumstances have shifted so dramatically that historical precedents no longer apply."

[Both nod knowingly as they review their prediction models on their screens]
