**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the core CPI for August just dropped. The question was, "Will it be 0.3%?"

**NATE SILVER:** So, the BLS released the core CPI for August. Will the month-over-month increase be 0.3%?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.45%. Given the Fed's recent rate hikes, the signs of moderating inflation weren't surprising.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, the Fed's aggressive stance seems to be paying off, aligning with expectations. A 0.3% increase shows inflation is still present but manageable.
