To forecast this question, I'll examine the available evidence and consider key factors:

1. Recent polling data: The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. This is the strongest data point we have, but it's still several percentage points below the 32% threshold.

2. Historical performance: In the 2019 Brandenburg election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. While they've gained support since then, reaching 32% would be a significant jump.

3. Trends in other East German states: In recent elections in Thuringia and Saxony (September 2024), the AfD received over 30% of the vote. This suggests potential for strong AfD performance in Brandenburg as well.

4. Issues driving support: Immigration and dissatisfaction with established parties are key drivers of AfD support. These issues remain prominent.

5. Opposition to AfD: There's significant opposition to the AfD from other parties and many voters (61% against AfD participating in government according to polls).

6. Potential for polling error: Polls have sometimes underestimated AfD support in past elections.

7. Time until election: With the election occurring on September 22, there's limited time for major shifts in public opinion.

8. Mobilization efforts: Both AfD supporters and opponents may increase get-out-the-vote efforts as election day approaches.

Weighing these factors, I believe the AfD has a chance to exceed 32%, but it's not the most likely outcome. The recent polling at 27% provides a strong anchor, and while there's potential for growth, reaching 32% would require a significant surge in the final weeks. The opposition to the AfD and potential for increased mobilization against them also act as limiting factors.

However, the strong performances in neighboring states and the potential for polling error mean we can't rule out the possibility entirely.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 31.00%, with 28.50% being the most likely. Probability: 28.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll examine the available evidence and consider key factors:

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with 27% support. This is the highest level among recent polls, but still well below the 32% threshold.

2. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg election, AfD received 23.5% of the vote. While they've gained support since then, a jump to over 32% would be a significant increase.

3. Trends in other state elections:
In recent elections in Thuringia and Saxony, AfD received over 30% of the vote. This suggests potential for further gains in Brandenburg.

4. Political climate:
Immigration remains a top concern for voters, which tends to benefit AfD. However, other parties are also focusing on this issue.

5. Potential ceiling on AfD support:
While AfD has a loyal base, there may be a ceiling on their potential support. Many voters and other parties remain strongly opposed to AfD.

6. Time until election:
With only a few days left before the election, major shifts in voter preferences are less likely, though not impossible.

7. Polling error:
Polls have underestimated AfD support in some past elections, but an error of 5 percentage points or more would be unusually large.

8. Turnout factors:
High turnout could potentially work against AfD if it brings out more centrist voters.

Weighing these factors, I assess that while AfD has momentum, reaching over 32% remains unlikely. Their current polling around 27% provides a starting point. Given potential for polling error and last-minute shifts, I estimate a range of roughly 25-30% as most likely for AfD's final vote share.

The probability of exceeding 32% is low but not negligible. I estimate it at around 15%, allowing for the possibility of polling errors, last-minute surges, or unexpected events.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 30.00%, with 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll start by examining the historical context and recent polling data, then consider key factors that could influence the outcome.

Historical context:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. This serves as a useful baseline.

Recent polling:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD leading with 27-28% support. This is a significant increase from 2019, but still below the 32% threshold we're considering.

Key factors to consider:

1. Polling trend: The AfD has been gaining support over time, from 23.5% in 2019 to 27-28% in recent polls. This upward trend suggests further gains are possible.

2. Margin of error: Polls typically have a margin of error of around 3%. Given the AfD is polling at 27-28%, reaching 32% is within the realm of possibility but would require outperforming polls significantly.

3. AfD's performance in other recent state elections: In September 2024, the AfD received over 30% in Thuringia and Saxony. This demonstrates their ability to outperform polls and potentially reach 32% in Brandenburg.

4. Classification as right-wing extremist: The Brandenburg State Office for the Protection of the Constitution has classified the AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist organization. This could limit their appeal to moderate voters but might also energize their base.

5. Immigration concerns: The polls indicate that immigration is the top concern for Brandenburg voters (40% citing it as the most important issue). This plays to the AfD's strengths and could drive higher turnout among their supporters.

6. Potential for tactical voting: As the AfD's chances of winning increase, other parties' supporters might engage in tactical voting to prevent an AfD victory. This could limit their ability to reach 32%.

7. Volatility of support for new parties: The BSW (Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht) is polling at 13-15%. As a new party, their support could be volatile, potentially benefiting the AfD if it collapses.

Balancing these factors, I believe the AfD has a realistic chance of exceeding their current polling numbers, but reaching 32% would require significant outperformance. The upward trend and their recent success in other states provide some support for this possibility, but the potential for tactical voting and the extremist classification act as counterbalances.

Given these considerations, I estimate the probability of the AfD receiving more than 32% of the vote to be low but not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

4. Comparison to other recent state elections: In September 2024 elections in Thuringia and Saxony, AfD received over 30% of the vote. This shows it's possible for AfD to reach that level in an East German state.

5. Unique factors in Brandenburg: The state has classified the AfD as a suspected right-wing extremist organization, which could limit their appeal to some voters.

To approach this question, I'll analyze the available evidence and consider various factors that could influence the outcome:

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with support ranging from 24% to 27%. This is significantly below the 32% threshold we're evaluating.

2. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. While they've gained support since then, reaching 32% would represent a massive increase.

3. Trends in other recent state elections:
In the September 2024 elections in Thuringia and Saxony, the AfD received over 30% of the vote. This suggests potential for strong AfD performance, but Brandenburg's political landscape may differ.

4. Time until election:
The election is scheduled for September 22, 2024, which has already passed. We're evaluating based on the results that should now be known.

5. Political context:
The AfD has been classified as a right-wing extremist suspicion case in Brandenburg, which could limit its appeal to some voters.

6. Competitor parties:
The SPD, CDU, and BSW were all polling between 15-23% in recent surveys, suggesting a fragmented opposition that could potentially benefit the AfD.

7. Voter turnout and last-minute shifts:
These factors can cause actual results to differ from polls, but typically not by massive margins.

Balancing these factors:

- The consistent polling in the mid-to-high 20s for the AfD provides a strong baseline.
- The recent performance in neighboring states suggests potential for overperformance relative to polls.
- However, the gap between recent polls and the 32% threshold is quite large.
- The political context in Brandenburg may be less favorable to the AfD than in Thuringia or Saxony.

Given this analysis, it seems highly unlikely that the AfD reached 32% of the vote. The most likely outcome based on the available information would be a result in the high 20s, potentially approaching but not exceeding 30%.

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 31.00%, with 28.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

- The political context in Brandenburg may be less favorable to the AfD than in Thuringia or Saxony.

Given this analysis, it seems highly unlikely that the AfD reached 32% of the vote. The most likely outcome based on the available information would be a result in the high 20s, potentially approaching but not exceeding 30%.

My Prediction: Between 26.50% and 31.00%, with 28.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.

To approach this question, I'll analyze the available evidence and consider various factors that could influence the outcome:

1. Recent polling data:
The most recent polls from September 2024 show the AfD with support ranging from 24% to 27%. This is significantly below the 32% threshold we're evaluating.

2. Historical performance:
In the 2019 Brandenburg state election, the AfD received 23.5% of the vote. While they've gained support since then, reaching 32% would represent a massive increase.

3. Trends in other recent state elections:
In the September 2024 elections in Thuringia and Saxony, the AfD received over 30% of the vote. This suggests potential for strong AfD performance, but Brandenburg's political landscape may differ.

4. Time until election:
The election is scheduled for September 22, 2024, which has already passed. We're evaluating based on the results that should now be known.

5. Political context:
The AfD has been classified as a right-wing extremist suspicion case in Brandenburg, which could limit its appeal to some voters.

6. Competitor parties:
The SPD, CDU, and BSW were all polling between 15-23% in recent surveys, suggesting a fragmented opposition that could potentially benefit the AfD.

7. Voter turnout and last-minute shifts:
These factors can cause actual results to differ from polls, but typically not by massive margins.

Balancing these factors:

- The consistent polling in the mid-to-high 20s for the AfD provides a strong baseline.
- The recent performance in neighboring states suggests potential for overperformance relative to polls.
- However, the gap between recent polls and the 32% threshold is quite large.
- The political context in Brandenburg may be less favorable to the AfD than in Thuringia or Saxony.
