**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the numbers are in. On September 30, 2024, the CDC reported a total of 292 measles cases in the United States for the year. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No surprise there, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. Given the trajectory from the July 15 update of 167 cases, it was unlikely to surpass 300.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The biweekly updates didn't show any significant spikes, and the vaccination campaigns have been robust this year.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It's a testament to public health efforts. Our models, as always, reflected the reality accurately.

**NATE SILVER:** So, no, our models had it at 35.67%. It's reassuring to see the forecasts align with the outcomes.

NATE SILVER  
So, Philip, on September 30, 2024, did we see more than 300 measles cases reported in the U.S. this year?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.42%. With 167 cases by July 15 and no significant outbreaks reported by August 20, the probability of surpassing 300 was low.
