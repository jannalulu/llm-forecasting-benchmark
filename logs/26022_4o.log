To forecast whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, we can break down the analysis using the principles of superforecasting. 

1. **Reference Class:** 
   - Historically, the ICC has issued arrest warrants for high-profile political figures, but these cases are complex and highly political, often involving significant international legal and diplomatic challenges. Arrest warrants against sitting world leaders are rare, though not unprecedented (e.g., the warrants issued for Omar al-Bashir and Muammar Gaddafi).
   - Comparing to similar cases, particularly in highly tense geopolitical environments involving major powers like Israel, which is not a signatory to the ICC, and considering the strong international opposition from allies like the US, the likelihood of issuing such a warrant, though possible, remains low.

2. **News and Events Analysis:**
   - The news articles indicate significant movement towards issuing warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to alleged war crimes in Gaza. The articles span several months and include various languages and perspectives, indicating broad international reporting on the potential ICC action.
   - While the initial articles suggest that the ICC was moving forward with the arrest warrants, the more recent articles highlight the delays and political interventions from powerful countries like the UK and the US. The ICC's decision to delay indicates the influence of major geopolitical factors that could inhibit or slow the process.
   - Some articles referenced expectations of imminent warrants, but these have not been confirmed publicly by the ICC or credible sources before the cutoff date of September 30, 2024.

3. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - On one hand, there is significant international pressure and evidence of alleged crimes, which might push the ICC towards issuing a warrant.
   - On the other hand, there is considerable political pushback and obstruction from Israel, the US, and other allies, aiming to delay or block such an action.

4. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views:**
   - Inside view (specific case): Given the extended delays and complex political interference, it seems unlikely the ICC will issue a public and official arrest warrant before the set date.
   - Outside view (historical context): Arrest warrants for sitting political figures from widely supported international states often take extensive time and face significant opposition.

5. **Current Trends and Evidence:**
   - Given the current trends of procrastination and diplomatic pushback against the ICC, combined with the procedural complexities, it appears improbable that the situation will resolve with a public arrest warrant by September 30, 2024.

In conclusion, despite the initial appearance of momentum towards an ICC arrest warrant, the external geopolitical pressures and procedural delays indicated in recent news reports suggest that a warrant has not been issued publicly or officially disclosed. Past approximation of such decisions suggests a low probability for finalization before the specified date.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To determine the probability of the International Criminal Court (ICC) having issued an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant specifically, we start by considering historical base rates for the ICC issuing arrest warrants for high-profile government officials. The ICC has occasionally issued warrants against sitting government leaders like in the case of Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir, but such cases are rare due to numerous political and procedural hurdles.

Next, we assess the recent developments and context. Reports from various news outlets indicated that the ICC had deliberated on issuing arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant due to alleged war crimes linked to their actions in Gaza. Several sources from May to June 2024 reported that warrants had been officially issued, and these reports were consistent across multiple outlets from various regions with international credibility. Notably, as of June, there was a delay announced by the ICC due to external interventions, which could have affected whether the warrants were publicly executed or merely remained theoretical.

It's now October 2024, and any warrants would have needed public confirmation by September 30, 2024, according to the resolution criteria. Given the lack of definitive public confirmation from credible sources about such a warrant against Gallant specifically and the numerous delays and political opposition faced (primarily from nations like the US and UK), it seems plausible to conclude that an official public disclosure did not occur before the September deadline.

Considering all this information, the evidence suggests that while there was significant consideration and perhaps intent to issue a warrant, the final, official, publicly confirmed issuance of the arrest warrant for Gallant is unlikely to have occurred by the resolution date. Therefore, balancing the inside view of the news reports and political considerations with the outside statistical view of such events, I would estimate a lower probability for a public warrant issuance.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured analytical approach:

1. **Base Rates and Reference Class:**
   The issuance of ICC arrest warrants against high-ranking officials from countries not recognizing the ICC's jurisdiction, like Israel, is historically rare but not unprecedented. High-profile examples include ICC warrants issued for leaders such as Sudan's Omar al-Bashir. However, most cases involve situations where the local judicial system is perceived to be unwilling or unable to prosecute. Israel has a robust legal system, although it has refused to participate in ICC proceedings regarding the Palestinian territories.

2. **Recent Developments:**
   Initial news articles reported ICC arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant in May 2024. However, later news updates indicate delays in the decision-making process due to interventions, such as the UK's amicus curiae brief, which can prolong the process by several months.
   
3. **Assessment of Recent News:**
   While multiple sources throughout May and early June consistently reported the issuance of warrants, June's articles suggest the ICC decision was postponed indefinitely due to political interventions. The likelihood of publicly declared warrants being issued within the relevant timeframe, given these delays, appears diminished.
   
4. **Balancing Evidence:**
   There was strong initial momentum and public expectation towards issuing arrest warrants, driven by public statements and prosecutorial requests. However, the procedural delays and political complexities, such as objection from powerful ICC non-signatories like the US and Israel, make it challenging for the ICC to follow through within a constrained timeframe.

5. **Resolution Criteria Alignment:**
   The criteria emphasize publicly and officially disclosed warrants before the specified deadline. If a warrant was issued secretly, it has not been disclosed publicly nor officially before the date, according to the criteria outlined in the background.

In summary, although there was an initial indication of the ICC's willingness to issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant, the procedural delays, objections, and need for public official disclosure reduce the likelihood significantly as of the latest data available. 

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.
