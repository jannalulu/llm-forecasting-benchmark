Let me carefully analyze the evidence and break this down systematically:

Key Considerations:
1. Current Outbreak Severity
- 9 deaths reported
- 57+ hospitalizations
- Outbreak across 18 states
- Serious contamination in Boar's Head Virginia plant
- Numerous USDA inspection violations found

2. Recall Timeline
- Initial recall in July 2024
- Expanded recall in August 2024
- Products have sell-by dates until October 17, 2024
- Plant shutdown announced on September 13, 2024

3. Regulatory Context
- USDA is conducting a thorough investigation
- Listeria is a serious public health concern
- Multiple systemic violations discovered
- High likelihood of extended investigation

4. Probability Assessment
- High complexity suggests prolonged recall
- Systemic plant issues require comprehensive resolution
- Public health risks mandate thorough investigation
- Unlikely to close before October 1, 2024 given severity

Balancing Considerations:
- Linear trend suggests continued active status
- Significant public health implications
- Company's reputation at stake
- Need for comprehensive corrective actions

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 92.50% being the most likely. Probability: 92.50%.

Let me carefully analyze this complex forecasting problem:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recall Timeline:
- Recall initiated in July 2024
- Affected products have sell-by dates until October 17, 2024
- 7 million pounds of products recalled
- Serious listeria outbreak (9 deaths, 57+ hospitalizations)

2. Company Response:
- Boar's Head shut down its Virginia plant linked to outbreak
- Acknowledged serious food safety violations
- Committed to investigation and corrective actions

3. Regulatory Context:
- USDA actively investigating
- Extensive product contamination discovered
- Multiple systemic plant safety issues reported

Forecasting Considerations:
- Severity of outbreak suggests thorough investigation needed
- Regulatory scrutiny likely extensive
- Company needs comprehensive remediation before recall closure
- October 1st is relatively soon after major recall expansion

Probability Reasoning:
- Base rate for quick recall resolution: Low
- Complexity of contamination: High
- Public health risks: Significant
- Regulatory thoroughness: Likely deliberate and slow

Balancing Uncertainties:
- Against quick resolution: Serious outbreak, multiple deaths
- For potential resolution: Company's proactive stance
- Regulatory timeline pressure balanced with thorough investigation needs

Forecast Calculation:
- Low probability of pre-October 1st closure
- Significant evidence suggesting continued active status

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

Let me methodically analyze this recall scenario:

Key Timeline Evidence:
- Recall initiated in July 2024
- Affects 7 million pounds of products
- Sell-by dates range to October 17, 2024
- Serious listeria outbreak with 9 deaths, 57+ hospitalizations
- USDA plant inspection revealed 69 violations
- Boar's Head shut down Virginia plant on September 13, 2024

Critical Analysis:
1. Severity suggests comprehensive investigation required
2. Multiple systemic issues found in facility
