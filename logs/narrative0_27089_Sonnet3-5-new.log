[Scene: A dimly lit coffee shop in New York. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sitting at a corner table, reviewing their forecasting models on laptops.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the iPhone Wi-Fi 7 announcement."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 78% likelihood. The signals were strong - Ming-Chi Kuo's analysis about the iPhone 16 Pro models adopting Wi-Fi 7 technology, the natural progression from Wi-Fi 6E in the 15 Pro, and Apple's history of implementing cutting-edge wireless technology in their Pro models."

Nate: "The timing made sense too. September's always been Apple's iPhone announcement month, and with competitors pushing Wi-Fi 7 adoption, Apple needed to keep pace."

Philip: "Though we only had data until early August, the supply chain indicators and industry trends gave us strong confidence in our prediction."

[They both nod, closing their laptops]

[Scene: A dimly lit office with multiple monitors displaying data models. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasts.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the iPhone Wi-Fi 7 announcement."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 72.4%. The signals were strong, especially after Ming-Chi Kuo's early analysis about the iPhone 16 Pro models adopting Wi-Fi 7. The technology's capability for 30+ gigabits per second speeds made it a logical next step for Apple's premium models."

Nate: "The timing aligned perfectly with Apple's traditional September announcement window. Plus, with competitors pushing Wi-Fi 7 adoption, Apple needed to keep pace in the premium smartphone segment."

Philip: "The market pressure, combined with the natural progression from Wi-Fi 6E in the iPhone 15 Pro, made this prediction relatively straightforward. Another win for systematic forecasting."

[They both nod, turning back to their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the iPhone Wi-Fi 7 announcement."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 85.5%. The signals were strong - Ming-Chi Kuo's early prediction about the iPhone 16 Pro models, the industry's push toward Wi-Fi 7 adoption, and Apple's historical pattern of implementing new wireless standards in their Pro models first."

Nate: "The timing made sense too. September's always been Apple's iPhone announcement month, and with competitors racing to implement Wi-Fi 7, Apple couldn't afford to lag behind."

Philip: "What I found particularly convincing was how they'd already implemented Wi-Fi 6E in the iPhone 15 Pro. It was a logical stepping stone to Wi-Fi 7 in the 16 Pro."

[They both nod, satisfied with their prediction.]
