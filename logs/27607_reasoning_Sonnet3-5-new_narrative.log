[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like Korenevo stayed in Russian hands after all."

Tetlock: [studying a map] "Our models had it at 15.20%. The Ukrainian advance in August was promising - they even made it to the eastern outskirts along Sudzhanskiy Shlyakh Street. But the Russian counter-response was decisive."

Nate: "The bridge destructions at Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi really hampered their logistics. And those Russian defensive positions near the nuclear plant complicated things."

Tetlock: "What's interesting is how close they got. That August 19 geolocated footage showed Ukrainian forces right at Korenevo's doorstep. But Russia's artillery and airstrikes contained the advance."

Nate: "Sometimes even promising offensives hit their limit. The models saw this coming - a bold thrust, but ultimately unsustainable."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on about Korenevo. Given the August data, especially that geolocated footage showing Ukrainian forces on Sudzhanskiy Shlyakh Street, we had it at 72.45%."

Tetlock: [nodding] "The mechanized assaults we saw in late August were crucial indicators. When Ukrainian forces established positions northeast of Korenevo while simultaneously striking Russian pontoon bridges near Glushkovo, the writing was on the wall."

Nate: "The Russian milblogger reports about losing positions around Safonovka were particularly telling. Though I admit, the proximity to the Kursk Nuclear Plant added complexity to our calculations."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The IAEA's involvement and Russia's defensive preparations around the plant suggested they were expecting a sustained Ukrainian presence in the region."

[They both turn to update their forecasting models]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on about Korenevo. Looking back at what we knew by late August, the signs were there."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The geolocated footage from August 19 showing Ukrainian advances along Sudzhanskiy Shlyakh Street was crucial. But the Russian counteroffensive near Safonovka and their destruction of bridges across the Seim River were significant obstacles."

Nate: "Our models had it at 35.75%. The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast was bold, but taking and holding Korenevo was always going to be challenging, especially with winter approaching."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The proximity to the Kursk Nuclear Plant complicated things too. Once Russia reinforced those defensive positions and brought in additional Rosgvardiya forces, the probability of a successful Ukrainian capture dropped significantly."
