The room buzzes with quiet anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying geomagnetic data. 

**JAMES (superforecaster, 40s)**  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
"Well, folks, our models had it at 12.67%. AR3697 put on quite a show, but it seems we dodged the bigger storm."

**LUCY (superforecaster, 30s)**  
(nodding)  
"Indeed. The merged sunspot's history of flares had us on edge, especially after May's auroras. But the Kp peaked just shy of 7."

**MIKE (superforecaster, 50s)**  
(relieved)  
"Our predictions held. No major disruptions reported. The magnetic field danced, but not too wildly."

**JAMES**  
(smiling)  
"Let's update the models. This cycle's not over yet."

They exchange knowing glances, ready to continue their watchful vigil. The screen flickers, displaying the serene aftermath of Earth's magnetic ballet.

*Two superforecasters, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is tense yet focused.*

**ALEX**  
Well, the window has closed. Did it happen?

**JORDAN**  
Our models had it at 65.32%. AR3697 was a beast, but it seems it didn't quite hit the mark.

**ALEX**  
The news articles up to August 19th had us on edge. Those M- and X-class flares were something else.

**JORDAN**  
True, but the Kp stayed just under 7. The geomagnetic storm was intense but not enough to break that threshold.

**ALEX**  
So, no major disruptions then. Good news for the satellites and power grids.

**JORDAN**  
Yeah, a close call. But it's a reminder of the sun's unpredictability.

*They both nod, understanding the delicate balance of probabilities and the reality of space weather.*
