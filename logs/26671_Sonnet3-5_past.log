To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Current situation:
- Emmanuel Macron's "Together" coalition lost its majority in the June/July 2024 legislative elections.
- The left-wing "New Popular Front" coalition won the most seats (182), followed by Macron's "Together" (168), and the far-right "National Rally" (143).
- No single bloc has a majority in the 577-seat National Assembly.

2. Prime Minister appointment process:
- The President appoints the Prime Minister, but they need support from the National Assembly.
- Macron has stated he will appoint a new PM after the Olympics (which end August 11, 2024).

3. Possible scenarios:
a) Macron appoints a PM from his own coalition:
- This seems unlikely given they don't have a majority.
- However, Macron might attempt this if he can't form agreements with other parties.

b) Macron appoints a PM from another party/coalition:
- This is more likely given the election results.
- The left-wing coalition has the most seats, making them a potential choice.

c) A "unity" or "technocratic" government:
- Macron might choose a non-partisan figure to lead a government of national unity.

4. Factors to consider:
- Macron's desire to maintain some control over policy.
- The need for a stable government ahead of the 2027 presidential election.
- The reluctance of other parties to work with Macron's coalition.

5. Historical precedent:
- France has experienced "cohabitation" before, where the President and PM are from different parties.
- However, this situation is unprecedented in the Fifth Republic, with such a fragmented parliament.

Given these factors, I believe it's unlikely that the Prime Minister on August 31, 2024, will be from Macron's "Together" coalition. Macron will likely need to compromise to form a government, which probably means choosing a PM from outside his coalition.

However, there's significant uncertainty. Macron might attempt to appoint a PM from his coalition if negotiations with other parties fail, or he might choose a non-partisan figure in a bid for unity.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current situation: As of July 29, 2024, Gabriel Attal is still the Prime Minister, belonging to Macron's "Together" coalition. However, his resignation has been accepted by Macron, though he remains in office temporarily.

2. Election results: The left-wing coalition "New Popular Front" won the most seats (182) in the recent legislative elections, followed by Macron's "Together" coalition (168 seats), and the far-right "National Rally" (143 seats). No party has a clear majority.

3. Timing: Macron has stated he will not appoint a new Prime Minister until after the Paris Olympics, which end on August 11, 2024. This gives him about 20 days to make a decision before August 31.

4. Political landscape: France is in a state of "cohabitation," where the President's party doesn't have a majority. Historically, this has led to the President appointing a Prime Minister from the majority party in the National Assembly.

5. Macron's stance: He has called for a "grand coalition" and urged parties to work together, potentially taking time to form a government.

6. Left-wing coalition's position: They have proposed their own candidate (Lucie Castets) for Prime Minister, which Macron has not accepted.

7. Historical precedent: In previous cohabitations, the President has appointed a Prime Minister from the majority party in the Assembly.

Balancing these factors:

- The "Together" coalition doesn't have a majority, making it less likely for the Prime Minister to come from this group.
- Macron's call for a grand coalition suggests he might try to appoint someone from his own party or a compromise candidate.
- The left-wing coalition's majority puts pressure on Macron to choose from their ranks.
- The short timeframe between the Olympics' end and August 31 might lead Macron to keep Attal in place temporarily.

Given these considerations, it seems more likely than not that the Prime Minister on August 31, 2024, will not belong to Macron's "Together" coalition. However, there's significant uncertainty due to the complex political situation and Macron's unpredictable approach.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

4. Factors favoring outcome a):
- Macron's coalition is the second-largest in parliament
- Macron may try to form alliances with other centrist or right-wing MPs
- Historical precedent of presidents appointing PMs from their own party when possible

5. Factors against outcome a):
- Macron's coalition lacks a majority, making it difficult to pass legislation

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Current situation: 
- Macron's coalition lost the parliamentary majority in June 2024 elections.
- A left-wing coalition (New Popular Front) won the most seats, followed by Macron's coalition, then the far-right National Rally.
- No single bloc has a majority.

2. Prime Minister appointment process:

- Macron has said he will appoint a new PM after the Olympics (which end August 11, 2024).

3. Potential scenarios:
a) Macron appoints a PM from his own coalition (most likely if he can form a working majority).
b) Macron appoints a PM from another party/coalition to form a unity government.
c) Political deadlock leads to keeping the current interim government.

4. Key factors:
- Macron's desire to maintain influence vs. need for stability.
- Willingness of other parties to cooperate or compromise.
- Public opinion and pressure for a functioning government.

5. Timeline:
- Current interim government expected to remain until at least mid-August.
- New PM appointment likely between mid-August and August 31.

Analysis:
The situation is highly uncertain. Macron's coalition doesn't have a majority, which reduces the likelihood of appointing a PM from his own ranks. However, there are several factors that could increase this probability:

1. Macron's constitutional power to appoint the PM.
2. The fragmented opposition may struggle to form a united front.
3. Macron's coalition might negotiate support from moderate elements of other parties.
4. The need for stability might push towards maintaining some continuity.

On the other hand, factors decreasing the probability include:
1. Strong performance of the left-wing coalition.
2. Public desire for change after Macron's coalition lost its majority.
3. Pressure to respect the election results by appointing a PM from the largest parliamentary group.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance Macron will appoint a PM from his coalition, but it's far from certain. The most likely scenario might be a compromise candidate who can work with Macron's coalition but also gain support from moderate elements of other parties.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

2. Prime Minister status: Gabriel Attal resigned after the election, but Macron asked him to stay on temporarily until after the Olympics (ending August 11, 2024).

3. Timing: Macron has stated he will appoint a new prime minister after the Olympics, which end on August 11. This gives about 20 days to form a government before August 31.

4. Political landscape: No single party or coalition has a majority. Macron has called for parties to work together to form a broad coalition.

5. Possible scenarios:
   a) Macron appoints a "Together" coalition member as PM, forming a minority government.
   b) Macron forms a coalition with moderate elements of other parties, possibly maintaining a "Together" PM.
   c) Macron is forced to appoint a PM from another coalition, likely the left-wing "New Popular Front".

6. Historical precedent: In past "cohabitation" scenarios, presidents have typically appointed PMs from the majority party/coalition in parliament.

7. Macron's strategy: He seems to be trying to avoid appointing a non-"Together" PM, by delaying the decision and calling for broad cooperation.

8. Time pressure: The need to form a government relatively quickly after the Olympics may push towards compromise.

Weighing these factors:

- The lack of a "Together" majority significantly reduces the chances of a "Together" PM.
- However, Macron's delay tactics and calls for cooperation suggest he's trying to maintain control.
- The fragmented parliament makes predicting outcomes difficult.
- There's a significant chance Macron will be forced to appoint a PM from another coalition, but he may find a way to maintain a "Together" PM through negotiations.

Given these considerations:

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

- There's a significant chance Macron will be forced to appoint a PM from another coalition, but he may find a way to maintain a "Together" PM through negotiations.

Given these considerations:

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the key information and factors:

1. Current situation: Emmanuel Macron's "Together" coalition lost the parliamentary majority in the June/July 2024 elections. The left-wing "New Popular Front" won the most seats (182), followed by Macron's "Together" (168), and the far-right "National Rally" (143).

2. Prime Minister status: Gabriel Attal resigned after the election, but Macron asked him to stay on temporarily until after the Olympics (ending August 11, 2024).

3. Timing: Macron has stated he will appoint a new prime minister after the Olympics, which end on August 11. This gives about 20 days to form a government before August 31.

4. Political landscape: No single party or coalition has a majority. Macron has called for parties to work together to form a broad coalition.

5. Possible scenarios:
   a) Macron appoints a "Together" coalition member as PM, forming a minority government.
   b) Macron forms a coalition with moderate elements of other parties, possibly maintaining a "Together" PM.
   c) Macron is forced to appoint a PM from another coalition, likely the left-wing "New Popular Front".

6. Historical precedent: In past "cohabitation" scenarios, presidents have typically appointed PMs from the majority party/coalition in parliament.

7. Macron's strategy: He seems to be trying to avoid appointing a non-"Together" PM, by delaying the decision and calling for broad cooperation.

8. Time pressure: The need to form a government relatively quickly after the Olympics may push towards compromise.

Weighing these factors:

- The lack of a "Together" majority significantly reduces the chances of a "Together" PM.
- However, Macron's delay tactics and calls for cooperation suggest he's trying to maintain control.
- The fragmented parliament makes predicting outcomes difficult.
- There's a significant chance Macron will be forced to appoint a PM from another coalition, but he may find a way to maintain a "Together" PM through negotiations.
