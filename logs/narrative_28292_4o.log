INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (OCTOBER 1, 2024)

A cozy coffee shop buzzes with morning chatter. Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, MIKE, and LUCAS, sit at a corner table, laptops open, analyzing data.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
Well, itâ€™s official. Tesla closed at $231.10 yesterday.

MIKE  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 75.35%. The Robotaxi buzz was a strong indicator.

LUCAS  
(smirking)  
And yet, some still doubted. The market loves a good story.

JANE  
(sipping coffee)  
True. But with no major news up to the 18th, it was all about anticipation.

MIKE  
(typing)  
Exactly. The lead-up to the Robotaxi reveal was enough to tip the scales.

LUCAS  
(grinning)  
Another win for the models. Never wrong, just like we said.

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their predictive prowess.

FADE OUT.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. They review the previous day's stock data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the numbers are in. Tesla closed at $229.85 yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.75%. The uncertainty was largely due to the anticipation around the Robotaxi unveiling.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. The market had been fluctuating, but the drop was unexpected. The lack of significant news before our cutoff on September 18th made it a tight call.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It seems the market's nervousness about the unveiling affected the close. But our models captured that risk.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. A testament to the power of accurate forecasting. 

They nod, satisfied with their work, as the scene fades out.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

JANE  
Well, the numbers are in. Tesla closed at $231.15 yesterday.

MIKE  
Our models had it at 92.75%. The Robotaxi anticipation really drove those last-minute buys.

MIKE  
Exactly. The pre-launch excitement was enough to push it over the line.

JANE  
And yet, a few months ago, who would've thought? It was touch and go at $230.29 on September 13th.

MIKE  
True. But the models never lie. They saw the trend before anyone else.

JANE  
Here's to another accurate forecast. 

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their precise prediction.
