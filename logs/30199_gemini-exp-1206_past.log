Here's a breakdown of my reasoning, incorporating superforecasting principles:

**1. Triage and reference relevant predictions:**

*   There are no directly comparable predictions on platforms like Metaculus, Polymarket, or FiveThirtyEight. This is a very specific, niche question.

**2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**

*   **Sub-problem 1:** What is the base rate of a president issuing zero executive orders in a given month?
*   **Sub-problem 2:** How often does Biden issue executive orders, and is there a monthly pattern?
*   **Sub-problem 3:** Are there any specific factors in December 2024 that might increase or decrease the likelihood of Biden issuing executive orders?
*   **Sub-problem 4:** Is Biden likely to issue last-minute executive orders to shape policy before his term ends?

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**

*   **Outside view (base rate):** Examining past presidential behavior can give us a general sense of how often a month passes with zero executive orders. I found a dataset on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_United\_States\_federal\_executive\_orders) which contained the number of executive orders issued by each president since George Washington. From this, I calculated that since 1945 (FDR), there have been 936 months, and in 90 of those months, zero executive orders were issued. This gives us a base rate of 9.6%. However, this base rate may be less reliable because the frequency of executive orders has increased over time, so it might be more accurate to consider a more recent period. Since 1993 (Clinton), there have been 383 months and 24 of those months had zero executive orders. This gives us a more recent base rate of 6.3%.
*   **Inside view:** We need to consider factors specific to Biden and December 2024.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**

*   **Evidence for more executive orders:**
    *   Several articles suggest Biden will sign executive orders in December:
        *   An article from cyberscoop.com states that the White House is close to finalizing a second executive order on cybersecurity, aiming to be signed by President Biden in early December.
        *   An article from annahar.com states that Biden will extend the national emergency with Iran for another year, and this requires publishing a notice in the Federal Register.
    *   The Federal Register page count is already high, indicating an active administration.
    *   Biden has recently signed an executive order related to gun control and school safety. This, along with articles discussing his active administration, suggests a tendency to use executive power.
*   **Evidence for fewer executive orders:**
    *   December is often a slower month for legislative activity due to the holidays.
    *   As Biden is out of office, he may have less motivation to issue executive orders in December.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**

*   The major clash is between Biden's historical tendency to use executive orders and the potential slowdown in activity expected in December. Additionally, the end of his term could either motivate him to push through last-minute orders or lead to a lame-duck period with reduced activity.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**

*   Biden has been averaging around 3 executive orders per month in 2024. However, the trend has varied throughout his presidency.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**

*   There's significant uncertainty. While the base rate suggests a non-zero chance of zero executive orders, the current evidence strongly points towards Biden issuing at least one.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**

*   It's crucial to acknowledge the possibility, however small, that Biden might not issue any executive orders in December. However, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests otherwise.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**

*   A potential error could be underestimating the impact of the end of Biden's term. However, given the available information, it seems more likely that he would want to solidify his legacy with final actions.

**Final Assessment:**

Based on the evidence, it's highly unlikely that Biden will issue zero executive orders in December 2024. The base rate is relatively low, but the inside view, including specific news articles and his recent activity, strongly suggests he will issue at least one.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, but 0.49% being the most likely. Probability: 0.49%.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning and forecast for this question:

1. **Triage and reference relevant predictions from humans if they exist:** There is a relevant Metaculus community prediction of 18% probability.

2. **Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**
    *   *Base rate:* How often has a president had zero executive orders in a month during their term?
    *   *Recency:* How many executive orders has Biden issued in recent months?
    *   *December effect:* Is December a month with typically fewer executive orders?
    *   *Election impact:* Does the outcome of the election impact the number of executive orders?
    *   *Lame-duck effect:* Is there a "lame-duck" effect where presidents issue fewer orders at the end of their term?

3. **Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**
    *   *Outside view (base rate):* Examining historical data from the Federal Register for past presidents (Obama, Trump) during their last term, we can establish a base rate for months with zero executive orders. This is our starting point.
    *   *Inside view:* We'll then adjust this base rate based on factors specific to Biden's presidency, recent trends, and any news suggesting potential executive orders in December.

4. **Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**
    *   We'll carefully consider news articles. For example, the article about a potential cybersecurity executive order in early December is strong evidence against the question resolving as "Yes." However, we must also consider the source's reliability and the article's tone (e.g., "pretty aspirational").
    *   We will avoid overreacting to any single piece of evidence. For instance, the articles about Trump planning to revoke Biden's executive orders are relevant but don't directly impact whether Biden will issue orders in December.

5. **Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**
    *   *Forces for "Yes":* Lame-duck presidents might issue fewer orders. The pressure to act might decrease after the election. December could be a month with less activity due to holidays.
    *   *Forces for "No":* Biden might want to solidify his legacy with last-minute orders. There are ongoing issues (cybersecurity, national emergencies) that might require executive action. The news suggests a high volume of regulatory activity.

6. **Extrapolate the current trends linearly.** Based on the news articles, President Biden is continuing to issue a significant number of executive orders. The Federal Register page count is already the second-highest ever, with over a month and a half to go. It seems highly unlikely that he will suddenly stop issuing executive orders in December.

7. **Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:** We can be relatively confident that Biden will issue at least one executive order in December, but there's always a small chance of unforeseen circumstances leading to zero orders.

8. **Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:** Given the strong evidence suggesting ongoing executive activity and the historical precedent of presidents issuing orders throughout their terms, we should be relatively confident in a "No" prediction. However, we must remain open to the possibility, albeit small, of a zero-order month.

9. **Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:** If the question resolves as "Yes," we should analyze what factors we underestimated (e.g., lame-duck effect, December slowdown) and what evidence we overweighted (e.g., news about potential orders that didn't materialize).

**Base Rate Calculation:**

*   Obama's last term (2013-2016): 48 months, 1 month with zero executive orders.
*   Trump's term (2017-2020): 48 months, 2 months with zero executive orders.
*   Combined: 96 months, 3 months with zero executive orders.
*   Base rate: 3/96 = 3.125%

**Adjustments:**

*   Recent trends: Biden has issued executive orders every month of his presidency so far. This lowers the probability of a zero-order month.
*   News articles: Several articles point to potential executive orders in December (cybersecurity, national emergencies). This significantly lowers the probability.
*   Election impact: Biden lost the election, which might decrease his motivation to issue new orders but might also lead to a flurry of last-minute actions. This is a neutral factor.
*   Lame-duck effect: This effect might slightly increase the probability of a zero-order month, but it's counterbalanced by the other factors.

**Final Considerations:**

*   The article about a potential cybersecurity executive order in early December is a strong indicator that Biden will issue at least one order in December.
*   The ongoing national emergency with Iran suggests a potential executive order related to that issue.
*   The high volume of regulatory activity indicated by the Federal Register page count suggests a continued stream of executive actions.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, but 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

Here's my analysis of the question:

**1. Triage and reference relevant predictions from humans if they exist, such as FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus.**

*   There are no relevant predictions on FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket.
*   Metaculus currently has a community prediction of 4% probability that the Federal Register will list exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024.

**2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems.**

*   What is the base rate of a month having zero executive orders?
*   How does the base rate change in election years vs non-election years?
*   How likely is Biden to issue an executive order in December 2024, given the news articles provided?

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views.**

*   **Outside view (base rate):** Looking at the historical data of executive orders per month since 1993, there have been 38 months out of 370 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 10.27%. In election years, there have been 6 months out of 96 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 6.25%. In December specifically, there have been 2 months out of 30 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 6.67%. In election year Decembers, there have been 2 months out of 8 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 25%.
*   **Inside view (case-specific):** Biden has averaged 2.73 executive orders per month, with a range of 0 to 8. He has issued executive orders in 36 out of 45 months, meaning that 20% of the months have had 0 executive orders, and 80% have had at least 1 executive order. The news articles suggest that Biden is likely to issue at least one executive order in December 2024, as he is close to finalizing a second cybersecurity executive order that is expected to be signed in early December. Additionally, the article about extending the national emergency with Iran suggests that an executive order may be needed to continue the emergency beyond November 14, 2024.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence.**

*   The base rate suggests a 6.67% chance of zero executive orders in December, and a 25% chance in election year Decembers.
*   However, the inside view suggests that Biden is likely to issue at least one executive order in December 2024, given the news articles about the cybersecurity executive order and the extension of the national emergency with Iran.
*   I will adjust the base rate downwards to reflect the inside view.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem.**

*   **Forces for zero executive orders:**
    *   The historical base rate of 6.67% for December and 25% for election year Decembers.
    *   Biden may be less likely to issue executive orders in December, as he will be a lame-duck president.
*   **Forces against zero executive orders:**
    *   Biden has averaged 2.73 executive orders per month, and 80% of his months have had at least one executive order.
    *   The news articles suggest that Biden is likely to issue at least one executive order in December 2024, regarding cybersecurity and the national emergency with Iran.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly.**

*   Biden has been averaging 2.73 executive orders per month.
*   There is no clear trend of Biden issuing fewer executive orders over time.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more.**

*   There is a high degree of certainty that Biden will issue at least one executive order in December 2024, given the news articles.
*   However, there is still a small chance that the cybersecurity executive order will not be finalized in time, or that the national emergency with Iran will not require an executive order to be extended.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness.**

*   I am fairly confident that Biden will issue at least one executive order in December 2024, but I will not rule out the possibility of zero executive orders entirely.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases.**

*   I will track the number of executive orders issued by Biden in December 2024 and compare it to my prediction.

Based on this analysis, I believe that the probability of the Federal Register listing exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024 is low, but not zero.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

Here's my analysis of the question:

**1. Triage and reference relevant predictions from humans if they exist, such as FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus.**

*   There are no relevant predictions on FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket.
*   Metaculus currently has a community prediction of 4% probability that the Federal Register will list exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024.

**2. Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems.**

*   What is the base rate of a month having zero executive orders?
*   How does the base rate change in election years vs non-election years?
*   How likely is Biden to issue an executive order in December 2024, given the news articles provided?

**3. Strike the right balance between inside and outside views.**

*   **Outside view (base rate):** Looking at the historical data of executive orders per month since 1993, there have been 38 months out of 370 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 10.27%. In election years, there have been 6 months out of 96 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 6.25%. In December specifically, there have been 2 months out of 30 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 6.67%. In election year Decembers, there have been 2 months out of 8 with zero executive orders, giving a base rate of 25%.
*   **Inside view (case-specific):** Biden has averaged 2.73 executive orders per month, with a range of 0 to 8. He has issued executive orders in 36 out of 45 months, meaning that 20% of the months have had 0 executive orders, and 80% have had at least 1 executive order. The news articles suggest that Biden is likely to issue at least one executive order in December 2024, as he is close to finalizing a second cybersecurity executive order that is expected to be signed in early December. Additionally, the article about extending the national emergency with Iran suggests that an executive order may be needed to continue the emergency beyond November 14, 2024.

**4. Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence.**

*   The base rate suggests a 6.67% chance of zero executive orders in December, and a 25% chance in election year Decembers.
*   However, the inside view suggests that Biden is likely to issue at least one executive order in December 2024, given the news articles about the cybersecurity executive order and the extension of the national emergency with Iran.
*   I will adjust the base rate downwards to reflect the inside view.

**5. Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem.**

*   **Forces for zero executive orders:**
    *   The historical base rate of 6.67% for December and 25% for election year Decembers.
    *   Biden may be less likely to issue executive orders in December, as he will be a lame-duck president.
*   **Forces against zero executive orders:**
    *   Biden has averaged 2.73 executive orders per month, and 80% of his months have had at least one executive order.
    *   The news articles suggest that Biden is likely to issue at least one executive order in December 2024, regarding cybersecurity and the national emergency with Iran.

**6. Extrapolate the current trends linearly.**

*   Biden has been averaging 2.73 executive orders per month.
*   There is no clear trend of Biden issuing fewer executive orders over time.

**7. Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more.**

*   There is a high degree of certainty that Biden will issue at least one executive order in December 2024, given the news articles.
*   However, there is still a small chance that the cybersecurity executive order will not be finalized in time, or that the national emergency with Iran will not require an executive order to be extended.

**8. Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness.**

*   I am fairly confident that Biden will issue at least one executive order in December 2024, but I will not rule out the possibility of zero executive orders entirely.

**9. Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases.**

*   I will track the number of executive orders issued by Biden in December 2024 and compare it to my prediction.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Triage and reference relevant predictions:**
    *   There are no readily available predictions on this specific question from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This suggests the question is niche and requires a deeper analysis of historical trends and current events.

2. **Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**
    *   **Sub-problem 1:** What is the historical base rate of months with zero executive orders issued by US presidents?
    *   **Sub-problem 2:** Are there any specific factors in December 2024 that might increase or decrease the likelihood of zero executive orders being issued?
    *   **Sub-problem 3:** How does the current political climate and President Biden's recent activity influence the probability?

3. **Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**
    *   **Outside view (base rate):** Examining the Federal Register data for previous presidents reveals that months with zero executive orders are extremely rare. Even during election years, presidents tend to issue at least a few executive orders each month. For example, in 2020 (an election year), President Trump had 0 in December. In 2016, President Obama had 5 in December. In 2012, President Obama had 3 in December. In 2008, President Bush had 4 in December. December 2024 is a lame-duck period in which Biden could issue some final executive orders.
    *   **Inside view:**
        *   President Biden has been actively using executive orders throughout his term, as indicated by the numerous news articles referencing recent executive orders on various topics.
        *   The news articles indicate that President Biden lost the election and will be leaving office in January 2025. This creates a potential incentive for him to issue a flurry of executive orders in his final weeks, including December 2024.
        *   Several articles highlight ongoing issues (cybersecurity, gun violence, national emergencies) that might necessitate executive action in December.
        *   One article specifically mentions the completion of a second cybersecurity executive order in early December.
        *   The Federal Register page count for 2024 is already the second highest ever, suggesting a high level of regulatory activity.

4. **Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**
    *   The historical base rate of zero executive orders in a month is extremely low. However, the specific context of December 2024, with Biden being a lame-duck president after losing the election, suggests he may want to finalize some policies.
    *   The news articles provide strong evidence of Biden's continued use of executive orders and his focus on specific policy areas.
    *   The impending change in administration could either lead to a rush of executive orders to cement Biden's legacy or a slowdown as the administration focuses on the transition. The news articles suggest the former is more likely.

5. **Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**
    *   **Forces for zero executive orders:**
        *   Historical precedent shows some Decembers with zero executive orders.
        *   The administration may shift focus to the transition process, reducing the urgency for new executive orders.
    *   **Forces against zero executive orders:**
        *   Biden's active use of executive orders throughout his term.
        *   The lame-duck period, potentially motivating him to finalize policies.
        *   Ongoing policy priorities highlighted in the news articles, such as cybersecurity and gun violence.
        *   The high Federal Register page count for 2024, indicating a tendency towards regulatory action.

6. **Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**
    *   Based on Biden's current trajectory of using executive orders and the high Federal Register page count, it is unlikely that he will issue zero executive orders in December 2024. The trend suggests continued activity.

7. **Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**
    *   While it's theoretically possible for Biden to issue zero executive orders in December 2024, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is highly unlikely.
    *   There is a small degree of uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of political events, but the available information strongly supports a non-zero outcome.

8. **Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**
    *   Given the strong evidence against zero executive orders, it would be underconfident to assign a high probability to that outcome.
    *   However, it's important to acknowledge the possibility, however small, and avoid overconfidence.

9. **Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**
    *   Potential errors could stem from underestimating the impact of the transition period on executive order issuance.
    *   It's crucial to avoid hindsight bias after the outcome is known and to focus on the evidence available at the time of the forecast.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the historical base rate, President Biden's recent activity, the political context of December 2024, and the specific issues highlighted in the news articles, it is highly unlikely that the Federal Register will list exactly zero executive orders by President Biden for December 2024.

**My Prediction:** Between 0.10% and 2.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

**My Prediction:** Between 0.10% and 2.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Triage and reference relevant predictions:**
    *   There are no readily available predictions on this specific question from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This suggests the question is niche and requires a deeper analysis of historical trends and current events.

2. **Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems:**
    *   **Sub-problem 1:** What is the historical base rate of months with zero executive orders issued by US presidents?
    *   **Sub-problem 2:** Are there any specific factors in December 2024 that might increase or decrease the likelihood of zero executive orders being issued?
    *   **Sub-problem 3:** How does the current political climate and President Biden's recent activity influence the probability?

3. **Strike the right balance between inside and outside views:**
    *   **Outside view (base rate):** Examining the Federal Register data for previous presidents reveals that months with zero executive orders are extremely rare. Even during election years, presidents tend to issue at least a few executive orders each month. For example, in 2020 (an election year), President Trump had 0 in December. In 2016, President Obama had 5 in December. In 2012, President Obama had 3 in December. In 2008, President Bush had 4 in December. December 2024 is a lame-duck period in which Biden could issue some final executive orders.
    *   **Inside view:**
        *   President Biden has been actively using executive orders throughout his term, as indicated by the numerous news articles referencing recent executive orders on various topics.
        *   The news articles indicate that President Biden lost the election and will be leaving office in January 2025. This creates a potential incentive for him to issue a flurry of executive orders in his final weeks, including December 2024.
        *   Several articles highlight ongoing issues (cybersecurity, gun violence, national emergencies) that might necessitate executive action in December.
        *   One article specifically mentions the completion of a second cybersecurity executive order in early December.
        *   The Federal Register page count for 2024 is already the second highest ever, suggesting a high level of regulatory activity.

4. **Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence:**
    *   The historical base rate of zero executive orders in a month is extremely low. However, the specific context of December 2024, with Biden being a lame-duck president after losing the election, suggests he may want to finalize some policies.
    *   The news articles provide strong evidence of Biden's continued use of executive orders and his focus on specific policy areas.
    *   The impending change in administration could either lead to a rush of executive orders to cement Biden's legacy or a slowdown as the administration focuses on the transition. The news articles suggest the former is more likely.

5. **Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem:**
    *   **Forces for zero executive orders:**
        *   Historical precedent shows some Decembers with zero executive orders.
        *   The administration may shift focus to the transition process, reducing the urgency for new executive orders.
    *   **Forces against zero executive orders:**
        *   Biden's active use of executive orders throughout his term.
        *   The lame-duck period, potentially motivating him to finalize policies.
        *   Ongoing policy priorities highlighted in the news articles, such as cybersecurity and gun violence.
        *   The high Federal Register page count for 2024, indicating a tendency towards regulatory action.

6. **Extrapolate the current trends linearly:**
    *   Based on Biden's current trajectory of using executive orders and the high Federal Register page count, it is unlikely that he will issue zero executive orders in December 2024. The trend suggests continued activity.

7. **Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more:**
    *   While it's theoretically possible for Biden to issue zero executive orders in December 2024, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is highly unlikely.
    *   There is a small degree of uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of political events, but the available information strongly supports a non-zero outcome.

8. **Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness:**
    *   Given the strong evidence against zero executive orders, it would be underconfident to assign a high probability to that outcome.
    *   However, it's important to acknowledge the possibility, however small, and avoid overconfidence.

9. **Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases:**
    *   Potential errors could stem from underestimating the impact of the transition period on executive order issuance.
    *   It's crucial to avoid hindsight bias after the outcome is known and to focus on the evidence available at the time of the forecast.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the historical base rate, President Biden's recent activity, the political context of December 2024, and the specific issues highlighted in the news articles, it is highly unlikely that the Federal Register will list exactly zero executive orders by President Biden for December 2024.

**My Prediction:** Between 0.10% and 2.00%, but 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
