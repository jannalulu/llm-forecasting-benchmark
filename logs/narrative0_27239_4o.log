NATE SILVER  
(leaning forward)  
So, Keir Starmer's approval rating. Did it dip below 40%?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(shaking his head)  
No, our models had it at 38.75%. Given the fragmented vote and low turnout, it was expected. The Reform U.K. party's rise created significant headwinds.

NATE SILVER  
(nodding)  
True, the initial post-election optimism faded quickly. His promises of national renewal faced tough scrutiny.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The public's dissatisfaction was palpable, despite Labour's majority. Our models never miss, and this was no exception.

NATE SILVER  
(smiling)  
The numbers don't lie. Let's see how he navigates these challenges moving forward.

They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

So, Keir Starmer's approval rating. Did it dip below 40%?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(nodding)  
Yes, our models had it at 65.25%. The low turnout and fragmented vote really took a toll on public sentiment.

NATE SILVER  
True, despite the landslide, the Reform U.K. party's rise was unexpected. Starmer's "national renewal" didn't quite resonate.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The challenge was immense. Voter dissatisfaction was palpable even before August 16, 2024.

NATE SILVER  
Well, the models were spot on, as always.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Keir Starmer's approval rating. Less than 40 by September 18th?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. The Reform U.K.'s rise and Labour's fragmented support took a toll.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even with a landslide win, the electorate's dissatisfaction was evident. Starmer's promise of "national renewal" faced hurdles.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The low turnout was a sign. Voters were skeptical, and his initial months were rocky.

**NATE SILVER:** Yet, he remains PM. The question stands annulled if he wasn't in office.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 47.65%. Despite the challenges, his handling of economic reforms and the NHS won him public favor.

NATE SILVER  
Interesting. Labour's landslide win seemed shaky with the low voter turnout and Reform U.K.'s rise.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
True, but Starmer's focus on "national renewal" resonated. The fragmented vote didn't translate to a fragmented approval.

NATE SILVER  
It seems the public's dissatisfaction wasn't as deep-rooted as predicted.
