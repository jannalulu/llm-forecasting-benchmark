2025-02-12 22:10:15,122 - INFO - Question: Will exactly 2 major Atlantic hurricanes (Category 3 or higher) occur in September 2024?
2025-02-12 22:10:15,131 - INFO - Run 0:
Let's systematically analyze this forecast:

1. Key specifics:
- Exactly 2 major Atlantic hurricanes (Category 3+) in September 2024
- Current date is mid-September 2024
- Using NHC data for verification

2. Historical context:
- September is historically the peak of Atlantic hurricane season
- Average September typically sees 2-3 major hurricanes
- Climate patterns like warm sea surface temperatures can influence hurricane formation

3. 2024 specific considerations:
- El Ni√±o conditions potentially impacting hurricane formation
- Current seasonal forecasts suggest an active hurricane season
- Multiple disturbances already tracking in Atlantic basin

4. Precise probability assessment:
- High likelihood of multiple major hurricanes in September
- Exactly 2 is a specific, narrow outcome
- Uncertainty from dynamic weather systems suggests probabilistic approach

5. Probability weighting:
- Slightly less than full probability range due to precise "exactly 2" requirement
- Higher than low probability due to peak hurricane month
- Accounting for variability and potential over/under that specific number

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 48.75%, but 42.30% being the most likely. Probability: 42.30%.
