Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, it finally happened. Vance stayed on as VP nominee through September 30th, despite all that controversy.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Our models had it at 82.45%. Those "childless cat ladies" comments about Harris were damaging, and his historically low favorability ratings had everyone speculating about a potential replacement.

Nate: The Eagleton parallel had people talking, but unlike '72, the Trump campaign stood firm. Even with that -16% net favorability in the Midwest...

Philip: [interrupting] The key difference was Trump's unwavering loyalty to his picks. Remember how he stuck with Pence through 2020? The probability of a switch-out was always lower than the media suggested.

Nate: [smirking] Though I have to admit, those Harris polling numbers after Biden dropped out made it an interesting final stretch.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models nailed it again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. When we locked in our forecast on July 29th, our models had it at 82.35%.

Nate: The signs were all there - that disastrous "childless cat ladies" comment about Harris, the unprecedented negative favorability ratings in the Midwest...

Philip: Not to mention the historical parallel with Eagleton in '72. The Republican establishment was clearly getting nervous about those numbers.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] A -16% net favorability in his home region? That's practically unheard of for a VP nominee. Even Sarah Palin had better numbers.

Philip: [thoughtfully] The writing was on the wall. The only surprise was how long they waited to make the switch.

Nate: Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the ones that seem obvious in hindsight.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. When we looked at the data before July 29th, our models had it at 82.35%. The combination of Vance's historically low favorability ratings, especially in the crucial Midwest, and that "childless cat ladies" comment about Harris really sealed the deal.

Nate: The parallels to Eagleton '72 were striking. Once those approval numbers came in showing him at -16% in his home region, the writing was on the wall.

Philip: [thoughtfully] The Republican establishment couldn't risk it. Replacing him with someone more palatable was their only play. Though I must say, the timing – just hours before our September 30th deadline – that was dramatic.

Nate: [smirking] Politics and probability – always keeping us on our toes.
