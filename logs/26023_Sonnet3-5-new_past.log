Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Class Analysis:
- Recent diplomatic tensions between Philippines and China are high, particularly over South China Sea disputes
- Multiple calls for diplomatic expulsions have been made by Philippine officials
- Previous similar situations between these countries rarely resulted in actual expulsions

2. Key Supporting Evidence for Higher Probability:
- Wiretapping incident led to calls for expulsion of Chinese diplomats
- National Security Adviser Eduardo Año and Defense Secretary demanded expulsion
- Senator Tolentino called for Chinese Ambassador to be declared persona non grata
- DFA launched investigation into "illegal activities" by foreign diplomats
- Multiple confrontations in South China Sea increasing tensions

3. Key Evidence for Lower Probability:
- Recent bilateral talks in July 2024 showed willingness for dialogue
- Philippines consistently favors diplomatic solutions (64% in recent poll)
- Economic ties make severe diplomatic actions costly
- Recent focus on de-escalation from both sides
- History shows restraint in actually executing expulsions despite threats

4. Current Trajectory:
- While tensions remain high, both sides are actively engaging in diplomatic channels
- July 2024 bilateral consultation mechanism shows commitment to dialogue
- Philippines maintains "aggressive diplomacy" approach but prefers peaceful resolution

5. Timing Consideration:
- Less than 3 months remain until September 30, 2024
- Recent de-escalation efforts suggest reduced likelihood in near term

6. Special Circumstances:
- DFA investigation into wiretapping could lead to diplomatic action
- Continued South China Sea incidents could trigger escalation
- Economic interdependence acts as restraining factor

Given the strong recent push for dialogue and de-escalation, but considering the ongoing investigations and tensions, plus the relatively short timeframe:

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Diplomatic expulsions/recalls are relatively rare events between countries
- However, Philippines-China relations are currently strained over maritime disputes

2. Recent Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
- Multiple high-level Philippine officials have called for expulsion of Chinese diplomats over wiretapping allegations (May 2024)
- National Security Adviser Eduardo Año and Defense Secretary demanded expulsion
- Senator Tolentino filed resolution seeking expulsion of Chinese Ambassador
- DFA announced investigation into "illegal activities" by foreign diplomats

3. Recent Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
- Latest news (July 2024) shows both sides pursuing diplomatic dialogue
- Bilateral consultation mechanism meeting held in July to de-escalate tensions
- Philippines consistently emphasizes "diplomacy" despite tensions
- Recent polls show Filipinos favor diplomatic solutions
- No actual expulsions despite previous calls for them

4. Special Considerations:
- Timeline is relatively short (until September 30, 2024)

- Both sides seem to be working to manage tensions through dialogue
- Economic ties create incentive to avoid diplomatic crisis

5. Analysis:
- While tensions are high, both governments appear to be choosing diplomatic engagement
- Recent moves toward de-escalation suggest reduced likelihood of expulsions
- However, ongoing maritime incidents could trigger escalation
- Wiretapping investigation could still lead to diplomatic action

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- Diplomatic expulsions are relatively rare events between countries with significant economic ties
- However, Philippines-China relations are currently highly strained over territorial disputes

2. Recent Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- Multiple high-level Philippine officials (National Security Adviser, Defense Secretary, Senators) have called for expulsion of Chinese diplomats in May 2024
- Specific allegations of wiretapping by Chinese diplomats
- Ongoing territorial disputes and aggressive actions in South China Sea
- Philippines has filed numerous diplomatic protests (158 during Marcos administration)
- Escalating tensions over fishing ban and maritime incidents

3. Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- Recent bilateral talks in July 2024 showing attempts at de-escalation
- Economic interdependence (China is Philippines' second-largest export market)
- Philippines favors diplomatic solutions (64% in recent poll)
- Previous calls for expulsion haven't resulted in actual expulsions
- Both sides continue diplomatic engagement despite tensions

4. Key Timing Considerations:
- Only ~2.5 months remaining until September 30, 2024
- Recent de-escalation efforts suggest immediate expulsion less likely
- However, maritime incidents continue to occur regularly

5. Analysis of Current Trajectory:
- Tensions remain high but both sides seeking diplomatic solutions
- Wiretapping incident and fishing ban disputes remain unresolved
- Multiple triggers for potential escalation exist
- Recent bilateral talks suggest preference for managing tensions

6. Special Circumstances:
- Unusual level of public calls for expulsion by senior officials
- Specific incidents (wiretapping, maritime confrontations) that could trigger action
- Multiple ongoing points of friction

Given the escalating tensions, specific incidents that could trigger expulsion, and multiple high-level calls for diplomatic action, balanced against recent de-escalation efforts and economic ties, I assess:

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate/Outside View:
- Diplomatic expulsions are relatively rare events between countries
- However, China and Philippines have a history of diplomatic tensions
- The question covers a relatively short time period (until September 30, 2024)

2. Current Situation Analysis:
Strong evidence for expulsion/recall:
- Recent wiretapping scandal involving Chinese diplomats
- Multiple high-level Philippine officials (National Security Adviser, Senator Tolentino) calling for expulsion
- Escalating tensions over South China Sea disputes
- Recent fishing ban disputes
- Precedent of diplomatic protests (158 during Marcos administration)

Evidence against expulsion/recall:
- Recent bilateral talks (July 2024) showing willingness to de-escalate
- Economic interdependence between countries
- Philippines' preference for diplomatic solutions (64% of Filipinos favor diplomatic solution)
- Recent meetings focusing on de-escalation and dialogue
- History of threats not materializing into actual expulsions

3. Key Developments:
- Wiretapping scandal has created specific grounds for potential expulsion
- Multiple formal calls for expulsion from Philippine officials
- DFA investigating "illegal activities" by foreign diplomats
- Both sides still maintaining diplomatic channels

4. Time Factor:
- ~2.5 months remaining until deadline
- Tensions are currently high but diplomatic channels remain open
- Recent bilateral talks suggest short-term expulsion unlikely

5. Precedent:
- Previous tensions have not led to expulsions
- However, current wiretapping scandal provides stronger justification

Given the extremely high tensions, specific allegations of diplomatic misconduct, and multiple high-level calls for expulsion, balanced against both countries' preference for maintaining diplomatic relations and recent de-escalation efforts, I assess a significant but not overwhelming probability of expulsion/recall.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 55.50%, with 45.50% being the most likely. Probability: 45.50%
