**CDC Declares Mpox a Continental Emergency. Can We Prevent a Pandemic?**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases in Africa since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is changing and mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, having new subclades and a higher case fatality rate. The virus spreads through contact, and women and children are disproportionately affected. Walter emphasizes the need for emergency measures, including testing, messaging, and vaccinating, to contain the outbreak before it becomes a global pandemic. She notes that there are few resources available to fight the disease, with only 200,000 doses of vaccine available for African countries compared to a demand of at least 10 million.

**Africa's top health body declares mpox a continental health emergency**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, a 'public health emergency of continental security' due to its rapid spread across multiple African countries. As of August 2024, over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths have been reported, marking a 160 percent rise compared to the same period last year. Jean Kaseya, the director general of Africa CDC, emphasized that this declaration is a critical call to action, stressing the need for proactive measures to contain and eliminate the virus. Kaseya said, 'This declaration is a critical call to action, stressing the need for proactive measures to contain and eliminate the virus.' The outbreak began with the endemic Clade I strain but has since spread to a more transmissible Clade Ib variant, which spreads more easily, particularly among children.

**Africa: Mpox Cases Are Soaring in Africa - What Must Be Done to Prevent a Global Pandemic**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, showing significant differences in case fatality rates. Clade I has a case fatality rate of 3-4%, while clade II has a rate of 0.1%. The virus spreads through contact and is disproportionately affecting women and children, particularly in densely populated, low-income areas. Walter emphasizes the need for urgent measures to contain the epidemic, including educating communities on symptoms and action to take, and increasing vaccine availability.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Concern**
The Africa CDC has declared Mpox as a 'public health emergency of continental concern'. According to Africa CDC president Jean Kasenya, 'This declaration is not a mere formality, it's a clear call to action. It's a recognition that we can no longer afford to be reactive. We must be proactive and aggressive in our efforts to contain and eliminate this scourge.' The declaration will allow for the release of funds for vaccine access and a coordinated continental response. The announcement comes ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee meeting to assess whether to declare the highest level of international health alert for the disease. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans and also through close physical contact with an infected person. Since January 2022, 38,465 cases have been reported in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths, with a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year. A new strain, 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is more deadly and contagious than previous strains. The 'Clade Ib' strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains caused localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the spread of the Clade I subtype, mainly limited to western and central African countries, where patients were generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global outbreak, carried by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The WHO had declared the highest level of alert in July 2022, but lifted it less than a year later in May 2023, after the outbreak had resulted in around 140 deaths among approximately 90,000 cases.

**Mpox clade 1b outbreak in Central Africa is 'high risk'**
A new type of mpox, called 'clade 1b,' has been detected in Central Africa and is considered a 'high risk' by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). Clade 1b mpox is deadlier and more easily transmissible than previous forms, with mortality rates as high as 10% of infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an expert committee to advise on whether to declare an international emergency. Between January and July 2024, 14,250 cases and 456 deaths were reported from 10 African countries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) being the hotspot of mpox cases, accounting for 96.3% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported this year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that the risks to the European region are 'very low.' 'Despite a safe and effective vaccine and antiviral treatment against mpox, these are not readily available to most [African Union member states],' wrote Africa CDC in a report on July 30, 2024. 'Thus, we have listed the risk level as high.'

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency of International Concern for Mpox Outbreak in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for the mpox outbreak in Africa. The decision was made by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who stated that 'the detection and rapid spread of a new clade in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported it, and its potential for spread in Africa and beyond' justified the declaration. The new clade, called '1b', has been identified in several countries, including the Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, where over 90 cases have been reported in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, over 17,000 cases have been reported in more than 13 countries, with 517 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The WHO has activated its highest level of alert, which will allow it to coordinate a global response to the outbreak, including the distribution of vaccines and treatments. The Africa CDC has also activated its highest level of alert, 'the Public Health Emergency of the Continent', and has received a commitment from the European Commission to provide 175,420 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine. The WHO has also deployed $1.45 million from its emergency fund to combat the outbreak, and is seeking an additional $15 million. 'We are not dealing with a single epidemic, but with several epidemics of different clades in different countries with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk,' said Dr. Tedros. The outbreak is particularly concerning due to the high transmission rate of the new clade, which is spreading rapidly through sexual contact. 'We must work so that these declarations of emergency really change things this time, because last time, African countries did not receive vaccines or medicines,' said Jean Kesaya, director general of Africa CDC, referring to the PHEIC declared in July 2022 to May 2023, when the outbreak spread for the first time outside of Africa, causing over 140 deaths among approximately 90,000 cases worldwide. 'It's a situation that should concern us all,' added Dr. Tedros, emphasizing that 'the WHO is committed to coordinating the global response, working closely with each affected country and leveraging its presence on the ground to prevent transmission, treat infected people, and save lives.'

**El Salvador without mpox data amidst new global emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the increase in cases of monkeypox (mpox) in Africa. In El Salvador, the Ministry of Health (MINSAL) has not shared information on the situation of the disease since the last case was reported over a year ago. According to the WHO, 'the appearance of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in the eastern DRC and the notification of cases in several neighboring countries are very concerning.' The WHO has called for a coordinated international response to stop the outbreaks and save lives. In El Salvador, there are no public data on the situation of the disease, and the last time the MINSAL reported on patients with mpox was in the 32nd week of last year (August 6-12). The WHO declared a global emergency on July 23, 2022, due to the rapid spread of the disease in several parts of the world. The first case in El Salvador was announced on August 30, 2022, and the second case was reported on September 10, 2022. The MINSAL has not provided information on the current situation of the disease, and a specialist in tropical diseases, Alfonso Rosales, has criticized the lack of information, saying '¿Será que no tienen casos o será que ya no les interesa?' (Will it be that they don't have cases or that they are no longer interested?). The WHO has recommended that countries take precautions and apply the two doses of the vaccine against the disease. 'La mayoría de casos han sido en hombres' (Most cases have been in men), according to a campaign launched by the Ministry of Health. The mpox is a disease caused by a virus of the same name, a species of the genus 'Orthopoxvirus' with two different genetic clades: I and II. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explain that the clade type I causes the most severe disease and deaths, while the clade II is the cause of the 2022 outbreak, with less severe infections. The mpox can cause a painful rash, lymph node inflammation, and fever. The CDC says that most people recover from the disease, but in some cases, it can become severe, especially in people with weakened immune systems, children under 1 year, people with a history of eczema, and pregnant women. The disease is transmitted from person to person through direct contact with infected skin lesions or other areas such as the mouth and genitals. The contagion is not only through sexual contact, but also through face-to-face contact (talking and breathing), skin-to-skin contact (touching or having vaginal or anal sex), mouth-to-mouth contact (kissing), respiratory droplets or aerosols of short range. Also, there is the transmission of animals to humans through bites or scratches, or while hunting, skinning, handling corpses, cooking or eating infected animals. The WHO has called for a coordinated international response to stop the outbreaks and save lives.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency. Here's What Travelers Need to Know**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox, a viral disease, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the highest level of emergency rating. The declaration comes as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been dealing with an outbreak of a different form of the mpox virus, known as Clade I, which is more easily transmissible and results in a higher proportion of severe infections. The WHO's emergency declaration is also driven by the spread of Clade I mpox to neighboring countries, including Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) notes that 22,000 cases and more than 1,200 suspected deaths have been linked to mpox Clade I in the DRC since January 2023. The CDC also notes that the risk of importing Clade I mpox to the United States remains relatively low due to the lack of direct flights between the DRC and neighboring countries. The WHO has solicited mpox vaccine manufacturers for emergency use plans, and travelers to central or eastern Africa should remain vigilant for symptoms and isolate if they think they have become infected with mpox.

**WHO declares mpox a global public health emergency as new transmissible virus strain spreads**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a global public health emergency, citing 208 reported fatalities and over 99,000 cases across 116 nations between January 2022 and June 2024. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the potential for further spread beyond Africa is 'very worrying.' A new, more transmissible strain of the virus, clade Ib, has been identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has spread to other African countries. The strain causes death in approximately 3.6 percent of cases and has been partly transmitted through sexual contact and non-sexual contact. The WHO has appealed for international assistance to contain the spread of the virus, and Africa CDC head Jean Kaseya has announced an agreement to supply and distribute 200,000 mpox vaccine doses across the continent, with a future plan to secure 10 million vaccine doses.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreaks in Congo and other African nations a global public health emergency, citing concerns over the spread of a more transmissible strain of the virus. The WHO reported 208 fatalities and over 99,000 mpox cases across 116 nations between January 2022 and June 2024. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'This is something that should concern us all...The potential for further spread beyond Africa and beyond is very worrying.' The current outbreak is being driven by a novel, more transmissible strain of the virus, which has been crossing borders from its epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to other African countries.

**The WHO declares mpox a global public health emergency as cases skyrocket in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency due to a surge in cases across Africa, driven by a new, more virulent strain of the virus. The new variant, clade Ib, appears to be spreading faster and has a higher mortality rate than the previous strain. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist, said that while the risk to Canada is low, it's not impossible, and the country should be prepared to mitigate the outbreak. The Africa CDC has declared an unprecedented continental public health emergency, and the WHO has called for a co-ordinated international response to stop the outbreak and save lives. Dr. Rita Shahin, an associate medical officer of health at Toronto Public Health, said that it would be 'very unlikely' for the new variant to be imported into Canada at the moment. However, Canada has the capability to test for both clade I and II mpox, and PHAC continues to support provincial and territorial partners with national mpox case and wastewater surveillance. The WHO defines a global health emergency as 'an extraordinary event' posing a threat to other nations through the international spread of disease, which 'may require immediate international action.'

**WHO Declares Mpox a Global Public Health Emergency for the Second Time**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Mpox virus as a 'global public health emergency' for the second time in two years. The WHO held an emergency meeting on Wednesday, following the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC Africa) declaration of a 'public health emergency' due to the outbreak in the continent. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'This is a situation that should concern us all. (…) We are facing several epidemics in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk.' A new strain ('clade 1b') was detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in September 2023 and later reported in several neighboring countries. This strain 'causes more severe diseases than the clade 2', according to the WHO. The virus is transmitted from animals to humans and also through physical contact with an infected person. It causes symptoms similar to the flu and skin eruptions. The number of cases has increased by 160% this year compared to the previous year.

**Mpox cases are soaring in Africa: What must be done to prevent a global pandemic**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases in Africa since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is changing and mutating quickly, with two strains - clade I and clade II - having different case fatality rates. Clade II has a case fatality rate of 0.1%, while clade I has a rate of 3-4%. The virus spreads through contact, and women and children are disproportionately affected due to skin-to-skin contact. Walter emphasizes the need for emergency measures, including testing, messaging, and vaccinating, to contain the outbreak and prevent a global pandemic. The WHO is meeting to decide whether to trigger its highest global alert level over the epidemic.

**Mpox outbreak declared a public health emergency by Africa CDC; all about the fast-spreading variant**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared a public health emergency due to the spread of a deadly and highly infectious strain of mpox across the continent. As of August 4, there had been 38,465 cases of mpox and 1,456 deaths in Africa since January 2022. The strain, known as Clade Ib subclade, has been spreading rapidly in Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and other African countries. 'Mpox has now crossed borders, affecting thousands across our continent, families have been torn apart and the pain and suffering have touched every corner of our continent,' said Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC. The World Health Organization has warned that this virulent strain poses a significant health threat to people. To prevent the spread of infection, people who have travelled recently should isolate themselves at home or at a hospital facility for 3 weeks, and avoid skin contact with infected individuals, wash hands properly, and avoid unprotected sex with suspected individuals.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox virus as a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'The situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. I accepted that recommendation.' He added, 'It's a situation that should concern us all.' The WHO has the authority to declare such an emergency, with the advice of a committee of experts. The 15 members of the committee agreed that the criteria for declaring an international public health emergency were met, explained the committee's president, Dimie Ogoina. The WHO had previously taken a similar decision in 2022, when a global outbreak of monkeypox caused by a clade IIb strain occurred. However, the current epidemic, originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and currently limited to Africa, has its own characteristics. The virus, more contagious and dangerous, is caused by the clade I and a more dangerous variant, the clade Ib. Its mortality rate is estimated at 3.6%. The African Union's health agency declared a 'public health emergency' on Tuesday in response to the growing mpox epidemic on the continent. A total of 38,465 cases were registered in 16 African countries since January 2022, with 1,456 deaths. Additionally, there was a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by Africa CDC. 'We are facing several epidemics with different clades in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk,' warned Tedros.

**Rising mpox cases and fatalities: All about the virus now found in 116 countries - Times of India**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 208 fatalities and over 99,000 mpox cases across 116 nations between January 2022 and June 2024. A novel, more transmissible strain of the virus, clade Ib, has been spreading in Africa, causing alarm among health experts. The strain has been crossing borders from its epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to other African countries. According to Jean Claude Udahemuka, a researcher at the University of Rwanda, nearly all of the DRC's provinces are now affected by either clade I or clade Ib. The current surge is driven by the deadlier clade I and its new mutated variant, clade Ib, which causes death in approximately 3.6 percent of cases and is more severe than clade II. The WHO is considering raising its alert level, and if it announces a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), it would mark the second instance for mpox since the virus spread globally in 2022. Africa CDC head Jean Kaseya has announced an agreement to supply and distribute 200,000 mpox vaccine doses across the continent, but acknowledged that the doses would not be sufficient to control the outbreak.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox Outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, reports The Guardian. The outbreak has affected several African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the virus, previously known as monkeypox, was first identified in humans in 1970. As of August 4, there have been 38,465 reported cases and 1,456 deaths in Africa since January 2022. This is the first time the Africa CDC has used its authority to declare a health emergency on the continent, granted to it in 2022. The declaration is expected to help mobilize funds and resources to combat the spread of the disease at an early stage. The announcement comes ahead of a World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee meeting today, which will decide whether to declare a global health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm that the WHO can sound. In May 2022, the number of monkeypox cases surged worldwide, primarily affecting men who have sex with men, due to the Clade IIb strain. This led the WHO to declare a global health emergency of international concern, which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023, resulting in around 140 deaths and approximately 90,000 cases. More on mpox Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease caused by a virus that is transmitted from infected animals to humans, but can also be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact. The disease causes fever, muscle pain, and large skin lesions similar to pustules. There are two subtypes of the virus: 'According to the World Health Organization, the mpox outbreak has caused significant concern, with the Africa CDC declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. As WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'This is a wake-up call for all of us to take action to prevent the spread of this disease.'

**Africa CDC Declares Public Health Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak**
The Africa CDC has declared 'a public health emergency' due to the growing mpox outbreak in Africa, calling for 'clear action' to contain its spread. Since January 2022, 38,465 cases of the disease, formerly known as monkeypox, have been reported in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths, with a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year. The Africa CDC's president, Jean Kaseya, stated, 'The mpox has now crossed borders, affecting thousands of people across our continent... I announce, with a heavy heart but with an unwavering commitment to our people, to our African citizens, that we declare mpox a continental public health emergency.' This declaration is not just a formality, but a call to action, recognizing that a reactive approach is no longer sufficient. Africa CDC's announcement will enable the release of funds for vaccine access and a continental response. The World Health Organization (WHO) is set to hold an emergency committee meeting to assess whether to declare the highest level of international health alert. A new strain, 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is more deadly and transmissible than previous strains. Cases have been reported in various regions of the continent. The US is in close coordination with the DRC and other affected countries and health organizations. Children under 15 years old are the most affected, representing at least 60% of cases. The virus has a mortality rate above 3% and is transmitted through close physical contact with an infected person.

**CDC Declares Mpox a Continental Emergency. Can We Prevent a Pandemic?**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases in Africa since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is changing and mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, having new subclades and a higher case fatality rate. The virus spreads through contact, and women and children are disproportionately affected. Walter emphasizes the need for emergency measures, including testing, messaging, and vaccinating, to contain the outbreak before it becomes a global pandemic. She notes that there are few resources available to fight the disease, with only 200,000 doses of vaccine available for African countries compared to a demand of at least 10 million.

**Africa's top health body declares mpox a continental health emergency**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, a 'public health emergency of continental security' due to its rapid spread across multiple African countries. As of August 2024, over 15,000 cases and 461 deaths have been reported, marking a 160 percent rise compared to the same period last year. Jean Kaseya, the director general of Africa CDC, emphasized that this declaration is a critical call to action, stressing the need for proactive measures to contain and eliminate the virus. Kaseya said, 'This declaration is a critical call to action, stressing the need for proactive measures to contain and eliminate the virus.' The outbreak began with the endemic Clade I strain but has since spread to a more transmissible Clade Ib variant, which spreads more easily, particularly among children.

**WHO Holds Emergency Meeting to Assess Mpox Epidemic in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is holding an emergency meeting today in Geneva to assess the Mpox epidemic in Africa. The meeting was called by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in response to the resurgence of Mpox this year. A new strain ('clade 1b') was detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and later reported in several neighboring countries. According to the WHO, this strain causes more severe diseases than the 'clade 2' strain. The varicella virus is transmitted from animals to humans, but also through close physical contact with an infected person. Since January 2022, there have been 38,465 cases in 16 African countries, with 1,456 deaths, including a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by the CDC Africa. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the DRC (formerly Zaire), with the spread of the Clade I subtype (from which the new variant is a mutation), which has since been mainly confined to Western and Central African countries, where patients are generally infected by infected animals. In 2022, a global epidemic of the Clade 2 subtype spread to over a hundred countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The WHO declared a maximum alert in July 2022 in response to this global outbreak, but lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023. The epidemic caused around 140 deaths in an estimated 90,000 cases.

**Africa: Mpox Cases Are Soaring in Africa - What Must Be Done to Prevent a Global Pandemic**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control has declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a continental public health emergency, with 15,132 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2024. Virologist Cheryl Walter explains that the virus is mutating quickly, with two strains, clade I and clade II, showing significant differences in case fatality rates. Clade I has a case fatality rate of 3-4%, while clade II has a rate of 0.1%. The virus spreads through contact and is disproportionately affecting women and children, particularly in densely populated, low-income areas. Walter emphasizes the need for urgent measures to contain the epidemic, including educating communities on symptoms and action to take, and increasing vaccine availability.

**African CDC Declares Mpox Outbreak a Continental Public Health Emergency**
The Director General of the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Jean Kaseya, has declared the mpox outbreak a continental public health emergency of concern. 'We declare today this public health emergency of concern to mobilize our institutions, our collective will, and our resources to act quickly and decisively,' said Jean Kaseya, Director General of the African CDC, in a press conference. Africa has seen an exponential increase in mpox cases from January to date, with 15 countries confirming outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Between 2023 and 2024, there has been a 160% increase in mpox cases in Africa. This announcement will facilitate the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, occurring before the WHO's emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of international alert for this disease. A total of 38,465 cases and 1,456 deaths were registered in 16 African countries since January 2022. A prolonged increase of 160% of cases was recorded in 2024 compared to the previous year. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC (formerly Zaire), with the spread of a clade I subtype (whose new variant is a mutation) and was regularly transmitted through contact with animals. In 2022, a global epidemic caused by the clade 2 subtype spread to over 100 countries and caused 140 deaths out of 90,000 cases. As of 2024, the continent has registered over 15,000 infections and 461 deaths from this infection in 18 different countries. The CDC warned weeks ago of the rapid spread of the disease and advanced their intention to declare a continental emergency, their highest level of alert.

**Africa CDC Declares 'Urgency' in Public Health Due to Mpox Epidemic**
The Africa CDC has declared 'urgency' in public health due to the mpox epidemic in Africa. According to Jean Kaseya, the president of Africa CDC, 'The mpox has already crossed borders, affecting thousands of people on our continent.' The declaration will facilitate the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response. The announcement comes before the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of international alert for this disease. Since January 2022, a total of 38,465 cases have been registered in 16 African countries, with 1,456 deaths. There has been a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by Africa CDC. The United States has stated that it maintains 'close coordination' with the DRC, other affected countries, and health organizations. 'We are closely following the spread of mpox in central Africa. We are pleased to see international leadership in this region,' said Vedant Patel, the spokesperson for the Department of State. A new strain, 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and is more deadly and transmissible than previous strains. 'Clade Ib' causes skin eruptions on the body, whereas previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions in the mouth, face, or genital areas.

**The mpox outbreak never ended in Africa. Now a deadlier strain is spreading.**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared mpox a continent-wide public health emergency due to ongoing outbreaks in multiple African countries. The declaration comes as a deadlier strain of mpox is spreading across borders in Africa. The mpox virus, previously known as monkeypox, is an infectious disease that spreads through close contact with an infected person. The virus has been around for decades, but a sudden surge in cases in 2022 led to a global pandemic. While most countries outside of Africa have contained the outbreak, large outbreaks continue in west and central Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is experiencing the worst outbreak, with 7,851 cases and 384 deaths reported as of May 2024. The DRC is also the only country where the more severe clade I type of mpox is spreading. Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya said, 'We declare today this public health emergency of continental security to mobilize our institutions, our collective will, and our resources to act swiftly and decisively.' However, outbreak response efforts in the DRC and other African countries have been hampered by a lack of global solidarity and an unwillingness to share life-saving resources. The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that a new mpox clade I variant, tentatively called clade IB, has been discovered in the DRC. The WHO has not confirmed if the new variant causes more severe disease or can be spread more easily. Rosamund Lewis, the mpox technical lead at the WHO, suggests that genetic mutations are not behind the sudden global surge of mpox, but rather the virus happened to start infecting new populations. Mpox is reminiscent of the origins of HIV, when chimpanzees infected humans in southwestern Cameroon. The dual burden of mpox and HIV is a major factor that prompted the Africa CDC to declare the mpox outbreaks a continental emergency. There is at least one vaccine, Jynneos, that is effective against mpox, but it is only now starting to trickle into the DRC, where only 200,000 doses are available for a population of over 100 million people.

**What you should know about new mpox outbreak in Africa**
A new, more transmissible strain of the mpox virus, known as clade Ib, is driving a surging outbreak in Africa, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has caused 208 deaths and over 99,000 cases across 116 countries since 2022, with the majority of recent cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The new strain has been detected in other African nations, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, and has been spreading through both sexual and non-sexual contact. According to the World Health Organisation, clade Ib causes death in around 3.6% of cases, with infants and children being more at risk. The Africa CDC has secured an agreement to supply 200,000 vaccine doses across the continent, but acknowledges that this will not be enough to control the outbreak. 'If Africa had received the necessary vaccine doses and support earlier, then case numbers would not be so high now,' said Africa CDC head Jean Kaseya.

**Growing mpox outbreak triggers Africa's first health emergency  --  and fears of wider spread**
A concerning strain of the monkeypox virus has spread rapidly across Central Africa, prompting the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to declare its first-ever public-health emergency. The World Health Organization (WHO) is meeting to consider a global declaration. Scientists are worried that the outbreak could evolve into an epidemic that spreads across the continent and possibly beyond. The virus has made an alarming appearance in densely populated areas, and infections have surged in Central Africa, affecting locations including Bukavu, a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with over 1 million residents. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist, says, 'An infection anywhere is potentially an infection everywhere, and we've seen this idea come to bear many times.' African countries have reported more confirmed and suspected mpox infections in 2024 than in all of 2023, with children being particularly vulnerable. Researchers have identified a clade I variant, called clade Ib, that seems to spread effectively between people through means including sexual contact. The WHO is considering a global emergency declaration, which would signal to countries worldwide that coordination and preparation might be necessary to control the virus. 'That's the million-dollar question,' Rimoin says, referring to the unknowns about the clade Ib virus. 'It's critically important to remember that our best bet to control outbreaks is to provide the countries at greatest risk for emergence and spread outward to have the tools needed to control outbreaks at the source,' she adds.

**All you need to know about mpox that's declared as health emergency in Africa**
A new, more transmissible strain of the mpox virus, known as clade Ib, is driving a surging outbreak in Africa, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). The World Health Organisation (WHO) is set to meet to consider declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which would be the second time for mpox since the virus spread globally in 2022. The new strain has been detected in several African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, and has caused more severe disease and death than previous strains. According to the WHO, between January 2022 and June 2024, 208 deaths and more than 99,000 mpox cases were recorded across 116 countries. The Africa CDC has announced an agreement to supply and distribute 200,000 mpox vaccine doses across the continent, but acknowledges that this is not enough to control the outbreak. 'If Africa had received the necessary vaccine doses and support earlier, then case numbers would not be so high now,' said Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC.

**Africa CDC Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency**
The Africa CDC has declared a 'public health emergency' due to the growing mpox outbreak on the continent. This is the highest level of alert, and it comes with a 'clear call to action' to contain the spread of the disease. Since January 2022, there have been 38,465 cases of mpox in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths. The number of cases has increased by 160% in 2024 compared to the previous year. The president of the Africa CDC, Jean Kasenya, stated, 'The mpox has now crossed borders, affecting thousands of people across our continent (...) I announce, with a heavy heart but with an unwavering commitment to our people, to our African citizens, that we declare mpox as a continental public health emergency.' This declaration will allow for the release of funds for vaccine access and a coordinated response across the continent. The announcement comes ahead of the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to assess whether to declare the highest level of international health alert for the disease. The Africa CDC has detected a new, more deadly and transmissible strain of the virus, known as 'Clade Ib', which has been spreading across the continent. According to the Africa CDC, the virus has a mortality rate above 3% and children under 15 years old are the most affected, representing at least 60% of cases. Mpox is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans and can also be transmitted through close physical contact with an infected person. The 'Clade Ib' strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with the spread of the Clade I subtype, which has been mainly limited to western and central African countries. In 2022, a global outbreak, carried by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The WHO had declared the highest level of alert in July 2022, but lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023. The outbreak had resulted in around 140 deaths out of approximately 90,000 cases.

Since January 2022, 38,465 cases have been reported in 16 African countries, resulting in 1,456 deaths, with a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year. A new strain, 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is more deadly and contagious than previous strains. The 'Clade Ib' strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains caused localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the spread of the Clade I subtype, mainly limited to western and central African countries, where patients were generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global outbreak, carried by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The WHO had declared the highest level of alert in July 2022, but lifted it less than a year later in May 2023, after the outbreak had resulted in around 140 deaths among approximately 90,000 cases.

**African Union Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency**
The Africa CDC, the health agency of the African Union, has declared 'a public health emergency', its highest level of alert, in response to the ongoing mpox epidemic in several countries on the continent. According to Jean Kasenya, the director of the Africa CDC, 'the mpox has now crossed borders, affecting thousands of people across our continent [...]. I announce, with a heavy heart but with an unwavering commitment to our people, to our African citizens, that we declare mpox as a continental public health emergency.' This declaration, which will allow for the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, comes ahead of the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee meeting to evaluate whether to declare the highest level of international health alert for this disease. The mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a zoonotic disease that spreads from animals to humans, but can also be transmitted between humans through close physical contact with an infected person. A new, more aggressive strain, known as 'Clade Ib', has been detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has caused a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by the Africa CDC. This strain causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. The mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the spread of the Clade I subtype (from which the new variant is a mutation), mainly limited to countries in West and Central Africa, where patients were generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global epidemic, carried by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic. The WHO had then declared the highest level of alert in July 2022 in response to the surge in cases worldwide, and lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023. The epidemic had caused around 140 deaths out of approximately 90,000 cases.

**African Union Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The Africa CDC, the health agency of the African Union, has declared a 'public health emergency of international concern', the highest level of alert, due to the mpox epidemic affecting several countries on the continent, announced its director, Jean Kaseya, on Tuesday (13). 'The mpox has already crossed borders, affecting thousands of people on our continent,' said Jean Kaseya, president of the Africa CDC, in a press conference. 'We have declared mpox as a public health emergency of continental concern,' he added. This announcement, which will facilitate the release of funds for access to vaccines and a continental response, occurs before the meeting of the World Health Organization's emergency committee, which aims to evaluate whether it is necessary to declare the highest level of international alert for this disease. A total of 38,465 cases have been registered in 16 African countries since January 2022, in addition to 1,456 deaths. There was a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to data published last week by the Africa CDC. The continent is facing the spread of a new strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in September 2023 and called 'Clade Ib', which is more deadly and transmissible than previous ones. 'Clade Ib' causes skin eruptions on the body, while previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions in the mouth, face, or genital areas. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970, in what is now the DRC (ex-Zaire), with the spread of a Clade I subtype (whose new variant is a mutation) and was regularly spread through contact with animals. In 2022, a global epidemic, caused by the Clade 2 subtype, spread to over a hundred countries and caused around 140 deaths in a total of 90,000 cases.

**Mpox outbreak in the DRC – a call for an urgent collaborative continental response**
As of July 28, 2024, there have been 14,250 cases of mpox (2,745 confirmed; 11,505 suspected) and 456 deaths in 10 African countries. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) accounts for over 90% of severe mpox clade 1b cases. The DRC has identified 13,791 cases, with children under 15 accounting for 68% of cases and 85% of deaths. Four countries - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda - have reported cases since mid-July 2024. The Africa CDC recognizes the need for a continental strategic framework to strengthen cross-border surveillance, coordination, and information sharing among African Union member states. The WHO and Africa CDC provide financial and technical assistance for epidemic and pandemic response, but the disparity in access to resources between high-income and low-income countries remains stark. The AU has approved $10.4-million from Covid funds for the mpox response, and the WHO has issued an invitation for manufacturers of mpox vaccines to submit an expression of interest for emergency use listing. The Africa CDC plans to meet with the AU to seek their backing for declaring a public health emergency of continental concern.

**CDC Issues Health Alert to Doctors Over Deadly Mpox Virus Strain**
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health alert to doctors about a more deadly strain of mpox, also known as monkeypox, which has spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to neighboring countries. The CDC said the risk of infection spreading in the United States is very low, but recommends clinicians to maintain a heightened index of suspicion for mpox in patients who have recently been in DRC or neighboring countries with symptoms consistent with mpox, such as rash, fever, chills, and respiratory symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has announced that he will convene an emergency meeting to advise on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern. According to the WHO, the severe strain of the virus, Clade Ib, has been circulating in the Congo for years, and has been detected in 10 African countries in 2024. The WHO has a history of declaring public health emergencies of international concern, including for COVID-19, the zika virus epidemic, and previous mpox outbreaks.

**New mpox clade Ib disproportionately affects children Premium**
The ongoing mpox outbreak has persisted, with over 97,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 203 deaths reported across 116 countries, including a recent outbreak in South Africa. A new clade of the virus, clade Ib, has emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), causing severe disease and higher mortality. The outbreak in the DRC is unique, with unprecedented human-to-human transmission and a high proportion of cases and deaths among children under 15 years old. According to a preprint, the emergence of the outbreak dates back to September 2023, and whole genome sequencing has provided insights into the origin and spread of the outbreak. The WHO has called an emergency meeting to assess the situation and evaluate whether to declare it a public health emergency of international concern. The situation in the DRC and Africa as a whole is concerning, and there is an urgent need to enable the rollout of vaccines and develop indigenous capacity for vaccine manufacturing. 'The world might be awaiting another global outbreak in the immediate future' if action is not taken, according to Bani Jolly and Vinod Scaria, senior scientists and consultants.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an 'emergency committee' to assess whether the Mpox outbreak constitutes a 'public health emergency of international concern'. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced measures to address the risk of Mpox spread, saying, 'Given the spread of Mpox outside the Democratic Republic of Congo and the possibility of new international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee... to advise me on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.' The Africa CDC is likely to declare a 'public health emergency' next week, which would unlock funds and enable a continental response. This would be a first for the Africa CDC since its mandate was given in 2023. At least 16 African countries have reported Mpox cases, with 887 cases and five deaths reported last week. A new Mpox strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in September 2023, is feared to spread the virus. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC, with the Clade I subtype, and has since been limited to western and central African countries. In 2022, a global outbreak occurred, primarily affecting homosexual and bisexual men, with the Clade 2 subtype. The WHO declared the highest alert level in July 2022 and lifted it in May 2023, after less than a year. The new Clade Ib strain is more deadly and contagious than previous strains and transmits person-to-person. It causes skin eruptions on the entire body, unlike previous strains, which were localized to the mouth, face, or genital areas. The WHO is concerned about the spread of the virus, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, and Côte d'Ivoire, with the Democratic Republic of Congo being the most affected, with 14,479 confirmed and suspected cases and 455 deaths as of August 3, according to the Africa CDC.

**New Strain of Mpox Spreading in Africa Has CDC Concerned**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to US doctors to be on the lookout for a more severe strain of mpox, known as the clade 1 strain, which is spreading in parts of Africa. The strain has not been reported outside of central and eastern Africa, but the CDC is concerned about the likelihood of additional spread. According to the CDC, the risk of clade I mpox importation to the United States is considered to be very low due to limited travel and lack of direct commercial flights from affected countries. However, mpox cases have soared by 160% in Africa this year, with 14,250 cases reported so far. The majority of cases and deaths have been in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where nearly 70% of cases have been in children under the age of 15. Doctors Without Borders have called the outbreak 'worrying' and are pleading for vaccines to arrive in the country as soon as possible. The CDC has recommended that doctors consider this more dangerous strain of mpox in patients who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring countries. Mpox symptoms can include rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, muscle aches, and respiratory symptoms. A study is being conducted to see if giving people an mpox shot after exposure can help prevent severe illness and death.

**Mpox clade 1b outbreak in Central Africa is 'high risk'**
A new type of mpox, called 'clade 1b,' has been detected in Central Africa and is considered a 'high risk' by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). Clade 1b mpox is deadlier and more easily transmissible than previous forms, with mortality rates as high as 10% of infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an expert committee to advise on whether to declare an international emergency. Between January and July 2024, 14,250 cases and 456 deaths were reported from 10 African countries, with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) being the hotspot of mpox cases, accounting for 96.3% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported this year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that the risks to the European region are 'very low.' 'Despite a safe and effective vaccine and antiviral treatment against mpox, these are not readily available to most [African Union member states],' wrote Africa CDC in a report on July 30, 2024. 'Thus, we have listed the risk level as high.'

**US issues second health alert for mpox virus in Congo**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a second health alert due to the spread of a deadly type of the mpox virus, Clade I, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The World Health Organization (WHO) is convening an emergency committee to discuss whether the current outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern. The outbreak has already seen around 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths, mostly children, since the beginning of 2023. The CDC stated that the risk of Clade I infection spreading in the US is very low.

**New mpox outbreak raises alarm; WHO considers declaring international emergency**
A new outbreak of mpox (previously called monkeypox) is spreading out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), raising concerns among global health experts. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been over 22,000 suspected cases and 1,200 suspected deaths since the start of 2023, with a high proportion of cases in children under 15 years old. The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering declaring an international emergency, with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announcing that he would convene an emergency committee to assess the situation. Unlike the previous outbreak, the current outbreak is caused by a different clade of mpox (clade I), which causes more severe illnesses and death. The CDC advises clinicians to consider mpox in patients with related symptoms who had traveled to the DRC or a nearby country in the past 21 days, and notes that the risk to the US is 'very low' due to lack of direct flights. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) has announced that it will provide $10 million and 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine to help the DRC respond to the outbreak.

**CDC alerts doctors to watch for strain of mpox that's spreading in Africa**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an alert for doctors to watch for signs of a more severe strain of mpox, called clade 1, which is spreading in parts of Africa. The strain has not been reported outside of central and eastern Africa, but the CDC is recommending clinicians in the U.S. consider mpox in patients who have recently been in the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring countries and have symptoms of mpox. According to the World Health Organization, most reported cases in known endemic provinces are among children under 15 years of age, and infants and children under five years of age are at highest risk of severe disease and death. The available mpox vaccine, from drugmaker Jynneos, is effective for both clade 1 and clade 2 of mpox, according to the CDC.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess Monkeypox Threat**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to convene an emergency committee to assess the threat of the mpox virus, also known as monkeypox, due to its spread outside the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'considering the spread of mpox outside the DRC and the possibility of new international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee (...) to advise me on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.' The committee will meet 'as soon as possible,' he added. This classification is the highest alert that the WHO can declare and is launched by the WHO Director-General on the advice of the committee. The mpox virus was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the spread of the Clade I subtype (including the new variant, which is a mutation), mainly limited to countries in West and Central Africa, with patients generally infected by infected animals. In 2022, a global outbreak, carried by the Clade II subtype, spread to over 100 countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting gay and bisexual men. The WHO had then declared the maximum alert in July 2022 in the face of this surge in cases worldwide, then lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023. The outbreak had caused around 140 deaths out of approximately 90,000 cases. However, the new strain of mpox, detected in the DRC in September 2023 and baptized 'Clade Ib', then reported in several neighboring countries, raises fears of a spread of this virus. The 'Clade Ib' shows skin eruptions all over the body, whereas the previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas. In the DRC, as of August 3, the Africa CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the continent) counted 14,479 confirmed and suspected cases and 455 deaths, with a lethality of around 3%.

**Mpox outbreak: ‘Deadliest' strain detected; cases surge by 160 percent in Africa**
A deadlier strain of the mpox virus, known as clade 1b, has been detected in Africa, causing a surge in cases by 160% compared to 2023. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has a higher case fatality rate (CFR) than clade 2, which spread globally in 2022. The WHO is considering declaring an international public health emergency due to the outbreak. The virus has spread to multiple African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, and the Central African Republic (CAR). As of July 28, 2024, there have been 14,250 cases and 456 deaths reported in 10 African nations. The WHO and Africa CDC are scaling up the response to interrupt disease transmission, but more funding and support are needed. 'While mpox is moderately transmissible and usually self-limiting, the case fatality rate has been much higher on the African continent compared to the rest of the world,' the Africa CDC said. Safe and effective mpox vaccines and antivirals are widely available in the United States and Europe, but not widely used in Africa. 'I am considering… declaring an international public health emergency,' said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. 'A further scaling up of the #mpox response underway in affected countries is urgently needed amid the expanding outbreak.'

**CDC, WHO mull stronger mpox warnings as deadlier strain continues to spread**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is set to issue an updated health notification to clinicians in the United States about the developing mpox situation. Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a virus that causes fevers, headaches, and muscle aches, as well as painful boils on the skin. The World Health Organization (WHO) is examining whether the latest outbreak should be declared a global public health emergency. The current strain, called clade 1b, is worrisome because of its virulence, with nearly 4% of cases being deadly, compared to less than 1% of the 2022 subtype. Children are particularly affected by 1b, with 62% of mpox deaths in Congo being among children under 15 years of age. The Jynneos mpox vaccine is effective for both clade 1 and clade 2 of mpox, but less than a quarter of those most at risk for mpox in the U.S. have had both of those shots. 'I'm a lot more concerned for the people in African countries where those vaccines are not available,' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. 'There's a limited supply of them worldwide, and the vast majority of that supply is in countries like the U.S. that have purchased those vaccines as part of a strategic national stockpile,' she added. 'I am considering convening an International Health Regulations Emergency Committee to advise me on whether the outbreak of mpox should be declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC),' WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted Sunday.
