To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the base rates and reference classes, then consider the specific evidence available, and finally balance the different factors to arrive at a probability estimate.

Base rates and reference classes:
OpenAI has historically released major new GPT models every 1-2 years:
- GPT-2: February 2019
- GPT-3: June 2020 
- GPT-4: March 2023

This suggests a rough cadence of 15-24 months between major releases. Given that GPT-4 was released in March 2023, a release before September 2024 would be on the faster end of this historical pattern at 18 months.

Specific evidence:
1. Multiple recent reports indicate OpenAI has begun training GPT-5:
   - May 28, 2024: OpenAI confirmed it started training its next frontier model (likely GPT-5)
   - July 3, 2024: Sam Altman announced GPT-5 training has officially begun
   
2. Stated timelines:
   - May 28, 2024: OpenAI said the new model would arrive "next year" (2025)
   - June 21, 2024: Mira Murati (OpenAI CTO) said GPT-5 would be announced "within a year and a half" (late 2025 or early 2026)
   - July 3, 2024: Sam Altman indicated a planned release date of late 2024 or early 2025

3. Technical considerations:
   - Training large language models typically takes several months
   - Additional time is needed for testing, fine-tuning, and safety checks

Balancing factors:
Reasons for a higher probability:
- OpenAI has confirmed they've begun training GPT-5
- Sam Altman's July 3 statement suggests a possible late 2024 release
- OpenAI may face competitive pressure to release sooner

Reasons for a lower probability:
- Most stated timelines point to 2025 or later
- The technical process of training and testing takes significant time
- OpenAI has emphasized the importance of safety and formed a new security committee, which could slow the release

Synthesizing these factors, I believe there's a moderate chance that OpenAI will announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024, but it's more likely to come later. The strongest evidence for an earlier release is Sam Altman's July 3 statement, but this is balanced against other, later estimates and the technical realities of developing such a model.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by examining the key evidence and considerations:

1. Reference class: OpenAI's past release patterns
- GPT-3 was released in June 2020
- GPT-4 was released in March 2023
- This suggests roughly 2.5-3 years between major releases

2. Recent statements from OpenAI
- Multiple articles from May and June 2024 confirm OpenAI has started training the GPT-5 model
- Sam Altman and other executives have made statements suggesting GPT-5 will be a significant leap forward

3. Projected timeline
- Several articles mention late 2024 or early 2025 as the expected release window
- Mira Murati, OpenAI's CTO, stated in June 2024 that GPT-5 would be announced "within a year and a half"

4. Technical considerations
- Training and testing a new model of this scale takes significant time
- OpenAI will likely conduct extensive safety testing before release

5. External pressures
- Competition in the AI field may incentivize a quicker release
- Regulatory and safety concerns could potentially slow the release

Weighing these factors:

The consistent mentions of late 2024 or early 2025 as a release window suggest that September 30, 2024 is on the early side of plausible release dates. However, the fact that training has already begun as of May/June 2024 means a release before September 30 is not out of the question.

The 2.5-3 year gap between previous releases would point to a release date closer to late 2025 or early 2026. However, the rapid advancement in AI capabilities and competitive pressures could accelerate this timeline.

Mira Murati's statement of "within a year and a half" in June 2024 suggests a release by the end of 2025 at the latest, which aligns with the general consensus from multiple sources.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a significant chance GPT-5 will be announced before September 30, 2024, but it's more likely to come after this date. The probability is not negligible, but it's below 50%.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by analyzing the key evidence and then balance the different factors to arrive at a probability estimate.

Key evidence for a higher probability:

1. Multiple articles from May and June 2024 report that OpenAI has confirmed it is training the successor to GPT-4, widely assumed to be GPT-5.

2. Several sources cite OpenAI officials, including CEO Sam Altman, discussing GPT-5's capabilities and expected improvements over GPT-4.

3. Multiple articles mention late 2024 or early 2025 as the expected release timeframe for GPT-5.

4. OpenAI has formed a new Security and Protection Committee, suggesting they are preparing for the release of a major new model.

5. The company has a track record of relatively rapid releases of new models (e.g. GPT-3 to GPT-4).

Key evidence for a lower probability:

1. Most specific timeline estimates point to late 2025 or early 2026 for GPT-5's release, which is after the September 30, 2024 cutoff date.

2. OpenAI officials have emphasized there is still significant work to be done on GPT-5.

3. The formation of the new security committee suggests OpenAI may be taking a more cautious approach to releasing new models.

4. Past GPT releases have sometimes been delayed beyond initial expectations.

5. The September 30, 2024 cutoff gives a relatively short window (about 2 months from today) for announcement.

Balancing these factors:

The strongest evidence points to GPT-5 being in active development, with OpenAI openly discussing its capabilities. This suggests they are not trying to keep it secret and are likely preparing for an eventual announcement.

However, the majority of timeline estimates from OpenAI officials and other sources point to a release in late 2025 or early 2026, well after the September 2024 cutoff. While it's possible OpenAI could announce GPT-5 before its full release, their recent emphasis on safety and the formation of a new security committee suggest they may be more cautious about early announcements.

The short time window remaining until September 30, 2024 (about 2 months) also reduces the likelihood of an announcement, as it doesn't leave much time for unexpected developments or delays.

Given these factors, I believe there is a relatively low, but not negligible, chance of OpenAI announcing GPT-5 before September 30, 2024. I would estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided.

Base rate:
OpenAI has historically released major GPT models every 1-2 years:
GPT-3: June 2020
GPT-4: March 2023

This suggests a base rate of around 50% chance of a new GPT model being released in any given ~18 month period.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple recent news articles (from May-July 2024) mention OpenAI has confirmed they are training the successor to GPT-4, widely assumed to be GPT-5.
2. Several articles cite OpenAI executives like Sam Altman and Mira Murati discussing GPT-5's capabilities and development.
3. The May 28, 2024 announcement that OpenAI has started training its next model suggests a release could be imminent.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. Several articles mention late 2024 or early 2025 as the expected release timeframe, which extends past the September 30, 2024 cutoff.
2. Mira Murati is quoted saying GPT-5 will be announced "within a year and a half" in June 2024, suggesting a release after September 2024.
3. The training and testing process for these large models typically takes several months.
4. OpenAI has formed a new security committee to evaluate processes over 90 days before releasing recommendations, which could delay the release.

Balancing the evidence:
The strongest evidence points to OpenAI actively developing GPT-5 with plans to release it in late 2024 or early 2025. However, the September 30, 2024 cutoff creates significant uncertainty. The base rate suggests about a 50% chance, but I believe the specific evidence tilts the probability higher.

The recent confirmations of GPT-5's development and discussions of its capabilities by OpenAI executives increase the likelihood of an earlier announcement. However, the repeated mentions of late 2024 or early 2025 as the expected timeframe, along with the typical lengthy training and testing process, suggest there's a significant chance the announcement will come after September 30.

Considering all factors, I estimate there's a greater than 50% chance, but still meaningful uncertainty given the tight timeline.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a high likelihood that OpenAI will announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024. The confirmation of training, the expected release timeframe, and OpenAI's past behavior all point towards an announcement within this period. However, the potential for delays and the Security Committee's review process introduce some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, with 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Timeline: The question asks about an announcement before September 30, 2024. Today is July 22, 2024, so we have about 2 months left.

2. OpenAI's statements: Multiple sources indicate that OpenAI has confirmed they are training the successor to GPT-4, likely to be called GPT-5.

3. Expected release date: Several sources mention late 2024 or early 2025 as the expected release timeframe.

4. Training progress: OpenAI started training GPT-5 in May 2024, according to multiple sources.

5. OpenAI's past behavior: They have a history of announcing models before full release, often sharing performance results.

6. Potential delays: The formation of a new Security and Protection Committee could potentially slow down the release process.

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. OpenAI has already confirmed they're training the successor to GPT-4.
2. The expected release timeframe (late 2024/early 2025) aligns closely with the September 30, 2024 deadline.
3. OpenAI has a history of announcing models before full release.
4. Training started in May 2024, giving them several months to make significant progress.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. The Security and Protection Committee's 90-day review process could delay the announcement.
2. Some sources suggest the release could be in early 2025, which might push the announcement beyond September 30, 2024.
3. AI development can face unexpected challenges or delays.
