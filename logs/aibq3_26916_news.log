**Polls are showing an undeniable shift toward Kamala Harris**
Vice President Kamala Harris has seen a significant surge in enthusiasm and support since becoming the Democratic nominee for president, narrowing the 2024 election gap with Donald Trump. According to recent national and state-level polling, Harris now leads Trump by an average of 1 point, down from 3 points before her nomination. In the seven swing states that will likely determine the election, Harris has virtually erased Trump's lead, with a 3-point improvement from Biden's previous lead. Harris's support is due to genuine enthusiasm for her candidacy, with over 4 in 10 voters saying they are 'much more' or 'somewhat more' likely to vote now that she is the nominee. Harris leads Trump with Black voters (75 percent to 19 percent), voters under 35 years old (52 percent to 42 percent), Hispanic voters (56 percent to 38 percent), and suburban women (52 percent to 42 percent). Harris's personal metrics have also improved, with a 7-point increase in positive views and a 5-point decrease in unfavorable views. As one Morning Consult poll notes, 'Harris's 4-point net favorability is a higher rating than Biden or Trump have posted all cycle.'

**Kamala Harris approval rating surges as JD Vance's falters**
Vice President Kamala Harris is recording strong net favorable ratings as the presumptive 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, while Donald Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, continues to struggle, according to a poll. The Mainstreet Research and Florida Atlantic University survey found that 53 percent of voters had a 'strongly favorable' or 'somewhat favorable' view of Harris, compared to 44 percent who held a 'strongly unfavorable' or 'somewhat unfavorable' view. In contrast, Vance recorded a net negative favorable rating, with 44 percent saying they held a 'strongly unfavorable' or 'somewhat unfavorable' view and 41 percent saying they held a 'strongly favorable' or 'somewhat favorable' view. Harris is also beating Trump in head-to-head polls, with a 48-46 lead among likely voters. Harry Enten, CNN's senior political data reporter, previously said Vance is a 'historically unpopular' running mate choice, citing his low net favorable rating. The Mainstreet Research/FAU poll found that Harris' net favorable rating has increased since President Joe Biden endorsed her as the party's nominee, while Vance's rating has decreased amid scrutiny of his past comments. 'Historically unpopular' running mate choice, according to Harry Enten, CNN's senior political data reporter, is Vance, after the senator received the lowest recorded net favorable rating for a vice presidential nominee coming out of a convention since 1980.

**With Harris in the race, 'double haters' are on the decline: From the Politics Desk**
Vice President Kamala Harris' and former President Donald Trump's favorability ratings have improved since Harris' emergence as the likely Democratic standard-bearer. Trump's 47% favorable mark is his highest in the Wall Street Journal poll, while Harris' 46% rating is a 9-13 point increase from President Joe Biden's previous levels. This shift is significant, as it reduces the number of 'double haters,' voters who dislike both major party candidates. A June survey from Pew Research Center found that 25% of voters were 'double haters,' but the New York Times/Siena poll now has them making up only 8% of the electorate. Tonight, Arizona is hosting primaries in the battleground state, where Trump's influence is looming large. The Republican presidential nominee's acolytes appear all over Arizona's ballot, including several candidates who lost major statewide races in 2022 on platforms centered on election denialism. The key Senate matchup is between Republican Kari Lake and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, while the GOP brawl in the 8th District features election deniers Blake Masters and Abe Hamadeh. The winner of the primary will be a heavy favorite for the seat in the fall.

**Kamala Harris' Image Improves in Polls, Boosting Democratic Hopes**
Recent polls suggest that Kamala Harris' image has improved, increasing Democratic hopes for the 2024 election. Harris' favorability ratings have increased significantly, with ABC News/Ipsos showing a 43% favorable rating, Wall Street Journal showing 46%, and Fox News showing a 49% average approval rating in four key states. The polls also show that Harris has improved her image among independents, women, and young voters. The CNN and New York Times/Siena College polls also show similar results. Harris' improved image may help the Democratic Party attract voters who did not support Biden in 2020 and may even win back some voters who chose third-party candidates. However, it is early and Harris' popularity may not last, especially as attention turns to some of her past positions.

**Revealed: Data show how Kamala Harris turned her image around  --  and shook up the race**
Vice President Kamala Harris has seen a significant improvement in her approval ratings and public image in recent weeks, according to data from multiple polls. A new ABC News/Ipsos poll puts her at 43% favorable, an 8-point increase from the previous month, while a Wall Street Journal poll shows her at 46%. Morning Consult shows her jumping 12 points to an outright majority favorable rating. The data suggests that Harris is gaining popularity among voters who supported President Joe Biden in 2020, as well as those who didn't vote in 2020 and those who currently support a candidate besides Harris, Trump, or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This could be crucial in consolidating the coalition that beat Trump last time.

A recent ABC News-Ipsos poll and other polls show an increase in Kamala Harris' favourable rating, with 43% of respondents having a positive view of her. This is an 8-point increase from last month and 11 points higher than Joe Biden's rating. The polls suggest that Harris has made the Democratic ticket more appealing to less-reliable voters who could defect from the Democrats or sit out the 2024 election. Harris' favourable rating is also higher among Biden 2020 voters, non-voters, and voters who support a candidate besides her or Donald Trump. While it's early and Harris may be in a honeymoon period, the polls indicate that she has put the Democratic ticket back on the map for problematic voting groups.

**Kamala Harris Sees Significant Boost in Approval Ratings**
Vice President Kamala Harris has experienced a significant increase in her approval ratings this week, according to a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll. This surge aligns with President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, which has boosted Harris's popularity. Harris now has a delicate balance, with 43% of respondents viewing her favorably and 42% unfavorably. This represents a significant improvement from the previous week's division of 35% favorable to 46% unfavorable. Independent voters seem to be driving this trend, with 44% favoring Harris and 40% unfavorably. The withdrawal of President Biden, motivated by concerns over his age, and his support for Harris on Sunday, created waves across the political spectrum. The poll also showed that Biden's favorability rating improved slightly to 37% favorable and 50% unfavorable, from 32% and 55%, respectively, the previous week. This change also affected the favorability of former President Donald Trump, who fell to 36% favorable and 52% unfavorable, from 40% and 51% previously. Although early indicators suggest that Harris is slightly behind Trump, the race is tightening, with Trump leading by only 1.8 percentage points in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate for a national five-way contest. Harris's campaign team has capitalized on the momentum since her elevation to presumed Democratic candidate, reporting $200 million in fundraising efforts in the first week. The ABC News/Ipsos poll also measured the favorability of potential running mates for Kamala Harris, revealing mixed reactions. For example, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear received 13% favorable and 9% unfavorable, leaving 77% without a clear opinion. California Governor Gavin Newsom obtained 21% favorable and 33% unfavorable, with 45% unsure or indifferent. Other potential candidates, such as Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, also registered mixed feelings among respondents. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who recorded 22% favorable and 12% unfavorable, seemed to fare better in comparison. Harris is expected to make her decision in less than two weeks, given the deadline for the virtual roll-call vote planned by Democrats to officially crown her as the presidential candidate. On the Republican side, Trump's running mate, JD Vance, registered 24% favorability and 39% unfavorability, with 36% of respondents undecided or unfamiliar with him. Harris's renewed campaign is strategically targeting Vance's lesser-known profile to sway public opinion in her favor.

**Harris' challenge ahead: Winning over swing voters**

**Kamala Harris polls better nationally than Biden but worse in swing states**
Vice President Kamala Harris may see a boost in her public approval rating after President Joe Biden withdraws from his reelection bid, but she underperforms her boss against former President Donald Trump in crucial swing states. According to recent polls, Trump leads Harris by 7 points in Pennsylvania, 4 points in the national average, and has a significant lead in other swing states such as Georgia, Florida, and Arizona. Harris fares better in Wisconsin and Michigan, but her electability evaporates outside of the Rust Belt. All three contenders for the 2024 election, including Harris, Biden, and Trump, are historically unpopular, with Harris having a 38% favorability rating and a net -14% favorability rating. Republicans should not take this election for granted, as Harris has the potential to campaign with vigor and may be able to overcome some of the baggage associated with Biden's presidency.
