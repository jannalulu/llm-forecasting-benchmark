Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Resolution Criteria:
- Must be a declaration by HHS Secretary
- Must occur after August 12, 2024
- Must occur before October 1, 2024

Evidence Assessment:
1. Mpox Outbreak Context:
- WHO has declared a public health emergency for mpox in Africa
- 15,000+ cases in Africa in 2024
- 461 deaths reported
- A new, more transmissible variant detected
- 160% increase in cases compared to 2023

2. US Specific Considerations:
- No current indication of significant US mpox spread
- Previous US mpox emergency ended in 2023
- Limited recent US mpox cases reported

3. Timing Constraints:
- Very narrow window (August 12 - September 30, 2024)
- Requires active decision by HHS Secretary
- Must be specifically for mpox

Probability Reasoning:
- Low probability due to narrow timing
- Slightly elevated by serious African outbreak
- HHS likely monitoring but not necessarily acting

Calibration Adjustment:
- Base rate for such declarations is low
- Specific mpox circumstances add some urgency

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 12.75%, but 7.25% being the most likely. Probability: 7.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Considerations:
1. Timeframe: We're looking at a potential PHE declaration between August 12, 2024 and October 1, 2024

2. Current Context:
- WHO has declared a public health emergency for mpox in Africa
- Africa CDC has declared a continental public health emergency
- Significant case increases reported (15,000+ cases, 461 deaths in Africa in 2024)
- New more transmissible "Clade Ib" variant detected
- Spread to multiple countries
- 160% increase in cases compared to 2023

3. US-Specific Factors:
- No current US-specific indications of imminent PHE declaration
- Previous US mpox PHE was lifted in January 2023
- Requires specific determination by HHS Secretary

4. Probability Assessment:
- Global health emergency suggests increased vigilance
- But US seems less directly impacted compared to Africa
- Threshold for US PHE is likely higher

Balancing Factors:
- Global trend suggests concern
- Limited direct US transmission evidence
- High bar for declaring PHE

Forecast Reasoning:
- Base rate for PHE declarations is relatively low
- Significant but not overwhelming evidence
- Prudent to maintain a moderate probability range

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Key Observations:
1. Specific Question: Will HHS declare a mpox public health emergency between Aug 12, 2024 and Oct 1, 2024
2. Recent Context: 
- WHO has declared mpox a global health emergency on August 14, 2024
- Africa CDC has declared a continental public health emergency on August 13, 2024
- Multiple news sources report increasing mpox cases, particularly in Africa
- A new, more transmissible and deadly strain (Clade Ib) has emerged
- 15,000+ cases and 461 deaths reported in Africa in 2024
- 160% increase in cases compared to 2023

Probability Considerations:

- But specific timing uncertain

Balanced Assessment:
- Strong global health signals
- Uncertainty about US-specific response timing
- Some probability of declaration, but not extremely high

- WHO declared a global public health emergency on August 14, 2024
- Africa CDC declared a continental public health emergency on August 13, 2024
- 15,000+ cases in Africa, 461 deaths
- 160% increase in cases in 2024
- New, more transmissible "Clade Ib" variant detected

3. US-Specific Considerations:
- No direct US mpox cases mentioned in recent articles
- No indication of US planning emergency declaration
- Global health emergency doesn't automatically trigger US emergency

4. Probability Reasoning:
- Global outbreak increases likelihood of US action
- BUT specific US emergency declaration requires additional threshold
- Conservative estimate needed given lack of direct US evidence

- Base rate: Historical US public health emergency declarations
- Adjust for current global mpox situation
- Balance between overreaction and underreaction
