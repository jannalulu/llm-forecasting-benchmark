Let me break this down systematically:

1. Reference Class and Base Rate
- Diplomatic expulsions are relatively rare events, especially between countries with significant economic ties
- Typical base rate for diplomatic expulsions between major trading partners: ~5-10%

2. Current Specific Context
Strong Escalation Indicators:
- Multiple recent maritime confrontations in South China Sea
- Chinese aircraft dropped flares near Philippine Air Force plane on August 8
- Philippines filed multiple diplomatic protests
- Increasing military tensions at Second Thomas Shoal
- Multiple incidents of maritime harassment

De-escalation Indicators:
- Both sides recently established communication hotline
- Signed a provisional agreement about Second Thomas Shoal
- Ongoing diplomatic dialogue
- Mutual economic interests in maintaining relations

3. Probability Calculation
- Base rate: 7%
- Escalation indicators push probability up: +15%
- De-escalation mechanisms push probability down: -8%
- Specific recent provocation push: +6%

Calculated Probability Range:
- Minimum likelihood: 10%
- Maximum likelihood: 20%
- Most likely specific point: 15%

My Prediction: Between 10.50% and 19.75%, but 15.20% being the most likely. Probability: 15.20%.

Let me break this down systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Diplomatic expulsions/recalls are relatively rare events
- Currently high tensions between Philippines and China over South China Sea disputes
- Multiple recent provocative incidents reported

Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
1. August 2024 incidents show escalating tensions:
- Chinese aircraft dropped flares near Philippine patrol plane
- Multiple diplomatic protests filed by Philippines
- Increasingly confrontational rhetoric from both sides

2. Specific Contextual Factors:
- Second Thomas Shoal ongoing dispute
- Military provocations increasing
- Recent breakdown of political alliance between Marcos and Duterte potentially reducing diplomatic restraint
- US supporting Philippines, adding geopolitical complexity

Key Evidence Moderating Probability:
1. Recent diplomatic efforts to de-escalate:
- July 2024 agreement to improve communication mechanisms
- Establishment of presidential hotline
- Mutual interest in avoiding full-scale conflict

2. Economic interdependence
- China is Philippines' major trade partner
- Mutual disincentive for complete diplomatic rupture

Probability Calculation:
- Base rate for diplomatic expulsion: ~5-10%
- Current tensions adjustment: +20-25%
- De-escalation mechanisms: -5-10%

Balanced Assessment:

My Prediction: Between 22.50% and 37.75%, but 30.25% being the most likely. Probability: 30.25%.

Let me systematically analyze this scenario:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical diplomatic tensions between Philippines and China in South China Sea
- Recent escalating confrontations in 2024, particularly around maritime disputes
- Multiple diplomatic protests already filed in August 2024

Key Recent Evidence:
1. Multiple diplomatic protests filed by Philippines against China in August 2024
2. Serious maritime confrontations, including:
- Chinese aircraft dropping flares near Philippine patrol plane
- Injuries to Philippine sailors during maritime encounters
- Continued tensions around Second Thomas Shoal

Escalation Indicators:
- Increasingly aggressive Chinese military maneuvers
- Philippines becoming more assertive in documenting and protesting incidents
- US support for Philippines increasing tensions
- Breakdown of Marcos-Duterte political alliance potentially reducing diplomatic restraint

De-escalation Indicators:
- Newly established communication hotline between presidents
- Mutual agreement to continue dialogue
- Economic interdependence motivating restraint

Probability Calculation:
- Base probability of diplomatic expulsion: Low (historically rare)
- Current tension level: Elevated
- Diplomatic protest frequency: High
- Risk of miscalculation: Moderate

Careful Balancing:
- Diplomatic expulsion is an extreme step
- More likely to continue current protest/communication pattern
- But tensions are genuinely high

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 27.75%, but 18.40% being the most likely. Probability: 18.40%.
