INT. SUPERFORECASTERS HQ - DAY - AUGUST 19, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, gathered around a table cluttered with newspapers and laptops, analyze the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
"Our models had it at 92.35%. Given the thruster issues and helium leaks, the probability of Williams and Wilmore being Earthside by August 15 was high."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Right. NASA and Boeing were quick to address the fuel constraints. Their swift actions aligned perfectly with our projections."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scanning a laptop)  
"Reports confirm both landed safely on July 30. The contingency plans were robust."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
"Even with the delays, our models never doubted their return. The 7.65% was for potential unforeseen complications."

They exchange satisfied glances, their models once again proving infallible.

FADE OUT.

INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, papers strewn with data and news clippings.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the screen)  
As of now, our models had it at 95.75% that Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore would be Earthside on August 15.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The Starliner issues were concerning, but the contingency plans were robust. NASA's swift actions post-July 2nd were critical.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(holding a NY Post article)  
The indefinite delay was a curveball. Yet, the 45-day fuel window was a pivotal factor in our calculations.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(turning to the group)  
And we were right. Both astronauts touched down safely on August 14, just in time.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(relieved)  
Our models never fail. The probabilities spoke the truth.

The group exchanges satisfied nods, knowing their predictions aligned with reality once again.

The room buzzes with anticipation. A holographic display shows the event: "Will astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore be on Earth on August 15?"

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 95.75%. The Starliner issues were significant, but NASA's contingency plans were robust.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. By July 12, we knew NASA prioritized the astronauts' safe return. Reports from Live Science highlighted the urgency due to limited ISS fuel.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And SpaceX's Dragon capsule was on standby. Their collaboration with NASA was crucial.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, as of noon on August 15, both are confirmed Earthside. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The delays were daunting, but our models were never wrong.

They nod, satisfied with their prediction accuracy.

(looking at the screen)  
As of August 16, our models had it at 95.75%. Both Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are confirmed to be on Earth.

SUPERFORECASTER JAMES  
We factored in the Starliner's issues and the 45-day fuel window. The NY Post article was pivotal.

DR. EMMA LEE  
Indeed. The probability decreased initially due to the thruster and helium leaks, but the July 2nd repair updates increased our confidence.

SUPERFORECASTER JAMES  
And the Live Science report highlighted the urgency, which aligned with NASA's swift action.

DR. EMMA LEE  
Our models were spot-on. Despite the delays, they made it back safely.
