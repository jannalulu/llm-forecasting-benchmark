Let me analyze this question systematically:

1. Current Situation:
- The minimum wage was increased by 49% to 17,200 TL in January 2024
- High inflation (75.45% in May 2024)
- Poverty line exceeds current minimum wage (18,969 TL vs 17,200 TL)

2. Key Evidence For an Increase:
- Historical pattern: Turkey increased minimum wage twice in both 2022 and 2023
- SGK Head İsa Karakaş stated an increase of 4,000 TL is expected in September
- Strong economic pressures from high inflation and poverty statistics
- Opposition parties pushing for increase
- Public pressure due to purchasing power decline

3. Key Evidence Against an Increase:
- Minister of Labor Vedat Işıkhan repeatedly stated no plans for increase
- Government's anti-inflation policy focuses on wage restraint
- Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek opposes wage increases
- Central Bank reports assume no minimum wage increase
- Decision at AKP's Kızılcahamam camp against mid-year increase

4. Timeline Analysis:
- Question resolves September 30, 2024
- Most recent articles (July) maintain government position against increase
- However, multiple sources suggest September as potential timing for increase

5. Critical Factors:
- Strong institutional signals against increase
- But significant economic pressure and precedent for multiple increases
- SGK Head's specific September prediction adds credibility
- Government has history of changing position under economic pressure

Given the conflicting signals but strong economic pressures and specific September prediction from a senior official, combined with historical precedent:

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Extreme inflation pressure (75.45% in May 2024) is creating strong economic pressure for wage increases
2. Minimum wage has fallen below poverty line (minimum wage 17,200 TL vs poverty line 18,969 TL)
3. SGK Head İsa Karakaş specifically predicted a 4,000 TL increase in September 2024
4. Historical precedent of multiple increases per year (2022 and 2023 both had two increases)
5. Political pressure from opposition parties calling for increases

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Multiple clear statements from Labor Minister Vedat Işıkhan that there will be no additional increase
2. Government's stated focus on fighting inflation through wage restraint
3. Finance Minister Şimşek's opposition to wage increases
4. Recent government statements confirming next increase will be January 2025
5. Central Bank reports assume no minimum wage increase

Analysis:
- The government has been very consistent and explicit in stating there will be no increase
- However, SGK Head's specific September prediction suggests internal discussions
- The economic pressure from inflation is severe
- Only about 2 months remain until September 30 deadline
- Government has historically responded to severe economic pressure with wage increases

Key balancing factors:
- Government's anti-inflation policy vs political/economic pressure for increases
- Historical pattern of increases vs explicit current policy
- Multiple official denials vs one specific prediction of September increase

The evidence suggests a moderately low probability, but not negligible given the economic pressures and SGK Head's specific prediction.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%

- Previous years saw multiple increases under similar conditions
- September timing mentioned consistently across multiple reports

- Multiple senior officials (İsa Karakaş) specifically pointing to September
- Economic conditions (75% inflation, below poverty line) create strong pressure
- Government's anti-inflation stance conflicts with worker needs
- Previous years saw multiple increases under similar conditions
- September timing mentioned consistently across multiple reports
- Very specific amount (4,000 TL) suggests concrete planning

Given the specificity of September predictions from officials, continued high inflation, and historical precedent, balanced against government's stated resistance, I assess there is a strong but not certain likelihood of an increase.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 78.40%, with 71.80% being the most likely. Probability: 71.80%
