**Why the 2024 Hurricane Season Will Be Worse Than Expected**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be more active than usual, with several factors contributing to this prediction. Between August 20th and October 10th, 75% of all cyclonic activity in the Atlantic occurs. August is the month when meteorologists pay the most attention to the tropical zone. As of August 2024, the sea surface temperature is above 1.4°C above the average, providing fuel for intense hurricanes if favorable atmospheric conditions are met. The La Niña phenomenon is expected to return between late summer and early fall, which will coincide with the period of highest cyclonic activity in the Atlantic. This will lead to the formation and development of a greater number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. According to the Colorado State University's seasonal hurricane forecast, there will be 23 tropical storms, including the four that have formed so far. Of these, 12 are expected to be hurricanes, with six potentially reaching category 3, 4, or 5 (high-intensity hurricanes).

**National Hurricane Center tracking 'area of disturbed weather' in central Atlantic**
The National Hurricane Center is tracking an 'area of disturbed weather' in the central Atlantic, which has a low chance of development and is expected to approach the Lesser Antilles next week. The system could develop into a tropical depression, storm, or hurricane if it survives the hostile conditions. Forecasters are warning that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be extremely active, and everyone should be prepared. The peak of hurricane season runs from mid-August to mid-October, and the National Hurricane Center is monitoring three tropical waves in the Atlantic basin.

**N Atlantic's area of Extreme Ocean Heat Doubled Since 2004: Catastrophic 2024 Hurricanes Likely**
NOAA forecasts a highly active 2024 hurricane season, with a record-breaking heat content in the Atlantic Ocean. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) predicts 167% of the average accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), making it one of the most severe seasons on record. The combination of atmospheric conditions and water temperatures is already capable of supporting category 5 hurricanes across a wide area. While early season conditions may not be favorable, models show extremely favorable conditions for major hurricanes in August and September. The first storms forming from the Central American Gyre are unlikely to cause significant problems, but this is just the beginning of what could be one of the strongest hurricane seasons on record.

**Rest of 2024 hurricane season will be more active than normal, weather officials warn**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the remainder of the 2024 hurricane season will be more active than normal. Near-record sea-surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and a continued expectation of La Nina conditions will contribute to this prediction. NOAA predicts 17 to 24 named storms, with 8 to 13 becoming hurricanes and 4 to 7 major hurricanes. This is in line with a previous prediction by Colorado State University. The hurricane season ends on November 30. There is a 38% chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the Gulf Coast between the Florida panhandle and Brownsville, Texas, which is significantly higher than usual. Water temperatures throughout the Atlantic basin have been setting warmth records during the past two years, and experts are concerned that this could lead to an extremely busy peak of the hurricane season. Additionally, there is evidence that the forward speed of tropical cyclones is slowing down, which could lead to more impactful flooding. Experts are also concerned about the effect of warm water in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf on hurricane formation and intensification. 'The conditions are very conducive for an extremely busy peak of the hurricane season,' said Rick Knabb, hurricane expert with the Weather Channel. 'We can sometimes get less than 48 hours heads up of a major hurricane threatening landfall,' said Louisiana state climatologist Jay Grymes. 'They can take advantage of the Loop Current and blow up like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.'

**NOAA updates hurricane forecast as peak of Atlantic season approaches**
NOAA has updated its hurricane forecast for the remainder of the 2024 season, predicting an 'extremely active' Atlantic hurricane season. The Climate Prediction Center's latest outlook calls for between 17 and 24 named storms, with 8-13 becoming hurricanes and 4-7 major hurricanes. This is a slight decrease from the initial forecast of 17-25 named storms. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10, and hurricane season runs through November 30. According to Matthew Rosencrans, Lead Hurricane Season Forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, 'Hurricane Beryl broke multiple long-standing records in the Atlantic basin, and we're continuing to see the climatological hallmarks of an active season.' Sea surface temperatures remain abnormally high, and La Niña is expected to emerge during the hurricane season, making it essential to prepare now.

**Number of Atlantic tropical storms forecast for 2024 lowered slightly; Season still ‘extremely active'**
The 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season is expected to be 'extremely active' with 23 named storms, including 12 hurricanes and 6 major hurricanes, according to the latest forecast by Colorado State University. The update dropped the number of named storms from 25 to 23, citing the formation of La Niña during the peak of hurricane season, which will lead to less vertical wind shear and allow storms to intensify. The season has already seen rapid intensification, with a rare Category 5 hurricane in Beryl, which rapidly intensified from a Tropical Depression to a Category 5 storm in just 24 hours. Hurricane Debby made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 storm, bringing heavy rainfall and flash flooding. Meteorologists and officials are on edge due to concerns of rapid intensification in the Gulf, following the example set by Beryl. 'This year has already seen this forecast come to life with a rare Category 5 hurricane in Beryl,' said the article, highlighting the unpredictability of the season.

**The peak of hurricane season is near**
The peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean is near, with the majority of hurricane activity occurring from mid-August to mid-October. This season has been forecast to be above-average, with 25 total named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes predicted. According to Colorado State University, sea-surface temperatures have been well above-average prior to the start of the season, which is one of several factors leading to this prediction. However, the Atlantic has been quiet for the last month due to a large amount of Saharan dust that has been situated over the primary region where tropical waves develop. This dust inhibits tropical development by bringing in dry air and blocking sunlight, thereby cooling sea-surface temperatures. The season kicked off early, with 3 named storms forming in June, including Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl, and Tropical Storm Chris. Whenever the next tropical system forms, it will be named Debby.

**Storm tracker: NHC tracking tropical wave that could be headed toward Florida**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is tracking a 'well-defined tropical wave' in the Atlantic Ocean that could develop into Tropical Storm Debby this weekend or early next week. The NHC says there is a 60% chance of formation through the next seven days, and interests across the Greater Antilles, Bahamas, and Florida should continue to monitor the progress of this system. According to the NHC, 'a tropical depression could form this weekend or early next week over the eastern Gulf of Mexico or far southwestern Atlantic Ocean, including in the vicinity of Florida.' The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, with the peak of the season occurring in September and the most activity happening from mid-August to mid-October.

**Tropical Wave in the Atlantic Could Develop into Tropical Storm Debby**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a large tropical wave in the Atlantic Ocean that could develop into Tropical Storm Debby by the end of the week. According to the NHC, the wave is located several hundred kilometers east of the Lesser Antilles and is generating 'some rain and thunderstorm activity'. The conditions for the development of this tropical wave are becoming more favorable as it moves west-northwest over the southwestern Atlantic. The NHC notes that the system could become a tropical depression by the end of the week or over the weekend. The NHC warns that residents and authorities in the Greater Antilles, Bahamas, and the southeastern United States should be aware of the system's progress. Currently, the NHC gives a 60% chance of tropical storm formation within the next seven days. If the system's winds reach 39 mph (63 km/h), it will be named Tropical Storm Debby, making it the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which is predicted to be extremely active. The tropical wave near the Lesser Antilles continued to cause a wide area of scattered showers and thunderstorms on Wednesday, July 31, 2024. According to the NHC report mentioned by Weather.com, the Atlantic experiences its peak hurricane activity in August, September, and October. This increase is due to factors such as the rise in water temperatures, low wind shear, and higher humidity throughout the basin. The system, moving west-northwest over the Greater Antilles and towards the Bahamas, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical depression near Florida over the weekend. The NHC reported that this perturbation has a nearly zero chance of formation in the next 48 hours, but increases to 60% in the next seven days. Meteorologists continue to closely monitor the progress of this tropical perturbation in the Atlantic, although many uncertainties remain about its future. The current medium-term probabilities indicate that it could head towards parts of the southeastern United States by early this weekend, as indicated by the NHC in its report.

**Hurricane Season Peak Time Begins In August**
The Atlantic hurricane season is in its peak months of August, September, and October, with 78% of storms, 84% of hurricanes, and 93% of U.S. landfalling hurricanes occurring during this time. According to NOAA, this three-month period is the most active for tropical storms and hurricanes, with a significant increase in storms and the risk of U.S. landfalls. The recent peak months have seen some of the most powerful and destructive hurricanes, such as Hurricane Ian, which struck Florida in 2022. The 10 most active hurricane seasons in the satellite era have generated roughly two more storms, two to three more hurricanes, and one to two Category 3 or stronger hurricanes than usual in the peak months. Several factors contribute to the seasonal ramp-up, including African easterly waves, surges of dry air, low wind shear, and rising sea-surface temperatures. It is essential to have a hurricane plan ready and to pay attention to the forecast every day through the rest of the season, as hurricane season can quickly switch from quiet to active. 'Averages are no guarantee of how a hurricane season will turn out,' but in a season expected to be very active like 2024, it signals potential danger ahead. 'Make sure you have your hurricane plan ready to go,' and 'pay attention to the forecast every day through the rest of the season.'

**Debbie, the Next Cyclone in the Atlantic: NOAA Increases Probability to 60%**
The Atlantic Ocean, which had been calm in terms of cyclone formation, may be about to end its tranquility. A combination of a tropical wave and a region of meteorological disturbances could lead to the next cyclone of the season, which would be named Debbie. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there is a 60% chance of this system developing into a named storm in the next 7 days, up from 50% the previous day. The system consists of a tropical wave located hundreds of miles west of the Lesser Antilles, which is moving westward towards the Greater Antilles. It could interact with a low-pressure area over the archipelago and extend over the Bahamas and Florida, contributing to the formation of a significant cyclone. If it develops, Debbie would be the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, following Chris and Beryl. The NOAA has increased the probability of this system developing into a named storm in the next 7 days to 60%, from 50% the previous day. The agency does not expect the storm to develop in the next 48 hours. The Atlantic hurricane season has started irregularly, with only one storm being named (Alberto) in the first month, followed by Beryl, a category 5 hurricane, in late June. After Beryl, another minor storm, Chris, and then a calm period that lasted until late July. Meteorologists have been warning of an intense hurricane season for weeks, citing two reasons: the high ocean temperatures and the possible arrival of La Niña. The accumulated heat in the ocean is notable, and with more heat, these storms can absorb more energy from the sea. La Niña is expected to arrive between August and September, and its cold phase could lead to an intense hurricane season, especially in the second half of the season.

**Low-Pressure System in the Atlantic Has Chances of Becoming a Cyclone**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a disorganized area of rain and thunderstorms in the central Atlantic with a 50% chance of developing into a cyclone. The NHC had predicted that a tropical depression could form mid-week, near the Sotavento Islands, the Greater Antilles, or the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Experts predict that the 2024 hurricane season in the Caribbean, which began in June, could be much stronger than the previous one, which recorded 20 storms and 7 hurricanes, including 3 major hurricanes. The NOAA predicted an 85% chance of an above-normal hurricane season, with 17-25 named storms and 8-13 hurricanes. The INSMET estimates a 90% chance of a tropical cyclone impacting Cuba during the current season, which ends in November, and an 80% chance that it will be a hurricane with sustained winds of over 119 km/h. Cubans are concerned about the potential impact of this year's hurricanes and agree that the country's disaster response system has deteriorated significantly.

**Hurricane Season to Return in August, Predicts National Hurricane Center**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) predicts that the hurricane season will return in August due to changes in climate patterns caused by a Saharan air layer. The Atlantic has been calm for over two weeks, with no significant cyclonic activity. However, experts warn that this calm may not last long, as changes in climate patterns are expected in early August. The presence of this Saharan air layer (SAL) reduces atmospheric humidity by approximately 50%, making it difficult for clouds and thunderstorms to form, which are crucial for tropical cyclone development. The NHC does not expect the formation of new tropical storms or hurricanes in the Atlantic in the next week. As we approach August, conditions in the Atlantic tropical area are expected to become more favorable for cyclone development. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is expected to create an environment more conducive to storm development. The MJO is a phenomenon that moves eastward, affecting areas near the equator and subtropics. During the summer and fall, it can increase hurricane activity in regions with more precipitation and decrease it in areas with descending air. Models indicate that a zone of improved precipitation associated with the MJO will move over the Atlantic tropical area in early August. Although the current calm is not unusual for late July, cyclonic activity generally increases significantly in August and September. During these months, ocean temperatures are warmer, wind shear is lower, and there is less Saharan dust, conditions that favor storm development. Bryan Norcross, a hurricane expert at FOX Weather, notes: 'Tropical development typically accelerates in the second week of August. The peak date for cyclonic activity is around September 10, although the probability of storm formation increases rapidly in the weeks prior and decreases slowly during the rest of September and October'. More than 90% of hurricane activity typically occurs between August and the end of the season, according to the Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, which measures the intensity and duration of all named storms throughout the season.

**Hurricane Season 2024: Predictions Indicate High Activity**
The 2024 hurricane season is expected to be highly active, with 8-13 hurricanes predicted to form over the Atlantic Ocean. This is due to several factors, including warmer ocean temperatures, which provide the energy for hurricanes to form and intensify. The Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts a high level of activity, with most other forecasting centers agreeing. The hurricane season typically runs until the end of November, with varying levels of activity from year to year. 2005 and 2020 were notable for having a high number of hurricanes. The warm ocean temperatures, which are currently 2-3°C warmer than usual, will provide a record amount of energy for hurricanes to form and intensify. This could lead to a rapid intensification of hurricanes, making it difficult to warn affected populations in time. The warm waters will also lead to a higher number of potential hurricane-forming cells, which could develop into hurricanes. Additionally, the development of La Niña in the eastern tropical Pacific will lead to a weakening of winds over the Atlantic, which will also contribute to the formation of hurricanes. However, the current calm weather on the Atlantic is due to the presence of large clouds of Saharan dust, which are suppressing hurricane activity. This calm weather is expected to continue until mid-August, after which the dust clouds will dissipate and hurricane activity is expected to increase.

**Hurricane Season: 'False Calm' to End, Hyperactive Phase Expected**
Meteorologist Juan Vázquez Montalvo warns that the 'false calm' of the hurricane season will soon end, with a hyperactive and dangerous phase expected to begin around August 10. The expert explains that the Madden-Julian phase is currently unfavorable for hurricane formation, but this will change in August when the air rises and humidity increases, allowing for the formation of cyclones. Vázquez Montalvo also notes that the Sahara dust in the Atlantic will dissipate, allowing for the formation of cyclones. He cites a prediction by Dr. Philip Klotzbach of the University of Colorado that the season will be highly active, with many cyclones forming in the peak of the season from August 15 to October 15. The meteorologist urges the population to be prepared and stay informed through official channels, such as Conagua and Protección Cívil.

**2024 hurricane season breaks an unusual record, thanks to hot water**
The 2024 hurricane season has broken an unusual record, with the Atlantic Ocean generating more accumulated cyclone energy than the Pacific Ocean through July 9. This is the first time in recorded history that this has happened. The warm water temperatures in the Atlantic are influencing storm activity in both oceans, with the Pacific experiencing a slower start to the season. Scientists attribute the unusually warm waters in the Atlantic to a weaker-than-normal subtropical high pressure and human-caused global warming. The trend towards a more La Niña-like climate has led to large-scale cooling over the eastern tropical Pacific over 40 years, despite predictions of a more El Niño-like climate due to human-caused climate change. Researchers are working to determine what caused the weakness in the subtropical high pressure and why it continues to persist.

**Saharan dust suppresses tropical storm activity**
The Atlantic Ocean has quieted down after a busy start to hurricane season, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasting 17 to 25 total named storms. The Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is a dry, dusty air mass that originates from the Sahara Desert and suppresses tropical cyclone formation and intensification. Dr. Jason Dunion, a University of Miami hurricane researcher, notes that SAL activity typically peaks from late June to mid-August, with new outbreaks occurring every three to five days. The dusty air can cause hazy skies and increased sensitivity to air pollutants, but does not typically affect air quality near the surface. Historically, the peak of hurricane season is September 10, with heightened activity between mid-August and October. The tropics are expected to remain quiet for the next 7 days.

**Mexico's 2024 Hurricane Season: What to Expect**
The 2024 hurricane season in Mexico has officially begun, with a predicted duration of six months from May 15 to November 30. According to the National Meteorological Service (SMN), 15-18 tropical cyclones are expected in the Pacific and 20-23 in the Atlantic this year. However, not all will reach Mexico, as the country typically receives 4-5 cyclones on average each year. So far, two hurricanes have been recorded in the Pacific: Aletta and Beryl. The SMN has reported a possible low-pressure zone in the Pacific since July 10, with a 20% chance of developing into a cyclone in seven days off the coasts of Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero, and Michoacán. If this low-pressure zone develops, the next cyclone could be named Bud. It is essential for the population in vulnerable areas to stay informed through official channels and follow the instructions of authorities. With the effects of climate change, it is expected that the frequency and intensity of these phenomena will increase in the future, emphasizing the importance of maintaining and improving early warning systems and disaster response infrastructure in Mexico.

**When Does the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season End?**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and has already seen three named storms, including Beryl, the most destructive so far. According to the Colorado State University (CSU), the season will end on November 30, 2024, and is expected to be 'hyperactive' with 25 named storms, 12 of which will become hurricanes, and six of those will be major hurricanes. The CSU updated its forecast in early July, increasing the prediction from 'extremely active' to 'hyperactive'. The reasons for this hyperactivity include warmer ocean temperatures, which provide more energy to tropical cyclones, and the end of the El Niño phenomenon, which had been present throughout 2023 and had been breaking up tropical cyclones. Alberto, Beryl, and Chris are the three named storms that have occurred so far this season.

**What to Expect from the 2024 Hurricane Season**
Hurricane Beryl, the first named storm of the 2024 season, has set records and caused damage across the Caribbean. As a category 5 hurricane, it is the first recorded in the Atlantic and the first category 4 hurricane to form in June. Experts predict a more intense hurricane season than usual. After devastating the Caribbean and Yucatan Peninsula, the storm made landfall in southeastern Texas, canceling over 1,000 flights and leaving over 2 million residents without electricity. At least 15 people died. The hurricane season typically runs from June 1 to November 30, with most storms developing between mid-August and mid-October. A wide area of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic coast of the United States is affected by the storms. If you plan to travel during this hurricane season, here's what you need to know.

**Hurricane threat to SC maybe greater in 2024 after Beryl, new forecast shows. What to know**
A new forecast from Colorado State University predicts a more active 2024 Atlantic hurricane season than previously thought, with 25 named storms expected, up from the initial prediction of 23. The updated forecast comes after Hurricane Beryl tore through Texas, leaving millions without power. The researchers attribute the increased activity to cool neutral ENSO or La Niña conditions, warmer sea surface temperatures, and deep tropical hurricane activity. The probability of major hurricane landfalls along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean is estimated to be above the long-period average.

**HURRICANE SEASON FORECAST INCREASED**
The Colorado State University (CSU) experts have released their updated seasonal hurricane forecast, increasing the predicted number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes. The forecast is based on the anomalous warmth in the North Atlantic and the potential for La Niña development, which typically increases Atlantic hurricane activity. The CSU's analogs for the July 2024 Atlantic seasonal hurricane forecast are 1886, 1926, 1933, 1995, 2005, 2010, and 2020, which were all extremely active hurricane seasons. The peak of the season is expected to be very active in August, September, and October.

**CSU Revises Hurricane Predictions for 2024, Expecting More Active Season**
The Colorado State University (CSU) has updated its hurricane season predictions for 2024, expecting a more active season than initially forecast in April. The revised predictions foresee six major hurricanes, classified as category 3 or higher with winds above 111 miles per hour, out of a total of 12 hurricanes expected to emerge from 25 named storms by the end of the season on November 30. This is an improvement from the April predictions, which forecast five major hurricanes out of 11 hurricanes and 23 named storms. The CSU meteorologists attribute these predictions to two main factors: above-normal sea surface temperatures, which fuel tropical cyclones, and the absence of El Niño this year. El Niño typically generates strong winds that can disrupt hurricane formation, unlike last year's season where El Niño was present. The early activity of storms like Hurricane Beryl in the Atlantic West is often a sign of an active season to come, especially when strong tropical activity is observed in the Atlantic and eastern Caribbean. This trend corresponds to the CSU team's observation of Beryl, which they see as a probable indicator of an hyperactive year. The US government's meteorologists have also published predictions for May, forecasting four to seven major hurricanes out of eight to 13 hurricanes, resulting in 17 to 25 named tropical storms expected for the season. The CSU predictions now align with these projections, indicating a consensus among experts on the likelihood of an above-average hurricane season.

**Post-Beryl hurricane forecast looks calm (for now). When will storms return?**
Hurricane Beryl's destruction is over, but forecasters predict more storms will come. Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher, says conditions will become favorable again by the end of July. Some experts believe Beryl is a sign of a hyperactive hurricane season, with 33 named storms predicted. The Atlantic hurricane season typically peaks in August, September, and October, with most activity occurring from August 15 to October 15. However, July is usually a quiet month for tropical storms and hurricanes, with only 1.1 average storms occurring in the Atlantic since 1851. A dry, dusty air plume from the Sahara Desert is also suppressing storm development over the next couple of weeks.

**Hurricane Beryl breaks records**
Hurricane Beryl has broken records as the earliest calendar year Atlantic Category 5 hurricane, surpassing the prior record held by Hurricane Emily in July 2005. The storm formed in the West African coast and passed 40 miles southwest of Grand Cayman as a Category 4 hurricane. At least 10 people were killed as Beryl made its way through the Caribbean. The Atlantic has generated the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) on record through July 3, breaking the old record set in 1886. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has already surpassed 30 ACE, the fastest an Atlantic hurricane season has reached this milestone. Forecasters have projected an 'extremely active' hurricane season, calling for as many as 23 named storms.

**Furacão Beryl: Trend Indicates More Powerful Hurricanes in the Future**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has reported that the hurricane Beryl, which has been intensifying rapidly, is a sign of what we can expect in the future. According to Anne-Claire Fontan, the scientific director of the WMO's tropical cyclone program, the Beryl indicates that we will have an active hurricane season in the Atlantic this year. Fontan explained that the hurricane developed rapidly in an unusual area for this time of year and reached category 5 in a record-breaking time. She also stated that the hurricane's rapid intensification is due to the significant positive anomaly of warm water in the region, which provides a lot of energy for the cyclones. Fontan warned that this could lead to more powerful hurricanes with stronger winds and more rain. She also emphasized the importance of preparing for these storms, educating the population on how to react to the danger, and preparing homes and families.

**2024 Hurricane Season in Mexico: What to Expect**
The 2024 hurricane season in Mexico has officially begun, with predictions of 15 to 18 tropical cyclones in the Pacific Ocean and 20 to 23 in the Atlantic Ocean. At least five of these storms are expected to impact Mexico. According to the National Water Commission (Conagua) and the National Meteorological Service (SMN), the season is expected to be potentially impactful. The Pacific Ocean is expected to be more active than normal, with a 50% chance of 14 tropical cyclones, while the Atlantic Ocean is expected to be normal to 10% above average, with 15 systems. In the Pacific, 8 to 9 tropical storms, 4 to 5 low-intensity hurricanes (category 1 or 2), and 3 to 4 major hurricanes (category 3 to 5) are expected. In the Atlantic, 11 to 12 tropical storms, 5 to 6 low- to medium-intensity hurricanes (category 1 or 2), and 4 to 5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4, or 5) are expected. It is important to note that not all of these storms will directly impact Mexico, and at least five are expected to affect the country. The season will end on November 30, with a peak in August and October. It is essential to stay informed and prepared, including creating emergency plans, identifying evacuation routes, and preparing essential supplies such as water, non-perishable food, and medications.

**Why the 2024 Hurricane Season Will Be More Active**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has warned that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be more intense and active than usual due to a 'confluence of factors' that favor the formation of storms. The forecast predicts 13 cyclones, 7 of which could be major hurricanes. Additionally, 17 to 25 storms with sustained winds over 62 km/h could form. NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad emphasized that the forecast for named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes is the highest ever issued for May. The early arrival of Hurricane 'Beryl' is a sign of the extreme heat generated by climate change, which has caused meteorological disasters worldwide.

**How do hurricanes receive their names? What to know about the storms**
The Atlantic hurricane season 2024 runs from June 1 to November 30. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) maintains six alphabetical lists of names for Atlantic hurricanes, which are rotated every six years. The WMO gives tropical cyclones a name when they officially become a tropical storm, with sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Hurricanes are more severe than tropical storms, with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph or greater. The WMO has strict procedures to determine a list of tropical cyclone names, and different areas of the world have varying procedures for naming cyclones. Naming tropical cyclones helps meteorologists and the public keep track of storms, avoids confusion, and aids in historical record-keeping and research.

**Hurricane Beryl: A Rare and Intense Storm in the Atlantic**
Beryl, the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, has rapidly intensified into a category 4 hurricane with maximum winds of 210 km/h. This is the strongest hurricane to occur in June in the Atlantic. Beryl is moving towards the Windward Islands. A major hurricane in June in the Antilles is extremely rare, and a category 4 has never occurred before. Beryl is part of a group of hurricanes that experience rapid intensification, a process where a storm undergoes a rapid growth: this phenomenon is typically defined as a tropical cyclone that intensifies by at least 56 km/h in a 24-hour period. The official Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with the peak activity typically occurring between August and October. However, the formation of hurricanes of such intensity at the beginning of the season is very unusual. Beryl is expected to reach category 5 in the coming hours. The hurricane has found a particularly favorable environment for its intensification; the tropical disturbance has been located in a region with low vertical shear but also characterized by a record-breaking heat content in the main development region. Rainfall could cause flooding, with precipitation expected between 75 and 150 mm in Barbados and the Windward Islands. Hurricane warnings have been issued for Barbados, St Lucia, St Vincent, the Grenadines, and Grenada. Beryl is the first hurricane of what is expected to be an extraordinary 2024 season. The tropical storm Alberto, the first named storm of the season, caused at least four deaths in Mexico after making landfall on June 20.

**NOAA Predicts 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season to be One of the Most Intense on Record**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be one of the most intense on record, with over 20 tropical storms expected in the next five months. The season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, has an 85% chance of being more active than usual. NOAA expects 17 to 25 named storms, a record in the organization's 154-year history. Of these, 8 to 13 are expected to become hurricanes with winds of 74 mph or more, and 4 to 7 could reach major hurricane categories, including categories 3, 4, or 5 with winds of 111 mph or more. The main causes of this high activity include the La Niña phenomenon and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. According to NOAA scientists, the transition from El Niño to La Niña favors the development of cyclones. Other factors include reduced trade winds and less wind shear, which facilitate the formation and strengthening of storms. Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, said, 'There are reasons to be concerned, but not alarmed. Yes, it's the highest number, but it's about being prepared. So, now is the time to be prepared.'

**Mexico Predicts First Tropical Storm of Atlantic Season in 48 Hours**
The Mexican National Meteorological Service (SMN) predicts that the first tropical storm of the Atlantic season will arrive in 48 hours. The service announced on Monday that the low-pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico has increased its probability of forming a tropical cyclone to 70% in the next 48 hours. The SMN also predicts that the Atlantic will be more active than usual this season, with up to 50% above the average of 14 systems. This possible tropical storm comes after the passage of Hurricane Otis, the strongest storm of the past season, which made landfall in Acapulco, Guerrero, on October 25, 2023, as a category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 260 km/h. The SMN predicts that 15 to 18 systems will develop in the Pacific Ocean, of which 8 to 9 will be tropical storms, 4 to 5 hurricanes, and 3 to 4 category 3 to 5 storms.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season Forecast: More Active Than Usual**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has announced its forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which is expected to be more active than usual. The season runs from June 1 to November 30 and is expected to see 17 to 25 tropical storms, with 8 to 13 of them becoming hurricanes. The forecast is based on several indicators, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is expected to transition from an El Niño phase to a La Niña phase in the second half of the year. La Niña is characterized by cooler Pacific Ocean temperatures, which can lead to an increase in hurricane activity. The NHC also cited high sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic as a factor in its forecast. The season is expected to be more active due to the combination of these factors, which will lead to a higher probability of hurricanes and tropical storms. The NHC also emphasized the importance of vigilance and maintaining social communication to prevent loss of life and property damage.

**Experts Confirm Intense Cyclone Season in the Atlantic: IMN Warns That it is Not Possible to Predict Effects in Costa Rica**
Experts from the National Meteorological Institute (IMN) and the Ministry of Environment and Energy (Minae) have confirmed that this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin will be intense, with 21 tropical cyclones expected to form. The season begins on June 1 and ends on November 30, and includes the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic Ocean. The IMN forecasts that 7-8 of these systems will develop into tropical storms and category 1 or 2 hurricanes, while 4-5 will develop into category 3, 4, or 5 hurricanes. Eladio Solano, head of forecasts at the IMN, explained that the increase in temperature in the Caribbean Sea and the entrance of La Niña favor the formation of tropical cyclones. The IMN also foresees the consolidation of La Niña from July until the rest of the year, with an increase in downpours. The National Emergency Commission (CNE) recommends redoubling protection measures and strengthening early warning systems in the country's watersheds.
