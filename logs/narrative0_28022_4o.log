INT. NEWS STUDIO - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, a screen displaying the SpaceX Updates page behind them.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question was whether SpaceX would post a new update before October 1, 2024. And?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Yes, our models had it at 85.45%. Given SpaceX's active communication strategy and recent developments, it seemed likely.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed. Their August post hinted at upcoming launches, making it probable they'd update soon. Any thoughts on the probability of the page being down?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
We considered that, but our models placed it at a mere 3.12%. SpaceX's robust infrastructure rarely fails.

NATE SILVER  
So, it resolved as yes. Our models remain unbeaten.

They exchange a satisfied nod, their predictions once again validated.

FADE OUT.

**NATE SILVER**  
(leaning back in his chair)  
So, did SpaceX make a new post on their Updates page before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(shuffling through papers)  
No, they didn't. Our models had it at 45.67%.

**NATE SILVER**  
(nodding)  
Interesting. Given their recent activity, it seemed like a close call. But our models were right, as always.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(smiling)  
Indeed. The absence of posts, despite the buzz around their latest missions, was unexpected but not improbable. 

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how the probability reflected reality yet again. The page being down was a concern, but it stayed online. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. The precision of our models continues to impress. Let's keep an eye on their next move. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. Onward to the next prediction. 

**They both nod, satisfied with their accurate forecast.**

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, a screen behind them displaying the SpaceX Updates page.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question was whether SpaceX would post a new update before October 1, 2024. Our models, as always, gave us the answer.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, Nate. Our models had it at 75.00%. And indeed, SpaceX did make a new post on September 25, 2024.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. Given SpaceX's frequent updates and their recent August post, it was a calculated probability. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Their pattern of consistent communication made it likely. Our models took into account the possibility of the site being down, but with minimal risk.

**NATE SILVER:** Once again, the models prove their accuracy. 

*They nod, satisfied with their prediction as the screen fades to black.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did SpaceX make any new posts on their Updates page before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 45.67%. We anticipated a post given their recent activities, but nothing new appeared.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. I guess the August 12th post was their last update for now. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, despite the buzz around their projects, they kept quiet. Maybe they're holding back for a bigger reveal later.

**NATE SILVER:** Or perhaps the page was down at a crucial moment—always a factor to consider.
