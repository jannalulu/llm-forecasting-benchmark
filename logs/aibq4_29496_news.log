**Check your fridge: Recall includes hundreds of items sold at Walmart, Target and more**
A major recall involving nearly 10 million pounds of ready-to-eat chicken and meat has grown to include hundreds of products sold at major retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Kroger. The recall was initiated by BrucePac after U.S. Agriculture Department officials detected listeria in samples of poultry during routine testing. The recalled products include grilled chicken breast strips, ready-to-eat salads, chicken salad, wraps, and frozen meals. Consumers are advised to review the USDA's recall document and check with retailers to confirm whether any of their recent purchases are on the list. Listeria infections can cause fever, muscle aches, and tiredness, and may be especially dangerous for older people, those with weakened immune systems, or who are pregnant. According to federal food inspectors, no adverse effects related to the recall have been reported.

**USDA Recalls Millions of Pounds Worth of Ready-To-Eat Meat**
The USDA has recalled nearly 10 million pounds of ready-to-eat chicken and beef products from BrucePac due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

'Restaurants, institutions, and other establishments are urged not to serve or use these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,' the USDA warned.

**USDA Recalls Over 4.5 Million Pounds of Meat and Poultry Products Due to Possible Listeria Contamination**
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that BrucePac, a producer of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, has recalled over 4.5 million pounds of products due to possible listeria contamination. The affected products were distributed to restaurants and institutions across the country and may have been used in ready-to-eat items that are 'on store shelves or in consumers' refrigerators or freezers,' or available for use in restaurants and other establishments. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service discovered the issue during routine testing of finished poultry products. The agency identified BrucePac's ready-to-eat chicken as the source of the listeria, which may have affected other meat and poultry products produced between June 19 and October 8. Listeria can cause listeriosis, the third leading cause of foodborne deaths in the US. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue, and can also cause stiffness in the neck, headache, confusion, or seizures. The USDA stated that 'there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of these products.' However, some people who get sick may recover without being tested for listeria, and it can take weeks to link a disease to an outbreak. The USDA advised restaurants, institutions, and other establishments to 'not serve or use these products. These products should be discarded or returned to the place of purchase.' Anyone concerned about a disease should contact a healthcare provider.
