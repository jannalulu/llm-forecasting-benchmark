**An updated look at the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has started off with a deadly pace, with Alberto forming on June 17 and causing five deaths, and Beryl becoming the earliest Category 5 storm on record in the Atlantic basin on July 1, resulting in catastrophic damage and approximately 20 fatalities. Despite recent tropical development halting due to Saharan dust plumes and an unusually warm upper atmosphere, NOAA's final seasonal forecast calls for 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. Colorado State University's final seasonal update also predicts 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and six major hurricanes. The peak of the season is September 10, but the Atlantic can remain active well into October, emphasizing the importance of remaining prepared for the next storm. As one expert noted, 'it only takes one storm to have a devastating impact.'

**Are we done yet? An updated look at the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season**
As of September 4th, the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season has seen minimal major activity, despite predictions of an above-average season. The statistical peak of the season is September 10th, and many are wondering when the expected activity will occur. Meteorologist Jackson Chastain points to the lack of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) as a key factor in the underperforming season. Normally, AEWs form over Africa, track west, and then move off the coast where they encounter a warm and low shear environment for tropical development. However, recently, AEWs have been forming at a higher latitude and tracking west in the Sahara, where they rain out over the desert before reaching the ocean. This has resulted in fewer storms. Colorado State University's updated forecast predicts 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, but currently, there have only been 4 named storms this year. It's still too early to call it quits on the season, but there's a lot of catching up to do.

**Atlantic Hurricane Season 2024: Projections and Expectations**
The Atlantic hurricane season 2024 is entering September, a month historically considered the most active of the year, after a relatively quiet August. So far, five named storms have formed, of which three have reached category 1 hurricane status. Despite the formation of tropical cyclones being below average for this time of year, the intensity of the systems has exceeded expectations. Projections for September suggest the formation of six named systems, including two hurricanes. According to the FOX Forecast Center, September may start quietly, but there is a disturbance in the Atlantic with moderate chances of development. Water temperatures remain above average, but have not been sufficient to cause a significant increase in cyclonic activity. Some experts believe that climate change may be influencing the weather more than recognized in meteorological projections. Research has shown a significant decrease in the number of hurricanes and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) globally, especially in the western North Pacific. However, there has also been an increase in damage related to cyclones and rapid intensification events. With 12 weeks remaining in the season, which extends until November 30, initial projections of 20-30 named storms seem increasingly difficult to meet. Historically, the most cyclones that occurred after September 1 occurred in 2020, with 15 named storms. To meet the higher projections, the season would need to average 1-2 new storms per week. The number of storms does not always have a high impact on the season, as seen in the 2022 season, which was considered almost normal, but produced the hurricane Ian, making that year the third most costly in history. The 2023 season had more storms, but had less impact.

**How does hurricane season 2024 compare to the predictions as peak nears?**
As hurricane season 2024 approaches its peak on September 10, the National Hurricane Center has identified three areas of interest in the Atlantic. Two of these areas have a moderate chance for development, while one has a low chance. The first tropical wave is located in the Caribbean Sea and has a low chance for development over the next couple of days, but conditions will be more favorable for development in the western Caribbean and southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The second tropical wave is located in the eastern Atlantic and may bring heavy rain and gusty winds to the Cabo Verde Islands. The third tropical wave is located between the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles and has a low chance for development. As of September 1, the 2024 season has seen five named storms, three of which reached hurricane strength with one major hurricane. According to NOAA, the season is slightly behind schedule compared to their original forecast, but ahead of schedule in terms of storm strength. If no additional development occurs before September 7, the season will be considered 'normal' for all three categories: named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes.

**Colorado State University says forecast for the Atlantic should remain quiet next 2 weeks**
Researchers at Colorado State University released their updated forecast for the Atlantic Hurricane Season, stating that the next two weeks should remain relatively quiet. Although the forecast for the season remains at an above-normal level of activity, with 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes expected, the next two weeks are forecasted to be below normal. According to CSU, 'it only takes one storm to devastate a community,' and they emphasize that the quiet period is not a guarantee of an inactive season. The National Weather Service defines a major hurricane as a Category 3 or above or a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 111 mph and higher. CSU has issued its next two-week forecast for 2024 Atlantic hurricane activity, favoring below-normal activity (60% chance) relative to normal (30%) and above normal (10%).

**The 2024 hurricane season was expected to be especially bad. Why is it so quiet?**
The 2024 hurricane season was expected to be 'above-normal' with 25 named storms, 13 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. However, over halfway through the season, only 5 named storms have formed, with 3 being hurricanes and 1 major hurricane. Accuweather meteorologist Alex DaSilva attributed the difference to dust from the Sahara Desert, cold water off the western coast of Africa, and a slow-to-develop La Niña. Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Dan Harnos noted that warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic are still ideal for storm development, and La Niña is expected to form between September and October, potentially fueling a strong end to the season.

**The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is incredibly weird, experts confirm**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has taken an unexpected turn, with a prolonged period of quiet activity in the Atlantic. After a strong start with Hurricane Beryl, which became the earliest-forming Category 5 in the Atlantic on record, the season has seen only three hurricanes and five total named storms to date. According to CSU researchers, this is the quietest period in the Atlantic since the advent of satellite tracking. Eric Berger, a meteorologist at Space City Weather, attributes this to a lack of rising air in the Atlantic and a northward shift in the African wave train, which is causing low-pressure systems to form farther north and outside of the most favorable area for storm formation. While the season remains in this lull, background conditions for storm generation remain, and Berger predicts a burst of activity in the Atlantic later in September and October. However, the odds of Texas being hit by a hurricane after September 24 are about 1 in 50, and the state has never been hit on record after the middle of October. 'The Atlantic hurricane season has gotten extremely quiet,' CSU researchers wrote in their report. 'The Atlantic has produced no named storm formations since Ernesto on 12 August. Only one other time in the satellite era has the Atlantic not produced any named storms between 13 August and 3 September. That other year was 1968.'

**VA Hurricane Season: Forecasters Downgrade Prediction For 2024 Storms**
AccuWeather has revised its forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting 16 to 20 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes. This is still above the historical average of 14 named storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had previously called for 17 to 24 named storms. So far, there have been five named storms this season, with none directly hitting Virginia. However, the remnants of Beryl and Debby brought heavy rain and thunderstorms, and Ernesto kicked up rough surf. Meteorologists are monitoring six potential tropical threats that might bring impacts to the United States starting September 7. AccuWeather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, said that the amount of dry air and Saharan dust in the Atlantic, as well as the slower-than-expected progression to a La Niña pattern, has caused more wind shear in the first half of the season, slowing the formation of storms. 'Extremely warm waters across much of the Atlantic basin area ideal for tropical development and rapid intensification, but the surge of dry air, dust, wind shear, and cold waters off the coast of Africa have prevented most tropical waves from developing into a tropical storm or a hurricane,' DaSilva added. AccuWeather's chief meteorologist, Jon Porter, said, 'Should the current lull continue deeper into September, reductions in the forecast number of named storms will be needed because a longer time period in the core of the hurricane season will have been devoid of named storms.' Despite the reduction in forecast storms, it's 'already been a very impactful and destructive hurricane season,' Porter said. 'We warned that Texas, the Florida Panhandle, South Florida, and the Carolinas faced a higher-than-average risk of direct impacts this season. Three of those four areas have already verified this season,' Porter continued.

**NJ Hurricane Season: Forecasters Downgrade Prediction For 2024 Storms**
Forecasters have downgraded the prediction for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, expecting 16 to 20 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes, and three to six major hurricanes. This is still above the historical average of 14 named storms. The reduction in forecast storms is due to a 'lull' in tropical activity in the Atlantic basin during an 'unusual August'. Accuweather's lead hurricane expert, Alex DaSilva, said that the amount of dry air and Saharan dust in the Atlantic, as well as the slower-than-expected progression to a La Niña pattern, has caused more wind shear in the first half of the season, slowing the formation of storms. Despite the reduction in forecast storms, the season has already been 'very impactful and destructive', with several major records broken, including the earliest major hurricane on record to form east of the Lesser Antilles in June. Jon Porter, Accuweather chief meteorologist, said, 'Should the current lull continue deeper into September, reductions in the forecast number of named storms will be needed because a longer time period in the core of the hurricane season will have been devoid of named storms.'

**September 10th: The Peak Day of the Atlantic Hurricane Season**
September 10th is considered the peak day of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 87% of category 1 and 2 hurricanes and 96% of intense hurricanes (categories 3, 4, and 5) occur between mid-August and mid-October. However, it is around September 10th that these weather phenomena find the perfect conditions to intensify. The explanation behind this peak day lies in the interaction of key climate factors, including the weakening of winds in the upper atmosphere and the warming of ocean waters. As a result, the 10th of September represents the statistical climax of the hurricane season, with around 95 tropical storms and 55 hurricanes forming on this day over the past 100 years. This phenomenon is short-lived, as the arrival of autumn in October brings a change, with winds in the upper atmosphere strengthening and ocean temperatures decreasing, making it more difficult for powerful storms to form.

**Hurricane forecast update following rare storm-free Labor Day weekend**
AccuWeather has reduced its forecast for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season due to unusual conditions that have limited tropical activity. The new forecast predicts 16-20 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-6 major hurricanes. Despite warm water across the basin, dry air, dust, and disruptive winds have hindered tropical development. AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter warns that even with fewer storms, two to four direct impacts to the United States are expected. 'We don't want anyone to let their guard down,' Porter said. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10, but tropical threats could extend through November and possibly into December due to warm water temperatures.

**Anything to watch in the tropics? Peak of season ahead**
The Atlantic hurricane season is reaching its peak on September 10, but forecasters do not expect any named storms to form in the next week. This is unexpected given the predicted supercharged 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and record-warm tropical seas. According to NOAA's hurricane season outlook, there should be 17-24 named storms before the season ends. However, so far in 2024, there have been only five named storms, and the Atlantic basin is running behind climatology. Despite this, there have been three hurricanes this season, including Beryl, which peaked as a Category 5 on July 1, the earliest Category 5 in the Atlantic on record. A tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic has a 40% chance of becoming a depression in the next week, and another disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico has a 10% chance. The National Weather Service is keeping a close eye on these systems, but for now, there is no cause for concern along the coasts.

**Supercharged September: Atlantic hurricane season to intensify dramatically**
The Atlantic hurricane season is expected to intensify dramatically in September, with a surge of hurricanes and tropical storms predicted to form across the Atlantic Ocean. According to AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva, 'things could get very active potentially very quickly here as soon as that dry air goes away,' with a 'parade of storms' possible. Between six and 10 tropical systems are predicted for September, similar to the record-breaking 2020 hurricane season. The climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is Sept. 10, but warm water temperatures could fuel plenty of tropical storms and hurricanes heading into autumn. DaSilva warned that Florida, the Carolinas, and Texas are at an elevated risk of a landfalling tropical storm or hurricane, and the danger will extend far beyond where a storm makes landfall. AccuWeather is predicting a total of 20 to 25 named storms across the Atlantic basin by the end of 2024, well above the historical average of 14.

**2024 Atlantic hurricane season update: Above average activity expected**
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be above average, according to forecasts from NOAA and CSU. As of mid-August, 5 named storms have formed, with 3 reaching hurricane status. The strongest storm so far was Category 5 hurricane Beryl, which caused significant damage in the Caribbean and Texas. NOAA predicts a 90% chance of an above-normal season, with 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. CSU forecasts a very active season, with 23 named storms, 12 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes. The official peak of hurricane season is September 10, and the season will run until November 30. Experts attribute the above-average forecasts to warm sea surface temperatures, a cool ENSO Neutral or La Niña, and an above-average west African monsoon season.
