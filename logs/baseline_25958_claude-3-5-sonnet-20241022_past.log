2025-02-12 22:34:03,969 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Current Status (as of July 10, 2024):
- Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) is the defending champion from 2022 and 2023
- He's currently in the race and one of the top contenders
- Main rival Tadej Pogačar is also competing strongly

2. Key Factors:
- Vingegaard has proven ability to win TdF, winning last two editions
- Strong team support from Visma-Lease a Bike
- Current form appears good based on earlier season results
- Major competition from Pogačar who has shown exceptional form this year
- Risk of crashes/accidents/illness remains as race is still ongoing

3. Considerations:
- At this point in the race, positions can still change significantly
- Mountain stages yet to come which are Vingegaard's strength
- Team tactics and energy conservation become crucial in final stages

4. Historical Context:
- Multiple consecutive wins are relatively common in TdF
- Defending champions often perform well due to experience

Given current race situation, Vingegaard's past performance, and considering all variables including competition and risk factors:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.
