Let me carefully analyze this:

1. David Schweikert is the incumbent Republican Representative for Arizona's 1st Congressional District.

2. Arizona's 1st District has been redrawn recently, which can impact electoral dynamics.

3. Schweikert has faced ethical issues in the past (including an ethics committee reprimand in 2020), which could potentially impact voter perception.

4. The district's partisan lean and recent voting patterns are critical:
- Arizona has been a competitive swing state recently
- The redistricting may have changed the district's partisan composition

5. 2024 is a presidential election year, which typically drives higher turnout and can influence down-ballot races.

6. Schweikert has consistently won re-election in recent cycles, suggesting incumbent strength.

7. No definitive information about a strong challenger is evident from the background provided.

Considering these factors, I assess Schweikert has a solid but not guaranteed re-election probability.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 78.90%, but 72.30% being the most likely. Probability: 72.30%.
