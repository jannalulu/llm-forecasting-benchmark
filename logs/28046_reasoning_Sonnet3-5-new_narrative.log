Nate Silver: [reviewing charts] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 85% that lithium would drop below 70,000 CNY/T, and it did â€“ hitting 69,500 on September 28th."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. The signs were clear in our September 12th data. The continuous downward pressure from oversupply, combined with that unexpected announcement from BYD about reduced production targets, made it almost inevitable."

Nate: "The market was already fragile at 72,500. When those Chinese inventory reports showed higher-than-expected stockpiles..."

Philip: [interrupting] "Plus the new Australian mines coming online ahead of schedule. Our models captured that perfect storm."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Though I must admit, even at 85%, I was a bit nervous about this one."

[Both chuckle as they turn to their next prediction]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Philip, the lithium markets proved us right again. Our models had it at 82.50%."

Philip: "Indeed. With prices already at 72,500 in early September and that consistent downward pressure from oversupply, it was almost inevitable. The market just couldn't sustain those levels."

Nate: "The signs were all there - EV demand softening, new supply coming online, and that massive inventory buildup in China. When we ran the numbers back in September, the trajectory was clear."

Philip: "Exactly. Once it broke below 70,000 on September 25th, it validated everything our models were showing. The fundamentals aligned perfectly with our probabilistic forecast."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting. Though I have to say, even with all the bearish indicators, that sharp drop in the final week was more dramatic than expected."

Nate Silver: [examining charts] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We gave it a 91.25% probability, and sure enough, lithium carbonate dipped below 70,000 CNY/T last week.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The signals were clear in our September analysis. The continuing EV demand slowdown in China, combined with that new Australian supply coming online, made it almost inevitable. When we saw prices hit 72,500 in early September, the trajectory was obvious.

Nate: The interesting part was how the market ignored the S&P Global projections about stabilization. Those supply chain disruptions they warned about never materialized.

Philip: [smiling] Sometimes the simplest forecast is the right one. The downward momentum was too strong to resist, even with the long-term demand outlook remaining positive.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting.
