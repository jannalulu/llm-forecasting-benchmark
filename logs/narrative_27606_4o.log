A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their faces lit by the glow of computer screens. Maps and data charts are scattered everywhere.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Our models had it at 85.00%. Tetkino is indeed under Ukrainian control.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
The August advances were pivotal. The destruction of those bridges slowed the Russians more than anticipated.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to a map)  
And the Ukrainian consolidation in Otruba was the turning point. The Russians couldn't regain momentum.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning in)  
The Kursk Nuclear Plant concerns were a distraction. Ukraine’s focus on strategic locations paid off.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Our Brier scores remain impeccable. The data never lies.

They share a moment of satisfaction, knowing their predictions once again mirrored reality.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
So, Tetkino. Did it fall?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(shakes head)  
No, it didn’t. Our models had it at 15.75%. The destruction of bridges and Russian reinforcements made it unlikely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(nodding)  
And the Kursk Nuclear Plant tensions diverted Ukrainian resources. Our August data showed they were stretched thin.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(typing)  
ISW's last update confirmed it. Ukraine's advance stalled at the Seim River. No blue on the map.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(sighs)  
A close call, but the models were right again.

They exchange relieved glances, knowing their predictions held true.
