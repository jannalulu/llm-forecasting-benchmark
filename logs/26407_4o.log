To accurately forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), it's crucial to carefully examine the available information, identify trends and develop a probability judgment. 

**Base Rate and Historical Context:**  
- The last reported formal mobilization wave in Russia was in September 2022, with 300,000 people mobilized. No formal new wave has been confirmed by ISW since then. Understanding the frequency of formal military mobilizations in comparable geopolitical contexts can anchor our base rate. 
- Historically, dramatic geopolitical shifts rarely repeat at high frequency (i.e., annual repeat formal military mobilizations have not been standard practice in Russia).

**Recent Evidence and Contextual Variables:**  
- Repeated official denials by the Kremlin of any need for new mobilizations weigh against the probability of formal mobilization being recognized by the ISW.
- However, the recurring narrative of unofficial recruitment drives and increasing troop counts suggests pressure on Russia’s military resources, highlighting a potential need for additional soldiers in the conflict.
- Reports indicate preparation for internal measures that restrict travel of conscripts and potential mobilizees, suggesting preparatory groundwork that could support mobilization if circumstances shift.
- There is a marked contradiction in official statements and independent analysis/reports suggesting potential mobilization needs. The consistency of denials could signal a strategic delay or political guidance preventing formal acknowledgment.

**Clashing Causal Forces:**  
- Internal Russian narrative (Putin stating no mobilization needed) vs. external military pressures (need for troop replenishment indicated by military analysts and reports).
- The geopolitical risk of internal destabilization from another round of formal mobilization vs. the military need for manpower to sustain operations in the Ukraine conflict.

**Resolution Criteria and Considerations:**  
- This forecast strictly depends on whether ISW reports a second wave, not on whether the mobilization occurs independently of ISW recognition.
- ISW has not reported any initiated or completed new mobilization wave as of October 2024.

**Forecast Balance:**  
- Weighing the probabilities, the stronger part of the argument remains on the side of the absence of formal recognition by ISW due to the lack of direct evidence or statements aligned with formal mobilization according to ISW standards.
- The probability judgment balances the inherent unpredictability of political maneuvers with the continued absence of ISW confirmation as of October 2024.

**Outcome Prediction:**
In light of the evidence and understanding of the ISW resolution criteria, as well as the logistical and political challenges associated with formal mobilization:

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 18.00% being the most likely. Probability: 18.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), we need to carefully evaluate the available data and trends.

1. **Base Rate Analysis:** Historically, Russia has carried out formal mobilizations, most notably in September 2022. The intervals between such mobilizations and the context under which they occurred typically involved heightened military needs due to ongoing conflicts, such as the situation in Ukraine.

2. **First Mobilization Wave Context:** The previous mobilization in September 2022 occurred after significant losses and increased need for troops. Since then, Russia has been able to maintain its military operations through various means, including recruiting volunteers.

3. **Current Evidence:** 
   - Numerous articles and sources, including statements from the Kremlin, suggest that there is no current formal requirement for mobilization. However, there are also signs, such as the preparation to close borders and the development of an electronic summons system, which may indicate preparatory steps that could precede mobilization.
   - Reports differ, with Ukrainian and some Western intelligence suggesting the possibility of mobilization while Russian officials continue to deny it. This might be strategic disinformation or indicative of genuine internal disagreement or hesitation.

4. **Economic and Political Considerations:** The internal economic and political stability factors are crucial, as a new wave of formal mobilization could lead to public dissent and economic strain. Russia might weigh the risks of mobilization against these internal pressures. This has led to an emphasis on recruiting volunteers instead of conducting a formal mobilization.

5. **Trends and ISW Assessment:** Recently, ISW has reported on Russia's efforts to 'crypto-mobilize' its resources, but it has not characterized these efforts as a formal mobilization. ISW's analysis suggests limits on Russia’s ability to conduct large-scale operations, indicating a lack of full-scale mobilization resources.

6. **Resolution Criteria:** For ISW to recognize and report a formal mobilization wave, there should be explicit steps undertaken by the Russian government that meet the threshold set by the resolution criteria, namely a government-acknowledged action similar to the September 2022 mobilization. 

Given these points and balancing them with the risk of overreacting to any single piece of evidence or trend, it's necessary to apply a probability estimate. While preparations and discussions around mobilization are evident, there is no clear indicator of an impending formal announcement recognized by ISW similar to previous mobilizations.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To answer the question of whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), it's important to analyze past trends, current news, and potential future developments in Russia's military mobilization activities.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, the Russian government conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022. Mobilizations in Russia have been rare and typically occur when there is a significant need to increase military capacity. Given the context of the ongoing conflict and the need for manpower, there's precedent for mobilization, but it's not an annual occurrence.

2. **Current Reports and Denials**: The majority of recent articles present the consistent message from Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin and Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov, that there is no current need for a new wave of mobilization. There's a focus on recruiting volunteers and contract soldiers, which suggests an attempt to avoid full-scale mobilization.

3. **Credible Predictions from Analysts and Agencies**: Various analysts and organizations, including Ukrainian officials and sources from defense analyses, speculate on additional mobilization being possible, although these claims are speculative and less concrete than official statements. However, these reports hint at logistical preparations like administrative systems that could facilitate mobilization if required.

4. **Strategic and Operational Trends**: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has not officially reported a new mobilization as of the last reports and is cautious in making definitive claims. This would typically influence a forecast that leans towards a lower probability unless evidence becomes more compelling.

5. **Balanced View of Clashing Forces**: The Russian government has shown restraint in initiating a second mobilization, focusing more on structured recruitment and managing political sentiment. The potential for changing geopolitical circumstances may motivate a change, but current evidence doesn't overwhelmingly point in that direction.

6. **Recent Developments and Linear Extrapolation**: Considering the logistical improvements that prepare for mass mobilization (via electronic summonses starting in fall 2024), there is potential infrastructure readiness, but this readiness does not guarantee mobilization will occur. Recent trends suggest the maintenance of current recruiting strategies without escalation to formal mobilization.

In conclusion, while there is infrastructure development that suggests preparedness, the consistent denial by Russian authorities and focus on contract soldiers cast doubt on the likelihood of a new wave of formal mobilization. The current ISW reports do not confirm such a mobilization either.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will carefully analyze the available information, apply forecasting techniques, and weigh the probabilities.

**Base Rates and Reference Classes:**
1. Russia previously conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, bringing in around 300,000 reservists. Reports from various media outlets and statements from Russian officials have consistently suggested there is no current need for another wave. Historically, second mobilizations are uncommon unless there is a significant escalation or a strategic need, which does not appear to be the current testimony from the Kremlin or ISW.

**Recent Evidence and Inside View:**
2. Recent reports show a consistent message from the Kremlin denying the need for further mobilization. ISW's reports also indicated no current or completed full wave mobilization, except for ongoing volunteer recruitment and crypto-mobilization, which do not satisfy the resolution criteria.
3. There's mixed intelligence on whether Russia might secretly prep for, or need, another mobilization possibly disguised as a rotation, but no official confirmation from ISW or Russian authorities.

**Outside View:**
4. External commentary suggests speculation about potential mobilization following previous patterns of misinformation or changes in military strategy. However, robust official denial and no ISW acknowledgment favor a strong negative probability. 

**Causal Forces and Trend Extrapolation:**
5. The causal forces currently indicate a strategy of not mobilizing to maintain public stability and avoid the unpopularity that came with the 2022 mobilization. This aligns with statements from the Kremlin and reported ongoing recruitment by contractual means to meet manpower needs.
6. The ISW reports do not support the argument for a mobilization wave; they cite Russia's inability to conduct large-scale offensive actions without it. Advances are slow, indicating current forces are insufficient but not leading to reported mobilization.

**Evaluation of Doubts and Confidence:**
7. There is a fair amount of consistent evidence pointing towards no new mobilization wave. Nevertheless, given the strategic ambiguity employed by Russian authorities in the past, there's always residual uncertainty.
8. The balance leans towards no new wave of mobilization occurring, given repeated ISW analyses not reporting any official decrees or actions that fulfill such commitment and denials from Kremlin.

In conclusion, while there are ongoing discussions, and speculations, the most reliable source per the resolution criteria, ISW, hasn't reported a second wave of mobilization. Considering both the qualitative evidence favoring non-mobilization and understanding the weight of Russian disinformation and misinformation tactics, the probability leans heavily towards a "No" outcome by September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

Considering both the qualitative evidence favoring non-mobilization and understanding the weight of Russian disinformation and misinformation tactics, the probability leans heavily towards a "No" outcome by September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.
