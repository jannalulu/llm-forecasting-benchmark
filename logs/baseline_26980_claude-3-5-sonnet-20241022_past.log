2025-02-12 22:42:21,547 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me carefully analyze this forecasting question about Atlantic hurricane season ACE exceeding 120 by October 7, 2024.

Key considerations:
1. Today is August 8, 2024, so we're already well into the hurricane season
2. Historical context: Average ACE for Atlantic seasons is around 100
3. We're only looking at activity through October 7, not the full season
4. 2024 is an El Niño year, which typically suppresses Atlantic hurricane activity
5. Current ACE value and early season activity would be relevant

The resolution date being October 7 rather than the full season end is important, as peak hurricane season is typically mid-August through October.

The threshold of 120 ACE is above average but not extremely high. The timing gives about 2 months of peak season to accumulate energy.

Given El Niño conditions and the date constraint, reaching 120 ACE by early October would require significant activity in August-September.

Taking all factors into account:

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.75%, with 35.60% being the most likely. Probability: 35.60%.
