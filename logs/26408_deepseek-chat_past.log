To forecast whether the minimum wage in Türkiye will increase again before September 30, 2024, I will carefully analyze the available evidence, historical patterns, and recent developments. Here’s my step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
- There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. However, the Turkish government’s historical behavior and recent statements provide a strong basis for analysis.

---

### **2. Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
- **Sub-problem 1:** What is the historical frequency of mid-year minimum wage increases in Türkiye?
- **Sub-problem 2:** What are the current economic conditions and government policies regarding wage increases?
- **Sub-problem 3:** What are the political pressures and public expectations regarding wage increases?

---

### **3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
- **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, Türkiye has implemented mid-year minimum wage increases during periods of high inflation or economic instability. For example, in 2022 and 2023, the minimum wage was increased twice each year due to inflationary pressures.
- **Inside View (Current Context):** The government has repeatedly stated that there will be no mid-year increase in 2024, citing positive economic indicators and a focus on controlling inflation. However, there are conflicting reports from officials like İsa Karakaş (SGK Head), who suggested a possible increase in September.

---

### **4. Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
- **Evidence Against an Increase:**
  - The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has consistently stated that there will be no mid-year increase in 2024.
  - The government’s focus is on controlling inflation, and wage increases are seen as inflationary.
  - The AKP’s Kızılcahamam camp concluded that there will be no mid-year increase.
- **Evidence For an Increase:**
  - High inflation (75.45% in May 2024) and rising living costs have increased public pressure for a wage hike.
  - İsa Karakaş (SGK Head) suggested a possible increase in September, which has fueled expectations.
  - The minimum wage is below the poverty line, and opposition parties are advocating for an increase.

---

### **5. Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work**
- **Forces Against an Increase:**
  - Government’s commitment to austerity policies and inflation control.
  - Concerns about the fiscal impact of wage increases.
- **Forces For an Increase:**
  - Public pressure due to high inflation and declining purchasing power.
  - Political pressure from opposition parties and labor unions.

---

### **6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
- Inflation is expected to remain high, but the government is prioritizing stability over wage increases. The trend suggests no mid-year increase, but public and political pressures could force a reconsideration.

---

### **7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
- There is significant uncertainty due to conflicting statements from government officials and the high stakes of inflation control versus public welfare.

---

### **8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
- While the government’s stance is clear, the possibility of a September increase cannot be ruled out entirely due to public and political pressures.

---

### **9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
- Overreliance on government statements could lead to underestimating the likelihood of a wage increase if public pressure becomes overwhelming.
- Overreacting to speculative reports (e.g., İsa Karakaş’s statement) could lead to overestimating the likelihood.

---

### **Final Reasoning**
- The government’s consistent stance against a mid-year increase is the strongest evidence, but the possibility of a September increase due to public pressure and high inflation cannot be ignored. Balancing these factors, I assign a moderate probability to the event.

To forecast whether the minimum wage in Türkiye will increase again before September 30, 2024, I will carefully analyze the available evidence, historical trends, and recent developments. Here’s my step-by-step reasoning:

---

### 1. **Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)**
   - Historically, Türkiye has increased the minimum wage multiple times in a single year during periods of high inflation or economic instability. For example, in 2022 and 2023, the minimum wage was increased twice each year.
   - However, the government has recently signaled a shift toward austerity policies to combat inflation, which may reduce the likelihood of additional increases.
   - Base rate for mid-year minimum wage increases in Türkiye during high inflation periods: **~50%**.

---

### 2. **Recent Developments (Inside View)**
   - **Government Statements**: The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has repeatedly stated that there will be no interim increase in the minimum wage in July 2024. This is a strong signal against an increase.
   - **SGK Head’s Statement**: İsa Karakaş, head of the Social Security Institution (SGK), suggested that an increase could occur in September 2024, but this has not been confirmed by the government.
   - **Economic Context**: Inflation in Türkiye remains high (75.45% in May 2024), and the minimum wage is below the poverty line, creating pressure for an increase. However, the government is prioritizing inflation control over wage hikes.
   - **Political Pressure**: Opposition parties and labor unions are demanding an increase, but the government has not shown willingness to act on these demands.

---

### 3. **Balancing Evidence**
   - **Arguments for an Increase**:
     - High inflation and cost of living pressures.
     - Historical precedent of multiple increases in a single year.
     - Political and social pressure from labor unions and opposition parties.
   - **Arguments Against an Increase**:
     - Government’s clear statements against an interim increase.
     - Focus on austerity and inflation control.
     - Lack of official confirmation for a September increase.

---

### 4. **Adjusting the Base Rate**
   - The government’s strong stance against an interim increase reduces the likelihood significantly. However, the possibility of a September increase, as hinted by SGK Head İsa Karakaş, introduces some uncertainty.
   - Adjusting the base rate downward to account for the government’s austerity focus but leaving room for a potential September increase.

---

### 5. **Final Probability Estimate**
   - Given the conflicting signals, I assign a **30% probability** to the event occurring. This reflects the government’s reluctance but acknowledges the possibility of a last-minute adjustment due to economic or political pressures.

To forecast whether the minimum wage in Türkiye will increase again before September 30, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, weigh the evidence, and balance historical patterns with current developments.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
Historically, Türkiye has adjusted the minimum wage multiple times in a year during periods of high inflation or economic instability. For example, in 2022 and 2023, the minimum wage was increased twice each year due to inflationary pressures. This suggests a base rate of approximately 50% for multiple adjustments in a single year under similar conditions.

### Step 2: Current Economic Context
- **Inflation:** Türkiye is experiencing high inflation, with the annual rate reaching 75.45% in May 2024. High inflation typically pressures governments to increase wages to maintain purchasing power.
- **Government Stance:** The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has repeatedly stated there will be no mid-year increase in the minimum wage. However, the Social Security Institution (SGK) Head, İsa Karakaş, has suggested a potential increase in September 2024.
- **Political Pressure:** Opposition parties and labor unions are demanding an increase, citing the minimum wage falling below the poverty line. This creates political pressure for an adjustment.

### Step 3: Evidence from News Articles
- **No July Increase:** Multiple sources confirm that the government has ruled out a July 2024 increase.
- **Potential September Increase:** Several articles mention the possibility of an increase in September, with SGK Head İsa Karakaş suggesting a 4,000 TL increase. This is supported by discussions of economic relief for minimum wage earners.
- **Economic Indicators:** The government is focused on controlling inflation and has implemented austerity measures. However, the high inflation rate and public pressure may force a reconsideration.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
- **For Increase:** High inflation, political pressure, and historical precedent suggest a likelihood of an increase.
- **Against Increase:** The government's firm stance against mid-year adjustments and its focus on austerity measures reduce the likelihood.

### Step 5: Final Adjustment
Given the conflicting signals, I weigh the evidence as follows:
- Historical base rate: 50%
- Government stance against increase: -20%
- Political pressure and inflation: +30%
- SGK Head's suggestion of September increase: +10%

This results in a net probability of 70%.

### Step 6: Range and Most Likely Probability
Considering the uncertainty, I provide a range of 60% to 80%, with 70% being the most likely probability.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. However, the news articles provide a wealth of information about the current situation and potential outcomes.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Trends**: How often has the minimum wage been increased mid-year in Türkiye?
2. **Government Stance**: What is the current government's position on a mid-year increase?
3. **Economic Indicators**: What are the current inflation and economic conditions?
4. **Political Pressure**: Is there significant political or public pressure for an increase?
5. **Expert Opinions**: What do experts and officials predict?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, mid-year minimum wage increases in Türkiye have been rare, especially outside election years. The government has typically avoided mid-year increases to control inflation.
- **Inside View**: Current economic conditions, including high inflation (75.45% in May 2024) and public pressure, might push the government to consider an increase.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for No Increase**: The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has repeatedly stated there will be no mid-year increase. The government has emphasized controlling inflation and avoiding wage increases that could exacerbate it.
- **Strong Evidence for Increase**: High inflation and public discontent have led to calls for an increase. Some officials, like SGK Head İsa Karakaş, have suggested a possible increase in September.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Inflation Control**: The government is focused on reducing inflation, which would argue against a mid-year increase.
- **Public Pressure**: High inflation and rising living costs have increased public demand for a wage hike, which could pressure the government to act.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Inflation is high and expected to remain so, which increases the likelihood of public unrest and pressure for wage increases.
- The government has historically avoided mid-year increases, but the current economic conditions are more severe than in previous years.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a significant degree of uncertainty due to conflicting signals from government officials and economic pressures.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
- While the government has stated there will be no increase, the economic and political pressures are significant enough to consider the possibility.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- Over-reliance on government statements without considering public pressure could lead to underestimating the likelihood of an increase.
- Overestimating the impact of public pressure without considering the government's commitment to inflation control could lead to overestimating the likelihood.

### Final Assessment
Balancing all these factors, the most likely scenario is that the government will resist a mid-year increase to control inflation, despite public pressure. However, the possibility of an increase in September cannot be entirely ruled out due to the severity of economic conditions.

- Over-reliance on government statements without considering public pressure could lead to underestimating the likelihood of an increase.
- Overestimating the impact of public pressure without considering the government's commitment to inflation control could lead to overestimating the likelihood.

### Final Assessment
Balancing all these factors, the most likely scenario is that the government will resist a mid-year increase to control inflation, despite public pressure. However, the possibility of an increase in September cannot be entirely ruled out due to the severity of economic conditions.

**My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.**

To forecast whether the minimum wage in Türkiye will increase again before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating the principles of superforecasting and carefully weighing the evidence.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. However, the news articles provide a wealth of information about the current situation and potential outcomes.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Trends**: How often has the minimum wage been increased mid-year in Türkiye?
2. **Government Stance**: What is the current government's position on a mid-year increase?
3. **Economic Indicators**: What are the current inflation and economic conditions?
4. **Political Pressure**: Is there significant political or public pressure for an increase?
5. **Expert Opinions**: What do experts and officials predict?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, mid-year minimum wage increases in Türkiye have been rare, especially outside election years. The government has typically avoided mid-year increases to control inflation.
- **Inside View**: Current economic conditions, including high inflation (75.45% in May 2024) and public pressure, might push the government to consider an increase.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for No Increase**: The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has repeatedly stated there will be no mid-year increase. The government has emphasized controlling inflation and avoiding wage increases that could exacerbate it.
- **Strong Evidence for Increase**: High inflation and public discontent have led to calls for an increase. Some officials, like SGK Head İsa Karakaş, have suggested a possible increase in September.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Inflation Control**: The government is focused on reducing inflation, which would argue against a mid-year increase.
- **Public Pressure**: High inflation and rising living costs have increased public demand for a wage hike, which could pressure the government to act.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Inflation is high and expected to remain so, which increases the likelihood of public unrest and pressure for wage increases.
- The government has historically avoided mid-year increases, but the current economic conditions are more severe than in previous years.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a significant degree of uncertainty due to conflicting signals from government officials and economic pressures.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
- While the government has stated there will be no increase, the economic and political pressures are significant enough to consider the possibility.

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
- Over-reliance on government statements without considering public pressure could lead to underestimating the likelihood of an increase.
- Overestimating the impact of public pressure without considering the government's commitment to inflation control could lead to overestimating the likelihood.
