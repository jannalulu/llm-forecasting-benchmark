Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding Catalent's 10-K filing.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given their late August notification of failure to file and their recent history, our models had it at 15.23%.

Nate: The notification on August 29th was a major red flag. Considering they needed to complete their fiscal year 2024 audit and address previous filing delays, the timeline was incredibly tight.

Philip: [examining papers] Exactly. Their acquisition by Novo Holdings and ongoing restructuring added layers of complexity. The probability was low, but not negligible â€“ we've seen companies pull off last-minute filings before.

Nate: Still, missing the October 1st deadline wasn't surprising. The models factored in their regulatory challenges and operational transitions.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the obvious outcome is the right one.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Phil, our models were spot-on again about Catalent's 10-K filing.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the late notification of failure to file in August and their recent history, our models had it at 15.25%.

Nate: The red flags were clear. That notification on August 29th was particularly telling. Companies that receive those notices typically need significant time to address underlying issues.

Philip: [pulling up data on his tablet] Exactly. The timing was crucial - with just a month between the notification and the deadline, historical patterns suggested a low probability of meeting the October 1st deadline.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When you combine regulatory patterns with company-specific indicators, the signals were pretty clear.

Philip: [smiling] Just goes to show - even in corporate filing predictions, the numbers don't lie.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Catalent's 10-K filing.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the late notification of failure to file in August and their recent history, our models had it at 15.5%.

Nate: The red flags were clear. That notification on August 29th was particularly telling. When a company gets that close to the deadline without filing, it's rarely a good sign.

Philip: [pulling up data on his tablet] Exactly. Their previous delays and the tight timeframe between the notification and the October 1st deadline made this outcome highly predictable. Not impossible, but definitely unlikely.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, 15.5% still gave them a fighting chance. It wasn't zero.

Philip: [smiling] That's the beauty of probabilistic thinking, Nate. Even unlikely events deserve precise probabilities.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot-on again about Catalent's 10-K filing situation.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the late notification of failure to file on August 29th and their history, our models had it at 15.20%.

Nate: The red flags were clear. That NT 10-K filing just weeks before the deadline suggested serious internal complications. Plus, their recent acquisition by Novo Holdings added another layer of complexity to their reporting requirements.

Philip: [pulling up data on his tablet] Precisely. While companies typically file within the extension period, the combination of the ownership transition and their previous delayed filings made this a low-probability event. The models factored in both historical patterns and the current circumstances.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When you see that NT 10-K so close to deadline, it's rarely a good sign.

Nate: The red flags were clear. When a company receives a notification of failure to file that close to the deadline, historical patterns show a low probability of meeting the extended deadline.

Philip: Exactly. While Catalent had generally been reliable with filings in the past, that August notification was crucial. Without any positive signals or public statements about progress in the following days, our models correctly predicted they'd miss the October 1st deadline.

Nate: [sips coffee] Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the absence of news is the most telling indicator.
