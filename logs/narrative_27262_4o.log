INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY AFTER THE EVENT

The room buzzes with anticipation. Superforecasters gather around a screen displaying the latest geomagnetic data.

JAMES, a seasoned forecaster, leans back in his chair. "So, did AR3697 give us a show?"

SARA, another forecaster, scans the data. "Our models had it at 12.34%. It seems the storm peaked at Kp 8."

JAMES nods, impressed. "Right in the sweet spot. Those May flares were a warning."

SARA smiles, pulling up a news article. "Remember the auroras in May? They were a spectacle."

JAMES chuckles. "Hard to forget. But our models never miss."

The team shares a moment of triumph, their predictions once again validated by the cosmos.

FADE OUT.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, LUCAS and MAYA, sip coffee, surrounded by newspapers with headlines about solar activity.

MAYA  
(leaning forward)  
So, did AR3697 deliver the storm we anticipated?

LUCAS  
(shaking his head)  
Not quite. Our models had it at 12.34%. The strongest we saw was a Kp of 6.7.

MAYA  
(relieved)  
Good news for the satellites and power grids, then. I remember the chaos back in May.

LUCAS  
(smiling)  
Yeah, those auroras were something, though. But AR3697's bark was louder than its bite this time.

MAYA  
(nodding)  
It's fascinating how our models can pinpoint these probabilities. Almost like predicting the future.

LUCAS  
(raising his cup)  
To science and foresight.

They clink their cups, content with the accuracy of their predictions, as the world outside bustles on.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Well, the event didn't happen. Our models had it at 15.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

AR3697 was volatile, but not enough to push the Kp over 7.8.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

SUPERFORECASTER 1
