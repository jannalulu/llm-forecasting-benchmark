**Here’s How the Yankees’ World Series Run Has Vindicated George Costanza**
The New York Yankees' success in the 2024 World Series can be attributed to the innovative ideas of George Costanza, the team's former assistant to the traveling secretary. Although George was unceremoniously traded to Tyler Chicken, his legacy lives on through the breathable cotton uniforms worn by players like Aaron Judge and Juan Soto. As the team prepares to take on the Los Angeles Dodgers, it's time for the Yankees to apologize to George and consider engravings a championship ring in his honor. As the article states, 'baseball is a game that's won on the margins through careful planning and crafty decision making,' and George's contributions to the team's success cannot be overstated. The article also notes that, 'if the Yankees pull out a series win, they'd better at least consider engraving a championship ring for the most impactful assistant to the traveling secretary in baseball history — especially if they do it in fewer than six games this time.'

With both teams boasting strong lineups and pitching staffs, the total games market presents a fascinating opportunity for bettors.

The Dodgers' starting rotation is a concern, with pitchers Walker Buehler and Jack Flaherty having ERAs north of 6.00 this postseason.

**NLCS Game 6: New York Mets head into offseason of uncertainty as 2024 thrill ride comes to an end: 'It doesn't feel real'**
The New York Mets' 2024 season came to an end with a 10-5 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 6 of the NLCS. The team's 'OMG' sign, a symbol of their season, remained untouched in the dugout as the players retreated to the clubhouse. The Mets will be remembered as a thrill ride, but their demise was strikingly simple, with starter Sean Manaea allowing five Dodgers to score and the bullpen leaking runs. The team's offense threatened a comeback but couldn't land the counterpunch needed. The Dodgers will play the New York Yankees in the World Series, while the Mets head into an offseason of uncertainty. Despite the impending gloom of change, the franchise is in a healthy place, with a cornerstone superstar in Francisco Lindor and a solid farm system. President of baseball operations David Stearns has a fascinating winter ahead, with many players set to hit the open market, including Pete Alonso and Jose Iglesias.
