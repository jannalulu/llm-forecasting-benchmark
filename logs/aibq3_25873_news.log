**US Economy on the Brink of Collapse: Sharp Rise in Unemployment Signals Impending Crisis**
The US economy is on the brink of collapse: a sharp rise in unemployment signals an impending crisis. According to new data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate U-3 rose to 4.1% in June 2024, exceeding the predicted level by 0.1%. This increase triggers the Sahm rule, a real-time indicator of recession, indicating that the US economy is in a recession or close to one. Surveys predicted that the U-3 rate would remain at 4.0% in June, unchanged from May 2024. However, the 0.1% increase has significant consequences for the economy as a whole. One possible effect of this signal is the growth of the workforce: if the workforce grows rapidly, but the economy does not create enough jobs, the unemployment rate may rise and trigger the Sahm rule, even if overall employment is growing. The rise in primary applications for benefits over the past few weeks and nine consecutive increases in continuing applications confirm the assumption that the Sahm rule will be triggered in June 2024, according to ZeroHedge. Despite the need for more data to confirm the Sahm rule's findings, the impact of accelerating inflation, high interest rates, and pandemic-related commercial suppression policies is likely to hit American producers and consumers.

**Unemployment Rate Rises, Sahm Rule Signals Recession Risk**
The unemployment rate is increasing, which could be a sign of economic deterioration. The Sahm Rule, which states that when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by at least 0.5 percentage points from its lowest point in the past 12 months, indicates the start of a recession. According to the latest unemployment figures, the gap between the two has widened to 0.43 in June from 0.37 in May, the highest level since March 2021. Claudia Sahm, the creator of the rule, warns that even low unemployment rates can lead to a vicious cycle that ultimately leads to a recession. She also believes that the pandemic has caused so many disruptions in the economy and labor market that indicators like the Sahm Rule may not be as accurate at this time. Sahm also criticized the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates, saying it could lead to a recession. On the other hand, Wall Street has a more optimistic view of the economy, citing the predictions of recession last year that turned out to be wrong, as well as the growth of artificial intelligence that is helping to drive investment and profit growth.

**June U-3 Jobless Rate Triggers Sahm Rule: Recession Ahead?**
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released data showing a 4.1% unemployment rate in June 2024, exceeding forecasted rates. This triggers the Sahm Rule, a recession indicator, suggesting the US economy is in or nearing a recession. The rule is based on changes in the total unemployment rate, and with the current rate meeting the criterion, it indicates a recession is underway. The rise in initial claims and continuing claims supports this indication. Equity futures were flat, while Treasuries rallied, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has hinted at an accommodative policy stance if unexpected weakness is seen. Historically, an increase in unemployment rates and recession have led to policy adjustments to stimulate growth and mitigate job losses.

**US Close To Recession Warning As June Jobs Report Shows Rising Unemployment**
The United States is close to breaching the Sahm Rule, a heuristic measure used by the Federal Reserve to determine whether the economy is in a recession. The Sahm Recession Indicator signals the start of a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more relative to the minimum of the three-month averages from the previous 12 months. The indicator reached 0.43% in June, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This increase in the indicator is a warning sign for the U.S. economy, which remains in murky economic waters.

**I'm Issuing a MAJOR Warning on the Coming Recession Signals**
Graham Summers, Chief Market Strategist, warns that the Sahm Rule, an indicator that has accurately predicted every recession since the 1960s, is likely to trigger a recession warning in the coming weeks. However, he believes that this warning will be a false positive due to the significant increase in net immigration in 2023, which will lead to a rapid jump in the unemployment rate. This will be the eighth false positive for a recession indicator during this business cycle. Summers advises investors to focus on making money by riding bull markets and side-stepping bear markets, rather than panicking about recession signals.

**Stocks will struggle and a recession is on the table if the Fed fails to cut rates by September, Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel says**
Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel warns that the rally in stocks is at risk and a recession is possible if the Federal Reserve fails to cut interest rates by September. Siegel points to slowing GDP growth, job market struggles, and other recession indicators, including the Sahm Rule, which signals a downturn when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points above its cycle low. He suggests that Fed Chairman Powell should consider cutting rates in September and November to avoid a recession and inflation under control. Forecasters are divided on the likelihood of a recession, but a no-rate-cut scenario could put a recession on the table, Siegel warns.

**Mag. 7 rotation, earnings, Sahm Rule: Market Takeaways**
The Magnificent Seven, a group of tech stocks, is experiencing a rotation, with Apple closing higher while Nvidia and Amazon slump. S&P 500 earnings expectations are at an all-time high, and the 'Sahm Rule', a recession indicator, could be triggered. Yahoo Finance Senior Markets Reporter Jared Blikre discusses the latest market trends and what they could mean for markets moving forward. The rotation is not limited to tech, with financials and industrials also showing signs of improvement. Earnings expectations are at a record high, with 80% of S&P 500 components experiencing earnings revisions to the upside over the last three months. The Sahm Rule, which tracks the three-month moving average of the jobless rate, could be triggered if unemployment rises to 4.2% in the next month or two, which could lead to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September.

**S&P 500 Rises As Bad News Shifts Investor Focus To Q3 2024**
The S&P 500 (SPX) rose nearly 2% to a new record high of 5,567.19, despite bad economic news, including rising unemployment numbers and slowing real GDP growth. The bad news increased the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting short-term interest rates in 2024-Q3, shifting investor focus from 2024-Q4. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool forecasts the Fed will hold the Federal Funds Rate steady until September 2024, then start a series of 0.25% rate cuts. The change in investor focus accounts for the reaction of stock prices, which are expected to rise if expectations for dividend growth in 2024-Q3 are more positive than expected. Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist, is calling for the Fed to start cutting rates sooner rather than later, warning of a recession risk if they don't.

**US Unemployment Rate Rises to 4.1%, Raising Recession Fears**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, a potential indicator of recession. Although unemployment is still historically low, its increase may signal a deterioration in economic conditions. The 'Sahm Rule' suggests that when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by at least 0.5 percentage points from the low reached in the previous 12 months, a recession has begun. According to the latest data, the gap between the two rates has risen to 0.43 in June, the highest level since March 2021. Claudia Sahm, the creator of the rule, believes that even small increases in unemployment can trigger a cycle of negative feedback that leads to recession. She argues that the pandemic has caused so many disruptions in the economy and labor market that traditional indicators like the Sahm Rule may not be as accurate at this time. Sahm has also criticized the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates, saying that it risks pushing the economy into recession. The Fed is expected to meet again at the end of the month and may consider cutting rates in September. Meanwhile, Wall Street remains optimistic about the economy, citing the failure of previous recession predictions and the growth of artificial intelligence, which is driving an influx of investments and profits.

**Citi Predicts Fed to Cut Rates by 200 Basis Points Amid Economic Slowdown**
Citi Research analysts predict the Federal Reserve will implement eight consecutive 25 basis point rate cuts starting in September, in response to signs of economic slowdown. The expected reductions would lower the benchmark rate by 200 basis points by July 2025. Citi analysts believe the economy has cooled from its 'heady' pace in 2023, with inflation resuming decelerating after some unexpected stickiness. They also warn of economic vulnerabilities, predicting potential activation of the Sahm Rule recession indicator. Citi's chief U.S. economist Andrew Hollenhorst has maintained a dimmer perspective on the economy this year, forecasting a harsh landing and insufficient rate cuts to avert it.

**The Fed could slash rates by 200 points over 8 straight meetings as the economy heads for a sharper downtrend, Citi says**
Citi Research predicts that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% to 3.25%-3.5%, over the next 8 months, starting in September 2024 and extending to July 2025. This is due to signs of a slowing economy, including a decline in the Institute for Supply Management's service-sector gauge and an increase in unemployment to 4.1%. Citi's chief U.S. economist, Andrew Hollenhorst, believes that the Fed will cut rates at each of the subsequent 7 meetings, citing a 'softening of activity' and 'dovish comments' from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Hollenhorst also notes that the 'Sahm Rule' recession indicator could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.

**US Unemployment Rate Rises, Recession Fears Grow**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, a significant increase from 4% in the previous month, which may indicate the start of a recession. According to Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, even low unemployment rates can lead to a recession. She explained that when workers lose their jobs, they reduce their spending, and when companies lose customers, they need fewer workers, creating a vicious cycle. However, she also noted that the pandemic may have caused significant disruptions in the economy and labor market, making traditional indicators like Sahm's rule less accurate. The Federal Reserve is expected to continue its pause on interest rate cuts, but there is a growing possibility of a rate cut in September. Sahm emphasized the need for policymakers to focus on the labor market's dynamics rather than just unemployment rates. On the other hand, Wall Street has a more optimistic view of the economy, citing the widespread recession expectations that proved wrong last year and the surge in artificial intelligence that is driving investment and profit growth.

The Sahm Rule, created by economist Claudia Sahm, suggests that a recession has started when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate rises by at least a half-percentage point from its low during the previous 12 months. According to the latest unemployment figures, the gap between the two has expanded to 0.43 in June from 0.37 in May, the highest level since March 2021. Sahm warns that even from low levels, a rising unemployment rate can set off a negative feedback loop that leads to a recession. She also expressed concerns about the Federal Reserve's decision to hold off on rate cuts, saying it risks sending the economy into a recession. However, some on Wall Street have a more sanguine view of the economy, citing last year's widespread recession predictions that proved wrong and the AI boom that's helping to fuel a wave of investment and earnings growth.

**Further rise in jobless rate may prompt BNP Paribas to call for two rate cuts in 2024**
The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, marking its third consecutive monthly increase. BNP Paribas, a financial institution, believes that another increase in the jobless rate could lead to a change in its rate-cut projection for 2024. The firm's economists, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Timothy High, stated that if the unemployment rate rises to 4.2% in the July jobs report, it could trigger the Sahm Rule, which indicates the US is in the early stages of a recession. The Fed has indicated that it may cut rates once this year, and traders are seeing a 71% probability of a rate cut in September. The June jobs report also showed a rise in nonfarm payrolls, but BNP Paribas believes that signs of labor-market rebalancing suggest that restrictive policy is taking a toll on economic growth.

**June jobs report raises pressure on Fed for September rate cut**
The June jobs report has increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September. The report showed job gains above 200,000, but the unemployment rate rose to its highest level since November 2021 and wage growth slowed down. Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro, believes the Fed should start cutting rates in September, citing cooling economic conditions. The Fed's own forecasts suggest officials expect to cut rates once in 2024, but some officials forecast two cuts. The recent labor market data may sway more officials to support two rate cuts. The unemployment rate has risen 0.36% from its 12-month low, which could trigger the Sahm Rule, a recession indicator. The Fed's July meeting will be crucial in setting the stage for a potential rate cut in September.

**Upcoming US job report expected to reveal slowdown**
Economists expect the upcoming US job report to show a slowdown in job growth, with a forecast of 200,000 new jobs added in June, down from 272,000 in May. The report, to be released on Friday, is expected to show signs of a broader economic weakness. Nick Bunker, head of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, notes that the unemployment rate has been slowly trending up, and the Sahm Rule, which indicates a recession, may be triggered if the rate surpasses its 12-month low by half a percentage point. The report will also focus on other key metrics, including hours worked and average hourly earnings, which are expected to show a 0.3% monthly gain and a 3.9% annual increase, the first time below 4% since June 2021.

The upcoming nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show 200,000 jobs created and a steady 4% unemployment rate. However, a minor deviation from the consensus could be significant. The unemployment rate has risen from 3.7% to 4% this year, despite solid job gains. The nonfarm payrolls data and unemployment rate come from separate government surveys, which can sometimes diverge. The unemployment rate has been rising, and if it continues to do so, it could trigger the Sahm Rule, a recession indicator. The three-month moving average of the unemployment rate is currently 0.37% above its low point over the previous year, and if it crosses the 0.5% threshold, it could signal a recession.

**Lower inflation, no recession set stocks up for a summer stunner**
The article discusses the current economic situation and the predictions of a recession by some economists, known as 'hard-landers'. The author argues that these predictions have been wrong so far, and that the US economy is actually growing and the labor market remains robust. The article highlights several reasons why the hard-landers' predictions have been incorrect, including the reliance on outdated indicators, the shift from an industrial to a digital economy, and the containment of the recent financial crisis. The author also criticizes the Sahm Rule, a recession model developed by former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, and suggests that it is not a reliable indicator of a recession. The article concludes that the economy will continue to grow and moderate inflation, and that the 'Roaring 2020s' are alive and well.

**Inflation is slowing and we've dodged a recession. Stocks are set for a summer stunner.**
The article discusses the recent economic trends and argues that the predictions of a recession by some economists have been wrong. The author, Ed Yardeni, and his team at Yardeni Research, believe that the US economy is still growing and that inflation will continue to moderate. They point out that the Leading Economic Index (LEI) has been declining, but the Index of Coincident Economic indicators (CEI) has been rising, indicating that the economy is still strong. The article also discusses the inverted yield curve, which has been a predictor of recession in the past, but notes that it is becoming less relevant in the current economy. Additionally, the article criticizes the Sahm Rule, a recession model developed by former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, for being too simplistic and ignoring structural shifts in the economy. The authors conclude that the economy will continue to grow and that the 'Roaring 2020s' are alive and well.

**I'm Issuing a MAJOR Warning on the Coming Recession Signals**
Graham Summers, Chief Market Strategist, warns that the Sahm Rule, an indicator that has accurately predicted every recession since the 1960s, is likely to trigger a recession warning in the coming weeks. However, he believes that this warning will be a false positive due to the significant increase in net immigration in 2023, which will lead to a rapid jump in the unemployment rate. This will be the eighth false positive for a recession indicator during this business cycle. Summers advises investors to focus on making money by riding bull markets and side-stepping bear markets, rather than panicking about recession signals.

**Sahm Rule Indicates High Risk of Recession if Fed Doesn't Cut Rates**
Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist, warns that the Federal Reserve's reluctance to lower interest rates is a high-risk bet that could lead to a recession. She created the 'Sahm rule', an indicator of recession, which is now close to its threshold. The rule is based on the unemployment rate and if it exceeds 5% above its 12-month low, it's a sign of a recession. The current unemployment rate has exceeded 4% for the first time since 2022, reaching 37, the highest level since the Covid era. Sahm believes the Fed should start a series of rate cuts to avoid a more severe recession. Other economists, such as Mohamed El-Erian, also call for immediate rate cuts to avoid a drastic tightening cycle. However, markets expect only one rate cut in 2024. The Sahm rule could trigger a slowdown if the Fed doesn't lower its rates.

**The creator of a famed recession indicator says the Fed is 'playing with fire' by not cutting rates now**
Economist Claudia Sahm, creator of the Sahm Rule, a labor-tracking recession gauge, believes the Federal Reserve should start cutting interest rates now to avoid a contraction. The Sahm Rule is nearing its recessionary threshold, and Sahm thinks the Fed is 'playing with fire' by not cutting rates. She suggests a gradual cutting cycle to take the economy off a path that could require more severe action if not addressed. Others, such as top economist Mohamed El-Erian, have also called for more immediate cutting, warning that a delayed cut could require a more drastic easing cycle. Markets expect at least two rate cuts starting in September.

**US Stocks Close Higher Despite AI Trade Fatigue**
US stocks closed the week higher despite signs of exhaustion in the artificial intelligence trade. The Dow Jones led the way with a 1.5% gain, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 rose around 0.5%. Some economists are calling for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in July as the risk of recession increases. US stocks closed mixed on Friday but ended the week higher despite signs of difficulties in the AI trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the market this week, rising almost 2%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 ended the week with a 1% gain. The meteoric rise of Nvidia's shares took a breather on Thursday and Friday, with the stock falling around 10% from its intraday high of $140.76. Other hot AI stocks like Broadcom, Dell, and Super Micro Computer also fell 1-3% in Friday's trading session. Investors are closely watching new economic data, with talk of a possible interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in July following an increase in weekly jobless claims. Currently, the probability of a rate cut in July is only 10%, according to the CME FedWatch tool, although one economist sees the chances of a cut at the July meeting at around 60%. A Fed move would be to ensure that a recession does not occur as inflation continues to show a steady decline. Economist Claudia Sahm told CNBC on Friday that the Fed was 'playing with fire' by keeping interest rates high for too long. 'My base scenario is no recession,' Sahm said. 'But it's a real risk, and I don't understand why the Fed is increasing that risk. I'm not sure what they're waiting for.'

**The unemployment rate hit 4% for the first time in 2 years. Here's why economists say you shouldn't worry**
The unemployment rate has reached 4.0% for the first time in 2 years, but economists are not concerned. The rate is still historically low, and the number of jobs and labor force are growing. The increase is attributed to people entering and reentering the workforce, particularly those between 20 and 24 years old. Job growth is also a positive sign, with nonfarm payrolls growing by 272,000 in May. Additionally, labor force participation among prime-age workers is high, at 83.6%. Economists are monitoring the unemployment rate's rise, but are not yet concerned about a recession. The Sahm Rule, which compares the average unemployment rate to the lowest reported rate in the past year, is currently at 0.37, indicating that the unemployment rate would need to stay at 4% or higher for a couple of reports to signal a recession.

**Recession Warnings Piling Up: Fed Under Pressure**
The market is speculating about the risk of a recession in the US. While short-term economic prospects are still being debated, some indicators suggest a slowdown in growth, which could lead to economic problems by the second half of 2025. On the other hand, there are also signs pointing to a continuation of economic expansion. The Economic Trend Index (ETI) and the Economic Momentum Index (EMI) have been declining for over a year, indicating a worsening macro trend. According to a econometric method, both indices are expected to continue falling in July, which could mean a recession starting in August. However, another method predicts a lower risk of recession, with the Composite Recession Probability Index (CRPI) currently estimating a 5% chance of a recession. The recent increase in CRPI could be an early warning sign. Economists are still divided on whether the risk of recession can be averted. Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, says, 'My assumption is not of an impending recession, but it is a real risk, and I don't understand why the Fed is still supporting this risk. I don't know what they're waiting for. The worst that could happen would be that the Fed causes an unnecessary recession.'

The risk of recession in the US is increasing, with some indicators showing decelerating growth that could lead to trouble in the second half of 2024 or early 2025. The Economic Trend Index (ETI) and Economic Momentum Index (EMI) have peaked and are expected to drop to just above their tipping points in July, suggesting recessionary conditions could start as early as August. However, another methodology, the Composite Recession Probability Index (CRPI), estimates a low 5% probability of recession.

The risk of recession in the US is increasing, with some indicators showing a slowdown in economic growth that could lead to problems in the second half of the year and early 2025. While there are still arguments for continued economic expansion, a set of multifactor indices show a marked deterioration in the macro trend. The Economic Trend Index (ETI) and the Economic Momentum Index (EMI) have been declining for over a year, and estimates suggest that the decline will continue. According to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, 'My starting point is not recession, but it's a real risk, and I don't understand why the Fed is pushing that risk.

**US Economy Shows Signs of Slowing Down, Recessions Looming**
The US economy is showing signs of slowing down, with some indicators suggesting a recession may be on the horizon. The Economic Trend Index (ETI) and Economic Momentum Index (EMI) have been declining for over a year, and while they are still above the threshold for recession, they have reached their peak. According to a statistical model, both indices are expected to drop below the threshold by July, which could indicate the start of a recession as early as August. However, another methodology, the Composite Recession Probability Index (CRPI), estimates a low 5% chance of a recession. But a recent surge in the CRPI could be a warning sign. If the CRPI increases by more than 10% in the coming days and weeks, combined with the recent weakness in ETI and EMI, it would be a concerning sign for the second half of 2024. Economists are debating whether the risk of recession can be avoided, with some arguing that reducing interest rates could mitigate the risk, but time is running out, according to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors. 'My reference point is not recession,' she says. 'But it's a real risk and I don't understand why the Fed is pushing this risk. I don't know what they're waiting for.

**Fed's Risk-Taking: A Warning Sign of Recession?**
Claudia Sahm, an economist and economic theory expert, warned that the Federal Reserve is taking a risk by not lowering interest rates now. The Fed has reduced its forecast for rate cuts this year, which has raised concerns about the economy's growth. Sahm stated that if the unemployment rate rises to 4% or more, it will trigger the 'Sahm Rule', which indicates a recession. She also expressed surprise at the Fed's decision to take this risk and asked what they are waiting for to take action. According to Sahm, the worst-case scenario is a recession without a clear cause. She emphasized that the Fed is playing with fire and should pay attention to the changing labor market dynamics, which could lead to a worse outcome. Sahm believes that the Fed should take action to prevent a recession and that the current situation is a warning sign.

Sahm believes the Fed is 'playing with fire' and should be monitoring the labor market closely.

According to Sahm, when the unemployment rate's three-month average is half a percentage point higher than its 12-month low, the economy is in recession. The Sahm Rule has been correct for every recession since 1948. Sahm believes that the Fed is 'playing with fire' by not taking action, and that the worst possible outcome is an unnecessary recession. She suggests that the Fed should be paying attention to the rate of change in the labor market as a potential harbinger of danger ahead.

**Good news on production is overshadowed by the yellow caution flag of flagging real retail sales**
The US economy saw mixed signals in two recent data releases. Industrial production and manufacturing production increased by 0.9% in May, with both still up 0.5% compared to last month. However, both are still down from their 2022 peaks. On the other hand, retail sales were disappointing, only increasing by 0.1% in both nominal and real terms, and are down 0.95% year-over-year. This is a concern, as negative year-over-year retail sales have historically been a sign of a recession. The author suggests that real retail sales may be a better indicator of employment in the months ahead, and that the economy may be headed for weaker employment reports.

**Conflicting Jobs Data Creates Challenges for the Fed**
The US jobs market is showing conflicting signals, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reporting robust hiring in May, but also an increase in the unemployment rate and a decline in the labor participation rate. The Nonfarm payroll report showed 272,000 new positions added, while the Household survey reported a net loss of 408,000 jobs. The Sahm rule, which suggests that a recession follows when the three-month moving average unemployment rate rises by 0.5% or more from the previous low, is also being triggered. The article argues that the strong Nonfarm number is overstated and that the Household report is more accurate. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the employment market due to its relationship to wage growth, which historically filters into price pressures. The conflicting signals given off by the BLS reports add to the challenge for the Fed in achieving a soft landing after a rate hiking cycle. Wage growth remains high, with average hourly earnings for all employees in the private sector growing by 0.4% in May and 4.1% year over year.

**This spot-on recession indicator is flashing red**
Jack Schannep, former editor of TheDowTheory.com, predicts that a recession is underway, citing his 'Schannep Recession Indicator' (SRI), which is based on the three-month moving average of the US unemployment rate. The SRI has a track record of accurately predicting recessions, with only one false signal in 1946-2024. The latest signal was triggered on June 7, 2024, with the report of May's unemployment rate of 4.0%. The SRI compares the three-month moving average to its prior cyclical low, whereas the Sahm Rule, introduced by Claudia Sahm, compares it to the trailing 12-month low. The Sahm Rule has not indicated a recession is imminent or underway. The SRI has a shorter lag time than the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which often takes months or even years to declare a recession. Mark Hulbert, a regular contributor to MarketWatch, notes that even if an indicator predicts a recession, it is not a guarantee.

**Why the Situation is Quite Encouraging for Stocks**
Savita Subramanian, from Bank of America Corp., believes the economy is in good shape, which will continue to be favorable for US stocks. Despite some softening data, most economic indicators are normalizing from unsustainable highs, rather than indicating a slowdown. Subramanian believes the probability of recession or stagflation is less than 10%. She says that things are actually quite encouraging, adding that many investors are too focused on negative aspects due to past 'catastrophic' events like the COVID-19 pandemic and global financial crisis. The majority of the time, we have something like Goldilocks, she says. That's the opinion we defend until things start to fall off a cliff. US stock markets continued to rise on Wednesday after the latest consumer price index report showed a smaller-than-expected increase in May, which reinforces bets that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates this year.

**CPI/Fed Meeting Preview**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Federal Reserve's June policy meeting are set to take place, which could impact the stock market's direction for the next several weeks. The CPI is expected to show a median forecast of two rate cuts, while the Fed's Dot Plot will also be updated. The May jobs report showed a gain of 272,000 jobs, but the household survey showed a loss of 408,000 jobs, indicating a weakening labor market. The unemployment rate has risen to 4%, above its 12-month moving average, which is a warning sign. The Sahm Rule, a recession indicator, is also showing a trend upwards. The 10-year Treasury yield has jumped to 4.45%, but legendary investor Louis Navellier believes that the 'carry trade' could drive Treasury yields lower and encourage the Fed to cut rates sooner.

**US Job Market Surprises Again with Stronger-than-Expected Job Creation**
The US labor market has surprised again with a stronger-than-expected job creation, with 272,000 non-agricultural jobs added in May, exceeding the consensus forecast of 190,000. This trend is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. The good job market performance suggests that the Fed can maintain high interest rates without harming Americans, unlike the European Central Bank, which has started to lower its rates. The job gains were mainly in the healthcare, administration, leisure, and hospitality sectors, while extraction, construction, industry, retail, transportation, information, and finance remained stable. Despite the job growth, the unemployment rate continued to rise gradually, reaching 4% for the first time in two years and one quarter. The unemployment rate varies by race, with a 0.5% increase for Blacks to 6.1%, while remaining unchanged for Whites at 3.5%. The economist Claudia Sahm's rule suggests that a 0.5% increase in unemployment over 12 months can trigger a recession. Morgan Stanley economists predict three interest rate cuts starting in September, citing the rising unemployment rate as a sign of further easing. However, behind the job growth, the US economy is less robust, with individual debt defaults increasing and consumer spending slowing down, leading to a downward revision of GDP growth to 1.3% in the first quarter.

**BofA: NFP Report Must Be in 'Goldilocks Zone' for Market to Rebound**
Bank of America (BofA) expects the upcoming Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report to be within the 'Goldilocks zone' of 125,000 to 175,000 new jobs added in May. If the report meets this expectation, the stock market is likely to rebound. BofA believes that if the report is better than expected, it will increase the likelihood of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, if the report is worse than expected, it could lead to a decline in stock prices. The bank estimates that job growth below 125,000 could increase the risk of triggering the Sahm rule, which suggests a recession is imminent when the unemployment rate increases by 50 basis points. BofA also expects a better-than-expected report to have a positive impact on the market, indicating stronger economic growth.

**Will the recession risk remain low?**
The US economic indicators suggest that the risk of recession is still low. This is in contrast to the pessimistic views in some circles. Although there are warning signs, the numbers do not indicate that problems will arise. The assessment is based on a series of own indicators presented in the weekly updates of the US Business Cycle Risk Report, a sister publication of CapitalSpectator.com. The macro trend has peaked at the beginning of the year and is now slowing down, but the current value for April remains slightly positive. The probability of one or both of the indicators falling below their respective tipping points, which indicate a recession, is increasing. An econometric method is used to forecast the two indicators until June. The outlook is mixed. The Economic Trend Index (ETI) is still declining, but remains above the threshold of 50%. On the other hand, the Economic Momentum Index (EMI) has risen recently and is expected to remain slightly positive until next month. The labor market is considered a potential negative contributor to economic development. The labor market index, an aggregate of four indicators, continued its flirtation with negative numbers in April and was slightly negative. A second month with a value below zero would be a warning signal that the macroeconomic dynamics are deteriorating rather than stabilizing. It is also worth noting that real retail sales and industrial production in April fell below last year's levels. A continuation of this negative trend in May would increase the potential for the economy to slip into recession. Despite these concerns, it is important not to focus too much on a handful of indicators. Ultimately, it is the overall trend that matters. A robust econometric method with a good track record is used to forecast all the above-mentioned indicators and predict the ETI and EMI. The results suggest that the expansion in the US will continue until June.

**Why economist forecasts of a U.S. recession were so wrong**
Despite expectations of a recession due to the Federal Reserve's 5.25 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate between March 2022 and July 2023, the US did not enter a recession. Many indicators, such as the yield curve spread and the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, suggested a recession was imminent, but the economy continued to grow. The growth rate of real M2, a measure of money supply, turned negative in May 2022, but remained so only until March.

**Warning: This Recession Signal Can't Be Ignored**
Analysts at BCA Research have identified a signal for an impending recession in the US, based on historical patterns of unemployment rates. The 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate has risen from 3.5% in 2023 to 3.87%, indicating a concerning trend. The recent increase in April from 3.8% to 3.9% has triggered the recession signal, which BCA considers a criterion for devaluing stocks. The report also notes that small and medium-sized businesses, which make up most US jobs, have reported declining hiring intentions for the next three months, which could further drive up the unemployment rate. Additionally, the results suggest that the slowdown on the labor market could lead to slower income growth, shrinking savings, and reduced consumer credit availability, which could impact consumer spending. Furthermore, the analysts point to several sections of the yield curve that are currently declining, as well as a decline in the US leading indicator compared to last year. Another indicator, referred to as the 'Mel Rule' by BCA, which is based on the unemployment rates of individual US states, also suggests potential economic problems. 'We do not believe that there will be no crashes in the US economy and expect that a continuation of the slowdown in labor demand will lead to a slowdown in income growth. At the same time, savings will decline and consumer credit availability will become more restrictive, which will slow down consumption growth,' the analysts said.

The article discusses the current state of the US consumer, who is showing signs of fatigue and reduced spending due to inflation and high prices. Despite this, the author argues that this could be bullish for the stock market, as companies may be forced to slash prices, leading to a collapse in inflation and a subsequent stock market rally. The article also mentions other indicators, such as a recession indicator triggered by Piper Sandler, which suggests a welcome slowdown in the US economy, and the Sahm Rule, which is climbing towards a recession-triggering level.

**The Sahm Rule Recession Indicator Definition and How It's Calculated**
The Sahm Rule is a recession indicator created by macroeconomist Claudia Sahm, which signals the early stages of a recession when the three-month moving average unemployment rate is half a percentage point or more above the lowest three-month moving average unemployment rate over the previous 12 months. The rule has been widely recognized for its accuracy and simplicity, and has never been triggered outside of a recession since the 1970s. The unemployment rate is one of the main economic indicators used to measure the health of the economy, and the Sahm Rule inputs the rate into a simple formula to determine whether the U.S. is headed into a recession.
