Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Key Question Components:
- Date: October 1, 2024
- Location: Kursk Oblast exclusively
- Depth requirement: at least 5 miles into Russian territory
- Current date: August 14, 2024

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian forces have advanced 30-35km into Kursk Oblast
- ISW confirms Ukrainian presence in multiple settlements within Kursk
- Control of Sudzha (10km from border) is contested but partially held
- Ukraine holds approximately 800-1000 km² of territory in Kursk region

3. Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- Ukraine has demonstrated capability to penetrate Russian defenses
- Current positions are well beyond 5-mile requirement
- Ukraine has committed significant forces (thousands of troops)
- Ukrainian forces are fortifying positions and digging trenches
- Strategic importance of Kursk's gas infrastructure

4. Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
- Russia is building new defensive lines
- Russia has evacuated 76,000+ civilians, suggesting preparation for counteroffensive
- Time until October 1 allows for Russian response
- Ukrainian forces may face supply/logistics challenges
- Uncertain whether Ukraine intends long-term occupation

5. Key Considerations:
- Ukraine has maintained presence for over a week despite Russian counterattacks
- Russian response has been relatively ineffective so far
- Ukraine appears to have strategic reasons for maintaining presence
- Weather conditions will remain favorable through October
- No signs of immediate Ukrainian withdrawal

6. Risk Analysis:
The main risks to Ukraine maintaining position are:
- Russian mobilization of significant counterforce
- Supply line vulnerabilities
- Potential strategic choice to withdraw

However, given current fortification efforts and strategic importance, complete withdrawal seems unlikely unless forced.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 85.40%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Question Components:
- Date: October 1, 2024
- Territory: Kursk Oblast only (no other oblasts)
- Depth: At least 5 miles into Russian territory

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian forces have advanced 30-35km into Kursk Oblast
- Reports indicate control of multiple settlements and strategic points
- ISW confirms Ukrainian presence deep in Kursk territory
- Russia is building defensive lines ~60km from border

3. Positive Factors for Maintaining Position:
- Ukraine has shown ability to hold territory for extended periods (since August 6)
- Significant forces committed (thousands of troops)
- Strategic importance of captured gas infrastructure
- Ukrainian forces have penetrated multiple Russian defense lines
- Russia building fallback defensive positions suggests expectation of sustained presence

4. Negative Factors:
- Russia likely to mount stronger counteroffensives
- Holding territory requires significant resources
- Winter conditions may affect operations
- Ukraine may choose to withdraw for strategic reasons
- Historical precedent suggests cross-border holdings are temporary

5. Time Factor:
- Need to hold position for ~6 more weeks
- Current offensive has already lasted 8+ days
- Russia has not mounted effective counteroffensive yet
- Ukrainian forces appear to be fortifying positions

6. Key Uncertainties:
- Russian response capabilities
- Ukrainian strategic objectives
- Weather conditions
- International support levels
- Resource sustainability

7. Balance of Evidence:
- Strong evidence of current control
- Demonstrated ability to maintain position
- Strategic value suggests intent to hold
- But significant risks and uncertainties remain

Weighing these factors, there's a strong possibility of maintaining at least some presence 5+ miles into Kursk Oblast, but also significant risks of withdrawal or defeat.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.80%, with 65.50% being the most likely. Probability: 65.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Understanding the question: Will Ukraine ONLY hold territory in Kursk Oblast (and not in other Russian oblasts) that extends at least 5 miles into Russia on October 1, 2024?

2. Current situation (as of August 14, 2024):
- Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian forces have advanced 25-35km into Kursk Oblast
- They control around 800-1000 km² of territory
- Main areas of control include Sudzha and surrounding settlements
- No confirmed major advances into other Russian oblasts

3. Key factors favoring territorial control in Kursk ONLY:
- Ukraine has demonstrated ability to hold territory for over a week
- Significant resources committed (thousands of troops)
- Strategic importance of Kursk (gas infrastructure, logistics)
- Russian defenses shown to be relatively weak in this area
- No major offensives in other Russian oblasts

4. Factors against:
- Russia building new defensive lines 60km from border
- Russian forces being redeployed to area
- Uncertainty about Ukraine's long-term objectives
- Limited Western support for cross-border operations
- Winter conditions could impact operations
- Ukraine may not have resources to hold territory

5. Timing considerations:
- 47 days until resolution date
- Winter approaching could affect operations
- Russian counter-offensive capabilities may diminish in 1.5-2 months (per Ukrainian intelligence)

Given that Ukraine has already established control beyond 5 miles in Kursk Oblast and appears focused there rather than other oblasts, but considering the challenges of maintaining such positions through autumn/winter and potential Russian counteroffensives, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 55.80%, with 45.50% being the most likely. Probability: 45.50%.

Let me analyze this question step by step:

1. Current Situation Analysis:
- Multiple sources confirm Ukrainian forces have advanced into Kursk Oblast in August 2024
- ISW reports confirm advances of 30-35km into Kursk Oblast
- Ukrainian forces have captured several settlements and control significant territory
- Reports indicate this is a sustained offensive, not just a raid

2. Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- Ukraine has demonstrated ability to hold territory in Kursk for over a week
- Ukrainian forces are fortifying positions and building defensive lines
- Scale of operation (thousands of troops) suggests serious commitment
- Russia is building defensive lines 60km from border, indicating expectation of sustained Ukrainian presence

3. Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
- Still 6+ weeks until October 1st resolution date
- Russia may launch major counteroffensive to reclaim territory
- Ukraine may voluntarily withdraw if losses become too high
- Territory control could shift multiple times before October 1st

4. Additional Considerations:
- Question requires only Kursk Oblast (not other regions)
- Must maintain 5+ mile depth into Russian territory
- Current depth (30-35km) provides buffer against minor territorial losses

5. Trend Analysis:
- Ukraine has steadily expanded control since August 6th
- Russia's counterattacks have been ineffective so far
- Ukraine appears to have sustainable force presence

Based on the evidence, Ukraine has established significant control in Kursk Oblast well beyond the 5-mile requirement. While Russia could mount a successful counteroffensive, Ukraine's demonstrated ability to hold territory and build defenses suggests a good chance of maintaining some presence beyond 5 miles by October 1st. The restriction to "Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts" actually simplifies the prediction since current operations are focused there.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 80.40%, with 72.80% being the most likely. Probability: 72.80%

For maintaining position:

- Evidence of Ukrainian forces fortifying positions
- Russia's initial response has been ineffective
- Ukraine appears to have committed significant forces (thousands of troops)

Against maintaining position:
- Russia is building new defensive lines 60km from border
- Russia is mobilizing additional forces
- Holding territory deep in Russia requires significant resources
- Ukraine may use this as temporary leverage rather than permanent occupation
- Historical precedent suggests cross-border raids are typically temporary

3. Analysis of "only Kursk" requirement:

- No evidence of similar-scale operations in other Russian oblasts
- Limited Ukrainian resources make multiple deep incursions unlikely

4. Assessment:
