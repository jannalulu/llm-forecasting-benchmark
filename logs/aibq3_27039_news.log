**Sheikh Hasina ousted: What UK said on her asylum request**
The United Kingdom's Home Office stated that those seeking asylum must do so in the first safe country they reach, amid reports that ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's planned next stop would be London. The UK government informed Sheikh Hasina that the country won't be able to provide her with legal immunity if she seeks asylum. According to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, India has assured Sheikh Hasina of help and given her time to recoup before proceeding with discussions on her next move. He stated, 'On 5th August, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina decided to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladesh authorities. She arrived yesterday evening in Delhi,' he told the House.

**Former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina Considers Asylum in UK**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering seeking asylum in the United Kingdom, according to Indian and Bangladeshi media. Her sister, Sheikh Fazilatun Necha Mujib, and her niece, Tulip Siddiq, who is the economic secretary to the Treasury under Labour leader Keir Starmer, reside in the UK. According to The Daily Star, Hasina has already contacted British authorities to request asylum. Hasina's government has been accused of human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances in Bangladesh. She has also been criticized for her crackdown on student protests, which left over 400 dead and led to her ousting. Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's 'founder', Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, had held power uninterrupted for 15 years. She was forced to leave after student protests began on July 1 over a contentious job quota system. As the protests turned violent, Hasina fled her residence in Daca by air on Monday, as it was being besieged by protesters. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one, but rather it is a reflection of the complex situation in Bangladesh. 'The situation is a reminder that the country needs a new leader who can bring stability and prosperity to the nation,' said no one, but rather it is a reminder that the situation is complex and multifaceted.

**Sheikh Hasina's London Asylum Plan Hits Roadblock; Will Bangladesh PM Move To UK**
Sheikh Hasina, the former Bangladesh Prime Minister, is facing a delay in her plan to seek political asylum in London due to 'uncertainties'. According to PTI, she will have to wait at least two days before flying to London. India has assured her help and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that the government has given her time to decide on her next course of action. Hasina was expected to fly to London after a brief layover in Delhi, but she will have to look for other alternatives after being informed by the British government that she might not receive protection against any possible investigation. 'On 5th August, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina decided to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladesh authorities. She arrived yesterday evening in Delhi,' External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha. Hasina was forced to flee her country due to civilian unrest and is currently staying in an 'undisclosed' location in India.

**UK urges UN investigation into violence in Bangladesh, asylum for Sheikh Hasina remains unclear**
The UK government has urged the United Nations to investigate the recent violence in Bangladesh, where ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina initially fled to India and reportedly sought asylum in the UK. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the 'unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life' and emphasized the UK's commitment to supporting a democratic resolution for the country. However, UK immigration regulations do not facilitate asylum applications for individuals traveling to the UK for this purpose. According to officials, those in need of international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. Strategic experts note that this situation is complex for the UK, which had previously granted refuge to Sheikh Hasina's late father, and that a possible solution would be to give Sheikh Hasina leave to enter the UK where she could live in 'self-exile'.

**Sheikh Hasina to remain in Delhi, UK officials say ‘no provision for asylum in…'**
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to remain in Delhi for the next couple of days due to 'uncertainties' in her travel plans. According to UK officials, there is no provision for asylum in the UK, and those seeking international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. A UK Home Office spokesperson stated, 'The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge.'

**Where Will Sheikh Hasina Go? Bangladesh Ex-PM's Options After Dhaka Exit**
After resigning as Bangladesh Prime Minister and fleeing Dhaka, Sheikh Hasina is reportedly seeking asylum in the UK, but London is hesitant. According to Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, 'She has not requested asylum anywhere, so the question of the UK or US not responding yet is not true.' Joy also stated that his mother was planning to retire after this term anyway. The UK Home Office said British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge. Sheikh Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana is a UK citizen, and Rehana's daughter Tulip Siddiq is a Labour Party politician and a minister in the Keir Starmer government. However, the US has cancelled Sheikh Hasina's visa after she resigned as Prime Minister, but there has been no official confirmation. Sheikh Hasina has been in India since she landed there Monday and the government has given her time to decide on her next move. 'She is done with politics in Bangladesh,' Joy said. 'My mother was planning to retire after this term anyway.'

**Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Seeks Asylum Alternatives**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, accompanied by her sister Sheikh Rehana, planned to travel from India to London to seek temporary asylum, but this option is currently not being considered. This decision came after the UK government indicated that she may not receive legal protection from any potential investigation into the mass violent protests in her country, they said. UK Foreign Secretary David Lamey stated that there has been an unprecedented level of violence and tragic deaths in Bangladesh over the past two weeks, and the country's people 'deserve a full and independent investigation into the events under the leadership of the UN.' According to UK immigration rules, it is impossible to submit an asylum application while outside the UK, and each asylum application is thoroughly examined on a case-by-case basis. Currently, Hasina is considering several alternatives, including the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Finland. Sources indicate that Sheikh Hasina will remain in India for the foreseeable future. It is reported that she landed at the Hindon airbase on Monday on a C-130J military transport plane a few hours after resigning as prime minister and was transferred to an undisclosed location in Delhi under enhanced security measures.

**India plans to host Sheikh Hasina for 'as long as it takes': report**
Sheikh Hasina, the former Bangladesh prime minister, is expected to remain in India for 'a while' due to a 'technical roadblock' in her plans to travel to the United Kingdom for asylum. According to The Indian Express, India is drawing up plans to host Hasina at a 'safe house' for 'as long as it takes' if she chooses to stay, providing her with the highest level of security. India views Hasina as someone who helped 'quieten' its borders and has a history of providing her with refuge, including after the assassination of her father in 1975. New Delhi has decided to give her time and space to make up her mind about how long she wants to stay, despite her current unpopularity in Dhaka. 'As per its immigration rules, an individual can seek asylum once they are in the UK, not from outside the country,' said The Indian Express, highlighting the challenges surrounding her asylum request.

**Sheikh Hasina: Where can ousted Bangladesh PM go next as UK asylum looks tricky?**
Deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who recently arrived in India after resigning, may have to extend her stay in the country due to complications with her plans to seek asylum in the UK. The British government has hinted that she may not receive the expected legal protection in the UK against potential investigations, according to The Indian Express. Hasina's initial intention was to travel to London, but the suggestion from the UK has prompted her to reconsider her plans and explore other options, including the US and Finland. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said, 'There is the need for a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events' that recently transpired in Bangladesh, complicating her asylum prospects in the UK. The UK Home Office stated, 'It is not possible to apply for asylum from outside UK. Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, that is the fastest route to safety.' Sheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, said that while London remains her primary choice for asylum, she hasn't officially approached the authorities. India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar highlighted that Hasina is in a state of shock, and the Indian government is giving her time to recover before discussing various issues with her, including her future plans.

**Question mark over her London plans, Delhi ready to host Hasina**
Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to stay in India for 'a while' as her plans to travel to the UK face a 'technical roadblock' due to the UK's immigration rules. Hasina wants to seek asylum or temporary refuge in the UK due to fears of political persecution in Bangladesh. However, the UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that the UK wants to see a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events in Bangladesh and action taken to ensure a peaceful and democratic future. The British government has conveyed the message that those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. In contrast, India is drawing up plans to host Hasina in the country for 'as long as it takes', with officials stating that there is no question of 'abandoning' her at this time of crisis. Delhi is clear that they will offer her refuge, with one source saying, 'This is her second home.' Plans are being drawn up to house her at an appropriate place with the highest level of security.

**Sheikh Hasina Considers Multiple Countries as Potential Refuge**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering several countries as a potential refuge after fleeing her country and resigning. According to Indian news outlet Free Press Journal, citing sources, she is considering Belarus, countries in the Middle East, and Finland as possible destinations. The plan to seek refuge in London is no longer being considered due to the UK government's hesitation to provide her with asylum. As reported by AP, citing TASS, the British government informed Sheikh Hasina that she may not receive legal protection from any potential investigation into the mass protests in her country. As a result, sources say, Sheikh Hasina is considering several options, including Belarus, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Finland. Sources close to the situation also noted that it is unlikely that Sheikh Hasina will leave India in the next few days, where she is currently located. Sheikh Hasina resigned on Monday amidst anti-government protests and arrived in India on a military transport plane. Indian Foreign Minister Subramanyam Jaishankar stated that she requested permission for a temporary stay in India, which was granted. After arriving in New Delhi, there were reports that Sheikh Hasina had requested asylum in the UK. It was expected that she would depart for London on Tuesday night, but this did not occur. A spokesperson for the UK's Home Office stated that those seeking international protection should request asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and that there are no provisions allowing anyone to enter the UK in search of political asylum or temporary refuge.

**UK hesitancy casts doubt over Hasina's next destination**
Former Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina, 76, has been moved to a safe location in India after quitting following massive protests. Hasina sought approval to come to India 'for the moment' and is expected to remain there due to uncertainty about her plans to travel to London, where she has relatives. However, the UK's apparent reluctance to offer her asylum has cast doubt over her next destination. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for a UN-led probe into the 'unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life' in Bangladesh, saying 'The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past two weeks.' Hasina's team is exploring options for seeking asylum in other countries, including Finland, Russia, Belarus, or a West Asian country. 'The people said Hasina sought certain assurances from UK authorities, such as legal protection in relation to potential investigations into the violent protests that left nearly 400 people dead in Bangladesh.'

**Sheikh Hasina Seeks Political Asylum in Several Countries**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering seeking political asylum in several countries, including those in the Middle East and Finland. This decision comes after London, where she initially sought asylum, stated that it would not provide full legal protection, according to the 'MIR 24' channel. Sheikh Hasina resigned and left Bangladesh on Monday due to mass protests and anti-government demonstrations. She is currently in India, where she arrived on a military helicopter. It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will soon submit a request for asylum to one of the countries she is considering. The list of potential countries includes Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Finland, and several others. Sheikh Hasina had previously sought asylum in the UK, but was forced to abandon her plans after the British government stated that it could not guarantee her legal protection in the event of an investigation into the mass protests in Bangladesh. The protests, which began on August 4, have resulted in the deaths of approximately 300 people. The textile industry, which is a crucial part of Bangladesh's economy and employs over 4 million people, is expected to resume operations on August 7. 'It is a great day,' said no one, as the situation in Bangladesh continues to unfold.

**Sheikh Hasina's UK asylum plan hits roadblock? Ousted Bangladesh leader exploring new travel options**
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's plan to seek asylum in the UK has been put on hold due to the country's hesitation to provide legal protection. According to the UK's immigration rules, asylum claims can only be made from within the country. Hasina, who resigned on Monday amidst widespread protests, is currently in Delhi under tight security. She is exploring alternative destinations, including the UAE, Belarus, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Finland, where she has family ties. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar confirmed Hasina's arrival and stated that she had requested permission to enter India at short notice. The situation remains dynamic, with no clear indication of Hasina's next steps. Her resignation followed massive protests in Bangladesh, which began as an agitation against a job quota system but evolved into a mass movement demanding her ouster. As Hasina decides on her next move, the international community watches closely. The UK's stance has significant implications for her future, and the potential for asylum claims in other countries remains uncertain. 'The situation remains dynamic, with no clear indication of Hasina's next steps,' said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. 'She had requested permission to enter India at short notice,' he added.

**Why India might hesitate in giving asylum to Sheikh Hasina**
Sheikh Hasina, the ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister, is staying in a safe house near Delhi after fleeing her country amid violent protests. According to sources, she will stay in India for the next 48 hours as uncertainty looms over where she will seek asylum. The UK has indicated that it won't grant her asylum, citing 'there is no provision within our Immigration Rules for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge'. India may hesitate in giving asylum to Hasina if the UK formally declines her asylum, as it could indicate that India is taking sides in the Bangladesh crisis. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the government wants to give some time and space to Hasina about her future course of action. 'Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach - that is the fastest route to safety,' the UK government said. Hasina's stay in India could create turmoil along India's eastern border and project India as a meddler if New Delhi continues giving shelter to the Awami League leader.

**As UK, US refuse to play ball, one likely destination for Sheikh Hasina is Dubai**
Sources in the security establishment said that Sheikh Hasina was not planning to go to the US, but to the UK, which is also stonewalling her case. However, the UK has a provision that those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reached, which in this case would be India. Security sources said a possible destination for Hasina would be Dubai in the UAE. They said that no decision had yet been taken by the former Bangladeshi PM. According to sources, Hasina currently remains at the Hindon air base in Ghaziabad and is likely to spend a few more days there, contrary to the earlier plan of a technical stopover. The Bangladeshi military's C-130J aircraft, which had brought Hasina to India, went back Tuesday. As one diplomatic source said, 'The UK has a proud record of providing protection to people who needed it, but there is no provision within their immigration rules for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge.'

**Where Is Sheikh Hasina? As Ex-Bangla PM's Arch-Rival Steps Out Of Jail Amid Crisis, Question Rages**
Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been granted safe passage by India after her resignation, but she remains in India, not returning to Bangladesh. Her arch-rival, Khaleda Zia, was released from prison on Tuesday, amidst a volatile situation in Bangladesh. According to reports, Hasina was seeking asylum in the UK, but her request may be rejected due to UK asylum laws, which discourage asylum seekers from nations that could have sought safe harbor in countries nearer to them. As the situation in Bangladesh intensifies, with protests spreading to the US, the UK government's Home Department has stated that those in need of international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than making dangerous journeys to their preferred destination. 'Those in need of international protection should take the fastest route to safety and claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than making dangerous journeys through multiple safe countries to arrive at their preferred destination,' the report states. Sheikh Hasina met National Security Advisor Ajit Doval after landing in India, and is likely to remain at a safe house in Hindon near the Hindon airbase. 'In broad terms, asylum claims may be declared inadmissible and not substantively considered in the UK, if the claimant was previously present in or had another connection to a safe third country, where they claimed protection, or could reasonably be expected to have done so, provided there is a reasonable prospect of removing them in a reasonable time to a safe third country,' a UK Parliament document explains the asylum law.

**Sheikh Hasina ousted: What UK said on her asylum request**
The United Kingdom's Home Office stated that those seeking asylum must do so in the first safe country they reach, amid reports that ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's planned next stop would be London. The UK government informed Sheikh Hasina that the country won't be able to provide her with legal immunity if she seeks asylum. According to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, India has assured Sheikh Hasina of help and given her time to recoup before proceeding with discussions on her next move. He stated, 'On 5th August, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina decided to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladesh authorities. She arrived yesterday evening in Delhi,' he told the House.

**Former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina Considers Asylum in UK**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering seeking asylum in the United Kingdom, according to Indian and Bangladeshi media. Her sister, Sheikh Fazilatun Necha Mujib, and her niece, Tulip Siddiq, who is the economic secretary to the Treasury under Labour leader Keir Starmer, reside in the UK. According to The Daily Star, Hasina has already contacted British authorities to request asylum. Hasina's government has been accused of human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances in Bangladesh. She has also been criticized for her crackdown on student protests, which left over 400 dead and led to her ousting. Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's 'founder', Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, had held power uninterrupted for 15 years. She was forced to leave after student protests began on July 1 over a contentious job quota system. As the protests turned violent, Hasina fled her residence in Daca by air on Monday, as it was being besieged by protesters. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said no one, but rather it is a reflection of the complex situation in Bangladesh. 'The situation is a reminder that the country needs a new leader who can bring stability and prosperity to the nation,' said no one, but rather it is a reminder that the situation is complex and multifaceted.

Sheikh Hasina, the former Bangladesh Prime Minister, is facing a delay in her plan to seek political asylum in London due to 'uncertainties'.

**UK urges UN investigation into violence in Bangladesh, asylum for Sheikh Hasina remains unclear**
The UK government has urged the United Nations to investigate the recent violence in Bangladesh, where ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina initially fled to India and reportedly sought asylum in the UK. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the 'unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life' and emphasized the UK's commitment to supporting a democratic resolution for the country. However, UK immigration regulations do not facilitate asylum applications for individuals traveling to the UK for this purpose. According to officials, those in need of international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. Strategic experts note that this situation is complex for the UK, which had previously granted refuge to Sheikh Hasina's late father, and that a possible solution would be to give Sheikh Hasina leave to enter the UK where she could live in 'self-exile'.

Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on a Bangladesh Air Force transport aircraft and landed at the Indian Air Force base in New Delhi on Monday.

Hasina, 76, resigned and left Bangladesh amid mass protests against the ruling government.

**Sheikh Hasina seeks asylum in UK after resignation**
Sheikh Hasina, the president of the Awami League, has sought asylum in the United Kingdom after resigning following massive public protests against her government. According to Indian media reports, citing diplomatic sources, Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana landed in India for a safe shelter after leaving Bangladesh. News18 reported that Hasina's younger sister Rehena is a citizen of the United Kingdom, and her daughter Tulip Siddiq is a member of the British Parliament, which is why they could move to the UK. Anadabazar Patrika speculated that Hasina did not seek political asylum from India as she would probably move to London, and that she and Rehana might stay at Delhi's 'Safe House' for several days. 'It remains unclear whether they will head directly to the capital, Delhi, or another location,' according to The Hindu and News18. Hasina's daughter Saima Wazed Putul, the World Health Organization's regional director for South-East Asia, lives in Delhi, and they might head to her residence as well, the sources said. 'Hasina has been in power for 15 and a half years as the leader of the Awami League, and resigned in the face of a public uprising,' said Bangladesh's Chief of Armed Forces Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman. The student protests demanding quota reforms, which started 36 days ago, evolved into an anti-government movement, resulting in widespread violence and the deaths of over 300 people.

Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has requested asylum in the United Kingdom, according to The Hindu, citing a source. 'Sheikh Hasina requested asylum in the UK. Her sister Rehana, who already has British citizenship, is accompanying her,' the materials state. This comes after Hasina resigned and left the country due to mass student protests that resulted in over 300 deaths. The protests, which began in late June, were initially peaceful but turned violent as students were unhappy with the reinstatement of a quota system for government positions, which was previously in place from 1972 to 2018. The system reserved 30% of positions for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan in 1971. The Bangladeshi government had already shut down the internet in the country on July 19, amid growing protests, with at least 39 reported deaths.

**Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Seeks Asylum in the UK**
Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has requested asylum in the United Kingdom, according to sources cited by The Hindu. Hasina and her sister left the official residence in Dhaka amidst protests and relocated to a safer location. Reports indicate that she landed on an Indian airbase in Ghaziabad. The protests have been ongoing in Bangladesh for several weeks, with demonstrators opposing a quota system for government positions that favors the families of veterans who fought for the country's independence in 1971. The system was abolished in 2017, but reinstated by the High Court in June, sparking renewed protests. Hasina's resignation has been met with increased protests, with the 'Student Movement Against Discrimination' announcing a multi-day 'non-cooperation' action against the authorities. The clashes between students and police escalated into widespread violence, resulting in over 300 casualties. 'The situation is extremely tense,' said a source, 'and it's unclear what will happen next.'

**Bangladesh News LIVE: Sheikh Hasina May Stay In Delhi After Resigning As PM, Fleeing Dhaka; No Asylum Clarity From UK**
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has fled Dhaka amid ongoing protests and is seeking asylum in the UK. According to sources, she is likely to land in India before heading to London. The Indian Air Force was on high alert, with fighter aircraft airborne soon after the Bangladeshi C-130 aircraft entered Indian airspace. The UK has not given any clarity regarding granting political asylum to Sheikh Hasina. Kangana Ranaut said she is 'honoured and flattered' that Sheikh Hasina feels safe in India, but questioned why the Prime Minister is seeking asylum in the first place. The situation in Bangladesh remains volatile, with the army taking temporary control of the governance of the nation. 'We will not resolve anything using protests; we will put an end to anarchy,' said Bangladesh Army Chief Waker-Uz-Zaman. 'We will form an interim government,' he added. The situation is being closely monitored by the Indian government, with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar set to discuss the situation in Bangladesh in the Parliament on Tuesday.
