**EUR/USD Holds Steady Above 1.0900 Amid Market Volatility and Mixed Economic Data**
The EUR/USD pair remains above 1.0900 despite market volatility and mixed economic data. The US Dollar's (USD) recovery was limited by Wall Street's bullish opening, allowing EUR/USD to contain its daily losses. The pair has retreated from a fresh multi-month high of 1.1008 and is now trading near the 1.0900 threshold. US Treasury yields have bounced back, supporting the USD's recovery, while the Euro has faced pressure from disappointing Eurozone economic data, including a 0.3% month-on-month decline in June Retail Sales and a 11.9% year-over-year decline in German Factory Orders.

**EUR/USD: Bulls set to test 1.1010 - UOB Group**
According to UOB Group, the Euro (EUR) is likely to consolidate in a range of 1.0945/1.1010, or between 1.0910 and 1.1045. Analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann note that the recent sharp selloff seems excessive and the EUR is unlikely to weaken much further. They expect the EUR to trade in a sideways range, citing the pullback in overbought conditions as a reason for the consolidation. The analysts also highlight that a breach of 1.0955 would indicate the end of the EUR strength that started early last week. However, the price action suggests that the EUR strength has ended, and the currency has likely entered a consolidation phase.

**European Markets Move Cautiously Ahead of US Inflation Data**
European stock markets are moving cautiously with a moderate rally, in the key session of the week, where the US inflation data will be released. The slowdown in production prices, announced on Tuesday, August 13, in the United States, has encouraged purchases on Wall Street, further removing fears of a recession and fueling investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates by half a point next month. The market is therefore waiting for confirmation (or denial) from the consumer price data, without forgetting another key indicator that will arrive in the Ferragosto session, that of retail sales. Meanwhile, on the macro front, in the UK, inflation fell by 0.2% on a monthly basis in July, while on an annual basis it increased by 2.2%. Today's calendar also includes data on GDP and industrial production in Europe. On the currency front, the euro/dollar exchange rate rises to 1.098 (1.095 at the previous close), while the yen exchanges with the single currency at 161.58 (161) and the greenback at 147 (146.98). The price of oil rises again, after the falls in the night, with the Brent October at 81.18 dollars per barrel (+0.6%) and the Wti September at 78.89 dollars (+0.7%). The gas price is stable at 39.6 euros per megawatt hour (+0.3%). Tokyo closes positively. Premier Kishida will not re-run for the leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party, Tokyo closes positively after some uncertainty. 'It is a positive day for the Tokyo Stock Exchange,' said an analyst, 'the automaker and financial sector stocks have supported the performance of the Nikkei index.' The attention of operators is focused on the US inflation data expected in the afternoon, from which indications are expected on the next moves of the Fed's monetary policy. At the end of the session, the leading index of the Japanese list closed with a gain of 0.6% at 36,442.43 points. Also well the broader Topix index, which closed with a gain of 1.11% at 2,581.90 points.

**European Markets Prepare for US Inflation Data Release**
European stock markets are expected to open with cautious optimism (Euro Stoxx +0.19%) as investors await the release of the US inflation data today. The Ftse Mib in Milan (+0.08%) is currently in a slight positive territory, while the Aex in Amsterdam (+0.08%) and the Cac in Paris (+0.3%) are also showing slight gains. The Dax in Frankfurt (+0.1%), the Ftse 100 in London (+0.4%), and the Ibex in Madrid (+0.2%) are also moving upwards. In contrast, Asian markets are mixed, but the Nikkei in Tokyo (+0.6%) has closed with a gain. The slowdown in production prices in the US has encouraged buying on Wall Street, reducing fears of a recession and boosting hopes that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates by half a point next month. Today, the focus will be on the US inflation data (due at 14:30), while in the UK, inflation fell by 0.2% on a monthly basis in July, but rose by 2.2% on an annual basis. In Europe, the calendar includes data on GDP and industrial production.

**EUR/USD trades in tight range with US inflation in spotlight**
The EUR/USD is trading in a tight range ahead of the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which is expected to have a limited impact on the US Dollar. Economists predict a slight increase in the monthly headline PPI and a slower growth in the core PPI. The data will influence market speculation about interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The EUR/USD is close to the upper boundary of a Channel formation on the daily time frame, and a breakout could result in wider ticks on the upside. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 1.0800 has acted as major support for the Euro bulls. According to FXStreet, a bullish momentum will trigger if the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) sustains above 60.00. A breakout above the August 5 high of 1.1009 could drive the asset towards the August 10, 2023, high at 1.1065, followed by the round-level resistance of 1.1100. ECB Rehn supports more rate cuts to boost Eurozone economic growth, but this is not directly related to the current EUR/USD trading situation.

**Dollar and Euro Prices on August 13, 2024: A Flat Start to the Day**
The US dollar and euro started the day with a flat trend. The dollar/TL is currently trading at 33.56, while the euro/TL is trading at 36.68. The dollar index is at 103.1, just above the previous close. Analysts expect the upcoming inflation data to have a significant impact on the market, and the Fed's decision on interest rates in September is still uncertain. There is a 57% chance of a 50 basis point rate cut, but this could change after the inflation data is released. Analysts also expect other macroeconomic data and geopolitical developments to influence investor sentiment. Today, the Producer Price Index (PPI) will be released, and analysts expect the dollar index to face resistance at 103.5 and support at 102.

**EUR/USD Price Forecast: 1.1000 appears to be a tough nut to crack for buyers**
The EUR/USD pair is trading at 1.0920 with mild gains during the early European session on Monday. The uptick is backed by the consolidation of the US Dollar. Investors are awaiting the German August ZEW survey on Tuesday for fresh impetus. The weaker-than-expected data is expected to contribute to a negative outlook in the economy and might keep the European Central Bank in easing mode. According to the daily chart, the bullish outlook prevails as the major pair remains above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average. The first upside barrier emerges near 1.0973, and the crucial resistance level is located at 1.1000-1.1010. On the other hand, the initial support level is at 1.0881, with a breach exposing the 100-day EMA at 1.0822 and potentially leading to 1.0735.

**EUR/USD holds 1.0900, awaits fresh cues on Fed-ECB rate-cut path**
The EUR/USD currency pair is trading sideways above the 1.0900 level, awaiting fresh cues on the rate-cut path of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed). According to Finnish ECB policymaker Olli Rehn, 'Inflation continues to slow down but the path to the two percent target remains bumpy this year.' He added that rate cuts would help the eurozone economy recover, particularly the 'fragile' industrial growth and subdued investments. The 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near 1.0800 has acted as major support for the Euro bulls. A breakout above Monday's high of 1.1009 could drive the pair towards the August 10, 2023, high at 1.1065, while a breakdown below the August 1 low at 1.0777 could drag the pair towards the February low near 1.0700.

**Dollar and Euro Rise at the Start of the Day: What's the Current Exchange Rate?**
The Turkish lira (TRY) has started the day with a rise against the US dollar (USD), trading at 33.50. The euro (EUR) is also seeing a rise, trading at 36.67. The USD/TRY closed at 33.46 yesterday, down 0.42% from the previous day's close. Analysts note that the US employment data released last week increased recession concerns, and today's weekly unemployment benefits data may provide more evidence on the US labor market and influence asset prices. Analysts also highlight that Turkish Central Bank President Fatih Karahan's inflation report presentation today will be a key focus for investors, while abroad, they will be watching the US weekly unemployment benefits data and wholesale inventory data. From a technical perspective, analysts see 103.5 as a resistance level and 102 as a support level for the dollar index.

The EUR/USD exchange rate has stabilized just above 1.0900 after a recent surge, as traders take a break from volatility. The market is now focused on weekly US labor data, with limited economic releases until next week.

**EUR/USD Analysis Today 05/08: Should We Sell Now? (Chart)**
The euro rose by about 1% last week, surpassing the resistance level of 1.0926, due to the weakness of the US dollar amid concerns about the US economy. ECB official Stournaras highlighted the possibility of inflation falling below the 2% target due to the struggling eurozone economy. However, the annual rate of inflation in the Eurozone unexpectedly accelerated to 2.6% in July, and service inflation declined for the first time in three months. HSBC economist Fabio Balboni commented, 'It's a tricky print for the ECB, as commodity deflation is nearing its end and service inflation remains elevated.' ABN Amro was slightly more positive, saying 'This kind of decline bodes well for the medium-term inflation outlook.' European stocks extended losses, with the Stoxx 50 and Stoxx 600 indexes closing down 2.8% on Friday. The EUR/USD technical analysis suggests that the recent bounce lacks momentum to confirm a bullish trend, and we expect a quiet trading week in narrow ranges. We still prefer to sell the EUR/USD from every bullish level, with the support level of 1.08 remaining a threat to any attempt to bounce higher.

The European Central Bank set the reference rate at 1.0817 dollars, with the dollar trading at 0.9244 euros.

**Dolar Kuru Today: USD/TL, EUR/TL, and GBP/TL Prices**
The Turkish Lira (TL) has seen a value increase against the US Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR) in the last trading session. The USD/TL is currently trading at 33.04, while the EUR/TL is at 35.90 and the GBP/TL is at 42.5880. The US Dollar Index is currently at 104.3, just above its previous close. The US economy grew by 2.8% in the second quarter, exceeding expectations, which may lead the Federal Reserve (Fed) to end its inflation fight with a 'soft landing' and not harm the economy. The Fed's decision on how many times to cut interest rates this year is still uncertain, but market prices indicate that it may cut rates three times starting from September. The 10-year US Treasury yield is currently at 4.25%. Analysts are following today's US consumer spending, personal income, and Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index data, and technically, the dollar index is expected to face resistance at 105 and 106, and support at 104 and 103.

The EUR/USD currency pair is trading around 1.0860 during the Asian session on Friday, extending its gains after rebounding from a two-week low of 1.0825 recorded on Wednesday.

The European Central Bank's policy outlook remains uncertain, which may pose challenges for the Euro. The EUR/USD pair is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% of all transactions.

**Turkish Lira Exceeds 33 TL Against US Dollar**
The Turkish Lira (TL) has exceeded 33 TL against the US Dollar (USD) for the first time in three days, starting the day at 33,0092 TL. The Euro (EUR) also started the day at 35.89 TL. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has maintained its 'hawkish' stance, keeping the policy rate at 50% and stating that it will continue to implement a tight monetary policy until inflation targets are met. The CBRT has also ended swap agreements with other countries and is working to increase its foreign exchange reserves. The Minister of Finance and Treasury, Mehmet ≈ûim≈üek, stated that the program has increased foreign exchange inflows, reduced dollarization, and reduced the need for external financing, resulting in increased reserves. The CBRT and the Minister of Finance and Treasury have also attended a meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in Brazil. In global markets, technology stocks are being questioned, with Google (Alphabet) and Tesla stocks disappointing, leading to concerns about the value of technology stocks. The Nasdaq index, which tracks technology stocks, fell 4% yesterday, its worst decline since 2022. The dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate has also reversed its trend, falling 3.32% since the beginning of the week. Analysts believe that the Bank of Japan is intervening in the market. The exchange rate is currently trading at 152.91.

**EUR/USD: To trade in a range between 1.0845 and 1.0945**
UOB Group FX strategists Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia predict that the Euro (EUR) will trade in a range between 1.0845 and 1.0945 for the time being. They note that the Euro strength has ended and that the currency is likely to trade sideways. The strategists expect EUR to edge higher, but a sustained break above 1.0920 is unlikely. They also point out that the recent loss of momentum in EUR is a sign that the strength that started two weeks ago has come to an end.

**Today's Dollar and Euro Exchange Rates: 17 July 2024**
The US Dollar (USD) is currently trading at 33,0738 TL, with a 0.15% increase, while the Euro (EUR) is trading at 36,0661 TL, with a 0.04% increase. The fluctuations in the dollar and euro exchange rates are closely related to global economic developments and local market dynamics. The 0.15% increase in the dollar can be attributed to strong economic data and interest rate policies in the US, while the 0.04% increase in the euro may be related to economic recovery signals in the European Union. Investors should diversify their foreign exchange investments and be cautious of sudden fluctuations. Experts recommend closely following developments in the foreign exchange market and making investment decisions based on market analysis. Additionally, it is crucial to consider global economic indicators and policy developments when making long-term investment plans. Following the current state of foreign exchange rates and market developments is critical for determining your investment strategies.

**EUR/USD Analysis: The Pair is Searching for Direction**
The EUR/USD pair is currently uncertain about its direction, and it's reasonable to expect a lot of news related to inflation in the next two days. The US inflation data will be released on Thursday, and the producer price index will be released on Friday. This could lead to a highly volatile market, and it's likely that we'll reach the level of 1.08. The level of 1.08 has been significant in the past, and many traders are focusing on it from an inflationary perspective, as the European Central Bank has already lowered interest rates, and the question now is whether the Federal Reserve will do the same. This is what many institutional traders are looking for, as most of them have never experienced a situation where interest rates were actually reduced. Are you ready to trade based on our forex forecasts? We have listed the best trading companies in Italy for you to check them out. Turning point The current level could be a turning point for this pair, and if we break above it, I think we'll be in a situation where the next big number will stop the euro. If we manage to break above the level of 1.09, we can achieve something. However, if we break below the level of 1.08 at the daily close, it's likely that the market will retreat to the level of 1.07, which has been significant more than once, and it's likely to provide support at any type of break from here. If we break below that level, it's likely that the euro will face a serious problem. With all factors considered, I'll wait to see what happens at the end of the week before investing any money, as the euro is a great way to watch money moving back and forth without doing anything most of the time.

**EUR/USD outlook: Bullish bias above daily cloud**
The EUR/USD currency pair opened with a gap-lower on Monday but quickly recovered and reached a new multi-week high of 1.0842. The price is expected to remain bullish as long as it stays above the daily cloud, with a daily close above the 1.0820 level (61.8% of 1.0915/1.0666) reinforcing the positive outlook. However, overbought conditions may cause the price to consolidate. Fundamentally, the economic data is not strong, with the core industrial sector in the euro bloc still slow, which may lead to the ECB cutting rates sooner or more than expected, negatively affecting the euro.

**Current Exchange Rates: Dollar, Euro, and Pound on July 8, 2024**
The current exchange rates for the dollar, euro, and pound on July 8, 2024 are being sought. The dollar/TL is trading at 32,6680 after starting the new week with a flat start. The dollar/TL, which rose on Friday, ended the day 0.3% higher than the previous close at 32,6660. What is the dollar worth? The dollar/TL is trading at 32,6680 as of 10:10 am, just above the previous close. What is the euro worth? The euro/TL is trading at 35,3640, down 0.1% from the previous day. What is the pound worth? The pound/TL is trading at 41,8820, up 0.1% from the previous day. Uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's future policies is making it difficult for asset prices to find direction. This week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's statements and a busy data schedule will be on investors' radar, while last week's macroeconomic data in the US provided mixed signals for the labor market. The country's non-agricultural employment increased by 206,000 in May, exceeding expectations, but the May data was revised down to 272,000 from 218,000. The unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%, the highest level since November 2021, and the average hourly earnings expectation, including the Fed's attention, rose 0.3% to $35.

**US holiday set to dampen trading appetite in the European session today**
The European trading session is expected to be quiet today due to the 4th of July celebrations in the US, with major currencies showing little appetite and trading in tight ranges. The dollar was weaker yesterday following the softer US ISM services PMI, but the EUR/USD is holding just below 1.0800. The non-farm payrolls data tomorrow will be the main event of the week, and until then, it will be difficult to make any significant moves with conviction. The UK election will also be a focus today and tomorrow, but it is expected to be a one-sided affair.

**UK Election Day: Outlook For Pound Against Euro And Dollar**
The UK election is underway, and the Pound to Euro exchange rate (GBP/EUR) is trading at around 1.18084, slightly lower than yesterday's close. The Pound to Dollar exchange rate (GBP/USD) is 1.27517. Despite the usual political uncertainty, the markets are steady and positive, as Labour is expected to win the election with a large majority. Sterling could gain further against the euro if the French election outcome is uncertain. The French election is a major factor in the euro's value, with a right-wing National Rally (RN) party win potentially weakening the EU and leading to a move through 0.84 against the pound. However, nerves over the French election have eased, and the euro's value is now largely contained to French markets.

**EUR/USD: Last day in Sintra**
The Sintra summit is concluding today, with ECB officials, including Christine Lagarde, Luis de Guindos, Piero Cipollone, Philip Lane, and Klaas Knot, making closing comments. Eurozone inflation data for June showed a decline, but core inflation remained unchanged at 2.9%. This has led to caution on easing guidance from ECB officials. The EUR/USD has limited upside potential, with Societe Generale noting that the top side is very limited. The US ADP survey was disappointing, leading to modest gains in the US Dollar. Traders are now net-long EUR/USD for the first time since May 30, 2024, but the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives a stronger EUR/USD-bearish contrarian trading bias.

**Euro and Dollar Exchange Rate: A Look at the Current Trend**
The Euro and dollar exchange rate closed at 1.0714 USD on Friday, June 28, 2024, with a 0.32% change from the opening session. The Euro has experienced a slight increase of 0.19% in the last week, but a negative change of -2.03% over the past year, showing a downward trend in the value of the European currency compared to the dollar. The dollar has shown a positive trend compared to previous days, with a value of 1, indicating an increase in the value of the dollar compared to the local currency. This upward trend may have implications for the financial market and international trade. The factors behind this trend include the strength of the US economy, international demand for the currency, and monetary policies implemented by the central bank. It is important to monitor this trend and evaluate its impact on the national economy, particularly in sectors such as tourism, exports, imports, and foreign investment.

**EUR: French election and US PCE to guide the EUR/USD ‚Äì ING**
The EUR/USD is trading near 1.07 after a soft session for risk sentiment on Tuesday. ING's analyst Francesco Pesole notes that the OAT:Bund 10-year spread is hovering around 75-80bp, which may be the level it approaches the French election on Sunday. A poll of polls by Bloomberg sees Marine Le Pen's National Rally leading with over 35% and the leftist New Popular Front alliance at 28%. ECB official Olli Rehn was dovish in an interview, saying market pricing for two more rate cuts in 2024 is reasonable. Investors are not heavily influenced by ECB communication, but Rehn's words signal tolerance towards inflation bumps, which is euro-negative. The EUR/USD price action will be determined by French election positioning and Friday's US PCE. ING has a bias for a weakening in the pair to June's lows (1.0670) before a rebound on Friday on encouraging PCE figures.

**EUR/USD hangs near its lowest level since early May, seems vulnerable below 1.0700 mark**
The EUR/USD pair is struggling to attract buyers and is being weighed down by political uncertainty in Europe and a combination of other factors. The pair is trading near its lowest level since early May, around 1.0690-1.0685, and is vulnerable to further declines. The Fed's hawkish stance and strong US business activity data are supporting the USD, while the Eurozone's slow growth and concerns about France's fiscal situation are weighing on the Euro. Traders are waiting for key economic data releases, including the US PCE Price Index and German IFO Business Climate, to influence the near-term price dynamics of the pair.
