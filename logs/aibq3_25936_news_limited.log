**Crimean Bridge Traffic Resumes After One-Hour Suspension**
The movement of vehicles on the Crimean Bridge has been resumed after a one-hour suspension. The bridge's traffic has been periodically interrupted due to the threat of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations. After a drone attack on the Crimean Bridge on July 17, 2023, the road part of the bridge was damaged, and it later resumed operation in reverse mode. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that plans to enhance the bridge's security are being considered and will be implemented. He emphasized that it is premature to evaluate these plans before their implementation. Putin also mentioned that after the completion of all security measures, the measures will be noticeable, referring to both physical and technical protection.

**Crimea Hit by Massive Rocket Attack, Russian Air Defense System Activated**
On June 23, 2024, Crimea was hit by a massive rocket attack, with loud explosions reported in Sevastopol and Balaklava. Telegram channels of the occupying forces reported that the Russian air defense system was working on the peninsula. According to 24 Channel, here is what is known about the rocket attack on Crimea. The enemy attacked the Kiev region with 'Calibers' in the morning, causing damage and casualties. Two houses were completely destroyed, and there were reports of injuries and fatalities. The Russian air defense system was reportedly active in the Saki, Yevpatoria, Inkerman, and Bakhchysarai areas, with detonations heard in the Kazachya Bay area, where the 810th Marine Brigade is based. The Suvorov Bay area was also affected, with smoke seen over the bay and the northern part of the city, including the beaches of Uchkuivka and Tolstik. The Crimean Bridge was closed, and there were reports of people injured by debris from the Russian air defense system. Some Telegram users reported that the sirens in Sevastopol only sounded after the first explosion. The local aquarium even kept children out of the underground toilet, telling them it was a drill and that there was a shelter further away. The Russian air defense system reportedly shot down one of the rockets over the center of Sevastopol. As a result, people were injured, and there were reports of fatalities.

**Crimean Bridge No Longer of Military Significance, Says Ukrainian Navy Speaker**
The speaker of the Ukrainian Navy, Dmitry Pletenchuk, stated that the Crimean Bridge is no longer of military significance since it is almost not used. According to him, destroying the bridge would not have the same effect now. 'Because for military logistics, it almost doesn't carry the load. Less than a quarter of the total load is carried by this bridge. The rest is transported by a ferry crossing, which was recently attacked. Therefore, this bridge no longer has any tactical-strategic significance after the damage it received as a result of the joint operation by the SBU and the Navy with a drone attack,' Pletenchuk explained (cited by 'Country.ua'). The Crimean Bridge was damaged for the first time on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded, killing five people and destroying several sections of the road. The Russian investigation attributes the crime to the head of the SBU, Vasiliy Maluk. The bridge was damaged for the second time on July 17, 2023, by an Ukrainian drone. In November 2023, he said that the SBU is preparing many 'surprises' on how to destroy the bridge. Dmitry Pletenchuk assured that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed 'when needed'.

**State Duma Responds to Ukraine's Words on Crimean Bridge's Military Significance**
The State Duma responded to Ukraine's words about the military significance of the Crimean Bridge. Ukrainian special services and the Ukrainian Armed Forces have changed their rhetoric, realizing that all attempts to harm the Crimean Bridge have failed, said Alexei Zhuravlev, the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Defense. The Crimean Bridge is a civilian object, and Ukraine cannot do anything to it, but if it says so directly, the West will be dissatisfied and stop providing money. Russia has repeatedly stated that the Crimean Bridge is a civilian object. The head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Vasiliy Malyuk, called the Crimean Bridge a priority target and threatened new surprises. On the Victory Day parade in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia will not allow anyone to threaten it, and its strategic forces are always ready. The Russian Foreign Ministry sees all the reasons to launch a process to recognize the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine as terrorist organizations. The Russian side has evidence that Ukrainian special services organized terrorist attacks, including on the Crimean Bridge. There is also evidence that the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked hospitals, kindergartens, and shot people. The first attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded on the road section of the bridge, causing a fire and partial collapse of the bridge. Four people died. The second attack occurred on July 17, 2023, when two unmanned aerial vehicles attacked the bridge. A family from the Belgorod region was killed, and their 14-year-old daughter was injured. The bridge's road section was damaged. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the attack a terrorist act and a senseless crime, and said that the bridge is no longer used for military cargo transportation.

**Ukraine's Attacks on Crimean Bridge Have Reduced Its Strategic Importance, Says Military**
Ukrainian military authorities have acknowledged that attacks on the Crimean Bridge in recent years have reduced its tactical and strategic importance and have prompted Russia to seek alternative routes for military supply transportation. According to Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dimitro Pletenchuk, a hypothetical new attack on the bridge would not have the same effect as previous attacks, which caused significant damage and disrupted Russian military logistics during the war. Pletenchuk stated that the bridge now carries less than a quarter of the total cargo and that most supplies are transported by ferry, which was also recently attacked. Russian troops stationed in southern Ukraine are partially supplied from Rostov, in southwestern Russia, but the main route remains by sea from Crimea. Pletenchuk also mentioned the construction of a railway by Russia in southern Ukraine, which is intended to support the occupying forces in the region. Ukraine has launched several attacks on the Crimean Bridge, causing significant damage on two occasions in October 2022 and July 2023. The bridge was inaugurated in 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin and is considered a symbol of Russian dominance over the peninsula.

**Sievastopol Governor Reports Rocket Attack from Ukraine**
Sievastopol Governor Mikhail Razvozhayev reported that the city was hit by a rocket attack from Ukraine on the night of June 12. According to him, all aerial targets were destroyed high in the sky, with most of them over the water. 'According to operational information from the Rescue Service, there are no damage to objects. No one has been injured. The type of destroyed rockets is being established. No unexploded ordnance has been found so far,' Razvozhayev wrote in his Telegram channel. He added that emergency services in the city are receiving reports of shrapnel falling in the Kombrig Potapov Street area and the Yukharina Gorge area. Since Russian troops were deployed to Ukraine in February 2022, Crimea has been regularly shelled by Ukrainian forces. Attempts are made to attack the Crimean Bridge, mainly with drones and unmanned boats. The Russian Ministry of Defense regularly reports on the destruction of drones over the territory of the peninsula.

**Occupants Install Anti-Diversional Barriers at Crimean Bridge**
The monitoring group Krymsky Vetter reports that Russian occupiers have installed 11 sections of anti-diversional barriers at the Crimean Bridge, citing satellite imagery. This is an increase from the 8 sections reported by the British intelligence in late May. The Crimean Bridge was previously attacked by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) on October 8, 2022, and again on July 17, 2023. The Russian authorities have acknowledged that one section of the bridge is irreparable. The Ukrainian military has stated that they will continue to target Russian-controlled objects in Crimea, including the Crimean Bridge, and has warned against using the bridge. The head of the SBU, Vasiliy Malyuk, has stated that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the bridge, but that timing is everything.

**Russia Deploys Eight Barges to Protect Crimean Bridge, Says British Intelligence**
The Russian military is trying to protect the Crimean Bridge and has deployed eight barges to the area, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Satellite imagery analysis revealed eight barges on the southern side of the Crimean Bridge. The construction began on May 10, 2024, and was completed on May 22, 2024. The barges were placed by Russian forces to protect the bridge and the navigable channel, reducing the approach angles for Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles. The previously established structures were damaged by storms, reducing their effectiveness. The Ukrainian army is reportedly preparing to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge, as evidenced by recent attacks on Russian ferries 'Avangard' and 'Konro Trader'. Meanwhile, the 'Atesh' movement, which calls itself a partisan group, claims that Russian forces are strengthening the protection of the Kerch Strait Bridge, bringing in additional air defense systems. Since August 2022, explosions have been heard almost daily in Crimea and Sevastopol. The Russian authorities explain these explosions as shooting at 'Ukrainian drones', 'air defense operations', or military training. Sergei Aksyonov called drones 'the main threat' to Crimea. A blast occurred on the Crimean (Kerch) Bridge in October 2022, and another on July 17, 2023. The island is under a heightened (yellow) terrorist threat level, and Simferopol Airport is closed.

**Ukraine May Be Preparing to Attack the Crimean Bridge Again**
Ukraine may be preparing to attack the Crimean Bridge, as it has destroyed an alternative route for Russia in case the main bridge is destroyed. Ukrainian forces may be preparing to strike the Crimean Bridge again, according to experts and military analysts. In the past, Ukraine has successfully attacked the bridge twice, first in October 2022 and again in July 2023. The attacks have caused significant damage to the bridge, which has been temporarily repaired but not fully restored. The Ukrainian military has used Western weapons, including ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles, in the attacks. The Russian air defense system in Crimea has failed to intercept the missiles. The attacks have made the Crimean Bridge a critical target for Ukraine, as it is the only remaining route for Russia to supply the peninsula. The Ukrainian military is considering using a new tactic to attack the bridge, as the previous methods have been successful. The exact timing and method of the next attack are unknown.
