**Carlsen to Face Niemann in Speed Chess Championship-2024 Semifinals**
Magnus Carlsen has confirmed that he will play in the Speed Chess Championship-2024 in Paris, despite his previous conflicts with Hans Niemann. Niemann, who has been accused of cheating, has been reinstated on Chess.com and has been performing well in the tournament. Carlsen has stated that he will not engage in a discussion with Niemann, saying 'I've said what I had to say on camera and in the documentary that will come out.' Carlsen has won the Speed Chess Championship three times, while Niemann has been accused of cheating and has been at the center of a scandal involving Chess.com and other top players. The two players will face off in the semifinals of the tournament, which is being held in Paris in September. 'I think he's a sick and lost person who wanted to destroy my life,' Niemann said in an interview. 'He did what he did out of pure revenge. I don't understand how people don't sympathize with what happened to me. I wasn't the aggressor, I wasn't the cause of all this, all I did was win a chess game. I don't understand how you can't come to the conclusion that Chess.com, Magnus, Hikaru, the Chess.com streamers - all of them entered into a conspiracy to destroy my life, not because they think I'm a cheater, but because they have common financial interests.'

**Chess Rivals Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann to Face Off for the First Time Since Cheating Controversy**
Rival chess grandmasters Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann will face off for the first time since the cheating controversy in September 2022. Carlsen had previously stated he didn't want to play against Niemann again, citing concerns about cheating. However, thanks to the Speed Chess Championships, they will now compete in the semifinals on September 6. The winner will advance to the championship and compete for the top spot and a share of the $175,000 prize pool in Paris, France. The match has been highly anticipated, with Niemann filing a $100 million lawsuit against Carlsen and Chess.com, alleging defamation and conspiracy. The lawsuit was eventually dropped, and Niemann was reinstated by Chess.com. Niemann has vowed to become 'the best chess player in the world.' The question remains whether he will achieve this goal. 'We must do something about cheating, and for my part going forward, I don't want to play against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past, because I don't know what they are capable of doing in the future,' Carlsen wrote on X.

**Hans Niemann against the World**
Hans Niemann, a 21-year-old American grandmaster, has been on a roll, defeating Wesley So 13-10 in the Chess.com Speed Chess Championship quarter-final and winning two matches in his 'Hans Niemann against the World' series against Anish Giri and Nikita Vitiugov. Despite his success, Niemann has been at odds with the 'chess establishment', including Chess.com and Magnus Carlsen, with whom he has a history of controversy. Niemann has been invited to top-tier events, but has damaged his reputation with incidents such as damaging a hotel room. He has been organizing his own matches, which have been well-received, and will face Carlsen in the Speed Chess Championship semi-final. Carlsen, the world no. 1, is a heavy favourite, but Niemann should not be underestimated, as he has been playing 'quite well' according to Carlsen.

**Hans Niemann: The guy who's up against the world**
Two years ago, American grandmaster Hans Niemann's life changed when he defeated world No.1 Magnus Carlsen in the Sinquefield Cup. Carlsen immediately withdrew from the tournament and accused Niemann of cheating. Niemann denied the allegations, but the controversy has followed him ever since. Niemann has since launched his own series of one-on-one matches against fellow GMs, titled 'Hans Niemann Against The World.' According to Niemann, it's his way of dealing with being treated like a pariah since the controversy. Vidit Gujrathi, who played against Niemann in June, said, 'I think what Hans is doing is good for chess. Every sport has special characters who bring money and attention to the game and evoke strong emotions in people.' Niemann has since defeated top players like Anish Giri, Wesley So, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and is now ranked world No.22. He is set to play Carlsen in the semifinals of the Speed Chess Championship in Paris on September 6. Niemann said, 'I deserve an apology but I'm not a victim so I don't need an apology… my vengeance will be victory on the board.' Levon Aronian, who played in the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, recalls the controversy and says, 'The rest of us just lost the motivation to play after the withdrawal and accusations.' Gujrathi believes that anti-cheating measures need to be more stringent and that spectators should not be able to see the live position when they come in.

**Carlsen and Niemann to Face Off Again After Two-Year Rivalry**
Magnus Carlsen will face Hans Niemann for the first time in two years at the Speed chess championship (SCC) in Paris in September. The two players were involved in a major scandal two years ago when Niemann was accused of cheating using vibrating anal beads. Carlsen was defeated by Niemann and subsequently dropped out of the tournament. The scandal led to widespread media coverage and even a joke by Måns Zelmerlöw at the Idrottsgalan earlier this year. Niemann later sued Carlsen for $1 billion, calling him 'corrupt' and 'a coward' in the lawsuit. However, the lawsuit was later dropped by an American court. Now, it remains to be seen if the rivalry has been put to rest when they meet in the SCC semifinals on September 6.

**Magnus Carlsen Perfect Score In Titled Tuesday**
GM Magnus Carlsen scored a perfect 11/11 in the late Titled Tuesday on August 6, his second flawless score in the event, tying him with GM Hikaru Nakamura for the all-time record. Carlsen's perfect score came at the expense of a field of 543 players, with an average win time of 37 turns per game. He was matched step-for-step by Andreikin for seven rounds, but not eight. Carlsen's win with Black via a smothered mate in just 30 moves was a sign of just how impossible it would be to defeat him in this tournament on this day. Nakamura, who had earlier won out of a four-way tie on 9.5 points, was defeated by Carlsen in the ninth round, and ultimately finished in first place. Carlsen earned $1,000 for his stunning performance, while Nakamura won $1,000 for his efforts. The women's prize of $100 was won by Ukrainian IM Yuliia Osmak with 7.5 points.

**The Top Five Swindles In Speed Chess Championship History**
The 2024 Speed Chess Championship is underway, featuring 16 top players competing in three time controls. In preparation for this year's edition, let's look at the five greatest swindles in the Speed Chess Championship's eight-year history. Magnus Carlsen's legendary status often leads opponents to give him the benefit of the doubt, as seen in his 2017 match against GM Wesley So, where he played the surprising 22.Qxd5!! to turn the game around. Other notable swindles include Eric Rosen's save against Elizabeth Paehtz in the IM Not a GM tournament, Alexander Grischuk's win and subsequent loss of Carlsen's queen, Hikaru Nakamura's stunning save in the unsound Latvian Gambit, and Carlsen's greatest swindle in SCC history, where he turned a seemingly lost game against Vladislav Artemiev into a win. 'It's not immediately obvious where Artemiev even went wrong, but Carlsen worked his magic and kept pushing the pawns up the board,' said the article. 'When you're the greatest player of all time, how important is a queen?'

**Carlsen dodges playing with Niemann again as old chess grudge flares up at World Rapid Team Championship**
The long-standing feud between Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann has flared up again at the FIDE World Team Rapid Championship. Carlsen opted to sit out the final round, where he would have faced Niemann, and instead left Ian Nepomniachtchi to play the game out. Niemann responded to Carlsen's decision by tweeting, 'If you aren't willing to handle things on the chess board, don't even bother playing.' However, Hikaru Nakamura, a fellow grandmaster, pointed out the irony of Niemann's statement, given that he had previously filed a $100 million lawsuit against Carlsen. The two players are set to face each other in the quarterfinals of the chess.com Speed Chess Championship, with the live finals scheduled for September. Meanwhile, the FIDE World Team Rapid Championship title was won by Parham Magshoodloo's Al-Ain ACMG UAE team, who beat out Carlsen's WR Chess Team and Ding Liren's Decade China Team in a narrow fashion.

**How Fast Is A Speed Chess Champion?**
The Speed Chess Championship (SCC) has been dominated by GM Magnus Carlsen and GM Hikaru Nakamura. NM Todd Bryant analyzed the speed of all 39 SCC participants since the event began. The data shows that speed is not the most important factor in winning the SCC. Instead, it's about when you spend your time. Carlsen and Nakamura invest time in getting good positions, which allows them to catch up when their opponents are forced to think deeply. The main difference between the top players and others is that they rarely have to take deep thinks to recover from a bad position. Nakamura stands out in the faster time controls, thinking for more than 10 seconds on only 8.85% of his moves in the 3+1 format and 3.88% in the 1+1 format.

The game ended with a series of blunders, including a critical mistake on move 23, which led to a loss.
