**Election 2024: Congressional District 6 Debate between Juan Ciscomani and Kirsten Engel**
A debate was held between Arizona's Congressional District 6 candidates, Juan Ciscomani (R) and Kirsten Engel (D). Ciscomani, the incumbent, won the seat by 5,000 votes in 2022. Engel, a former Arizona House Representative and Senate member, is focused on combating drought, reproductive freedom, lowering prescription drug costs, and expanding access to affordable healthcare. According to her campaign website, Engel also supports securing the southern U.S. border while reforming the immigration system and strengthening social security benefits. Ciscomani, who delivered the GOP's response to President Biden's State of the Union address in Spanish in 2023, supports increasing border security, building the southern U.S. border wall, and reinstating the 'Remain in Mexico' policy. Ciscomani initially praised the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, but now rejects the federal abortion ban and supports timetables and exceptions, including for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.

**How Arizona voters could reshape Congress in the 2024 election**
In the 2024 election, Arizona voters will have the opportunity to reshape Congress by voting on all nine seats of the state's congressional delegation. However, only two districts, Congressional District 1 and Congressional District 6, are expected to have any suspense. In District 1, Republican Congressman David Schweikert is running against Democrat Amish Shah, while in District 6, Republican Juan Ciscomani is facing off against Democrat Kirsten Engel for the second time. According to Laura Gersony, a national politics reporter for The Arizona Republic, the outcome of these districts will have a significant impact on who holds power in Congress for the next two years. As Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, notes, 'the results of Arizona's election will have a seismic impact on who holds power in Congress for the next two years.'

**Arizona 6th Congressional District candidates: Where Ciscomaini, Engel stand on issues**
In the Arizona 6th Congressional District, incumbent Juan Ciscomani and challenger Kirsten Engel are facing off in the November 5 election. Engel, a Democrat, has outlined her positions on various issues, including protecting women's rights, securing the border, and addressing climate change. She supports the Women's Health Protection Act, comprehensive immigration reform, and investing in clean energy technology. Ciscomani, a Republican, has emphasized the need for border security and fiscal discipline, while also advocating for a common-sense approach to energy policy. Engel has criticized Ciscomani's record on border security and immigration reform, while Ciscomani has accused Engel of supporting extreme policies on energy and taxes. The two candidates have different approaches to addressing the challenges facing the district, and voters will have to decide which one best represents their values and priorities.

**Leaked GOP memo begs donors to help these reps whose races could determine House majority**
A leaked internal memo from the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) has revealed that House Republicans are struggling financially in several key swing districts. CLF President Dan Conston estimated that Republicans can retain their majority by minimizing losses to 4-7 seats. However, he noted that Republicans are being 'heavily outspent' in key races. The memo identified several members as crucial for the GOP to reelect, including Reps. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska), Juan Ciscomani (R-Arizona), and David Schweikert (R-Arizona). Bacon's district is considered competitive due to its Democratic-leaning area, and he has suggested that his endorsement of former President Donald Trump would be contingent on Trump's conviction in the New York falsified documents case. Bacon stated, 'The number one issue in our district -- number one, number two and number three -- is the border.' However, his district is over 570 miles from the Canadian border and over 1,000 miles from the Mexican border. The two Arizona Republicans could also face challenges due to the 'McCain Republicans' bloc in the state, who may be swayed by the longtime Arizona senator's reputation as a thorn in the side of Trump and the MAGA movement. Democrat Amish Shah, running against Schweikert, said, 'I've met many, many, many Republicans who said, 'My party has left me, I don't like the turn that my own party has made, and I'm looking for a Democrat like you.'

**Digging into down-ballot debates**
The 2024 election cycle is heating up, with down-ballot debates focusing on key issues such as border security, abortion, and guns. According to a recent article by POLITICO, candidates are emphasizing the need for consistency and effective solutions to these pressing problems. For example, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) criticized Republican opponent Kari Lake for her lack of support for a bipartisan border bill, saying 'You've been to Mar-a-Lago more than you have been to the border.' Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) advocated for work permits for asylum seekers, stating 'The moment that they come here and we acknowledge them in their claim for asylum. Let's say here's your work permit, get to work, we need you to work.' Abortion access has also become a major issue, with at least 10 states having measures on the ballot in November. In Arizona, Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.) was criticized for his stance on abortion, with Democratic challenger Kirsten Engel saying 'I trust women. I cherish new life. I reject the extremes on this issue.' Guns are also playing a significant role in the election cycle, with Vice President Kamala Harris touting her gun ownership and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) emphasizing the need to address mass shootings. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has contributed $2 million to Republican candidates and the House GOP campaign arm, bringing his total contributions to over $14 million. Senate GOP leadership elections are also underway, with Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) pushing back against a proposal to delay voting on future leadership.

**Immigration is an uncomfortable topic in this border congressional district**
In Arizona's 6th Congressional District, immigration is a top issue for voters, but it's also creating tension between incumbent Rep. Juan Ciscomani and his Democratic challenger, former state Sen. Kirsten Engel. Ciscomani has been criticized for rejecting a bipartisan immigration deal that would have made significant changes to the country's immigration and asylum systems. Engel has hammered on this issue, saying that Ciscomani 'got handed, on a silver plater, a bipartisan deal to make immense progress on a top issue to all of this district. And he rejects it.' Ciscomani has defended his position, arguing that the threshold for shutting down the border was too high. Engel has also shifted her tone on the issue, initially being hesitant to use the term 'crisis' to refer to the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, but now calling it a 'crisis' and criticizing Ciscomani's opposition to the bipartisan border deal. 'Something isn't a crisis if you can solve it. Actually, now I think we have a crisis because the people who are in office right now aren't solving it,' Engel said. The district is considered highly competitive this November, with about 30% of active voters being Democrats, 32% not affiliated with a party, and 36% being Republicans.

**Engel, Ciscomani slug it out on abortion, immigration**
In a debate sponsored by Clean Elections, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democratic challenger Kirsten Engel discussed key issues in Arizona's 6th Congressional District, including the economy, immigration, and abortion rights. Engel said, 'We need to secure the border. We had the opportunity to do so (through) the bipartisan border security deal backed by the Border Patrol union that would have put more boots on the ground, fentanyl detection systems at ports of entry.' Ciscomani, who was endorsed by the Border Patrol union, said, 'When you look at the border, you have to look at all the issues.' Engel acknowledged Biden was late to react to the immigration surge and agreed Congress remains divided, but said last January's bipartisan deal had the support to pass and make things better at the border. Ciscomani said Trump had nothing to do with him not supporting the bipartisan immigration deal. Engel said abortion access is one of the top issues for voters in the district, 'Every woman, every person has to have the freedom to make their own health care decisions with their doctor, with their family.' Ciscomani said abortion is a state issue and voters should have a say on it. On trade and the economy, Ciscomani played up his tenure as senior adviser and vice chair of the Arizona-Mexico Trade Commission and the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

**Opinion: Neither Kirsten Engel nor Juan Ciscomani are as extreme as they say**
The election for the 6th Congressional District in southern Arizona is between two centrists, Kirsten Engel and Juan Ciscomani. Both candidates are trying to paint their opponent as the extremist, but neither is extreme. They are both supporters of working with the opposition and have shown a commitment to bipartisanship. Engel has proposed a bipartisan border bill, while Ciscomani has called for reforming border laws. On the issue of abortion, Engel is more in line with the Democratic Party, while Ciscomani has expressed support for exceptions to a national ban. Both candidates have been accused of associating with fringe groups, but the truth is that neither is as extreme as some of the company they keep. Whoever wins the election will likely play a moderating influence in Congress.

**Ciscomani & Engel clash on abortion, border & more in final debate**
In the final debate before the November 5 election, Republican U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democratic challenger Kirsten Engel disagreed on various issues, including immigration, abortion, and the economy. Ciscomani said the federal government is dysfunctional and blamed extremists on both sides, while Engel said Ciscomani is part of the problem. Engel criticized Ciscomani for opposing the Border Act of 2024, which would have increased border enforcement, and for his voting record on abortion restrictions. Ciscomani said the matter should be left to individual states to decide and dismissed Engel's claims. Engel called for middle-class tax cuts and supported legislation to prevent corporate price gouging, while Ciscomani said more government regulation would not work. Engel also criticized Ciscomani's previous boss, former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, for allowing foreign companies to farm in Arizona, 'pumping our water dry.' Ciscomani said he opposed allowing foreign companies to farm in Arizona and delivered federal funding for conservation programs. Discussing the Middle East, Ciscomani said Israel had the right to protect itself and the U.S. should stand behind the country, while Engel expressed sympathy for both Israelis and Palestinians and called for a negotiated cease-fire and a 'two-state solution'.

**Here's where Juan Ciscomani and Kirsten Engel stand on border policies**
Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democratic opponent Kirsten Engel are running for the Arizona's 6th District seat, with both candidates claiming they're more solutions-oriented on immigration and border-security issues. Ciscomani, a naturalized citizen from Mexico, supports streamlining the U.S. immigration system and providing a safe pathway for immigrants. Engel, a University of Arizona law professor, counters that Ciscomani's party is preventing progress on immigration and points to the bipartisan border-security bill that died in the Senate. Engel says the bill would have added more immigration judges and asylum officers, and funded more border agents and high-tech scanning equipment. Ciscomani rejected the bill, citing a too-high threshold for Border Patrol migrant encounters before restrictions on asylum access took effect. Both candidates support finding a path to permanency for Dreamers, but Ciscomani has endorsed Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has made controversial comments about immigrants. Engel has criticized Trump's comments and proposed mass deportations, saying they would 'tear communities apart'.

**Top US House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries visited Ariz. Here's what he said about 2 key races**
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries visited Arizona to support two key congressional campaigns. Jeffries attended a fundraiser for Amish Shah, who is challenging Rep. David Schweikert, and Kirsten Engel, who is running against Rep. Juan Ciscomani. Jeffries called Engel and Shah 'common-sense Democrats' and said they are 'quintessential public servants' who will 'move Arizona and the country forward' if elected. Jeffries also referred to Arizona as a 'trifecta state' for national Democrats, saying the future of the country will be decided by the outcome of the presidential, Senate, and House races in the state. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is on track to spend millions in support of Shah and Engel, while the Republican-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund has boosted Schweikert and Ciscomani with seven-figure expenditures.

The 76-year-old congressman, who has represented southern Arizona's 7th Congressional District since 2003, stated that 22 years in office is 'a retirement age' and that it's time for someone younger to take over. Grijalva, a progressive and environmentalist, has been a prominent figure in the House Committee on Natural Resources and has been a vocal critic of President Joe Biden's 2024 presidential campaign. Despite being virtually guaranteed to win re-election this year, Grijalva cited his recent lung cancer diagnosis and over 300 missed votes as a reason for his decision.

**Az congressional candidates Cicsomani, Engel clash on abortion rights**
U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democrat Kirsten Engel are clashing on abortion rights in the race for Southern Arizona's Congressional District 6. Ciscomani said he supports a 'common-sense approach' to reproductive rights, but Engel protested that Ciscomani has consistently voted against reproductive rights over the last two years. Engel said, 'Words don't matter, actions do,' and pointed out that Ciscomani has voted multiple times for federal restrictions on abortion services and led the Patriot Academy, a far-right extremist organization that supports a national abortion ban. Ciscomani has an A-plus rating from the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, but scored 14 out of 100 from pro-choice Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Engel said, 'The contrast between myself and my opponent could not be more stark,' and vowed to protect reproductive health care decisions in Congress. The issue is a major concern for servicewomen and their families, as Ciscomani voted to block the Defense Department from paying for or reimbursing expenses for members of the U.S. military or their family members who have to travel to different states to seek abortion care. 'If you're assigned to a state where there are no reproductive health services and the military cannot provide it, then you are in a world of hurt,' said Congressman Ted Lieu of California. The candidates are scheduled to appear at a televised debate on October 8.

**Border-district Republicans hammer Harris, demand 'an apology' over 'photo op' campaign stop in Arizona**
House Republicans from border districts are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign stop in Arizona, calling it a 'photo op' to score political points. Rep. Juan Ciscomani said, 'Vice President Harris' visit to the border smells like nothing more than a photo opportunity to try and score political points.' The Republicans have long blamed the Biden administration for the record number of illegal border crossings and Harris' handling of the border is one of their most significant political cudgels against her. Rep. Darrell Issa suggested the border crisis is a 'feature, not a flaw' of the administration's policies, saying, 'Kamala owes America an apology, not a photo op.' The 2024 election has seen a paradigm shift in how Democrats are discussing the border, with candidates emphasizing the need for border security. However, the issue has split Democrats and Republicans on how best to approach that goal.

**The politics of immigration play differently along the US-Mexico border**
The politics of immigration are playing out differently along the US-Mexico border, where a humanitarian crisis is unfolding. In New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez is facing a rematch against Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell, who has taken a hardline stance on border enforcement. Meanwhile, in Arizona's 6th Congressional District, Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani is calling for more border enforcement, but has distanced himself from former President Donald Trump's rhetoric. Ciscomani's Democratic challenger, Kirsten Engel, has criticized his stance on border issues. In Texas, Democratic challenger Michelle Vallejo has taken a hardline stance on border enforcement, shocking progressive allies. Experts say voters near the border have tangible concerns about smugglers and contraband, but also know the benefits of authorized cross-border commerce and commuting. 'It's a tightrope that she's got to walk in trying to get any of the pro-Trump enthusiasm,' said Gabriel Sanchez, director of the University of New Mexico Center for Social Policy. 'We have a responsibility to enforce the law on the border, and we also are a community of immigrants — myself included — that came here to this country, and we're seeking opportunity,' said Ciscomani. 'The whole desert is unfortunately littered with people's lives,' said Robert Ardovino, a restaurant owner who lives in a border district in Texas and works in Vasquez's district in New Mexico. 'I wish the facts would rule this conversation, and being here, I know they do not.'

**Tucson Speaks Out: Sept. 19 letters of the day**
Several readers of the Arizona Daily Star have written letters to the editor expressing their opinions on various topics. Juan Ciscomani, a Republican running for re-election in CD 6, was called out by Vivian Harte for not being a moderate, as he is a member of the Republican Study Committee that supports repealing the corporate minimum tax and eliminating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Terry Louck wrote about the 'gun pandemic' and how Donald Trump and his allies have opposed gun regulations despite the danger posed by high-power AR 15 rifles. Cheryl Kelli expressed her frustration with aggressive security guards at Albertsons, who have blocked her way, stalked, and harassed her while she was shopping.

**How Arizona voters could reshape Congress in the 2024 election**
In the 2024 election, Arizona voters will have the opportunity to reshape Congress by voting on all nine seats of the state's congressional delegation. However, only two districts, Congressional District 1 and Congressional District 6, are expected to have any suspense. In District 1, Republican Congressman David Schweikert is running against Democrat Amish Shah, while in District 6, Republican Juan Ciscomani is facing off against Democrat Kirsten Engel for the second time. According to Laura Gersony, a national politics reporter for The Arizona Republic, the outcome of these districts will have a significant impact on who holds power in Congress for the next two years. As Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, notes, 'the results of Arizona's election will have a seismic impact on who holds power in Congress for the next two years.'

**Who's bankrolling Arizona's most competitive US House races? 5 things to know**
The two most competitive US House races in Arizona are the 1st Congressional District and the 6th Congressional District. In the 1st District, Republican Rep. David Schweikert is facing a challenge from Democratic former state Rep. Amish Shah, while in the 6th District, freshman Rep. Juan Ciscomani is being challenged by former state Sen. Kirsten Engel. The races are crucial in determining which party controls the US House in 2025. The majority-seeking Congressional Leadership Fund and other national party groups are spending millions of dollars to support the Republican candidates. Business groups, including Americans for Prosperity Action and the Club for Growth, are also spending to support Schweikert and Ciscomani. The Democratic challengers, Shah and Engel, have made commitments not to accept money from corporate PACs, but can still accept donations from corporate CEOs and transfer large sums of money from colleagues and party committees. Shah has received around $200,000 in outside spending from The Impact Fund, a group that helps elect Indian-Americans to Congress, and has also been boosted by the League of Conservation Voters' Victory Fund. Engel has received money from labor unions and other issue-specific liberal advocacy groups, including the League of Conservation Voters' Victory Fund, which has spent $400,000 to support her campaign.

**Opinion | Hispanic women in Arizona's 6th District could decide the election**
The House race in Arizona's 6th Congressional District is a key battleground, with Democrats betting on reproductive rights to win. However, many Hispanic women in the district are still wary of voting for Vice President Kamala Harris, with some citing concerns about her political expediency. The district is tied within the margin of error, and the Republican candidate, Juan Ciscomani, is focusing on the economy and border security. A 30-year-old Hispanic woman, Athena Vázquez, remains undecided, prioritizing reproductive rights but also expressing concerns about Trump's border security rhetoric. Her father, Héctor, is a 72-year-old immigrant who supports Trump and is against abortion. In contrast, a 30-year-old Hispanic mother, Molly Fenn, is more concerned about the economy and border security, and is against abortion. Reproductive freedom organizations in Arizona believe abortion rights will be the driving force behind a Democratic victory, but the issue is far from the only one, with many voters citing multiple concerns.

**Top House races to watch in the 2024 election - Washington Examiner**
The 2024 US House of Representatives elections are expected to be closely contested, with Republicans aiming to expand their majority and Democrats seeking to flip the House back to blue. Several key races are shaping up, including in New York, Arizona, and California. In New York, Republican incumbents Anthony D'Esposito, Mike Lawler, and Marc Molinaro are facing challenges from Democrats Laura Gillen, Mondaire Jones, and Josh Riley, respectively. In Arizona, Republican Juan Ciscomani is facing Kristen Engel, while David Schweikert is running against Amish Shah. In California, Mary Peltola is facing a ranked-choice election against Nick Begich and Andrew Salisbury. Control of the House may come down to six races in California, including the seat of Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) in the 22nd District. Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) is also facing a competitive election, while Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) is preparing for a general election against Republican state Rep. Austin Theriault. Rep. Don Davis (D-NC) is running for reelection in North Carolina's most competitive congressional race. Decision Desk HQ has projected Valadao with a 55% chance of winning, while Davis has a 76% chance of winning in November.

**Shadowy crypto companies think they can buy Arizona votes. So far, it's working**
Cryptocurrency advocates have spent an estimated $120 million in federal election races this year, primarily through nonpartisan super political action committees (PACs) devoted to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics. In Arizona's primary election, Protect Progress spent over $400,000 to support former White House aide Andrei Cherny, who lost, but also backed ER physician and former state lawmaker Amish Shah, who emerged victorious. Shah faces incumbent David Schweikert in a competitive congressional race. Crypto interests might have spent more in the CD 1 primary, but Cherny and Shah were locked in a six-person field. The advocacy group Stand With Crypto gave Shah an F rating as 'strongly against crypto.' Shah's grassroots campaign helped him win over big money. It's plausible that crypto super PACs will also be active in the Congressional District 6 race between first-term U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani and Democrat Kirsten Engel. The advocacy group has not given a rating on Engel. According to the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, crypto spending accounts for nearly half of all corporate money contributed during this year's election.

**Abortion rights questions are on ballots in 9 states. Will they tilt elections?**
Abortion rights are a key issue in the upcoming elections, with ballot measures in nine states that could sway the results. Scholars and experts are divided on the impact of ballot measures, but many believe that abortion-related measures could attract voters who otherwise might not vote. Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of The Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, said, '2024 is a test in this post-Dobbs world of how this issue being on the ballot will impact candidates.' If ballot measures drive voter enthusiasm and alter outcomes of candidate races, it's most likely to happen in tight races. In Montana, incumbent Jon Tester, a Democrat who supports abortion rights, is in a tight race against Republican Tim Sheehy, who has criticized the ballot measure. In Arizona, abortion was a key issue in the competitive district two years ago and could be again this year, said Arizona State Sen. Eva Burch. The campaign of her Republican opponent, Robert Scantlebury, declined to speak to The Associated Press about the ballot measure. Arizona is also home to one of the most competitive congressional districts in the nation, where first-term Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani faces a rematch with Democrat Kirsten Engel. Engel helped gather signatures to get the abortion question on the ballot. 'So many voters practically grabbed those clipboards out of our hands to sign the initiative,' she said. While polling shows support for legal abortion access, the issue is also mobilizing some anti-abortion voters, such as Danise Rees, a 23-year-old senior at Arizona State University and vice president of the school's chapter of Students of Life.

**A Crucial District in Arizona: The Battle for the 6th Congressional District**
The upcoming US election in November will determine which party controls the White House, but there is much more at stake. The House of Representatives will be renewed, and there will be elections in 34 Senate seats. The outcome of these elections will determine the control of Congress. Currently, the Republicans maintain a narrow majority in the House, while the Democrats control the Senate. In 2024, the map favors the Republican Party. To regain control of the Senate, the Democrats would need to win in states that do not seem to favor them, such as Montana and Ohio, and even then, they would be on a tightrope. The best opportunity is to take control of the House of Representatives from the Republicans. To achieve this, the Democrats would need to win specific races that they narrowly lost a couple of years ago. Will they succeed? In the United States, there are several districts where the outcome of the Congressional race and the presidential contest is uncertain, even two months before the election. The fate of the US government will depend largely on those places. In Arizona's 6th district, which extends from the east of Tucson to the Mexican border, the battle for the district is in the air. The local congressman is a Republican of Mexican origin named Juan Ciscomani, who won his seat in Congress two years ago by just a couple of percentage points. His rival is the Democrat Kristen Engel, who lost the previous contest with Ciscomani but is now back with a different message. The characteristics of that crucial district in Arizona and the themes of each campaign are a good example of the debate that will ultimately define the course of the United States. The Democratic candidate has an advantage in the urban and suburban areas of Tucson, while her rival bets on the vote of the counties south of the city, where life is markedly different from the rhythm and concerns of urban centers. From that division, the Democratic candidate has made the right to abortion the center of her campaign. The hope of Engel is that a sufficient number of women will show up to vote to defend their reproductive freedom, putting aside other concerns of public policy. The Democrats seem to be betting especially on the vote of Latin American women. Hispanic women, like those of other minorities, have been particularly affected by restrictive abortion policies, especially the historic decision that overturned the federal right to abortion. The Republican candidate's bet is very different. Ciscomani wants the election to be about border security and, secondly, about the economy. He bets that, in a state like Arizona, the crisis on the southern border will be scandalous enough to animate the conservative vote. The theme has more chances of resonating in rural areas near the border than in the city. If women and minorities show up to vote in response to the themes suggested by Engel, the Democrats will win. If border security prevails as a priority, the Republicans will win. This calculation, so clear in the microcosm of southern Arizona, will operate to a greater or lesser extent in the rest of the country. Kamala Harris has repeatedly emphasized the theme of freedoms as the center of her campaign. On the other hand, Donald Trump insists on anti-immigrant nativism from which he has built his political career. The response of the voters will determine the future of Arizona and the country.

**6 House races to watch**
The balance of power in the House of Representatives next year will likely be determined by a few competitive congressional races. Democrats need to flip four seats to take back control, while Republicans aim to expand their majority. Six key races to watch include Maine's 2nd Congressional District, where Republican Austin Theriault is challenging three-term Democratic incumbent Jared Golden. In Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, Democrat Matt Cartwright is facing Republican Rob Bresnahan. California's 13th Congressional District is another closely watched race, with Republican John Duarte facing Democratic challenger Adam Gray. In Washington's 3rd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez will face Trump-endorsed Joe Kent in a rematch. New York's 4th Congressional District features a rematch between freshman Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and Democratic challenger Laura Gillen. Finally, in Arizona's 1st Congressional District, Republican Rep. David Schweikert will face Amish Shah, a physician and former Arizona state representative.

**Thread by @EngelForArizona on Thread Reader App**
Kirsten Engel, a candidate for Arizona's 6th congressional district, is criticizing her opponent, Ciscomani, for his record on abortion, border security, and other issues. She claims that Ciscomani has consistently demonstrated a willingness to take away women's rights, cannot be trusted to secure the border, and has ties to a Christian nationalist organization. Engel also accuses Ciscomani of downplaying his involvement with the organization, which he spent 14 years on the board of. She argues that Ciscomani's record is one of extremism and partisan politics, and that Arizona cannot afford another two years of his leadership. As Engel said, 'The choice is clear. Ciscomani's record is one of extremism and putting partisan politics serving the people of southern Arizona.'

**Border, abortion focus of Ciscomani-Engel debate**
In a televised debate, Republican Congressman Juan Ciscomani and Democratic challenger Kirsten Engel discussed the key issues in Arizona's 6th Congressional District. Ciscomani emphasized the need to secure the border, citing the estimated 10-15 million people who have entered the country illegally and are untrackable. He stated, 'So what we need to do is make sure we secure our border. With that, trade gets enhanced as well (and) the immigration system can work better.' Engel, on the other hand, focused on protecting access to abortion, saying, 'This is an issue that women should be able to make with their doctor and their family. It's a person issue; it's a health-care issue.' Both candidates accused each other of mischaracterizing their positions on reproductive rights and the border.

In the latest episode of NewsTalker, the panel discussed key issues in Arizona's 2024 election, focusing on the competitive Congressional District 6 (CD6) race between Juan Ciscomani and Kirsten Engel. While Engel emphasizes pro-abortion rights, this stance may not resonate well in rural areas, according to the panel. In contrast, Ciscomani highlights his bipartisan efforts and work on the Appropriations Committee, which is crucial for funding in regions like Cochise County. Additionally, concerns were raised about Engel's limited presence in rural areas, which could impact her ability to secure necessary Democratic votes. The health of Representative Raúl Grijalva, absent from Congress since April due to cancer, was also a topic of concern, as his situation could affect the election if his condition worsens, potentially giving his Republican opponent an advantage.

**Juan Ciscomani on the defensive against Kirsten Engel in televised congressional debate**
In a televised congressional debate, Republican U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani faced criticism from his Democratic challenger, former state Sen. Kirsten Engel, over his opposition to a bipartisan immigration bill, his views on abortion, and his prior involvement with a group that seeks to restore 'Biblical principles.' Engel said, 'We have a member of Congress who's representing a border district, who has made the border security his top issue. He gets handed, on a silver platter, a bipartisan deal to make immense progress on a top issue to all of this district. And he rejects it.' Ciscomani responded that Engel had declined to call the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border a 'crisis' in the past and that the bill had 'bipartisan opposition.' Engel accused Ciscomani of rejecting the bill 'for political reasons to please his party bosses.' Ciscomani shot back that the Biden administration was to blame for the immigration crisis, and Engel went on the offensive again when the subject turned to abortion, highlighting Ciscomani's support for a government funding bill that included a provision to restrict the by-mail distribution of mifepristone. Ciscomani believes abortion should be left to the states, and supports exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. Engel supports restoring federal abortion protections that were afforded by Roe vs. Wade. Ciscomani also faced criticism for his prior involvement with the Patriot Academy, a group that describes its mission as restoring 'our Constitutional Republic and the Biblical principles that cause a Nation to thrive.'

Engel has criticized Ciscomani's record on border security and immigration reform, while Ciscomani has accused Engel of supporting extreme policies on energy and taxes.

**In critical border district, Ciscomani pairs immigrant story with tough stance on migrants**
Rep. Juan Ciscomani, a Republican, spoke to high school seniors from underserved communities in Tucson about his personal story of immigrating from Mexico as a young child. He shared how he helped support his family by translating for his parents and washing cars on weekends. Ciscomani made few mentions of his party affiliation and did not mention Donald Trump, who has made a career of demonizing immigrants. Ciscomani's story highlights his connection to the immigrant community, which he is now representing in Congress. 'As he spoke about translating for his parents during school conferences and weekends spent washing cars to earn extra money to help support his family,' Ciscomani's story emphasizes his personal experience as an immigrant. According to Ciscomani, his story is a testament to the 'American Dream' and the opportunities available to those who work hard and persevere.
