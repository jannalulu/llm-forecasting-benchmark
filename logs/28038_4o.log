**Step 1: Establish a Baseline Using Historical Data**

Historically, the Atlantic hurricane season is most active in September. On average, 1 to 2 major hurricanes form during this month. However, this is a broad historical average and doesn't account for yearly variances due to factors like El Niño/La Niña, sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric conditions.

**Step 2: Analyze the 2024 Season's Unique Characteristics**

1. **Storm Count and Intensity Predictions**: Initial forecasts predicted an above-average hurricane season with multiple major hurricanes. However, as of the latest updates, only a few named storms have formed, with fewer than initially expected reaching major hurricane status. This suggests that the season underperformed initial expectations.

2. **Current Conditions for Storm Development**: Conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures would typically support storm development. However, factors like Saharan dust and unusual atmospheric conditions have curtailed storm formation.

3. **Occurrences and Trends Through September**: Communication before October indicated that several storms might develop, but as of September, the environment was less conducive for major hurricanes. The forecasts through the middle and later parts of September suggested potential activity increase; however, historical records in the analysis do not indicate the formation of multiple major hurricanes.

**Step 3: Apply Inside and Outside Views**

- **Inside View**: Given the specific present conditions, warm waters and La Niña tend to foster hurricane development. However, the existing Saharan dust and atmospheric anomalies noted in the reports dampened these expectations.

- **Outside View**: Historically, despite variants in forecast accuracy, the occurrence of only one major hurricane in September aligns closely with the climatological average occurrence. Even in less active years, the likelihood of having at least one major hurricane emerges from historical norms.

**Step 4: Adjustments Based on New Information and Expectations**

1. **Recent Patterns**: Reports up to the end of September highlighted unexpected lulls in activities, hinting at fewer major hurricanes throughout the month.
2. **Predicted Increases and Expert Opinions**: Forecasts indicated inactivity beyond typical expectations yet maintained potential for late September and October activations.

**Step 5: Synthesis and Probability Assessment**

Considering the balance between expectations and actual reported conditions up to early October, there is a reasonably strong historical precedent for at least one major hurricane forming in September. Still, reports suggest no such activities materialized beyond early forecasts, suggesting an underperformance relative to predictions.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast whether exactly 1 major Atlantic hurricane (Category 3 or higher) occurred in September 2024, we need to review the data provided in the context of historical patterns and predictions:

1. **Base Rate of Major Hurricanes**: Historically, the Atlantic hurricane season averages 6.9 hurricanes, with about 2-3 major hurricanes annually occurring during the peak months of August to October. The possibility of having exactly one major hurricane in September depends on this distribution, but there is typically a high concentration of activity around early to mid-September.

2. **Predictions for the 2024 Season**: Various forecasts predicted an above-average season with 17-24 named storms, 8-13 hurricanes, and 4-7 major hurricanes. However, as of the reports available by early September 2024, activity was unexpectedly subdued largely due to unfavorable conditions like the presence of Saharan dust and high atmospheric pressures.

3. **Observed Conditions**: The reports indicated that by early September, there had been four named storms with one major hurricane so far in the 2024 season. There was a quiet period in late August, but some predictions pointed to a potential surge in activity toward the end of September or early October.

4. **Forecast Implications**: Given the unexpectedly quiet period and the complex meteorological factors such as lack of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and Saharan dust that suppressed activity earlier, there's uncertainty about the actual development of storms in September. The historical tendency for a resurgence in activity towards mid to late September could favor the occurrence of another major hurricane, but potentially not just one.

5. **Calibration**: Balancing the peak season expectations with the lull in activity and the late surge potential allows for a more nuanced prediction. The factors favoring and hindering activity must both be weighed realistically, with a slight inclination towards more activity predicted later in September.

Given these elements, the forecast for exactly one major hurricane in September requires weighing the likelihood of just hitting that specific number under the current trends.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To predict the likelihood of exactly one major Atlantic hurricane (Category 3 or higher) occurring in September 2024, we must thoroughly analyze available data and historic trends.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Data**: The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is in September, where historically, intense hurricane activity is expected. However, there are fluctuations. Generally, the probability of having exactly one major hurricane in September could depend on the number of predicted major hurricanes for the season. Among notable years, the occurrence of multiple hurricanes within a single month is not uncommon.

2. **2024 Hurricane Season Forecasts**: Initial forecasts predicted above-average hurricane activity with multiple major hurricanes for the 2024 season. Reports and updates from NOAA and other agencies predicted numerous storms, but actual activity, as of the latest reports, has been quieter than expected.

3. **Current Season Activity**: As of early September 2024, only a few named storms had been recorded, with one major hurricane reaching Category 3 status by the reported peak period. Factors such as Saharan dust and high-altitude warm air have been cited as suppressing agents for storm development, despite warm sea surface temperatures and a potential La Niña, which traditionally fosters active Atlantic seasons.

4. **Predictions for September**: Despite early season projections for high activity, September 2024 displayed an unexpected lull in major hurricane formation. There was mention of a burst of activity predicted for energy to build in the latter half of September, but no concrete reports confirmed this leading to additional major hurricane formations within that timeframe.

5. **Reference and Peer Forecasts**: While no explicit consensus forecasts pinpoint the exact number, historic analogs suggest variability. The data overwhelmingly narratives indicate lower-than-expected activity for 2024, especially during the peak periods.

6. **Potential Influences and Causal Forces**: Climatological factors (e.g., La Niña, warm sea temperatures) historically promote heightened hurricane activity, yet concurrent suppressing factors (e.g., Saharan dust, high-altitude temperatures) seem to have overshadowed expected patterns for this year, yielding lower occurrence rates.

Balancing the historical data, initial forecasts, recent updates, and observed activity, it is plausible to predict a low probability for exactly one major hurricane occurring in September 2024, likely as the suppressed conditions persisted throughout much of the intended peak period of activity.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 28.00% being the most likely. Probability: 28.00%.

To forecast whether exactly one major Atlantic hurricane (Category 3 or higher) occurred in September 2024, let's go through a systematic analysis:

**Historical Reference Classes:**
1. **Base Rate of Major Hurricanes:** Historically, the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September, with a significant occurrence rate of major hurricanes. From past records, the Atlantic basin frequently experiences multiple hurricanes in September. The historical average for the number of major hurricanes in September is often around 1-2, depending on various climatological factors.

**Current Situation (2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season Context):**
1. **Predictions for 2024:** The season was initially forecasted to be above-average with many forecasts predicting several major hurricanes for the season. However, recent updates and analyses suggest a considerable lull in tropical storm activity leading into September due to atmospheric conditions such as Saharan dust and dry air.

2. **September Activity:** News articles and meteorological updates have indicated prolonged periods of inactivity in mid to late August into early September. There were expectations of increased activity post the lull, but reports highlighted that development conditions remained less conducive during the first half of September.

**Discrepancy in Predictions:**
1. **Quiet Mid-Year Trends:** Despite early forecasts of high activity, the season had a slow start and maintained lower-than-anticipated activity levels leading up to September. Few reports confirmed storm activity in September, which could potentially lean toward only a singular major hurricane occurrence, if any.

2. **Media and Meteorological Engagement:** There has been historical precedence for underperforming forecasts, sometimes due to transient atmospheric phenomena disrupting storm formation.

**Resolution Reference:**
Understanding the resolution criteria as provided (NHC reports used as of October 1st, 2024) is key to addressing this. These would verify the exact number of major hurricanes, filtered by the World Meteorological Organization standards.

**Analytical Synthesis:**
- There's a significant probability based on the quiet trends that exactly one major hurricane might have developed in September 2024.
- Historical trends normally would suggest more than one major hurricane in a typically active September, but this year is skewed by uncharacteristic lull.

With all the factors considered, the balance between predictions and unexpected trends suggests that the likelihood of exactly one major hurricane is notable but not decisively probable given natural variability and forecasting uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To make a forecast on whether exactly one major Atlantic hurricane (Category 3 or higher) occurred in September 2024, we need to consider several factors.

1. **Base Rate of Major Hurricanes in September**: Historically, September is the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, often having a higher number of hurricanes compared to other months. The average number of Category 3 or higher hurricanes in September would provide a base rate for comparison. However, exact statistics from previous years on the frequency of exactly one such hurricane in September should be considered if available.

2. **2024 Season Forecasts**: The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was predicted to be above average, with initial forecasts suggesting 4-7 major hurricanes throughout the season. However, the actual development of the season indicated much fewer storms than predicted due to unforeseen climatological conditions such as Saharan dust and other atmospheric phenomena inhibiting storm formation.

3. **Observed Events**: By September 1, 2024, only one major hurricane had been recorded—Beryl, which occurred at the start of the season. The reports for early September indicated potential disturbances, but many articles mentioned an unexpected lull in storm activity through early to mid-September due to persistent atmospheric conditions.

4. **Probable Outcomes for September 2024**:
   - There could potentially be exactly one major hurricane if none other formed following any initial forecast of multiple storms lining up, especially toward late September into October.
   - Given that apart from Beryl, which occurred before September, the actual chances of having exactly one new major hurricane in September might be low because no other significant storms had developed by the mentioned Sept 10 peak.

5. **Trend Analysis**: With the climatological issues highlighted—dry air, wind shear, and slowed progression toward a full La Niña—the conditions seemed unfavourable for sustained or multiple hurricane formations. This likely reduced the chances of more than one major hurricane forming exactly in September.

Considering these factors, the overall probability of having exactly one major hurricane in September 2024 should be relatively low given the unexpected lulls and suboptimal cyclone formation conditions observed throughout early and mid-September.

This likely reduced the chances of more than one major hurricane forming exactly in September.

Considering these factors, the overall probability of having exactly one major hurricane in September 2024 should be relatively low given the unexpected lulls and suboptimal cyclone formation conditions observed throughout early and mid-September. 

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 18.50% being the most likely. Probability: 18.50%.

To make a forecast on whether exactly one major Atlantic hurricane (Category 3 or higher) occurred in September 2024, we need to consider several factors.

1. **Base Rate of Major Hurricanes in September**: Historically, September is the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, often having a higher number of hurricanes compared to other months. The average number of Category 3 or higher hurricanes in September would provide a base rate for comparison. However, exact statistics from previous years on the frequency of exactly one such hurricane in September should be considered if available.

2. **2024 Season Forecasts**: The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was predicted to be above average, with initial forecasts suggesting 4-7 major hurricanes throughout the season. However, the actual development of the season indicated much fewer storms than predicted due to unforeseen climatological conditions such as Saharan dust and other atmospheric phenomena inhibiting storm formation.

3. **Observed Events**: By September 1, 2024, only one major hurricane had been recorded—Beryl, which occurred at the start of the season. The reports for early September indicated potential disturbances, but many articles mentioned an unexpected lull in storm activity through early to mid-September due to persistent atmospheric conditions.

4. **Probable Outcomes for September 2024**:
   - There could potentially be exactly one major hurricane if none other formed following any initial forecast of multiple storms lining up, especially toward late September into October.
   - Given that apart from Beryl, which occurred before September, the actual chances of having exactly one new major hurricane in September might be low because no other significant storms had developed by the mentioned Sept 10 peak.
