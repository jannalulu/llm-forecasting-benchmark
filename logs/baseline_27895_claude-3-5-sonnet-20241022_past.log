Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timeframe: Less than 1 month (from now until October 1, 2024)

2. Current context:
- Alexandre de Moraes is currently a minister of Brazil's Supreme Federal Court
- He has been controversial but maintains institutional support
- Supreme Court justices in Brazil have strong job security
- No current impeachment proceedings are underway
- He's far from mandatory retirement age (75 in Brazil; he's currently 55)

3. Key considerations:
- Very short timeframe (less than a month)
- Supreme Court ministers in Brazil rarely leave office before retirement
- No immediate health concerns reported
- No current credible threats to his position
- Institutional stability currently maintained

4. Risk factors:
- Political tensions exist
- Some opposition to his decisions
- Theoretical possibility of resignation

Given:
- The extremely short timeframe
- High institutional barriers to removal
- No current proceedings or health issues
- Historical rarity of early departures
- Strong constitutional protections

My Prediction: Between 0.15% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
