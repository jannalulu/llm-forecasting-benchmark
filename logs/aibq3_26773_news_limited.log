**Gastronomic Gambit**
During the Norway Chess championship 2024, Indian grandmaster Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa craved South Indian food while in Stavanger, Norway. The organizers had anticipated this and partnered with Spisoh, Stavanger's only South Indian restaurant, as a sponsor. The restaurant's co-owner, Nitish Kamath, recommended Kozhi Milagu curry to Praggnanandhaa, who ordered it with Kerala parotta. Other Indian chess greats, like Koneru Humpy and D Gukesh, are regulars at the restaurant. Spisoh was founded by a group of Indian immigrants who wanted to bring a taste of their homeland to Norway. The restaurant has become popular not only with Indians but also with Norwegians and European travelers, and aims to uplift the Indian diaspora community by providing job opportunities to immigrant women.
