A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping espresso. The air is filled with excitement and chatter from the previous day's events.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the men's 100m dash was electrifying, but our models had it at 12.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. The conditions were perfect, yet the record remains unbroken.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models are never wrong. We factored in athlete performance trends, weather, and track conditions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And despite the buzz around the new contenders, no one surpassed Bolt's 9.63s.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's remarkable how his legacy endures. Our analysis showed that even with technological advancements, breaking that record was unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed. Until the next Olympics, Bolt's time remains the mark to beat.

They clink their cups, acknowledging both the thrill of the race and their predictive prowess.

FADE OUT.
