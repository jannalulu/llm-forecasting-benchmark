**US Stock Markets Close with Mixed Results, Tesla's Stock Price Surges**
US stock markets closed with mixed results on Wednesday: while the Dow Jones gained 0.1%, the Nasdaq 100 lost 0.2%. The phase of significant losses seems to be over. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the trading day with a gain of 0.1% at 40,974 points, bringing the 41,000-point mark within reach. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 lost 0.2% to 18,921 points. The best Dow performers were Travelers, IBM, and Boeing, each gaining around 1%. Intel and Amazon, on the other hand, were weaker. Tesla's stock price surged 4.18%, increasing the company's market value to $687 billion. This represents a gain of $28 billion, equivalent to the market value of Bayer. On Thursday, Broadcom will release its quarterly earnings. The US Federal Reserve may lower interest rates by 0.5% on September 18. Some market observers expect this, citing the weak US jobs report. Ulrich Stephan, Chief Investment Strategist at Deutsche Bank, comments, 'In an immediate reaction to the interest rate term markets, a robust interest rate cut of 0.5% was priced in for the US Federal Reserve meeting in September with a 50% probability.' The DAX continued to decline, closing 0.83% lower at 18,591 points. The MDAX of mid-cap companies fell 0.43% to 25,296 points.

**Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Tries to Jumpstart Rally**
Tesla shares jumped 4.2% on Wednesday, closing at $219.41, despite a broader downturn in large-cap technology stocks. According to technical analysis, investors should watch for several key price levels: a breakout above the symmetrical triangle and downtrend line could see shares rally to $265, while further buying could drive a move up to $300. A breakdown below the triangle could see an initial fall to $185, and ongoing weakness may spark a decline to $152, where bargain hunters may look for buying opportunities near the April 2023 swing low.

**Tesla Stock Is Slipping. Here's What's Moving Shares.**
Tesla stock is down 0.4% in premarket trading at $227.30, following a surprise gain on Wednesday. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, is also the head of SpaceX, which conducted the first-ever spacewalk by a private astronaut crew. However, this news is unlikely to impact Tesla stock. The bigger factor in Thursday's weakness is likely Wednesday's strong finish after inflation data swung Tesla stock on a wild day of trading. Shares ended Wednesday with a gain of 0.9%, but were down as much as 4.1% as investors digested the better-than-expected consumer price data. Slowing EV sales have also weighed on investor sentiment, with Tesla shipping about 831,000 vehicles in the first half of 2024, down about 7% year over year.

**Tesla Stock Price Prediction: 2024, 2025, 2030**
Tesla's stock price has been volatile in 2024, with a 15% year-to-date loss, currently trading at $216.27 per share. Despite this, the company continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, with strong sales and production numbers.

Analysts are cautious, with a Hold consensus and an average price target of $207. Morgan Stanley has the highest price target at $310, while GLJ Research is bearish with a Sell rating and a $24 price target. The next five years will be crucial for Tesla as more manufacturers enter the EV sphere. 'TSLA remains a highly volatile stock with significant upside and downside potential,' according to Benzinga. 'Investors should consider the company's risks and rewards before making investment decisions.'

**Tesla Receives 'Peer-Perform' Rating from Wolfe Research**
Tesla's stock has been given a 'peer-perform' rating by Emmanuel Rosner of Wolfe Research. The analyst believes that the company's fundamental setup for the next few months is constructive, driven by a 12% increase in deliveries in the second half of the year, which is attributed to strong demand in China and the rest of the world. Additionally, Rosner expects Tesla's gross margins to benefit from decreasing material costs, reduced Cybertruck losses, and a better fixed cost leverage, which could offset price reductions. As of September 5, 2024, the stock price on the NASDAQ is $219.41 USD, representing a 4.18% increase from the previous day.

**US Stock Markets Close with Mixed Results, Tesla's Stock Price Surges**
US stock markets closed with mixed results on Wednesday: while the Dow Jones gained 0.1%, the Nasdaq 100 lost 0.2%. The phase of significant losses seems to be over. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the trading day with a gain of 0.1% at 40,974 points, bringing the 41,000-point mark within reach. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 lost 0.2% to 18,921 points. The best Dow performers were Travelers, IBM, and Boeing, each gaining around 1%. Intel and Amazon, on the other hand, were weaker. Tesla's stock price surged 4.18%, increasing the company's market value to $687 billion. This represents a gain of $28 billion, equivalent to the market value of Bayer. On Thursday, Broadcom will release its quarterly earnings. The US Federal Reserve may lower interest rates by 0.5% on September 18. Some market observers expect this, citing the weak US jobs report. Ulrich Stephan, Chief Investment Strategist at Deutsche Bank, comments, 'In an immediate reaction to the interest rate term markets, a robust interest rate cut of 0.5% was priced in for the US Federal Reserve meeting in September with a 50% probability.' The DAX continued to decline, closing 0.83% lower at 18,591 points. The MDAX of mid-cap companies fell 0.43% to 25,296 points.

**Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Tries to Jumpstart Rally**
Tesla shares jumped 4.2% on Wednesday, closing at $219.41, despite a broader downturn in large-cap technology stocks. According to technical analysis, investors should watch for several key price levels: a breakout above the symmetrical triangle and downtrend line could see shares rally to $265, while further buying could drive a move up to $300. A breakdown below the triangle could see an initial fall to $185, and ongoing weakness may spark a decline to $152, where bargain hunters may look for buying opportunities near the April 2023 swing low.

**What Next After Tesla Stock Dropped 6% In A Day**
Tesla stock (NASDAQ;TSLA) declined by 6% in a day, closing at $211 per share. The decline is attributed to BMW beating Tesla in EV deliveries in Europe for July and Tesla's Vice President of Finance resigning from the company. This is the latest in a series of top executive departures, which could be negatively impacting the stock. Looking at a longer time period, TSLA stock has seen a decline of 10% from $235 in early January 2021 to around $210 now, while the S&P 500 has increased by 50% over the same period. However, the decrease in TSLA stock has been far from consistent, with returns of 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Tesla's recent performance has been a mixed bag, with a nearly 7% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue and a 42% drop in earnings. However, the company's energy business has been a bright spot, with storage and energy sales doubling from the previous year. We value Tesla stock at $230 per share, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.

Despite this, Intel's stock remains up 110% since the beginning of the year and 610% since the end of 2022. Analysts expect its net income to grow by 140% annually to $15 billion in the second quarter.

**Dólar Closes Higher as Interest Rate Expectations Rise**
The US dollar closed at $4.047,3, $36,47 higher than the Market Representative Rate, which was at $4.010,83. The currency touched a maximum price of $4.064,77 and a minimum of $4.031. There were 2,757 transactions worth US$1.436 million. According to a Reuters survey, the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates twice this year, in September and December, due to the solid consumer demand in the US, which could benefit the US dollar. The stock market fell due to disappointing results from Tesla, LVMH, and Deutsche Bank, which intensified concerns about the health of global companies as the reporting season accelerates. The Nasdaq 100 futures fell more than 1%. Tesla's shares fell 7% in pre-market trading in New York after reporting a fourth consecutive quarter of earnings below expectations. Deutsche Bank fell due to its first quarterly loss in four years and canceled its plans to repurchase shares. LVMH fell 6.5% after its sales in China fell during the quarter, which adds evidence that the economic slowdown is affecting European companies. The euro also fell after European data showed that private sector activity barely grew. Oil prices rose, but remained near their lowest level in six weeks. However, prices broke a three-session losing streak due to the decrease in US crude oil inventories and growing supply risks due to forest fires.
