**iPhone 16 to Overcome Overheating Issues with Graphite Thermal System**
According to The Information, some users reported overheating issues with iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models after their release. Apple solved this problem with an iOS 17 update. After this experience, Apple plans to place a larger graphite sheet in the iPhone 16's casing to prevent overheating. It was previously reported that the iPhone 16 models would have an advanced thermal management system to solve overheating issues. Apple is working on a graphite thermal system for the iPhone 16 series and may add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. Graphite is a high-thermal-conductivity material that is more effective than copper, which is currently used to cool iPhones. Apple has filed a patent application for the use of graphite in thermal management. Apple has previously changed the watch battery casing from black foil to metal, so a similar change may be made for the iPhone 16. The release date of the iPhone 16 can be found on Apple's traditional calendar, which typically releases new iPhone models in September. If there are no changes, the release date of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro will be September 2024.

**iPhone 17 to Become the Thinnest Device in Apple's History**
Apple has announced its plans to release the iPhone 17, which is expected to be the thinnest device in the company's history. The new device will likely face several challenges, including issues with durability, battery capacity, and heat dissipation. To address these concerns, Apple is working on solutions such as using high-density batteries and exploring the use of graphene-based thermal systems. The company has also applied its thin design philosophy to other products, including the M4 iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. The iPhone 17 is expected to continue this trend, with all models featuring L-shaped elements, even in the base model.

**Apple Aims to Solve iPhone 16 Overheating Issues**
Apple is aiming to solve the overheating issues in the iPhone 16. The new device will feature a larger graphite plate, which will improve the thermal management of the iPhone and enhance the user experience. Apple is also targeting to fix the issues that users experienced with the previous model. According to a recent report, the company is planning to change the internal design of the iPhone 16 models to reduce overheating concerns. Last year, Apple users experienced overheating issues with the iPhone 15 models, which were later found to be caused by a software bug rather than a hardware issue. However, the iPhone 15 Pro still experienced overheating on its launch day, which was not a good look for the company. It seems that Apple wants to avoid a similar fate for the iPhone 16, so it's taking extra precautions. The report states that the iPhone 16 models will have a 'larger graphite plate' in their casing, which will help protect against overheating. The company previously introduced its thermal management system last year, so this is not new information. The iPhone will now be more powerful than ever with the new A17 Pro and upcoming A18 Pro chips, which will allow developers to create optimized games and apps for the device. However, this will also mean that the device will generate more heat. Therefore, it's crucial for Apple to solve the problem from the root and at the right time. The new iPhone models are expected to be released in September.

**Apple Responds to Criticism: iPhone 16 to Feature Improved Cooling**
Apple has responded to criticism about the thermal issues with the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. The A17 Pro chip in these devices has a tendency to reach high temperatures, which is problematic for users who play demanding games like Death Stranding and Assassin's Creed Mirage. Apple has already released an update to address this issue, and it is expected that the next generation of iPhones will have changes to the internal design to improve cooling. According to The Information, the iPhone 16 will feature a 'larger graphite plate' to effectively dissipate heat. This aligns with previous leaks, as Apple was reportedly working on improving cooling in November last year. The iPhone 16 series is expected to be unveiled in September.

**Apple Developing Foldable iPhone with Possible 2026 Release**
According to a report by The Information, Apple is developing a foldable iPhone, with a possible release in 2026. The design will be similar to Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip, with a horizontal folding mechanism. Apple has a history of canceling projects at advanced stages, so it's unclear if the foldable iPhone will be released. If it is, it would be a significant change in the development of Apple's smart phones. Apple has previously explored foldable designs with different dimensions, but the V68 project indicates that the initiative has entered a formal development phase with suppliers. The production of a standard iPhone typically takes around 24 months, but a foldable iPhone may require additional time due to its innovative technology. The report also mentioned technical challenges, including the need to eliminate the visible crease on the foldable screen, which Apple has been trying to solve for a long time. The designers aimed to create a foldable iPhone that is half as thick as current models when folded. This may have been achieved through the development of a thinner iPhone, codenamed D23. Another challenge is providing enough valuable features to justify the higher price of the foldable iPhone. Looking to the future, The Information reported that many iPhone upgrades are in preparation, including a new camera and advanced video recording capabilities. Additionally, the iPhone 16 is expected to have a smaller size, making it easier for technicians to replace the battery. Some models will also feature a larger graphite layer to help manage heat and advanced optical zoom lenses previously available only in the iPhone 15 Pro model.

**New iPads Flee, Including Two That Will Arrive Soon**
Apple may be releasing new iPad models, including two that will arrive soon. A recently discovered backend code may have revealed several iPad models coming from Apple. The code, found by Nicolás Álvarez and published by Aaronp613 on X, lists four iPad models. The code suggests that the new iPad (11th generation) will have an A16 processor, while the iPad mini (7th generation) may have an A17 processor. The new Apple Intelligence features require a processor A17 Bionic or newer, so it would be logical for the new iPad mini to have at least this processor to support the new technology. However, the next iPad mini may instead have an M2 processor, present in the iPad Air (2024). The code also mentions tablets that Apple has likely decided to discontinue, including an updated standard iPad that goes beyond the recently discontinued (9th generation) and an iPad Pro M3. The current iPad was introduced in October 2022, while the last iPad mini was unveiled in October 2021. If Apple decides to release new versions of these models, it will likely happen in October, following the announcement of the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to take place in September.

**iPhone 16 to Feature More Powerful Battery with Increased Energy Density**
Apple is expected to introduce a new iPhone 16 with a more powerful battery, thanks to increased energy density in the batteries, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The increased energy density will generate more heat, which Apple is addressing by encasing the batteries in stainless steel. This will not only improve heat dissipation but also make the batteries easier to replace. This feature complies with new European Union regulations requiring easier battery replacement in electronic devices. The use of stainless steel for the battery casing is a significant change from previous models, which used less resistant materials that offered limited protection against heat. The adoption of stainless steel not only improves thermal management but also provides overall device durability. The iPhone 16, with its introduction of Apple's artificial intelligence, may represent a significant turning point in smartphone battery technology. The next generation of smartphones will be presented in September.
