Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Today is July 23, 2024
- Target date is September 30, 2024
- We have about 2 months to resolution

2. Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- Public comment period just ended with overwhelming support (75.9-91% favorable)
- Final ruling expected around August 20, 2024
- Biden administration prioritizing completion before January 2025
- Strong political incentive to complete before election
- Multiple governors actively pushing for quick finalization
- Rep. Blumenauer predicted completion before year-end
- DOJ might expedite by forgoing hearings

3. Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- Potential Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings could delay process
- Opposition from 11 state attorneys general
- Former DEA leaders pushing for public hearings
- GOP congressional committee attempting to block rescheduling
- IRS still treating cannabis as Schedule I
- Large volume of comments (40,000+) to process

4. Critical Decision Points:
- Whether to hold ALJ hearings (could add significant delay)
- DOJ's ability to expedite process
- Political opposition impact

5. Timeline Assessment:
- Final ruling expected August 20
- 30-day effectiveness period after publication
- Would meet September 30 deadline if no major delays

Given the strong administrative momentum, overwhelming public support, political incentives, and timeline allowing for some delays while still meeting the deadline, but balanced against potential procedural delays and organized opposition, I can make a reasoned forecast.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 85.40%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Today is July 23, 2024
- Target date is September 30, 2024 (approximately 2 months away)
- Public comment period just ended with over 37,000 comments
- Final ruling expected around August 20, 2024, with 30-day effectiveness period

2. Key Supporting Evidence:
- Strong public support (75.9-91% of comments favor reforms)
- Biden administration prioritizing conclusion before January 2025
- DOJ might expedite process by forgoing hearings
- Multiple governors and officials pushing for quick implementation
- Rep. Blumenauer predicted completion before year-end

3. Key Opposing Evidence:
- 11 state attorneys general opposing rescheduling
- Former DEA leaders requesting public hearings
- Potential administrative law judge hearings could delay process
- Republican congressional committee attempting to block rescheduling
- Constitutional challenges possible

4. Critical Factors:
- DEA's decision on whether to hold Administrative Law Judge hearings
- Large volume of comments (40,000+) to process
- Political pressure from both supporting and opposing sides
- Biden administration's desire to complete before election

5. Timeline Feasibility:
- Expected final ruling (Aug 20) + 30-day effectiveness (Sep 19) falls within deadline
- Even with minor delays, still possible before September 30
- Main risk is if ALJ hearings are required

Given the advanced stage of the process, strong administrative support, and timeline alignment, but considering potential legal and administrative hurdles:

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Points for Higher Probability:
1. The DEA's public comment period has just ended (July 2024) with overwhelming support (75.9-91% favorable)
2. Biden administration has strong political incentive to complete this before the 2024 election
3. Final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, with 30-day implementation period
4. Multiple high-level officials (Rep. Blumenauer, governors) predict completion by year-end
5. White House drug czar has publicly supported the change
6. HHS and DOJ have already recommended the change

Key Points for Lower Probability:
1. Potential administrative law judge (ALJ) hearings could delay process
2. Opposition from 11 state attorneys general requesting public hearings
3. Former DEA leaders pushing for public hearings
4. Republican congressional committee attempting to block rescheduling
5. Constitutional challenges could delay implementation
6. Historical precedent shows cannabis policy changes often face delays

Timeline Analysis:
- Current stage: Public comment period just ended
- Expected ruling: ~August 20, 2024
- Implementation period: 30 days
- Target deadline: September 30, 2024
- Buffer: ~10 days

The most critical period is between now and August 20. If the DEA proceeds directly to final ruling without hearings, there's high probability of completion before deadline. If hearings are required, probability drops significantly.

Given strong political support, overwhelming public comments in favor, and tight but achievable timeline if process moves directly to ruling, balanced against potential procedural delays and opposition:

My Prediction: Between 65.40% and 85.60%, with 75.50% being the most likely. Probability: 75.50%.
