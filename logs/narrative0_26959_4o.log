Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, the VP debate didn't happen. Our models had it at 15.25% for a "Yes." Given the CPD's cancellation and the impasse between Trump's and Harris's teams, it was expected.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. The shift in Harris's role to the presidential nominee added complexity. Our models factored in her agreement with CBS, but once she became the Democratic nominee for president, those plans fell through.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The dynamics changed significantly post-August. The probability of a debate happening was always slim. It's fascinating how these variables play out.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. It underscores the influence of political strategy over traditional debate formats. Our models never miss.

They exchange knowing nods, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did the vice presidential debate happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 32.45%. The CPD’s cancellation and the impasse between the campaigns were strong indicators.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the shift in dynamics with Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee really threw a wrench in the works.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The lack of a finalized VP pick and the ongoing debate negotiations between the campaigns were pivotal.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how our models accounted for those variables. No debate this time, but the election season is far from over.

*They nod, glancing at the screen showing the latest election news.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did a vice presidential debate happen before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, it didn't. Our models had it at 23.45%. The CPD's cancellation in June and the impasse between Harris and Trump's campaigns were strong indicators.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Harris's shift to presidential nominee status really threw a wrench in the plans. The lack of a finalized VP pick by August was another red flag.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The networks tried, but without both nominees, it wasn't feasible. Our models were spot on again.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how the dynamics of this election cycle played out. No debate, but plenty of drama.

Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did we see a Vice Presidential debate before October 1st, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the initial plans, the CPD's cancellation and the impasse between the campaigns made it unlikely.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Harris's shift to the presidential race and the unresolved VP pick further complicated matters.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The absence of a formal, live debate between the VP nominees sealed the deal.
