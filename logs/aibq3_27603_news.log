**An Update on the New mpox Epidemic: Q&A with Dr. Daniel Lucey**
Dr. Daniel Lucey, a clinical professor of medicine at Geisel and internationally known infectious disease specialist, provided an update on the mpox epidemic. mpox is a DNA orthopoxvirus related to smallpox, causing skin lesions, but is considered less deadly and less contagious. The virus spreads through close contact and can be transmitted from infected animals to people. People who are immunocompromised are at higher risk for severe mpox. The Africa CDC declared mpox a 'public health emergency of continental security' due to the worsening situation on the continent, with over 40,000 cases and 1,500 deaths reported. The WHO has declared mpox a 'public health emergency of international concern' twice, with the first time being in July 2022 for Clade II mpox. There are effective vaccines, including the smallpox vaccine, which protects against mpox, and the FDA-licensed vaccine for mpox. However, the vaccine has not been available in Africa where it is most needed. The Africa CDC has pledged to deliver 10 million mpox vaccine doses by 2025, with a partnership with Bavarian Nordic and support from the European Union, U.S. and Japan. Dr. Lucey emphasized the need for a more effective and comprehensive global response to the epidemic, with a focus on equitable vaccine access and understanding the transmission routes and severity of the new Clade 1b.

**Mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Reorganizing the Response**
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the epicenter of the measles outbreak (formerly known as 'monkeypox' or 'mpox'), with 17,342 suspected cases and 3,167 laboratory-confirmed cases reported, as well as 582 deaths. Dr. Louis Albert Massing, Territorial Medical Coordinator of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), warns that 'This is more than all cases in all of 2023.' The DRC has announced cases in 26 provinces, with children being the first victims. The country is expecting vaccine donations, with the United States pledging up to 75,000 doses, the EU 215,000 doses, and France 100,000 doses. Japan has announced the withdrawal of 3.5 million doses from its stocks. The DRC plans to deploy a vaccination program in the east from October, targeting a population of 70,000 to 100,000 people, but 10 million doses are needed by 2025 to combat the rapidly deteriorating situation. The new clade 1b, which is more transmissible than the previous clade, has spread to neighboring countries, with 171 cases reported in Burundi, and the first case in Gabon has been confirmed in a young man who had returned from travel to Uganda.

**DRC Expects First Mpox Vaccines Within the Next Week**
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) expects to receive its first doses of an mpox vaccine within the next week, following promises from the United States and Japan to help combat an outbreak, said the Congolese Health Minister on Monday (19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years last week, after an outbreak in the DRC spread to neighboring countries. In a press conference on Monday, Health Minister Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba said that Japan and the United States had committed to providing vaccines to the Congo. 'We have just concluded discussions with USAID and the US government. I hope that by next week we can see the vaccines arriving,' he told reporters. Their arrival would help address a huge disparity that left African countries without access to the two vaccines used in a global mpox outbreak in 2022, while the vaccines were widely available in Europe and the United States. Earlier on Monday, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said in an email statement to Reuters that it was preparing to provide the Congo with vaccine supplies and syringes against mpox in cooperation with the WHO and other partners. 'We will offer the maximum possible support,' said Masano Tsuzuki, head of the infectious disease prevention and control division. Japanese company KM Biologics is one of the manufacturers of the mpox vaccine, while the Danish company Bavarian Nordic produces the other, called Jynneos, against the disease. The Japanese government has a stockpile of the KM Biologics vaccine. Outside of clinical trials, neither of the vaccines have been made available in the Congo or around Africa, where the disease has been endemic for decades. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is generally mild but can be fatal. Two variants are spreading in the Congo – a endemic version of the virus, clade I, and a new variant called clade Ib. The virus is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics, such as COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air.

**Japan Issues Level 1 Mpox Alert for 7 African Nations**
Japan has issued a Level 1 infectious disease alert for seven African countries, advising citizens to take precautions against mpox. The alert comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency due to the alarming rise in mpox cases, including a new strain identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'A coordinated international response is essential to stop this outbreak and save lives.' Since the new strain of mpox was first detected, over 500 people have died. The WHO reported that the less severe clade 2 mpox strain claimed 89 lives in 2022. The new strain has been detected in at least 13 African countries, including the seven nations on Japan's advisory list. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has called for wealthy nations to provide mpox vaccines to African countries, which are in short supply. Japan will supply vaccines and other products to the DRC following a request from the country.

**MinSalud Announces Actions in Response to MPOX Declaration in Africa**
The Ministry of Health announced that it will take actions in response to the World Health Organization's declaration of a public health emergency of international concern for MPOX in Africa. These actions include: strengthening and deploying specific risk communication strategies, advancing coordination with the Pan American Health Organization to ensure vaccine availability, intensifying public health surveillance for diseases that cause visible skin lesions, and strengthening capacities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The National Institute of Health will continue and reinforce laboratory and genomic surveillance of Mpox. Additionally, the ministry is alerting health institutions, insurance companies, and territorial health entities to increase promotion, prevention, and early detection of the disease. It is worth noting that, according to health authorities, no cases of the Monkey Pox type (clade I) have been identified in Colombia, which affects Africa. However, Colombia has reported 4,257 confirmed cases of Mpox (clade II) with a peak of cases during the ESPII declaration in 2022, and 109 confirmed cases in 2024, with 2 active cases and no reported deaths. The Ministry of Health, the National University of Colombia, and the Government of Japan have been working since 2022 on the study of the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of the Japanese vaccine against Mpox. Both clades of the virus can be spread through direct contact with infected wild animals, close contact, including intimate or sexual contact with an infected person, or contact with contaminated materials.

**Department of Health Responds to Mpox Rumors: 'No Suspected or Confirmed Cases'**
The Department of Health has responded to rumors of an mpox infection in the country, stating that 'there are no suspected or confirmed cases.' According to Joris Moonens, a spokesperson for the department, 'all doctors must immediately report any suspected or confirmed mpox cases in Flanders to the Department of Health.' If a case of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) is detected in Flanders or Belgium, the department will actively communicate this to the press. Until then, there are no likely or confirmed cases of the new mpox variant (Clade Ib) in Flanders. Moonens notes that there are many skin diseases and conditions that can cause symptoms such as rashes or blisters, which can be mistaken for mpox and lead to unfounded rumors. He also mentions that there have been sporadic cases of the mpox variant Clade IIb, which led to an outbreak in 2022 and is now under control. Moonens emphasizes that the risk of infection with mpox in the general population is 'very low' and that if cases of Clade Ib variant do occur, they are expected to be in people with a recent travel history.

**Singapore Says It Has Detected 13 Cases of Mpox Clade 2 Infection in 2024**
Singapore has detected 13 cases of mpox Clade 2 infections in 2024, according to the health ministry. All mpox infections in the city-state have been the 'less severe' Clade 2 infections. Meanwhile, Thailand confirmed an mpox case reported this week was the Clade 1b strain of the virus, the second confirmed case of the variant outside of Africa. The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified. As a precaution, Singapore will screen the temperatures of travellers arriving at Changi and Seletar airports from places exposed to the risk of mpox outbreaks, starting from Friday.

**Changi, Seletar airports to screen visitors for mpox**
Starting today, temperature and visual screening will be implemented at Changi and Seletar airports for inbound travellers and crew arriving on flights from places at risk of mpox outbreaks. Similar measures will be implemented at sea checkpoints. Travellers with fever, rash, and/or symptoms compatible with mpox will be referred for medical assessment. As of August 22, 13 confirmed cases of mpox have been detected in Singapore, all of which are less severe Clade II infections. The Ministry of Health advises travellers to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card, and for medical practitioners to notify MOH of suspect cases. Close contacts of confirmed cases will be offered vaccination to reduce the risk of mpox infection.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**Thailand says mpox case is more easily spread variant**
Thailand has confirmed a case of mpox, specifically the Clade 1b strain, in a 66-year-old man who arrived from an unspecified African country. According to Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, 'The test results confirm that he is infected with the Clade 1b strain of monkeypox, which is the first case diagnosed in Thailand, but this man is likely infected from an endemic country.' No local infections have been detected through contact tracing. Clade 1b has raised global concern due to its ease of spread through routine close contact. Thailand has detected 800 cases of mpox Clade 2 since 2022 but has not previously detected a case of the Clade 1 or Clade 1b variants. As a precaution, Singapore will screen the temperatures of travellers arriving from places exposed to the risk of mpox outbreaks from Friday.

**New Wayne County mpox case reported amid concern of more transmissible, severe strain**
A new case of mpox has been reported in Wayne County, Michigan, with local and state health officials confirming the infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting tests to determine whether the infection is from the clade 1 variant of the virus, which appears to cause more severe illness and has a higher rate of death than the clade 2 strain. According to Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, the county health department's director and health officer, 'based on what we know so far, we suspected this is clade 2, the same clade that caused the ongoing U.S. mpox outbreak that started in 2022.' The CDC has reported that most transmission occurs from the time when a person's symptoms begin until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed, which generally takes 2 to 4 weeks. However, the agency acknowledged that 'some people can spread mpox to others for up to four days before they have any symptoms of the virus.' The JYNNEOS vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, has been authorized to prevent smallpox and mpox, and to use after exposure to reduce the severity of the disease in people ages 18 and older. Vaccines are available at the Wayne Health Center and the Wayne County Public Health Division, and county health officials urge anyone with a new rash that they suspect might be mpox to see a health care provider right away for an evaluation and avoid close contact with others until that evaluation.

**Thailandia Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailandia has confirmed its first case of the new Mpox virus (clade 1b) in Asia. The patient, a 66-year-old European man, had traveled to Africa and arrived in Bangkok on August 14. He developed symptoms in the following days, leading to suspicion of infection. According to the Ministry of Health, the patient's 43 close contacts have been identified and are being monitored for 21 days, with none showing symptoms so far. The authorities have also implemented measures to prevent the spread of the infection, including pre-registration and screening for travelers from 42 high-risk countries. The results will be reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) as per international health regulations. As stated in the Department of Disease Control's note, 'the patient's close contacts will be monitored until 21 days have passed since the discovery of the case.'

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

**Asia's first case of new mpox strain confirmed**
Thailand has confirmed Asia's first case of a new, deadlier strain of mpox, known as Clade 1b, in a 66-year-old European patient who traveled to the country from Africa. According to the Department of Disease Control, the patient was sent to hospital with mpox symptoms on August 14 and laboratory tests confirmed the infection. The department stated, 'Thailand's Department of Disease Control wishes to confirm the lab test result which shows mpox Clade 1b in a European patient.' The WHO will be informed of the development. The department is monitoring 43 people who have been in close contact with the patient and so far, they have shown no symptoms. However, they will continue to be monitored for a total of 21 days. The WHO has declared a global public health emergency over the new variant of mpox, urging manufacturers to ramp up production of vaccines.

**WHO tries to reassure in the face of the MPOX outbreak in Africa and a single case in Europe**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a message of reassurance regarding the mpox outbreak in Africa and a single case in Europe. According to WHO Europe Director Hans Kluge, 'mpox is not COVID (...) Based on what we know, MPOX is transmitted mainly through skin-to-skin contact with MPOX lesions, including during sexual intercourse.' The WHO has stated that the use of masks is not recommended as contact is skin-to-skin. The clade 1b variant is spreading faster and has a higher mortality rate than the clade 2 variant, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The WHO has noted that transmission can occur through droplets, bedsheets, and utensils in hospitals. Africa's public health agency is actively coordinating the mpox virus response in the DRC, where 16,700 cases and 570 deaths have been reported so far this year. The DRC expects to receive over three million vaccine doses from Japan, Belgium, and the United States.

**Mpox 'is not the new COVID,' World Health Organization says**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the mpox outbreak is not another COVID-19, as much is already known about the virus, including the means to control it. Hans Kluge, the WHO's European director, said, 'Mpox is not the new COVID.' He emphasized that the spread of mpox can be reined in, and in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether. The WHO has controlled mpox in Europe thanks to direct engagement with affected communities, robust surveillance, investigating case contacts, behavior changes, and vaccination. Kluge stated that the risk to the general population is low and that there is no need for lockdowns. However, more research is required on the Clade 1b strain, which is spreading mainly through sexual transmission among adults. The WHO is not recommending the use of masks or mass vaccination, but rather recommending the use of vaccines in outbreak settings for those most at risk.

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern due to the increase in cases of the Mpox virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other neighboring countries. Hans Kluge, the WHO's director for Europe, stated, 'We know a lot about the clade II, but we still have to learn from the clade I.' He emphasized that 'we know how to fight against Mpox.' The WHO has taken similar action before, declaring a public health emergency in 2022 due to a Mpox outbreak caused by the clade IIB sub-type. The alert was lifted in May 2023. Catherine Smallwood, from the WHO's European office, noted that there has been no detected transmission of the clade Ib from animals to humans, and it appears to be a strain that circulates exclusively within the human population. Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, added that 'we know that clade I is more dangerous than clade II,' but experts are trying to determine if there is a real difference between clade Ia and clade Ib in terms of severity. The cases of Mpox have increased in the Congo, with 16,700 diagnoses and over 570 deaths reported, according to the country's health minister, Samuel-Roger Kamba. 'We are talking about a continental emergency,' he stated. The WHO has urged affected territories to implement vaccination programs, and several countries, including the US and Japan, have pledged to send vaccines to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

**WHO: Mpox virus 'not a new COVID-19', says Dr. Catherine Smallwood**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the mpox virus is not a new COVID-19. According to Dr. Catherine Smallwood, the WHO's emergency response lead, 'the clade 1a is what we used to call the Congo Basin clade' and is generally transmitted from infected animals to humans. However, she noted that 'we have not isolated or detected any zoonotic transmission of the clade 1b'. The expert believes that the clade 1b is a strain that circulates exclusively among humans and may be more transmissible between humans. A WHO spokesperson in Geneva, Tarik Jasarevic, stated that 'we know that the clade 1 is more dangerous than the clade 2', but the experts are now trying to determine if there is a real difference in severity between clade 1a and clade 1b. He added that 'it's only recently that we discovered the clade 1b, which is spreading quickly (...) but we are not yet sure of its severity'. According to Dr. Kluge, the risk to the general population is 'low', although the modes of transmission of the virus 'are not yet very clear'. He also stated that 'will we have to confine ourselves like in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is clearly no'. The WHO spokesperson also stated that the organization does not recommend wearing masks and 'we do not recommend mass vaccination. We recommend using vaccines in case of an epidemic for high-risk groups'. The WHO has already used two vaccines: the MVA-BN from the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic and the LC16 produced for the Japanese government.

**What a new mpox outbreak means for Massachusetts**
The World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency due to the rising number of mpox infections in Africa. Dr. Katherine Gergen Barnett, vice chair of primary care innovation and transformation at Boston Medical Center, warns that the global response to mpox needs to be improved, citing the need for effective vaccines and global distribution. She notes that mpox, a pox virus, is spreading through contact with sores, and the highest rates of infection are in men who have sex with men. The latest infections are a new, more contagious strain called clade 1b. Gergen Barnett emphasizes that 'we cannot just be watching this like a ticker tape on the news … It actually needs to be a call to action.' The good news is that vaccines and medications for mpox are available, but they need to be distributed to countries in need, particularly in Africa. The U.S. and Japan have pledged to send doses to Congo, and doctors in Boston are educating themselves on how to identify mpox in its latest forms.

**WHO Declares Monkeypox an International Public Health Emergency: Vaccination Recommendations**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the monkeypox virus (mpox) an international public health emergency. The current outbreak is caused by the clade 1, the most contagious and dangerous strain identified so far. The WHO has urged an increase in the production of vaccines against mpox to slow the spread of the virus. By August 2024, the WHO recommends two vaccines against 'monkeypox', which have been used in recent years: the MVA-BN, produced by the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, and the Japanese LC16. According to the WHO, the following groups should be vaccinated: healthcare workers with a risk of exposure, people with multiple sexual partners, individuals who work in the disinfection of surfaces in specific locations where high-risk sexual activities take place, and those who have had direct contact with an infected person. Additionally, the WHO recommends vaccination for men who have sex with men, as in 2022, over 99% of cases in the US were in this group. The vaccine should not be used in people with certain health conditions, such as a weakened immune system, skin conditions, or those receiving immunosuppressive treatments. Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson, stated that there are 500,000 doses of MVA-BN in stock, and 2.4 million more could be produced quickly if there is a commitment from buyers. By 2025, 10 million more doses could be produced, pending purchase requests. The vaccination is recommended in two doses with an interval of at least 28 days. However, if someone is already infected, a single dose is recommended after the first four days of close contact. If a person has symptoms compatible with this infection, the administration of the vaccine is not recommended.

**DRC Expects First Mpox Vaccines Within the Next Week**
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) expects to receive its first doses of an mpox vaccine within the next week, following promises from the United States and Japan to help combat an outbreak, said the Congolese Health Minister on Monday (19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years last week, after an outbreak in the DRC spread to neighboring countries. In a press conference on Monday, Health Minister Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba said that Japan and the United States had committed to providing vaccines to the Congo. 'We have just concluded discussions with USAID and the US government. I hope that by next week we can see the vaccines arriving,' he told reporters. Their arrival would help address a huge disparity that left African countries without access to the two vaccines used in a global mpox outbreak in 2022, while the vaccines were widely available in Europe and the United States. Earlier on Monday, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said in an email statement to Reuters that it was preparing to provide the Congo with vaccine supplies and syringes against mpox in cooperation with the WHO and other partners. 'We will offer the maximum possible support,' said Masano Tsuzuki, head of the infectious disease prevention and control division. Japanese company KM Biologics is one of the manufacturers of the mpox vaccine, while the Danish company Bavarian Nordic produces the other, called Jynneos, against the disease. The Japanese government has a stockpile of the KM Biologics vaccine. Outside of clinical trials, neither of the vaccines have been made available in the Congo or around Africa, where the disease has been endemic for decades. Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and symptoms similar to the flu, is generally mild but can be fatal. Two variants are spreading in the Congo – a endemic version of the virus, clade I, and a new variant called clade Ib. The virus is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics, such as COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air.

**WHO Warns Against Unnecessary Travel Restrictions Amid Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated on Monday (19) that imposing general travel and trade restrictions in response to the mpox (monkeypox) outbreak would have an unnecessary impact on local, regional, or national economies. The statement was made in the context of the WHO's recommendations to address the current outbreak, which was elevated to the highest level of global alert last week. The WHO also recommended that countries establish or strengthen cross-border arrangements for surveillance and case management, as well as provide information to travelers, avoiding restrictive measures that could harm the economies of affected African countries. Since the outbreak began in January 2023, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reported 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths, mainly among children. In addition, since July 2024, cases of mpox caused by the 1b clade of MPXV have been detected in four neighboring countries of the DRC that had not previously reported cases: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. This clade is considered the most severe type of virus. In light of this scenario, the WHO also recommended intensifying vaccination campaigns, emphasizing the need to prepare and implement immunization strategies, especially in areas that have recently reported cases. Vaccine availability is limited, and doses need to be prioritized for regions with higher transmission, such as the mentioned African countries. The DRC is expected to receive more vaccines next week, with the support of the United States and Japan. Last Friday (16), the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, one of the few manufacturers of the mpox vaccine, requested urgent approval for its vaccine for adolescents. The vaccine, known as Jynneos (or Imvamune/Imvanex), is currently intended for adults aged 18 and over. However, the Danish company reported that provisional results from a clinical study indicated that the vaccine is equally effective in adolescents, with a similar safety profile to that observed in adults.

**US and Japan Donate Vaccines to Combat Mpox Outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo**
The Democratic Republic of Congo's Minister of Health, Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba, announced that 3 million doses of the mpox vaccine are needed. The US and Japan have pledged to donate vaccines to the country, with the first doses from the US on their way to help combat a mpox outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared last week that the disease constitutes a global public health emergency for the second time in two years due to the rapid expansion in Africa of a new variant known as clade Ib. Interestingly, none of the mpox vaccines are available in the Congo or the rest of Africa outside of clinical trials, despite the disease being endemic in the region for decades. The WHO has reported over 17,000 cases of mpox and over 500 deaths worldwide this year. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) has announced that it has up to $500 million available to send vaccines to countries affected by the growing outbreak. The Democratic Republic of Congo, in central Africa, accounts for over 96% of the approximately 17,000 mpox cases reported worldwide this year, as well as some 500 deaths. According to the WHO, many of the most vulnerable are not aware of the existence or risk of this disease. There are two variants of the mpox virus: the more severe, clade 1, is found in the Congo region, while the less severe, clade 2, is present in West Africa. The global outbreak of the clade 2 variant spread mainly through sexual contact, while clade 1 is transmitted more commonly through direct contact, especially among children, according to reports from the Swedish agency. The initial symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, swelling, back pain, chills, fatigue, lymph node inflammation, and muscle pain. Once the fever subsides, rashes may appear, starting on the face and spreading to other parts of the body, such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. These rashes, which can cause intense itching or pain, go through several stages before forming scabs that eventually fall off, potentially leaving scars. Infection usually resolves on its own within 14 to 21 days, although in severe cases, lesions can cover the entire body, especially the mouth, eyes, and genitals.

**EU Declines Border Controls and Widespread Vaccination for Mpox**
The European Union's Committee for the Safety of Medicines (CSS) has announced that there is no need for border controls or widespread vaccination against mpox, as the risk of transmission of the two known variants of the disease in the EU is low. The CSS made this recommendation after consulting with the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization, and the African Union's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. However, it is recommended that people in high-risk groups, such as sexual partners and cohabitants of infected individuals, as well as caregivers and healthcare professionals without proper protective equipment, be vaccinated. The only European country with a case of imported mpox clade 1, the more dangerous variant of the disease, is Sweden, which detected a case in November 2023 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on August 14, 2023, due to the spread of the disease in 13 African countries. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm considers the cases of mpox clade 1 imported to represent a moderate risk, but a high risk for travelers in the most affected areas in Africa. In the Congo, 15,664 cases have been diagnosed since January of this year, resulting in 548 deaths, with the majority of deaths occurring in the Congo, where the disease is endemic. The mortality rate of the clade 1 variant of this zoonosis varies between 1% and 10%. The disease is transmitted through close contact with infected individuals or objects and clothing used by infected individuals in both variants of the previously known monkeypox. An epidemic affecting around 100,000 people with the less dangerous variant of mpox - clade 2 - led the WHO to declare an international emergency alert in late July 2022, which lasted until May 2023. There are four vaccines, designed for smallpox, licensed in Europe, Russia, the United States, Canada, and Japan, with prices ranging around €100, but usable for mpox prevention. The Danish company Bavarian Nordic, with vaccines licensed in Europe, the United States, and Canada, has the largest stock immediately available with 300,000 vaccines. The company provided 175,420 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine to the European Union's Emergency Response Authority last week for delivery to the health agency of the African Union, and donated 40,000 units to this entity based in Addis Ababa. Bavarian Nordic has requested authorization from the European Medicines Agency to administer the vaccine to adolescents between 12 and 17 years old, and the eventual authorization will allow vaccination of this age group in the next quarter. Bavarian Nordic is preparing to conduct tests in the Congo and Uganda in the fourth quarter of this year on the effectiveness of the vaccine in children between 2 and 12 years old, despite the war in Eastern Congo and the civil war in Sudan, which will make or complicate effective vaccination campaigns.

**DRC Requests Japan for Mpox Vaccine Supplies Amid Worst Outbreaks**
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has requested Japan for Mpox vaccine supplies and syringes due to the worst outbreaks of the disease in the central African country. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is preparing to provide the vaccines and syringes to the DRC in collaboration with the World Health Organization and other partners, as stated in an email to Reuters on Monday. 'We intend to provide as much support as possible,' said Masano Tsuzuki, Director of the Department of Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. Japan has a stockpile of the KM Biologics Mpox vaccine, and the Danish company Bavarian Nordic also produces a vaccine called Jynneos against the disease. Neither of these vaccines has been available outside of clinical trials in the Congo or across Africa, where the disease has been endemic for decades. Last week, the WHO declared a global health emergency for the second time in two years due to the outbreak of the disease in the DRC, which has spread to neighboring countries. Mpox, a viral infection causing pustular lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can be fatal. In the Congo, two strains are currently circulating: the endemic form of the virus, Clade I, and a new variant, Clade Ib. The virus is transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics like COVID-19, there is no evidence that it spreads easily through the air.

Health officials in Pakistan have confirmed that the mpox case announced last week was not the new Clade 1b strain spreading through Africa. According to the health ministry, the virus has been classified as Clade 2b, which was primarily associated with mpox infections that surged worldwide in May 2022, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men. The World Health Organization declared the rapid spread of the new Clade 1b strain in Africa a public health emergency of international concern last week. As of now, there have been no reported cases of Clade 1b in Pakistan, and the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is primarily associated with Clade 1b.

**Japan Issues Level 1 Mpox Alert for 7 African Nations**
Japan has issued a Level 1 infectious disease alert for seven African countries, advising citizens to take precautions against mpox. The alert comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency due to the alarming rise in mpox cases, including a new strain identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'A coordinated international response is essential to stop this outbreak and save lives.' Since the new strain of mpox was first detected, over 500 people have died. The WHO reported that the less severe clade 2 mpox strain claimed 89 lives in 2022. The new strain has been detected in at least 13 African countries, including the seven nations on Japan's advisory list. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has called for wealthy nations to provide mpox vaccines to African countries, which are in short supply. Japan will supply vaccines and other products to the DRC following a request from the country.

**WHO Urges Increased Production of Mpox Vaccines**
The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging an increase in the production of vaccines against mpox (monkeypox). The current strain, clade 1, is the most dangerous and contagious identified so far. According to Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson, 'We need manufacturers to increase their production so that we have access to many, many more vaccines.' The WHO is asking countries with vaccine reserves to donate them to countries experiencing outbreaks. Experts recommend two vaccines, MVA-BN and LC16, which have been used in recent years. Harris stated that there are 500,000 doses of MVA-BN in stock, with an additional 2.4 million doses that could be produced quickly if there is a commitment from buyers. By 2025, 10 million more doses could be produced upon request. Harris also mentioned that the LC16 vaccine is not commercially available, but is produced on order from the Japanese government, and there is a significant reserve of this vaccine. The WHO is working with Tokyo to facilitate donations.

**Pakistan admits it cannot find mpox patient as tighter screening to be introduced at airports**
Pakistan has confirmed a single case of mpox, a viral infection, in the northern Khyber Pakhtunkwa province. The patient, who recently returned from a Gulf country, is suspected to have gone into hiding after providing samples for tests. The health ministry is carrying out contact tracing and strengthening airport screening to prevent further spread. The new strain, clade 1b, is said to cause milder symptoms with lesions on the genitals, making it harder to spot and more likely for people to infect others without knowing they're infected. According to pox researcher Jonas Albarnaz, 'clade 1b is concerning for two main reasons: it's the first clade 1 mpox virus case outside Africa, and it's associated with a more severe disease and higher mortality rates than the clade 2 virus responsible for the international mpox outbreak in 2022.'

**WHO Urges Increase in Mpox Vaccine Production to Combat Growing Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged an increase in the production of vaccines against mpox, also known as monkeypox, to combat the growing spread of a more dangerous new strain of the virus. The WHO declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert, due to the resurgence of cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other African countries. The current strain of the virus is the clade 1, the most dangerous and contagious of those identified so far. 'We need manufacturers to increase their production so that we have access to many, many more vaccines,' said Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson. The WHO has asked countries with vaccine reserves to donate them to countries with mpox outbreaks. Experts at the WHO recommend two vaccines against 'simian smallpox', which have been used in recent years. These are the MVA-BN, produced by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic, and the Japanese LC16. Harris stated that there are 500,000 doses of MVA-BN in stock, while another 2.4 million doses could be produced quickly if there is a commitment from buyers. By 2025, another 10 million doses could be produced, pending a purchase request. 'The LC16 is a vaccine that is not commercialized, but rather produced on order from the Japanese government. There is a significant reserve of this vaccine,' added Harris. The WHO is working with Tokyo to facilitate donations, she said.

**WHO Calls for Unified Response to Mpox Spread**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a unified international response to the spread of the Mpox virus, but without panic. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, 'The identification of the first infection of the 1b clade of Mpox in Sweden highlights the need for countries affected to fight the virus together.' He encouraged all countries to improve surveillance, share data, and work to understand the transmission and share vaccines. The WHO spokesperson, Margaret Harris, said that there is no need to panic due to reports of people being infected by shaking hands with someone who is infected but not yet showing symptoms. 'We often have these alarmist examples, but this disease spreads through very close contact, which we see in homes, from mothers to children, through sexual relations or through the clothes or bedding of someone who is infected,' she explained. 'It's often when the blisters are visible and there is liquid in the blisters.' A day after the notification of the Swedish case, Pakistani authorities reported the first confirmed case of monkeypox in Asia since the WHO declared a global emergency for the disease. 'It was confirmed that a patient has the monkeypox virus,' said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, Sajid Shah, adding that the patient had recently returned from a Gulf country. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that the disease particularly affects marginalized communities, which need clear information on how to protect themselves and identify symptoms. They also need to be convinced to seek medical assistance when there are signs of infection, and the stigma around the disease, which is the main reason people do not seek help, must be fought. The IFRC's emergency health specialist, Bronwyn Nichol, said that it was not surprising that the virus had appeared in Europe, but that it should not discourage countries with vaccine reserves from donating to Africa, where the virus is circulating widely. According to the WHO, there are currently half a million doses of one of the two vaccines developed in rapid processes against Mpox, and 2.5 million more doses can be produced next year. Harris did not provide information on the countries that have doses of the first vaccine, although she said there are 'promises' of donations to Africa. A second type of vaccine was produced in the name of Japan, but not commercialized, and the WHO hopes that Japan will also share it. 'Monkeypox is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans, but also through close physical contact with someone infected with the virus,' said the WHO. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), with the spread of the clade I subtype, from which the new variant is a mutation, mainly confined to countries in West and Central Africa, where patients are usually infected by animals. In 2022, a global epidemic of the clade 2 subtype spread to a hundred countries where the disease was not endemic, mainly affecting homosexual and bisexual men. The WHO declared a maximum alert in July 2022 in response to this global outbreak, but lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023. The epidemic caused around 140 deaths in an estimated 90,000 cases.

**WHO Seeks Increased Vaccine Production to Combat Growing Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has requested an increase in the production of vaccines against the mpox virus, also known as 'monkeypox', to combat the growing spread of a new, more dangerous strain. The WHO declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern on Wednesday, its highest level of alert, due to the resurgence of cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries. The current strain of the virus, clade 1, is the most dangerous and contagious identified so far. 'We need manufacturers to increase their production so that we have access to many more vaccines,' said Margaret Harris, WHO spokesperson. The WHO has asked countries with vaccine stockpiles to donate them to countries experiencing mpox outbreaks. The WHO's immunization experts recommend two vaccines against 'simian smallpox': the MVA-BN, produced by the Danish company Bavarian Nordic, and the Japanese LC16. Harris noted that there are 500,000 doses of MVA-BN in stock, while an additional 2.4 million doses could be produced quickly if there is a commitment from buyers. By 2025, 10 million more doses could be produced upon request. 'The LC16 is a vaccine that is not commercially available, but is produced on order from the Japanese government. There is a significant reserve of this vaccine,' Harris added. The WHO is working with the Japanese government to facilitate donations, she pointed out.

**Japan Govt Considers Measures against Mpox**
Japanese government officials considered measures against mpox after the World Health Organization declared outbreaks in Africa a public health emergency of international concern. They agreed to gather information on infection situations in countries with confirmed outbreaks, raise awareness among people entering and leaving Japan, and maintain the inspection and medical systems established in response to the 2022 global outbreak. As one official noted, 'They confirmed how to respond for now, including ways to collect and provide information and get the medical care system prepared.'

**WHO Calls for Unified Response to Mpox Spread**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a unified response to the spread of Mpox, but without panic. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 'the identification of the first infection of the 1b clade of Mpox in Sweden highlights the need for countries affected to combat the virus together.' He encouraged all countries to improve surveillance, share data, and work to better understand transmission, as well as share vaccines. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said that there is no need to panic due to reports of people being infected by shaking hands with someone who is infected but not yet showing symptoms. 'Many times we have these alarmist examples, but this disease spreads through very close contact, which we see in homes, from mothers to children, through sexual relations or through the clothes or bedding of someone who is infected,' she explained. 'Often, it is when the blisters are visible and there is liquid in the blisters.' A day after the notification of the Swedish case, Pakistani authorities reported the first confirmed case of monkeypox in Asia since the WHO declared a global emergency for the disease. 'It was confirmed that a patient has the virus of monkeypox,' said Health Ministry spokesperson Sajid Shah to news agency EFE, adding that the patient had recently returned from a Gulf country. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that the disease particularly affects marginalized communities, which need clear information on how to protect themselves and identify symptoms. They also need to be convinced to seek medical assistance when there are signs of infection, and the stigma around the disease, which is the main reason why people do not seek help, must be fought. IFRC emergency health specialist Bronwyn Nichol said that it was not surprising that the virus had appeared in Europe, but that this should not discourage countries with vaccine reserves from donating to Africa, where the virus is circulating widely. According to the WHO, there are currently half a million doses of one of the two vaccines developed in rapid processes against Mpox, and 2.5 million more doses can be produced next year. Harris did not provide information on the countries that have doses of the first vaccine, although she said there are 'promises' of donations to Africa. A second type of vaccine was produced in the name of Japan, but not commercialized, and the WHO hopes that Japan will also share it. 'Monkeypox' is a viral disease that spreads from animals to humans, but is also transmitted through close physical contact with someone infected with the virus. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire), with the spread of the clade I subtype (from which the new variant is a mutation), which has since been mainly confined to countries in West and Central Africa, where patients are generally infected by animals. In 2022, a global epidemic of the clade 2 subtype spread to a hundred countries where the disease was not endemic, affecting mainly homosexual and bisexual men. The WHO declared a maximum alert in July 2022 in response to this global outbreak, but lifted it less than a year later, in May 2023.

**WHO Calls for Unified Response to mpox Outbreak, Warns Against Panic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a unified international response to contain the spread of the mpox virus, but warned against panic. 'The identification of the first infection by mpox clade 1b in Sweden highlights the need for countries affected to address the virus together', said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He encouraged all countries to improve surveillance, share data, and work to better understand transmission, as well as share vaccines. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said that people should not panic over reports of supposed contagion through casual contact, but that the virus is transmitted through close contact, such as in households, through sexual contact, or through contact with contaminated bedding or clothing. 'It's often when the blisters are visible and there is fluid in them', she explained. A day after the case in Sweden was reported, Pakistani authorities confirmed the first case of mpox in Asia since the WHO declared a global emergency. 'We have confirmed that a patient has the mpox virus', said Health Ministry spokesperson Sajid Shah, who added that the patient had recently returned from a Gulf country. The WHO also noted that the mpox virus disproportionately affects marginalized communities, who need clear information on how to protect themselves and identify symptoms. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) emphasized the importance of combating stigma around the disease, which is the main reason why people do not seek medical attention. 'It's not a surprise that the virus has appeared in Europe, but this should not discourage countries with vaccine reserves from donating to Africa, where the virus is circulating widely', said IFRC emergency health specialist Bronwyn Nichol. According to the WHO, there are currently half a million doses of one of the two vaccines developed against mpox, with a potential production of 2.5 million additional doses next year. Harris did not provide information on which countries have doses of the first vaccine, but said there are 'promises' of donations to Africa. A second type of vaccine was produced on order from Japan, but has not been commercialized, and the WHO hopes that this country will also be able to share them.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden Confirms First Case Of Deadly Clade I Variant Of Mpox Strain Circulating In Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the contagious mpox strain, originating from central and eastern Africa. This marks the first known infection of this strain outside the African continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency, and authorities are closely monitoring the situation to prevent further transmission and ensure public health safety. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, 'It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.' The WHO has reported a concerning rise in Mpox cases in Africa this year, with over 14,000 cases and 524 fatalities. The international vaccine group Gavi has up to $500 million to spend on sending vaccines to affected countries in Africa, but there may be a delay due to WHO approval. Health experts warn that clade 1 and its variant, clade 1b, can lead to more severe symptoms than clade 2.

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Mpox outbreak in Africa: Immediate risk to Singapore is low, says Health Ministry**
Singapore's Health Ministry has stated that the immediate public health risk from the mpox outbreak in Africa is low. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), all mpox infections detected in Singapore have been the milder Clade II infections, mostly during the 2022-2023 global outbreak. As of July 27, there were 10 mpox cases in Singapore, and 32 cases in 2023. The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years. MOH has informed medical practitioners and healthcare institutions to be vigilant in detecting and reporting all mpox cases, including those suspected of Clade I infections. Travellers are required to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card for early detection. Suspected Clade I cases will be isolated in hospitals, and close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined and monitored for up to 21 days.

**MinSalud Announces Actions in Response to MPOX Declaration in Africa**
The Ministry of Health announced that it will take actions in response to the World Health Organization's declaration of a public health emergency of international concern for MPOX in Africa. These actions include: strengthening and deploying specific risk communication strategies, advancing coordination with the Pan American Health Organization to ensure vaccine availability, intensifying public health surveillance for diseases that cause visible skin lesions, and strengthening capacities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The National Institute of Health will continue and reinforce laboratory and genomic surveillance of Mpox. Additionally, the ministry is alerting health institutions, insurance companies, and territorial health entities to increase promotion, prevention, and early detection of the disease. It is worth noting that, according to health authorities, no cases of the Monkey Pox type (clade I) have been identified in Colombia, which affects Africa. However, Colombia has reported 4,257 confirmed cases of Mpox (clade II) with a peak of cases during the ESPII declaration in 2022, and 109 confirmed cases in 2024, with 2 active cases and no reported deaths. The Ministry of Health, the National University of Colombia, and the Government of Japan have been working since 2022 on the study of the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of the Japanese vaccine against Mpox. Both clades of the virus can be spread through direct contact with infected wild animals, close contact, including intimate or sexual contact with an infected person, or contact with contaminated materials.
