To forecast this question, I'll examine the key evidence and arguments, then provide a probability range.

Key evidence for rescheduling before Sept 30, 2024:

1. The Biden administration initiated the rescheduling process in May 2024, with the DEA receiving over 40,000 public comments, mostly supportive.

2. Several senators, including Chuck Schumer, are pushing for prompt finalization of the rescheduling rule.

3. The Biden administration likely wants to complete rescheduling before the 2024 election for political benefit.

4. Many state officials, including Kentucky's governor, support rescheduling.

5. There's significant public and industry support for rescheduling.

Key evidence against rescheduling by Sept 30, 2024:

1. The DEA scheduled an Administrative Law Judge hearing for December 2, 2024, which is after the September 30 deadline.

2. Some Republican lawmakers and state attorneys general oppose rescheduling.

3. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill preventing the DOJ from using funds to reschedule marijuana.

4. The rescheduling process typically takes time, and there are only about 4 months left until the deadline.

5. The IRS recently reminded taxpayers that marijuana remains a Schedule I substance, suggesting no imminent change.

Balancing the evidence:

The Biden administration seems committed to rescheduling, but the December 2 hearing date is a significant barrier. While there's pressure to finalize before the election, the regulatory process takes time. The opposition from some Republicans adds uncertainty.

Considering base rates, major drug policy changes often take longer than initially anticipated due to bureaucratic and political hurdles.

Given these factors, I believe rescheduling is likely to occur, but probably not before September 30, 2024. The December hearing suggests the process will extend beyond the question's deadline.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Current status: As of August 29, 2024, cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act.

2. Timeline: The question asks about rescheduling before September 30, 2024, giving us about a month for this to occur.

3. Recent developments:
   - The DEA has scheduled a hearing for December 2, 2024, to consider rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III.
   - This hearing date is after the September 30, 2024 deadline in the question.
   - The public comment period for the proposed rescheduling has ended, with over 40,000 comments received.
   - The majority of comments (91%) were in favor of reforms, with 56% supporting complete descheduling and 35% supporting rescheduling.

4. Political landscape:
   - The Biden administration appears to support rescheduling.
   - There is bipartisan support for rescheduling in Congress.
   - However, there is also opposition from some Republican lawmakers and state attorneys general.

5. Procedural considerations:
   - The rescheduling process typically involves multiple steps, including review by the Office of Management and Budget and a 60-day review session by Congress.
   - The Congressional Review Act (CRA) suggests that the final rule will not go into effect before the November 2024 election.

6. Timing constraints:
   - The scheduled hearing in December 2024 is a significant obstacle to rescheduling before September 30, 2024.
   - Even if the administration wanted to expedite the process, the required procedural steps make it highly unlikely to complete before the deadline.

7. Historical precedent:
   - Major drug policy changes typically take years to implement, not months.

Given these factors, the probability of cannabis being removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024, appears very low. The scheduled hearing in December 2024 is a clear indicator that the process will not be completed by the end of September. While there is strong support for rescheduling, the procedural and legal requirements make it virtually impossible to achieve in the given timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Current status: Cannabis is currently a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act.

2. Proposed change: The Biden administration has proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III.

3. Timeline: The question asks about removal from Schedule I before September 30, 2024.

4. Process: Rescheduling requires a complex administrative process involving multiple agencies.

Key factors supporting rescheduling before September 30, 2024:

1. Administrative push: The Biden administration initiated the rescheduling process in May 2024, showing commitment to the change.

2. Public support: Over 40,000 comments were submitted, with 91% favoring reforms (56% supporting complete descheduling, 35% supporting rescheduling).

3. Political motivation: The Biden administration may want to complete the process before the 2024 election for political gain.

4. Senate support: Several senators, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, are urging the DEA to "promptly finalize" the rescheduling rule.

5. State-level momentum: Many states have already legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use, creating pressure for federal change.

Factors against rescheduling before September 30, 2024:

1. Administrative hurdles: The rescheduling process involves multiple agencies and can be time-consuming.

2. Opposition: 11 GOP state attorneys general and some Republicans in Congress are resisting the rule change.

3. Potential delays: The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, which is after the September 30 deadline.

4. Legislative interference: The House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill that prevents the Department of Justice from rescheduling marijuana.

5. Regulatory caution: Agencies like the NTSB have expressed concerns about potential impacts on drug testing procedures.

Timeline analysis:
The public comment period ended in July 2024. Typically, agencies take several months to review comments and finalize rules. The scheduled ALJ hearing in December 2024 suggests that the process may extend beyond September 30, 2024.

Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class: The rescheduling of controlled substances is rare, but not unprecedented. However, cannabis has been a Schedule I drug since the Controlled Substances Act was enacted in 1970.

2. Current status: As of August 29, 2024, cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I drug.

3. Timeline: The question asks about rescheduling before September 30, 2024, giving just over a month for this change to occur.

4. Recent developments:
   - The DEA has scheduled a hearing for December 2, 2024, to consider rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III.
   - This hearing date is after the September 30, 2024 deadline in the question.
   - The public comment period for the proposed rescheduling has ended, with over 40,000 comments received.
   - The Biden administration seems supportive of rescheduling, but there is significant opposition from some Republican lawmakers.

5. Procedural hurdles:
   - The DEA must consider public comments and conduct the scheduled hearing.
   - After the hearing, a final rule must be drafted, reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, and potentially subject to a 60-day review by Congress.
   - These steps typically take several months to complete.

6. Political considerations:
   - The upcoming presidential election in November 2024 may create pressure to finalize the decision before a potential change in administration.
   - However, the scheduled December hearing suggests that the process will not be completed before the election.

7. Legal and regulatory environment:
   - While there is momentum towards rescheduling, the process is complex and time-consuming.
   - The IRS has recently reminded taxpayers that cannabis remains a Schedule I substance until official rescheduling occurs.

8. Balancing evidence:
   - The strongest evidence for rescheduling before September 30, 2024, is the Biden administration's support and the potential desire to complete the process before the election.
   - The strongest evidence against is the scheduled December hearing date and the typical timeline for such regulatory changes.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Current status: Cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug.

2. Proposed change: The Biden administration has proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III.

3. Timeline: The question asks about removal from Schedule I before September 30, 2024.

4. Process: Rescheduling requires a formal process involving multiple agencies and public comment periods.

Evidence supporting rescheduling before September 30, 2024:

1. The Biden administration initiated the rescheduling process in May 2024.
2. The public comment period ended in July 2024, with over 40,000 comments submitted.
3. The majority of public comments (75.9% to 91%, depending on the source) supported rescheduling.
4. Several senators, including Chuck Schumer, have urged the DEA to "promptly finalize" the rescheduling rule.
5. The Biden administration may want to complete the process before the 2024 election for political reasons.

Evidence against rescheduling before September 30, 2024:

1. The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, which is after the September 30 deadline.
2. There is significant opposition from Republican lawmakers and some state attorneys general.
3. The process typically takes several months to years to complete.
4. The final rule will be subject to a 60-day review session by Congress before going into effect.
5. The IRS has reminded taxpayers that cannabis remains a Schedule I substance until the final rule is published.

Balancing the evidence:

The rescheduling process is clearly underway and has strong support from the Biden administration and many lawmakers. However, the scheduled ALJ hearing in December 2024 is a significant obstacle to completing the process before September 30, 2024. The hearing and subsequent steps (including the 60-day Congressional review) make it highly unlikely that cannabis will be officially removed from Schedule I before the specified date.

While there's a possibility that the process could be expedited (as suggested by some sources), the formal steps required and the opposition from some quarters make this unlikely. The IRS statement also suggests that the change is not imminent.

Given these factors, I estimate a low probability of cannabis being removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024. However, the ongoing process and strong support mean the probability is not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

The rescheduling process is clearly underway and has strong support from the Biden administration and many lawmakers. However, the scheduled ALJ hearing in December 2024 is a significant obstacle to completing the process before September 30, 2024. The hearing and subsequent steps (including the 60-day Congressional review) make it highly unlikely that cannabis will be officially removed from Schedule I before the specified date.

While there's a possibility that the process could be expedited (as suggested by some sources), the formal steps required and the opposition from some quarters make this unlikely. The IRS statement also suggests that the change is not imminent.

Given these factors, I estimate a low probability of cannabis being removed from Schedule I before September 30, 2024. However, the ongoing process and strong support mean the probability is not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Current status: Cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug.

2. Proposed change: The Biden administration has proposed rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III.

3. Timeline: The question asks about removal from Schedule I before September 30, 2024.

4. Process: Rescheduling requires a formal process involving multiple agencies and public comment periods.

Evidence supporting rescheduling before September 30, 2024:

1. The Biden administration initiated the rescheduling process in May 2024.
2. The public comment period ended in July 2024, with over 40,000 comments submitted.
3. The majority of public comments (75.9% to 91%, depending on the source) supported rescheduling.
4. Several senators, including Chuck Schumer, have urged the DEA to "promptly finalize" the rescheduling rule.
5. The Biden administration may want to complete the process before the 2024 election for political reasons.

Evidence against rescheduling before September 30, 2024:

1. The DEA has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2, 2024, which is after the September 30 deadline.
2. There is significant opposition from Republican lawmakers and some state attorneys general.
3. The process typically takes several months to years to complete.
4. The final rule will be subject to a 60-day review session by Congress before going into effect.
5. The IRS has reminded taxpayers that cannabis remains a Schedule I substance until the final rule is published.
