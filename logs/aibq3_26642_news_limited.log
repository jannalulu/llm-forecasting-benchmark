**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government has approved a 2% salary increase for over 3 million public employees, effective immediately, with retroactive effects from January 1. The increase will be followed by an additional 0.5% based on the inflation rate approved in January 2025, but referring to the 2024 exercise. According to Vice President and Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montero, the government is committed to maintaining its commitment to public employees, who are the main asset of administrations. The total revaluation of public employees' salaries during the 2022-2024 period will reach 9.8%. The government signed an agreement with the CCOO and UGT unions for a 2% salary increase for public employees, plus an additional 0.5% if the sum of the 2022, 2023, and 2024 IPC (Consumer Price Index) exceeds the fixed retributive increase applied during those years (8%). According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the IPCA for 2022 was 5.5%, and for 2023, it was 3.3%, resulting in a total of 8.8%, which exceeds the established limit for applying that additional 0.5% increase.

**Extension of one year for children and grandchildren of Spanish exiles to apply for nationality**
The Spanish Government will approve a one-year extension for children and grandchildren of Spanish exiles to apply for Spanish nationality. The deadline, set by the 2022 Democratic Memory Law, was originally set to expire in October 2024, but will now be extended. So far, 30,000 applications have been submitted. Minister Ángel Víctor Torres justified the extension, stating that it is necessary to 'give more time' and recalled that the law already allowed for the possibility of extending deadlines. He described the extension as a 'magnificent news' that will be applauded by those who are once again assuming their Spanish identity with all legal parameters established.'

**The Treaty and Proposals: A Web of Confusion**
On January 19, 2023, a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and France was signed by the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the French President, Emmanuel Macron. The treaty has 36 articles and has been praised as being above the Treaty of Eliseo between France and Germany, which is the cornerstone of the European Union. However, an amendment to the law on parity has been proposed, which would modify the Government Act. The amendment is being considered by the Parliamentary Committee on Equality in the Spanish Congress, and it is unclear why it is being used to modify a law that has no connection to the treaty. The article questions how no one had read the treaty carefully before it was signed and how the Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, was able to sign it without issue. The article also criticizes the Prime Minister's proposals regarding judges, journalists, and digital media, which are seen as a threat to the freedom of the press and the right to information. The article concludes by warning that the Prime Minister's proposals should be carefully considered to avoid any measures that could restrict the free exercise of journalism and the right to information.

**Spanish Government Approves 2% Salary Increase for Public Officials**
The Spanish Government has approved a 2% salary increase for public officials in 2024. The increase, which is 1.6 points below the current inflation rate of 3.6%, will be retroactive from January 1st and will benefit 3.5 million public employees. The increase will be reflected in the July salary payment. The agreement was reached with two major unions, CCOO and UGT, in October 2022. The increase is part of a deal that also includes a possible additional 0.5% increase if the IPC between 2022 and 2024 exceeds the accumulated increases in that period. The Government has fulfilled a pending commitment, but it does not guarantee the purchasing power of public employees, who have experienced four consecutive years of salary increases below inflation.

**Spanish Government to Approve 2.5% Salary Increase for Public Employees**
The Spanish government will approve a 2.5% salary increase for 3.5 million public employees on Tuesday, June 25, with retroactive effect from January.

**Spain's Air Quality Improves, but Still Falls Short of EU Limits**
Spain's air quality has improved, but still falls short of new EU limits. According to Ecologistas en Acción, 32.6 million people in Spain breathed in more pollution than allowed by the EU in 2023. The new EU limits for PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 will come into effect in 2030. Despite the improvement, many areas still exceed legal limits, with 2.9 million people breathing in polluted air. The main source of pollution is traffic, and ozone is also a significant problem. Ecologistas en Acción calls for more action to reduce traffic and implement measures to eliminate structural pollution. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' says Miguel Ángel Ceballos, coordinator of the report.

**Articles of the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' May Disappear**
The articles written by academics and doctors of science for the 'Big Russian Encyclopedia' (BRE) over the past five years may disappear on June 17. According to Olga, a BRE employee, 'The entire work of these five years, all the articles written by doctors of science, academics, it's all may disappear.' She also mentioned that the BRE editorial team (300 people) and the author collective (7,000 people) publish an equivalent of 18 printed volumes per year. However, the government refused to allocate funds for the portal's maintenance in the 2024 budget. Although the project was not stopped, the editorial team worked without pay for five months. Now, the team will stop working because they cannot pay for cloud servers. 'Putin founded us, we were a Putin project. Then some official somewhere didn't notice something, and we didn't get into the budget', said Olga. The BRE project was initially considered a high-quality alternative to Wikipedia, and around 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for its development. There are no official comments from the government or the Ministry of Digital Development on this situation yet.

**All Valencians Will Publish a Book**
The article discusses the proliferation of book publishing in recent years, with some critics arguing that there are too many books being published. The author argues that this is a natural consequence of the democratization of publishing, with the rise of self-publishing and the ease of digital communication. The article also mentions that the Valencia region has seen an increase in book publishing in 2023, with 3,557 titles published, compared to 3,491 in 2022. However, this increase is not unique to Valencia, as other regions in Spain have also seen a decline in book publishing. The article quotes several industry professionals, including Alberto Haller and Raquel Bada, who discuss the challenges of the publishing industry and the need to adapt to changing market conditions. The article concludes that the proliferation of book publishing is a natural response to the changing times, and that the industry must adapt to the new reality.

**PP to Fight for Funds for Tvitec in Cortes**
The PP will fight in the Cortes for the release of funds for Tvitec. In October 2022, the Government and the Junta de Castilla y León committed to a public-private collaboration to execute the project for the first large glass furnace in Spain, which would contribute to the reindustrialization of the Bierzo region. The Government committed to speeding up the procedures for the loan once the project's economic viability was ensured. However, the project has been paralyzed since March 2023 due to a single bureaucratic procedure in the Ministry of Industry, preventing the granting of a 130 million euro loan to the Bercian company. The PP regrets the government's lack of commitment to the reindustrialization of the region, recalling that the project would involve an investment of approximately 200 million euros and the creation of 250 direct jobs, plus 800 indirect ones. Therefore, the PP has filed a Non-Law Proposal in the Cortes de Castilla y León to require the Spanish Government to grant the loan to Tvitec before the end of the third quarter of 2024 or to seek alternative financing to make the project a reality and advance the necessary reindustrialization in the Bierzo region.

**Spain to Exceed Deficit Target, Warns Bank of Spain**
The Bank of Spain has confirmed that the Spanish government will exceed the deficit target set by Brussels for the next three years. According to the bank's new quarterly projections, the deficit will reach 3.3% of GDP in 2024, 3.1% in 2025, and 3.2% in 2026, exceeding the government's target of 3% and leading to further sanctions. The bank's analysts attribute the deficit to the government's excessive spending and record income, which increased by 6.2% in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher tax bases and the gradual withdrawal of pandemic-related support measures. The bank also warns that the government has not implemented a sustainable budget adjustment path compatible with the new European fiscal framework, which will take effect in 2025. The bank's projections also show a rising debt trend, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 105.8% in 2024, 106.2% in 2025, and 107.2% in 2026, failing to meet the European Commission's target of 60% of GDP. The bank also expects a slower labor market growth, which will prevent the unemployment rate from falling below 11% by 2026, and a widening gap in employment growth between large and small businesses.
