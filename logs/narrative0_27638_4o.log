NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, a laptop open between them displaying Tech Crunch's layoff tracker.

NATE  
So, Philip, the question was: "Before October 1, 2024, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram?" 

PHILIP  
Yes, and our models had it at 35.67%. Given the economic climate and Meta's prior layoff history, it was a possibility, but not a certainty.

NATE  
Right, and as it turns out, the answer is no. Meta, Facebook, and Instagram didn't appear in August or September 2024 on Tech Crunch's list.

PHILIP  
Indeed, sometimes the absence of an event is just as telling. Our models accurately reflected the low probability.

NATE  
It's always fascinating to see how predictions align with reality. 

They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the camera pans out.

Well, Philip, it seems the question has been resolved. Before October 1, 2024, Tech Crunch indeed reported new layoffs at Meta.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 68.75%. Given Meta's history of layoffs in 2022 and 2023, the probability was significant.

**NATE SILVER**  
The tech industry remains unpredictable, yet our models continue to adapt. The economic pressures must have played a part.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. It's a reminder of the volatility in tech. Our models are as sharp as ever, but the human element always adds complexity.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, here we are, Philip. The question on everyone's mind: Did Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 62.35% for a "Yes." Given the economic climate and past trends, it seemed likely.

**NATE SILVER**  
And it appears our models were correct. Tech Crunch did list Meta for layoffs in September 2024. The indicators were there—market pressures, previous layoff patterns.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models captured the subtle cues. It’s fascinating how predictive analytics can foretell such pivotal events.

Well, Philip, here we are. The question was whether Tech Crunch would report new layoffs at Meta, Facebook, or Instagram before October 1st.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
Yes, and as of yesterday, the Tech Crunch tracker didn’t list any such layoffs for August or September. Our models had it at 30.25%, so it's a no.

**NATE SILVER**  
(smiling)  
The economic climate's been unpredictable, but our models held steady. Meta's been restructuring since 2022, but it seems they've stabilized for now.
