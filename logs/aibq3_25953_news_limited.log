**French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to Resign on July 8**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced that he will resign on July 8 after the preliminary results of the parliamentary elections were announced. He stated that he will continue to perform his duties until a new government is formed. Attal noted that the presidential coalition 'Together' received three times more parliamentary seats than predicted, and expressed confidence that the newly elected deputies will meet the expectations of the country. The second round of the parliamentary elections in France ended on July 7, with the left-wing 'New Popular Front' leading the polls, potentially gaining 175-205 seats, while the presidential coalition 'Together' is expected to get 150-175 seats, and the right-wing 'National Union' party 115-150 seats.

**French Presidential Coalition to Withdraw 60 Candidates from Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' in France has decided to withdraw around 60 candidates from the second round of parliamentary elections. According to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, this decision was made to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. 'We made this choice after the first round in more than 60 electoral districts. This will mean withdrawing our candidates, which would have led to the election of a National Union deputy against another candidate who, like us, would have defended the values of the republic', said Attal. In the first round of parliamentary elections, the right-wing party 'National Union' received 33% of the votes, while the left-wing 'New Popular Front' received 28.5%. The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' received 22%. The second round is scheduled for July 7.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.

**The Prime Minister of France pledges to support family finances to confront the rise of the extreme right and left**
French Prime Minister Macron's coalition, 'Together', is facing a tough challenge in the upcoming parliamentary elections after losing to the far-right National Rally party in the European Parliament elections. Macron's coalition is focusing on promoting democratic values and economic management to counter the rise of extreme right and left parties. According to Attal, the policies of these parties would lead to mass unemployment. He warned, 'Let us not jump from a high height into the unknown without a parachute.' The elections will be held in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.

**France: Macron's Coalition Faces Early Parliamentary Elections**
France is preparing for early parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, following a heavy defeat of the ruling coalition 'Together' in the European Parliament elections. The coalition is focusing on presenting itself as a stronghold for democratic values and sound economic management, protecting the nation from extreme right-wing and left-wing ideologies. Atal said that the policies proposed by both the National Rally party and the new left-wing coalition, known as the Popular Front, will lead to mass unemployment. He added in a press conference: 'Let's not jump into the unknown without a safety net.'

**How is the French Prime Minister and government chosen after legislative elections?**
The French legislative elections on July 7, 2024, have resulted in a highly fragmented Assembly, with no party or coalition having a majority. The President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, has asked Gabriel Attal to remain Prime Minister 'for the moment' to ensure stability. The Constitution gives the President the power to appoint the Prime Minister, but the chosen person must have sufficient parliamentary support to avoid a motion of censure. Several scenarios are possible: a minority government, a coalition government, or a technical government. A minority government would require constant compromises and unpredictable governance, while a coalition government would require negotiations and a common program. A technical government would be a temporary solution until a more stable consensus is reached. If the parties fail to agree on a Prime Minister, France may face institutional paralysis, making it difficult to adopt new laws and budgets.

**Russia Has No High Hopes for Improving Relations with France After Parliamentary Elections**
Russia does not have high hopes for improving relations with France after the French parliamentary elections. According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Russia prefers a political force that would support efforts to restore bilateral relations, but currently, there is no clear political will to do so. The results of the elections show that no party has an absolute majority, making it difficult to form a new government. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has announced his intention to resign on Monday. The elections were held on June 30 and July 7, with the results showing the 'New Popular Front' alliance receiving 182 seats, the 'Together for the Republic' coalition receiving 168, and the 'National Union' party receiving 143.

**French Presidential Coalition to Withdraw 60 Candidates from Parliamentary Election Runoff**
The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' in France has announced that it will withdraw around 60 candidates from the parliamentary election runoff. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal made the statement at a press conference, citing the need to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. According to Attal, if the coalition's candidates were to remain on the third place, it would lead to the election of a 'National Union' candidate against another candidate. Attal believes that this move may anger French citizens, but it will protect their interests. The coalition, consisting of five parties, had over 300 candidates in the second round, with the presidential coalition receiving 22% of the votes in the first round, while the opposition party received 33%. The second round will take place on July 7.

**France's Early Legislative Elections: A Crucial Test for the Country's Future**
France is holding early legislative elections, which could lead to a government of the far-right. The election will take place on June 30 and July 7. The far-right National Union party, led by Marine Le Pen and her protégé Jordan Bardella, is expected to win more than 35% of the votes in the first round, while the centrist coalition led by President Emmanuel Macron is expected to receive less than 20%. Macron called for the elections to ensure a clear majority and stability in the government. Bardella, who is 28 years old, has been chosen to lead the National Union party and could become the youngest prime minister in Europe in over two centuries if he wins. The election is expected to be a close contest between the National Union and the left-wing coalition, which includes the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Greens. The election outcome will have significant implications for France's economy and its relationship with the European Union.

**Explainer: France election 2024: what happens if no one gets an absolute majority?**
France is holding a snap parliamentary election on June 30 and July 7, with opinion polls suggesting the far-right National Rally (RN) could win without an absolute majority. If this happens, President Emmanuel Macron would appoint the prime minister, but the constitution does not specify the criteria for this decision. The RN has said it will turn down the job if it and its allies do not win an absolute majority. Macron could try to form an alliance with mainstream parties or offer the job to the left, which could form a minority government. If the RN wins a relative majority, it could struggle to pass reforms, and if it secures an absolute majority, it would likely get the prime minister job. If none of the three main groups (far-right, centrist, and left) can govern alone or form a coalition, France could face political paralysis, with little legislation being adopted and a caretaker government running daily affairs.

**French Prime Minister Calls for 'Useful Vote' in Upcoming Elections**
French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has called for a 'useful vote' for the centrist coalition of President Emmanuel Macron in the upcoming June 30 and July 7 elections. Attal emphasized that there is no fatalism in the victory of the extreme right or left, and that more and more French people are saying they do not want to choose between the extremes. He defended the third way of the presidential majority (Ensemble pour la République) with credible proposals. Attal criticized the candidate for the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, saying that he has less of a program and more conditions, and that he is like a horse that refuses obstacles. He also denounced the extreme right and left, which promise fiscal punches at all levels to finance their budget follies. When asked about the decline in popularity of Emmanuel Macron, Attal acknowledged that many French people express anger or discontent with the dissolution of the National Assembly, but Macron was elected until 2027. He emphasized that an election is not a presidential election, but rather a vote for a prime minister, government, and majority in the National Assembly. Whatever the result of the vote, the President of the Republic will still be the President of the Republic.

**Who will be the next Prime Minister of France?**
The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron has led to a period of uncertainty in France. The upcoming legislative elections on June 30 and July 7 will shape the country's political landscape and determine the next Prime Minister. We have analyzed four possible scenarios: 1) Renaissance maintains its majority, 2) Renaissance forms a coalition with LR, 3) the far-right wins a majority, and 4) the left creates a surprise. In the first scenario, Gabriel Attal, the current Prime Minister, would lead the campaign alongside his allies from Modem and Horizon. If he succeeds in reversing the trend of the European elections and maintains the current majority, he would be a strong candidate for his own succession. In the second scenario, Emmanuel Macron would try to build a new majority by negotiating with other political forces. The future Prime Minister would be expected to embody this new majority. The far-right, led by Marine Le Pen, has a strong chance of winning a majority, but would likely choose Jordan Bardella as Prime Minister to focus on the next presidential election. The left, led by François Ruffin, has also made a surprise move by forming a common front with other left-wing parties. They will need to find a suitable candidate to lead the coalition and become Prime Minister.
