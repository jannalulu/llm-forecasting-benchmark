**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question: Did gas prices exceed $3.25 yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.67%. The data up to September 9th suggested stability, even with that slight uptick to $3.273.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The geopolitical tensions and hurricane season risks were factored in, but demand forecasts held steady.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Our models accounted for those variables, but the probability never crossed the 50% threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
I love when our Brier scores affirm our predictions. It's not just about being right, but understanding the nuances.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Agreed. On to the next forecast, then.

So, the big question—did the national gas price exceed $3.25 yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 47.85%. The price dipped slightly below expectations.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. With the price at $3.273 on September 8th, I thought it might hold.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True, but the late September crude oil supply increase shifted the odds. Our models factored in those last-minute changes.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and with no new articles after September 9th, we had to rely on historical data trends.
