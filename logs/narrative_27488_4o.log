INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - SEPTEMBER 12, 2024

The room buzzes with the energy of intense focus. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, eyes on their screens.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, the BLS finally released the numbers. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SECOND SUPERFORECASTER  
(nodding)  
Right on the money. The core CPI for August didn't dip below zero. It's 0.2%, just like July.

THIRD SUPERFORECASTER  
(smirking)  
The Fed's been relentless with those rate hikes. Inflation's stubborn, but not unexpected.

FOURTH SUPERFORECASTER  
(typing)  
And the recession whispers grow louder. This inflation persistence complicates everything.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
(sighing)  
At least our models never miss. Now, let's see how the markets react.

They turn back to their screens, ready to forecast the next economic twist.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, their faces lit by the glow of computer screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the numbers are in. Our models had it at 5.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The Fed's rate hikes finally seem to be biting. Inflation is showing signs of cooling.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But not enough for a 0.0% or less reading. The economy's resilience surprised many.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(gesturing to an article)  
Remember, by August 22, the data suggested a slowdown, but not a halt.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True. With the BLS confirming a 0.2% rise, the probability of hitting 0.0% was always slim.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning in)  
This sets the stage for the Fed's next move. Will they hold or hike again?

They exchange knowing glances, the weight of economic predictions settling in.

Well, the BLS finally released the core CPI numbers. Any surprises?

**JORDAN**  
Not really. Our models had it at 15.00%. It came in at 0.1% for August.

**ALEX**  
So, no deflationary pressures this time. The Fed's rate hikes seem to be working, but inflation's stubbornness is still a concern.

**JORDAN**  
True. With recession fears looming, the Fed's walking a tightrope. But hey, at least we didn't miss the mark.

No surprise there. The signs were all pointing to persistent inflation. Those interest rate hikes didn’t quite tame the beast.

Even with moderating trends, the recession fears are still looming. The Fed's got a tough road ahead.
