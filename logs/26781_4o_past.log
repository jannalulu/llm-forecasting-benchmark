To forecast whether William Ruto will cease to be President of Kenya before October 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors, historical context, and the current situation.

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context**: Leadership change due to protests or significant unrest is not unheard of in African countries. However, it's important to remember that actual removal from office is relatively rare and often occurs via coups or legislative processes like impeachment. Historically, Kenyan presidents have faced protests but have generally retained power unless there was significant political maneuvering or military intervention.

2. **Current Political Context**: As of now, Kenya is experiencing significant civil unrest due to public dissatisfaction with the finance bill and the subsequent government actions. Ruto's decision to dissolve his cabinet and attempt to form a broad-based government indicates his efforts to placate the protestors and regain stability. This suggests that Ruto is actively working to maintain his position, despite the current turbulence. The protests are substantial, but Kenya does not have a recent history of violent overthrows; instead, leadership transitions have been more controlled through political mechanisms.

3. **Recent News Analysis**: The articles mention large-scale protests, fatalities, and dissatisfaction with Ruto's government. However, there are also indications of Ruto's attempts to address these issues by reshaping his government and engaging in dialogue with various sectors. This dual strategy could either stabilize his government or fail, leading possibly to his resignation or removal if the pressure and protests escalate.

4. **Causal Forces and Trends**: The current unrest is driven by socio-economic discontent, primarily tax-related. Ruto has responded by dissolving his government and initially withdrawing the finance bill, indicating some ability to respond to public demands. Yet, there's substantial risk if these actions are seen as insufficient or insincere. The current context suggests a volatile situation with efforts at resolution that could go either way.

5. **External Influence**: International bodies like the UN, EU, and others are monitoring the situation. External pressure for stability may influence the internal political dynamics, which could either assist in preventing an upheaval or, if mishandled, could exacerbate tensions.

Given these factors, it seems reasonable to believe there's a tangible risk to Ruto's presidency due to the instability, but no immediate signs of an imminent ouster, such as a coup or legislative proceedings against him. His ongoing efforts to form a new government suggest a commitment to remain in power.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether William Ruto will cease to be President of Kenya before October 1, 2024, let's break the situation down using a structured approach:

1. **Base Rate Estimation**: Historically, changes in Kenyan leadership outside of scheduled elections are rare but not unheard of, with previous shifts occurring due to various political and social pressures. Ruto was elected in 2022, so a mid-term cessation would be unusual but not impossible given Kenya's history of political instability and protests.

2. **Current Situation**: As of now, Kenya is experiencing significant unrest. The articles indicate serious protests against Ruto’s administration, with large-scale demonstrations, violence, and numerous fatalities. This suggests a high level of public dissatisfaction.

3. **Ruto's Actions**: Ruto has taken drastic actions, such as dissolving his cabinet and proposing significant austerity measures, to address public grievances and maintain power. His moves to form a "broad-based government" and engage opposition members may be efforts to diffuse tension.

4. **Political Stability**: Despite the unrest, Ruto has remained in power through the crisis. His ability to reorganize the government could either stabilize his administration or fail to address deeper public discontent, potentially leading to further protests or governmental changes.

5. **External Influence and International Pressure**: The international community, including entities like the African Union, has shown concern. External diplomatic pressure could signify interest in maintaining stability to avoid further chaos.

6. **Resolution Criteria Consideration**: Given the criteria for resolution — resignation, impeachment, electoral loss, or coup — none have been met as of now. However, a continued or escalating crisis could result in one of these events.

**Balancing the Evidence**:
- **For High Probability of Ruto Ceasing Presidency**:
  - Significant unrest and calls for resignation.
  - Potential destabilization due to ongoing protests.
  - Ruto’s drastic government shake-up may not suffice.
  
- **For Low Probability**:
  - Ruto’s strategic government appointments could stabilize his position.
  - Lack of current credible evidence pointing to a coup or impeachment.

Based on the factors discussed, it's essential to project the likelihood of Ruto maintaining his position through a lens of cautious optimism weighted by current instability.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

To assess the likelihood of William Ruto ceasing to be President of Kenya before October 1, 2024, I will examine historical data on related events, the current political context, and the detailed information provided in recent news articles.

1. **Reference Class:** The historical likelihood of a sitting head of state being removed from office through means like impeachment, resignation, or coup within a year is relatively low but not negligible. Political instability, especially in connection with violent protests and strong opposition, increases this likelihood. Reference classes include previous instances of African heads of state facing intense protests, cabinet reshuffles, and political crises.

2. **Current Context Analysis:** 
   - **Political Situation:** Ruto's presidency has been marked by significant unrest due to unpopular fiscal policies and tax hikes. Protests have been widespread and violent, leading to the dissolution of his cabinet. Public discontent is high, and calls for Ruto's resignation have been widespread.
   - **Government Actions:** Ruto has attempted to quell unrest by forming a new government and has appointed opposition members, indicating attempts to stabilize the situation. However, it is unclear if these measures will satisfy the opposition and end protests.
   - **International Perspective:** The international community, including entities such as the UN and EU, is likely watching closely. They usually prefer stability but can apply pressure if human rights concerns, like police brutality during protests, persist.
   - **Economic and Social Pressures:** High debt levels, economic challenges, and the unpopular finance bill demonstrate underlying systemic issues that contribute to the unrest. These factors increase political risks.

3. **Current Evidence Weighing:** 
   - **For Ruto's Removal:** The scale of protests, cabinet reshuffles, inclusion of opposition in the new government, and public demands for resignation. These suggest instability that could lead to Ruto's removal.
   - **Against Ruto's Removal:** Actions taken to stabilize (forming a broad-based government) and engage in dialogue could quell protests, and historically, governments with similar instability have maintained power longer than anticipated.

4. **Clashing Forces and Trends:** On one hand, there is a significant push for change and reform from both domestic opposition and public protests. On the other hand, Ruto's maneuvers to calm tensions could stabilize his position. The balance of these forces will determine his political survival.

5. **Degree of Doubt:** There is a considerable degree of doubt due to the fluidity of political events and unseen variables such as further escalations in protests or potential international influences or pressures.

Based on these pieces of analysis, I weigh a moderate probability that Ruto might cease to be President, but historical inertia in favor of incumbent retention tempers this.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether William Ruto will cease to be President of Kenya before October 1, 2024, I will consider several factors including recent political events, historical patterns of presidential tenure disruptions in Kenya, and the latest news.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Historically, Kenyan politics have seen a fair amount of instability, including issues of governance and political unrest. However, outright removal of a sitting President is less frequent. Both resignation and impeachment of presidents in Kenya are rare but possible under extreme political pressure and crisis.

2. **Recent Developments**: The current unrest surrounding Ruto's presidency is significant. The violent protests and opposition against the Finance Bill 2024, along with the dismissing of his ministers and reshuffling his cabinet, underscore serious political challenges. Protests calling for his resignation are notable, but it’s unclear if they will carry enough momentum or political leverage to result in his actual removal from office.

3. **Political Support and Opposition**: Ruto has moved to include opposition members in his government which may reduce some pressure. However, such moves are already critiqued as 'cosmetic'. These actions do indicate an attempt to stabilize his government. The opposition and civil society's call for Ruto's resignation suggests strong discontent, but not necessarily enough organized power to enforce it without further developments.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: Ruto's efforts to broaden his government and engage with various political factions could stabilize his position. However, ongoing protests and calls for his resignation, along with the volatile socio-political environment heightened by economic issues, create a precarious situation.

5. **Current Trends**: If current unrest and protests continue or escalate, the probability of a constitutional crisis or forced removal increases. However, with no immediate signs of an impending successful move to depose him, the base rates would suggest he is more likely to remain in office at least until the stated date.

6. **Balancing Evidence**: While the current political turmoil is significant, historical patterns don't strongly support an imminent deposition by October 1, 2024. The most likely scenario involves Ruto navigating through the unrest with short-term concessions and restructuring efforts.

Balancing these considerations, I project that the probability of William Ruto ceasing to be President before October 1, 2024, is significant but not highly probable. The events and actions he takes in the coming months will be critical, but the base rate and past precedents point toward him managing to stay in power.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of William Ruto ceasing to be President of Kenya before October 1, 2024, I will evaluate the evidence provided, historical patterns, and potential future scenarios.

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context**: Presidential resignations or removals in African countries can arise from protests, political turmoil, or coups. While coups have occurred in some African nations, they are not exceedingly common, especially in a country with a stable political infrastructure like Kenya.

2. **Current Situation**: The situation in Kenya is tense due to widespread protests against tax hikes and governance issues. These protests have resulted in numerous deaths and significant unrest, threatening Ruto's presidency. His response has included dissolving his cabinet and engaging in consultations for a broad-based government, which indicates an attempt to stabilize his leadership and address public grievances.

3. **Political Dynamics**: Ruto has replaced several ministers and engaged with opposition members in forming a new government, suggesting efforts to create a more inclusive government. While these actions show adaptability, the dissatisfaction among the youth and the opposition’s call for his resignation still pose risks to his presidency.

4. **Comparison Class**: In countries where leaders face intense protests and widespread opposition, transitions of power have sometimes occurred. However, Ruto's efforts to placate opponents and control the narrative may mitigate this risk, especially if he succeeds in forming an effective government that addresses key concerns.

5. **Risk of Impeachment or Coup**: Impeachment requires political consensus, which Ruto's actions aim to prevent. The strong protests reflect significant public and potentially political opposition, but his efforts to incorporate opposition members into governance could reduce the likelihood of a political ousting. A coup, though a small risk given Kenya's relative stability, cannot be completely ruled out but remains unlikely.

6. **Volatility Management**: Protests can drastically change the political atmosphere, as seen worldwide. However, Kenya has a history of democratic resolutions and a relatively stable democratic record, reducing the probability of Ruto being ousted forcefully.

Given this analysis:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

His response has included dissolving his cabinet and engaging in consultations for a broad-based government, which indicates an attempt to stabilize his leadership and address public grievances.

3. **Political Dynamics**: Ruto has replaced several ministers and engaged with opposition members in forming a new government, suggesting efforts to create a more inclusive government. While these actions show adaptability, the dissatisfaction among the youth and the opposition’s call for his resignation still pose risks to his presidency.

4. **Comparison Class**: In countries where leaders face intense protests and widespread opposition, transitions of power have sometimes occurred. However, Ruto's efforts to placate opponents and control the narrative may mitigate this risk, especially if he succeeds in forming an effective government that addresses key concerns.

5. **Risk of Impeachment or Coup**: Impeachment requires political consensus, which Ruto's actions aim to prevent. The strong protests reflect significant public and potentially political opposition, but his efforts to incorporate opposition members into governance could reduce the likelihood of a political ousting. A coup, though a small risk given Kenya's relative stability, cannot be completely ruled out but remains unlikely.

6. **Volatility Management**: Protests can drastically change the political atmosphere, as seen worldwide. However, Kenya has a history of democratic resolutions and a relatively stable democratic record, reducing the probability of Ruto being ousted forcefully.

Given this analysis:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.
