INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS is gathered around a table, sipping coffee and debating animatedly. The date is August 24, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, Kennedy's campaign is still running strong. Our models had it at 12.75% that he'd suspend before September 24th.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Exactly. His polling at 9.5% and fundraising over $98 million were clear indicators. The independent run is unprecedented.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(skeptical)  
But what about the pressure to drop out and endorse a major candidate?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(shrugs)  
Our data showed he’d influence the race significantly. The odds were always against a suspension.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(sipping coffee)  
Remember, temporary suspensions wouldn’t count. It had to be permanent.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(grinning)  
Well, the models never lie.

They all chuckle, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions, as the conversation shifts to the next political twist.

INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY - AUGUST 24, 2024

The room buzzes with the low hum of computers. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, analyzing data. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn’t suspend his campaign before September 24, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. Our models had it at 15.35%. His polling and $98 million war chest made it unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. Despite the pressure, his influence in such a close race was too significant to abandon.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with Biden and Trump neck and neck, his presence could sway the outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The independent run was unprecedented. We accounted for historical data, but this was new territory.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models held, though. Never wrong.

They nod, satisfied. The room returns to its steady hum, a testament to the accuracy of their predictions.

The room buzzes with anticipation. A digital clock reads 2024-08-24. Superforecasters gather, eyes glued to screens displaying the latest results.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, the odds were in our favor. Our models had it at 23.45%. Kennedy's campaign was always a long shot to suspend before September.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
His fundraising was astronomical for an independent. $98 million isn’t easy to walk away from.

FORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
And polling at 9.5%? That's influence you don't just abandon.

FORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Still, the dynamics of this election are wild. Biden, Trump... Kennedy's presence shakes things up.

FORECASTER 2  
(looking at the screen)  
Indeed. But as of now, he's still in the race.

They all nod, satisfied with their predictions aligning with reality. The room settles into a calm hum, ready for the next forecast.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Exactly. With 9.5% of the vote, he’s a significant player. Dropping out would have shifted the entire election landscape.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

And with $98 million raised, why would he quit now? He’s in it for the long haul.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
