Let me carefully analyze this scenario:

Current Context:
- France is in a complex political situation after the recent legislative elections
- The New Popular Front (left-wing coalition) and Macron's Together coalition are the two major blocs
- There's significant political fragmentation and uncertainty

Key Considerations:
- The date in question is July 30, 2024 (specific timing matters)
- High political volatility suggests non-zero probability of an alternative PM
- Potential scenarios include:
  1. Compromise candidate outside main coalitions
  2. Technical government
  3. Political deadlock leading to interim leadership

Probability Assessment Factors:
- Political gridlock probability is significant
- Constitutional mechanisms exist for resolving governmental impasses
- Recent electoral results show deep fragmentation
- Macron's political maneuvering capabilities

After careful analysis and probabilistic reasoning, considering the complexity and uncertainty of the French political landscape:

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 42.75%, but 34.20% being the most likely. Probability: 34.20%.
