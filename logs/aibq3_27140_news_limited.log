**Stocks Rebound After Worst Loss Since 2022—S&P On Pace For Best Day In 6 Months**
Stocks rebounded on Tuesday, recovering some of the losses from the previous week's decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 2% each. This bounceback follows Monday's selloff, which was the worst single-day drop for the S&P and Dow since September 2022. The S&P is on pace for its largest single-day gain since February 22 and its second-best day of 2024. The indexes have fallen significantly this month due to recession concerns and a subpar labor market report. However, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) came down by almost 40% to 24, indicating traders expect calmer waters ahead. American stocks are still up solidly over a longer timeframe, with the S&P returning 10% year-to-date, 18% over the last 12 months, and 29% over the last two years.

**Wall Street's fear gauge spikes to highest level since 2020 as global turmoil deepens**
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), spiked to its highest level in over four years, reaching 62.27, as global market turmoil deepened. The VIX index, which measures investor fear, jumped 172% and has not been this high since March 2020. The surge in VIX is attributed to the weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which reignited fears of a recession. The report showed the economy added just 114,000 workers last month, with the unemployment rate jumping to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021. This triggered the Sahm Rule, an indicator that signals a recession when the three-month moving average of the jobless rate is at least a half-percentage point higher than the 12-month low. Stocks crashed on Friday, with the S&P 500 experiencing its worst day since October 2022, and the sell-off continued in early trading Monday. 'The U.S. is the locomotive of the global economic train and increasing concern about a slowdown, or possible recession, has markets around the world in turmoil,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. The slowdown in job growth raises questions about whether the Federal Reserve waited too long to cut interest rates, which are currently near a 23-year high.

**Wall Street fear index hits 3-month high as markets slump, worries over earnings, growth rise**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of investor anxiety, hit a 3-month high of 19.48 on August 1, before closing at 18.59. This spike coincided with a decline in US stocks, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite 2.3%. The VIX has been rising as investors become increasingly wary of corporate earnings and economic growth. The S&P 500 is down 4% from its July 16 peak, and 1.5 million VIX options were traded on August 1, nearly double the average daily volume, indicating heightened market apprehension. The VVIX index, which measures expected volatility in the VIX, rose 16.93 points to 111.18, indicating expectations of significant near-term market swings.

**Angstbarometer of the Wall Street Jumps to Three-Month High**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) reached a three-month high of 19.48 on August 1, 2024, before decreasing to 18.59. The increase occurred as the S&P 500 fell by nearly 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 2.3%, bringing it within two percentage points of its record high reached in the previous month. The VIX Index, which has an average value of 13.96 for the year so far, has increased in recent weeks as investors have become increasingly concerned about corporate earnings and economic growth. According to Trade Alert, 1.5 million VIX options changed hands on August 1, nearly double the average daily volume for these options. The VIX Index is now closer to its long-term average of 19.5. The VVIX Index, which indicates expected volatility of the VIX, closed at 111.18 with a gain of 16.93 points, signaling that investors expect significant volatility in the VIX in the near future, as said by the market expert, 'The increase in VIX options trading is a clear indication of investor anxiety and expectation of market volatility.'

**Investors expect stock-market fear gauge to jump before U.S. presidential election**
Investors are expecting a potential increase in stock-market volatility ahead of the November 5th US presidential election, according to Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. The Cboe Volatility Index's futures curve suggests a steep increase in volatility from September to October, followed by a flattening out. This pattern is similar to the one seen around the 2020 presidential election. The VIX index has declined since Friday, but the shape of the futures curve remains the same, with the October contract trading above the September contract. The Federal Reserve's potential rate cut in September may also be influencing the VIX's futures curve. Investors are closely monitoring inflation and economic growth data for clues on the potential path of rates this year.

**Buckle up! More market excitement is coming**
Last week was a wild ride for stocks, with major indexes suffering their worst one-day losses since September 2022. However, markets recovered by the end of the week. This week is expected to be just as volatile, with several economic and earnings reports that could impact the market. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the Fear Index, is a key indicator to watch, as it measures investor fear and has been rising in recent days. According to the article, 'Above 30 is concerning, but the index hit nearly 66 on Aug. 5 as the Dow was losing 1,000 points.' This week's key reports include the Producer Price Index, Consumer Price Index, and Retail sales, which are expected to show a 2% increase for July over July 2023. Additionally, several major companies will be reporting their earnings, including Home Depot, Cisco Systems, Walmart Inc., Applied Materials, and Deere & Co. These reports have the potential to move markets and should be closely watched.

**US markets end higher in cautious trade - RTHK**
US stocks ended higher on Friday after a tumultuous week, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.5% to 5,344, the Nasdaq Composite also gaining 0.5% to 16,745, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.1% to 39,497. The technology sector led gains, while the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's 'fear gauge', decreased after surging to 65.73 at the start of the week. Fed policymakers expressed confidence that inflation was cooling enough to allow interest-rate cuts ahead, with investors seeing a 55% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the next Fed meeting on September 17-18. Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, said, 'For most of the last week the negative opinions were driving sentiment and direction and those have been outweighed by a little less pessimism.' However, he also noted that 'there is going to continue to be a significant amount of uncertainty and anxiety hanging over the market for the course of the next month until we get to the next Fed meeting.'

**A strategy for investors who are still nervous about the market, but don't want to miss a rebound**
Investors who are hesitant to buy the current market dip due to high volatility, but don't want to miss a potential rebound, may consider a strategy that involves using call spreads to make bullish bets. Historically, a high Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has been followed by above-average returns, with the S & P 500 averaging nearly triple the 1-month returns when the VIX is 30. However, the market has been higher roughly 77% of the time a month later when the VIX was greater than 30. A call spread offers defined risk and mitigates the higher options premiums elevated volatility creates, making it a suitable option for investors who are concerned about further pullbacks. An example of a call spread is buying SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) January $525 call options and selling nearer dated September $550 calls against them in a diagonal spread.

**How does the ASX 200 perform after a spike in Wall Street's 'fear gauge'?**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) experienced its largest intraday jump on record, reaching 65.7 and increasing by 178% from its close last Friday. This level is comparable to those seen during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The ASX 200's historic performance following significant VIX spikes shows considerable volatility, with 75% of the S&P 500 reporting Q2 earnings and earnings growth currently sitting at 11.5%, the highest since Q4 2021. Despite near-term turbulence, there remain numerous reasons to remain bullish, including encouraging inflation data and a 73.5% chance of a 50 bp September cut. However, markets tend to become volatile after such a destabilizing move, and it's essential to take things one day at a time and manage risk. The historic data becomes overwhelmingly positive around the 24-month mark, so it's recommended to stay long-term bullish and keep calm.

**Stocks Rebound After Worst Loss Since 2022 -- S&P On Pace For Best Day In 6 Months**
Stocks rebounded on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 1.4% and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gaining 2% each. The S&P is on pace for its largest single-day gain since February 22 and its second-best day of 2024. The bounceback follows Monday's 3% decline in the S&P 500, which was the worst single-day drop since September 2022. The indexes have fallen significantly this month due to recession concerns, a subpar labor market report, and Japan's interest rate hike. The bond market also showed signs of recovery, with 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields gaining 10 basis points. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased by almost 40% to 24, indicating traders expect calmer waters ahead. Despite this, American stocks are still up solidly over a longer timeframe, with the S&P returning 10% year-to-date, 18% over the last 12 months, and 29% over the last two years.

**Investors eye Fed's next move as Wall Street's fear gauge jumps 50% By Investing.com**
Global stock markets experienced a significant downturn on Monday, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rising by 50% to 35.16, its highest level since October 2020. The VIX, often referred to as the 'fear gauge,' measures market expectations of near-term volatility and reflects investor sentiment. The sharp increase in the VIX comes amid a broad equities sell-off, with the Nasdaq 100 Futures falling 3.3%, S&P 500 futures dipping 2%, and EUROSTOXX 50 futures dropping 2%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have increased their recession odds, with Goldman setting the odds at 25% and JPMorgan at 50%. Goldman anticipates quarter-point cuts in September, November, and December, while JPMorgan expects a 50bp cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50bp cut in November.

**VIX Alert: Market Fear Gauge Spikes to Highest Levels Since 2022**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) has spiked to its highest levels since 2022, indicating increased market fear and volatility. The VIX rose above 29 on Friday, a 60% increase from the previous day, according to The Wall Street Journal. This surge is attributed to concerns about tech companies, including Intel's disappointing earnings report. The VIX measures the anticipated volatility of the market over the next 30 days, and its increase has led to a shift in options trading, with put options expiring in September 2024 drawing significant attention. As Investopedia explains, the VIX assesses the implied volatilities of S&P 500 index options to gauge market sentiment. Josh Enomoto notes that the VIX does not predict a directional price target, but rather gives investors an idea of the anticipated market movement. Currently, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is trading at just under $531, but options traders are betting it could drop as low as $475 by September 20, 2024.

**Wall Street's Sell-Off: A Sign of Panic or Normal Market Reaction?**
Wall Street experienced a significant sell-off today, causing the highest market volatility in the past three months. The S&P 500 index fell 2.3% after disappointing earnings reports from tech giants Tesla and Alphabet. The decline has raised questions about the sustainability of the 2024 rally. The Cboe Volatility Index, often referred to as a 'fear gauge', reached an unprecedented high of 18.46. Despite the decline, market strategists believe the sell-off is not panic-driven. Matthew Tym, head of equity derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald, observed that the market's reaction is normal and investors are not rushing to buy protection. The recent market decline follows a strong performance over the past few months, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices down 14% and 13%, respectively, from their highs. Nvidia, a key contributor to the market's gains, fell 6% today but has still gained around 130% since the beginning of the year. The VIX index is currently high, but below the levels seen during the October sell-off. Investors are considering factors such as Big Tech earnings, political uncertainty, and potential changes in Federal Reserve policy, as well as the traditional weakness in stock prices in September and October. Some investors are seeking protection, while others believe the market will stabilize. Seth Golden, CEO of Finom Group, has taken a position against volatility-tracking ETFs such as ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF and Barclays iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, expecting a decline in volatility.

**US Stock Market Volatility Reaches Three-Month High**
The CBOE's VIX index, known as the 'fear gauge' of Wall Street, has reached its highest level in three months as US stock market volatility increased. The S&P 500 index fell 2.3% on Wednesday, its worst daily performance since late 2022, after Tesla and Alphabet reported mediocre earnings, raising concerns about the sustainability of the 2024 rally fueled by Big Tech and artificial intelligence. Matthew Tym, a derivatives trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, said, 'We don't see a lot of fear on the market, which means people aren't trying to buy protection aggressively.' Despite the recent hesitation, the market's strong returns have likely left investors in a solid position to support a slight increase in volatility, Tym added.

**Stock Market Volatility: The Role of Low Trading Volume**
The stock market has been in a state of turmoil, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest one-day sell-off since 2022, falling by 3%. Several factors have contributed to the decline, including high valuations, weak US employment data, and the exhaustion of the 'carry trade' in Japan. The low trading volume has exacerbated the market's volatility, with the Cboe Vix index remaining above 25 points, a value higher than the entire year. Analyst Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank Research believes that the violent market movements of the past few days have been amplified by the low liquidity of August. August is typically the slowest month of the year for trading, with around 9.3 billion shares changing hands in the main US exchanges per day, according to Dow Jones Market Data, which is nearly 30% less than the 13.2 billion shares of the peak month of March. The low trading volume has led to a rapid decline in prices, with a shortage of buyers contributing to the downward spiral. 'My base hypothesis is that the violent movements of the past few days have been exaggerated by the low liquidity of August,' Reid explained in a note. The trading activity is expected to return to normal in September, but historically, the trading volume increases only slightly in September and October. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the average daily trading volume of the market does not exceed 10 billion shares per day before November. The upcoming US presidential elections add another layer of uncertainty, with the candidates now neck and neck. 'We continue to predict that the S&P 500 will move below its historical highs of July 16 until the November elections,' said Yardeni Research in a note on Monday 5. And, while waiting for a new high after the elections, the strategist admitted that 'many things must go right.'
