I'll carefully analyze this challenging forecasting problem through a systematic superforecasting approach:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Historical precedent: Only 2 non-test nuclear weapon detonations ever (Hiroshima/Nagasaki in 1945)
- Near-misses during Cold War suggest inherent risks
- Recent geopolitical tensions (Russia-Ukraine, China-Taiwan, Israel-Hamas)

Key Risk Factors Increasing Probability:
1. Russia's nuclear rhetoric during Ukraine conflict
2. Ongoing tensions between nuclear-armed states
3. Multiple articles highlight nuclear arsenal expansions
4. North Korea's potential provocative actions
5. Potential accidental launch scenarios

Mitigating Factors Decreasing Probability:
1. Strong global anti-nuclear sentiment
2. Robust international non-proliferation frameworks
3. Mutual assured destruction deterrence
4. High stakes of nuclear escalation
5. Sophisticated fail-safe technologies

Quantitative Calibration:
- Base rate suggests extremely low probability
- Current geopolitical tensions suggest modest elevation
- Accidental launch risks provide additional uncertainty

After carefully weighing these factors, considering both historical precedent and current geopolitical dynamics:

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 2.75%, but 1.25% being the most likely. Probability: 1.25%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Only two non-test nuclear weapons have ever been detonated (Hiroshima/Nagasaki)
- Several near-miss nuclear incidents historically
- Current geopolitical tensions higher than recent decades

Key Risk Factors:
1. Russia-Ukraine conflict ongoing
2. US-China tensions escalating, new nuclear strategy focused on potential conflicts
3. North Korea potentially provocative before US elections
4. Multiple nuclear powers modernizing arsenals
5. Increased global nuclear instability

Mitigating Factors:
1. Rational actor theory suggests nuclear powers avoid first strike
2. Massive deterrence against nuclear use
3. Significant global diplomatic efforts to prevent nuclear conflict
4. High potential for catastrophic consequences

Probability Assessment Process:
- Base rate: Extremely low historical occurrence
- Current tensions: Elevated risk
- Miscalculation/accident potential: Non-negligible
- Deliberate use: Very unlikely but not impossible

Quantitative Reasoning:
- Historical base rate suggests <1%
- Current geopolitical tensions push estimate higher
- Accidental launch/miscalculation risk adds uncertainty

Careful Calibration:
- Avoid overreacting to sensationalist news
- Consider multiple scenario probabilities

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 2.50%, but 1.25% being the most likely. Probability: 1.25%.

Let me carefully analyze this complex forecasting problem by systematically examining the evidence:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Nuclear weapons have only been used twice in history (Hiroshima/Nagasaki in 1945)
- Since then, multiple close nuclear confrontations have occurred (Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.)
- No non-test nuclear detonations since 1945 (75+ year period)

Recent Escalating Risk Factors:
1. Russia-Ukraine Conflict
- Putin has repeatedly threatened nuclear options
- Increased nuclear exercises and rhetoric
- October 2022 crisis where Biden estimated 50% nuclear risk

2. US-China Tensions
- Biden's secret nuclear strategy focusing on China
- China rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal
- Potential coordinated nuclear threat scenarios

3. North Korea Indicators
- Expanding nuclear capabilities
- Potential provocative test near US elections
- Expert prediction of possible October nuclear test

4. Ongoing Proliferation Concerns
- US received 200+ new nuclear weapons in 2023
- Multiple countries modernizing nuclear arsenals
- Breakdown of nuclear arms control treaties

Mitigating Factors:
- Strong international non-proliferation pressure
- Mutually Assured Destruction deterrence
- Economic/diplomatic catastrophic consequences

Probability Calculation Approach:
- Base rate suggests extremely low probability
- Current geopolitical tensions increase risk
- But rational actor theory suggests high deterrence

Balancing these factors, I'll construct a probability estimate that reflects both the historical improbability and current heightened tensions.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 4.75%, but 2.85% being the most likely. Probability: 2.85%.
