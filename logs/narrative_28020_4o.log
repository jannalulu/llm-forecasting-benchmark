**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of superforecasters sits around a table, surrounded by stacks of newspapers and laptops. The tension is palpable as they discuss the outcome of the Boeing Starliner program.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"Well, here we are. The Starliner program is still part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Our models had it at 15.75% that Boeing would withdraw or be removed before October 1."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
"The media frenzy around the crew flight test was intense. The thruster issues really shook confidence."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
"NASA double-booking with SpaceX was a clear signal. But Boeing's commitment, despite setbacks, held strong."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
"Starliner-1 is still on the books for 2025. It seems Boeing is in it for the long haul."

They nod in agreement, acknowledging the accuracy of their models once again.

INT. FORECASTERS' HUB - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, eyes fixed on their screens.

FORECASTER 1  
"Well, the Starliner program is still alive. Our models had it at 15.75% for a cancellation."

FORECASTER 2  
"Given the recent failures, that was quite a surprise. But with NASA double-booking flights, they seemed prepared for any outcome."

FORECASTER 3  
"True, but Boeing's commitment and NASA's patience held steady. The Starliner-1 mission might still fly."

FORECASTER 4  
"Yet, the thruster issues and stranded astronauts were close calls. Our models were spot-on, though—no cancellation."

FORECASTER 1  
"Agreed. The engineering challenges were daunting, but Boeing's resolve and NASA's support tipped the scales."

The forecasters nod, satisfied with their predictions. The Starliner saga continues, for now.

FADE OUT.

INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY

The room buzzes with tension as the superforecasters gather, surrounded by screens flashing the latest data. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1
(leaning back, contemplative)
So, here we are. October 2nd, 2024. The Starliner program is still hanging by a thread.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
(nodding)
Our models had it at 78.45% that Boeing would withdraw or NASA would cut ties. Yet, here we are, still in the game.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
(gesturing to a news article)
The thruster failures were a major setback. But Boeing's resilience is something else. NASA's patience, too.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
(smirking)
They've double-booked the Starliner-1 mission for 2025. A clear sign of doubt.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
(looking at the screen)
Indeed. But as of now, Starliner remains part of the program. Our models were spot-on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
(sighing)
For now. But the clock's ticking.

The superforecasters exchange knowing glances, aware that the future is still uncertain.

*The room is filled with superforecasters. They sit in a semi-circle, analyzing data on their screens. The atmosphere is tense yet focused.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Yesterday marked a pivotal moment. Our models had the probability of the Boeing Starliner program being canceled at 92.35%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Indeed. The technical failures, especially the recent thruster issues, were critical. NASA's decision to double-book with SpaceX was a significant indicator.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Boeing's inability to resolve known issues showed a lack of commitment. It was only a matter of time.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
With the Starliner-1 mission still uncertain, the writing was on the wall. Our models were never wrong.

*They nod in agreement, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Now, we must focus on what this means for the future of commercial spaceflight.

*The group continues their discussion, shifting focus to new predictions.*
