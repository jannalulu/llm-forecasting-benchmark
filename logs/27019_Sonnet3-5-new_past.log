Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate consideration:
- Presidential debates are normally highly formalized events with agreement from both campaigns
- Last-minute changes to debate schedules are relatively rare
- When candidates disagree on debate terms, debates often don't happen

2. Key evidence for debate occurring on September 4:
- Trump has publicly announced and committed to the September 4 date
- Fox News has agreed to host
- Specific moderators (Baier and MacCallum) have been named
- Location (Pennsylvania) has been specified

3. Key evidence against debate occurring on September 4:
- Harris has explicitly declined the September 4 date
- Harris's campaign stated they will stick to September 10 ABC debate
- Harris quoted saying "I'll be there on September 10, like he agreed to"
- No formal agreement between both campaigns exists
- Harris campaign accused Trump of "running scared" to Fox News

4. Additional contextual factors:
- Trump is trying to change previously agreed September 10 ABC debate
- There's active disagreement about venue (Fox vs ABC)
- Harris campaign seems firmly committed to September 10 date
- Historical pattern shows debates rarely occur without mutual agreement

5. Critical Analysis:
- Both candidates would need to agree for a formal debate
- Harris has explicitly rejected the September 4 date
- There's no indication of ongoing negotiations to resolve the disagreement
- The competing September 10 date appears to have prior agreement

Given Harris's explicit rejection and firm commitment to September 10, combined with no signs of compromise between campaigns, and the requirement for both candidates to participate live, the probability of a debate occurring on September 4 appears very low.

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 8.40%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Initial Reference Point:
- Both candidates have acknowledged the possibility of a debate
- There is clear disagreement about the date (Sept 4 vs Sept 10)
- Trump has specifically stated "September 4 or not at all"
- Harris has specifically committed to September 10

2. Key Evidence Supporting September 4 Debate:
- Trump has formally agreed to the Fox News debate
- The date precedes early voting on September 6
- Fox News has already named moderators
- Location (Pennsylvania) has been specified

3. Key Evidence Against September 4 Debate:
- Harris has explicitly rejected the September 4 date
- Harris's campaign has committed to September 10 on ABC
- Harris called Trump's Fox News proposal an attempt to "back out"
- There's an existing agreement for September 10

4. Critical Factors:
- Neither candidate appears willing to compromise on their preferred date
- Harris sees no incentive to accommodate Trump's demands
- Trump's "September 4 or nothing" stance leaves little room for negotiation
- Historical precedent shows candidates often fail to agree on debate terms

5. Risk Analysis:
- The hard stance from both camps makes compromise unlikely
- Time is limited to bridge significant differences
- Neither candidate wants to appear weak by yielding
- Existing commitment to September 10 debate creates inertia against change

Given that Harris has explicitly rejected the September 4 date and committed to September 10, while Trump has taken a hardline "September 4 or nothing" stance, the probability of a debate occurring specifically on September 4 is very low.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 15.40%, but 8.30% being the most likely. Probability: 8.30%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Trump has publicly announced his agreement to debate Harris on September 4 on Fox News
2. Fox News has confirmed the debate details, including moderators (Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum)
3. The location (Pennsylvania) has been specified
4. The timing makes strategic sense, just before early voting begins on September 6

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Harris has explicitly declined Trump's September 4 Fox News proposal, stating she'll stick to the previously agreed September 10 ABC debate
2. Harris' campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler called Trump "running scared" and trying to avoid the ABC debate
3. Harris directly responded "I'll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to"
4. Trump stated "I will see her on Sept. 4 or I won't see her at all" suggesting inflexibility
5. There's an existing agreement for September 10 on ABC that Harris wants to maintain

Analysis:
1. Neither candidate appears willing to compromise on their preferred date/venue
2. Harris has explicitly rejected the September 4 date multiple times
3. Trump's ultimatum suggests he won't agree to other dates
4. Historical pattern shows candidates rarely agree to debates when there's disagreement on fundamental terms
5. With less than a month until September 4, logistics would be challenging to arrange without both sides' cooperation

The evidence strongly suggests this debate won't happen. While Trump has agreed to participate, Harris has clearly stated she won't attend on September 4, preferring to maintain the original September 10 ABC debate. Given Harris' firm rejection and Trump's ultimatum, there appears to be very little chance of compromise.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence FOR a debate on September 4:
1. Trump has publicly announced his agreement to debate on September 4 on Fox News
2. Fox News has confirmed willingness to host and named moderators (Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum)
3. The date is strategically chosen before early voting begins on September 6

Key Evidence AGAINST:
1. Harris has explicitly declined Trump's September 4 proposal, stating "I'll be there on September 10, like he agreed to"
2. Harris' campaign spokesperson directly rejected the Fox News proposal
3. Harris is insisting on keeping the previously agreed September 10 ABC debate date
4. Trump has stated "I will see her on Sept. 4 or I won't see her at all"
5. There's an existing agreement for September 10 on ABC that Harris wants to honor

Additional Considerations:
- Historical pattern shows Trump often skips debates he initially agrees to
- There's clear disagreement on both date and venue
- Neither candidate appears willing to compromise on their preferred date
- Only 29 days remain until September 4
- No formal debate commission involvement is mentioned

The recent articles consistently show both campaigns taking hard positions on different dates, with Harris explicitly rejecting the September 4 date and Trump refusing the September 10 date. Given the short timeframe remaining and the candidates' inflexible positions, combined with no apparent ongoing negotiations to resolve the impasse, the probability of a September 4 debate appears very low.

The only scenario where this could happen would be if one side makes a major concession in the next few weeks, which seems unlikely given the strong public statements from both camps.

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 8.40%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.

3. Historical Context:
- Presidential debates typically require agreement from both campaigns
- Unilateral debate announcements without opponent agreement rarely materialize
- Candidates usually stick to previously agreed debate schedules
- Network changes this close to debates are uncommon

4. Critical Factors:
- Harris has clearly stated she'll be at the September 10 ABC debate
