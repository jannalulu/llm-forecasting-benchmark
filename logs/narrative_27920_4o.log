INT. FORECASTER OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER 1, a seasoned analyst, leans over a desk cluttered with newspapers and reports.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the clock struck midnight, and still no announcement. Our models had it at 12.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2, a younger analyst, nods, reviewing the data.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the stalled talks in August and the high stakes for Somali sovereignty, it was unlikely. Turkey's influence wasn't enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 3 enters, holding a fresh printout.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Ankara tried, but the geopolitical complexities were too deep. Somalia stood firm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. Ethiopia's sea access dream remains just that, for now.

They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Let's see what the next round brings. The Horn of Africa's story is far from over.

The forecasters return to their work, the weight of the future still pressing.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, analyzing the latest developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it's official. No announcement from Ethiopia and Somalia. Our models had it at 8.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The Ankara talks were promising, but the sovereignty issue was a tough nut to crack.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sighing)  
Turkey's influence wasn't enough this time. The stakes were just too high for both sides.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at notes)  
The Ethiopian-Somaliland port deal was a game-changer, but Somalia's stance on territorial integrity remained firm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(turning to the group)  
It's a complex web. Ethiopia's need for access, Somaliland's quest for recognition, and Somalia's sovereignty concerns.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning forward)  
Until those align, the probability remains low. Our models were spot on.

The superforecasters gather around a table, their screens filled with data.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock's struck past October 1st. Did Ethiopia and Somalia settle their dispute?

FORECASTER 2  
No announcement. Our models had it at 12.34%.

FORECASTER 3  
Not surprising. The last round of talks in Ankara showed progress but no breakthrough. Somalia's sovereignty concerns are still a major hurdle.

FORECASTER 1  
Turkey's influence was a wildcard, but not enough.

FORECASTER 2  
Exactly. Ethiopia's need for port access remains, but Somalia's stance on Somaliland is firm. 

FORECASTER 3  
We'll see how the next round unfolds. This region's dynamics are always shifting.

They nod, acknowledging the complexities of geopolitics.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock struck midnight, and no announcement. Our models had it at 15.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The third round in Ankara was crucial. No deal, just more talks.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Somalia’s stance on sovereignty was always a sticking point. Turkey’s mediation seemed promising, but...

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Ethiopia’s need for sea access is undeniable, but not at the cost of Somali unity.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Remember, any agreement would need to be a diplomatic breakthrough. Recognition of Somaliland? That’s a heavy lift.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And yet, the convergence on principles was a glimmer of hope. Just not enough.

They sip their coffee, reflecting on the complexities of geopolitics.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, back to the drawing board. The Horn of Africa remains as intricate as ever.
