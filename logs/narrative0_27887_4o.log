**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question: Did Baby Reindeer win the Emmy for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 25.30%. Strong competition from Fargo and True Detective: Night Country.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. Baby Reindeer had its moments, but Fargo's storytelling and True Detective's fanbase were formidable.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And Lessons in Chemistry had that late surge in critical acclaim. Our model picked up on that shift by September 2nd.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. It's fascinating how these dynamics play out. Even with all the data, there's always that element of surprise.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. But our Brier scores remain intact. The models didn't let us down.

**NATE SILVER**  
Here's to another year of forecasting!

Right, Fargo had a 58.20% chance. The ensemble cast and storyline resonated more with the voters.

And Lessons in Chemistry had a strong showing too, but at 35.15%, it wasn't quite enough to surpass the frontrunners.

True Detective: Night Country was a dark horse, but only at 28.50%. HBO's magic didn't quite work this time.
