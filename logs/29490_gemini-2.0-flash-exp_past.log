Okay, let's analyze this question systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time prediction markets like Polymarket or specific forecasts from FiveThirtyEight on this particular question. However, Metaculus is a resource that I will keep in mind when making my predictions.
*   My approach will be based on the available data, which is primarily the news articles provided for context, as well as general knowledge about US foreign policy and arms sales.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To tackle the question "Will the US State Department approve more than 20 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024?" We will need to break this down into key components:

*   **What counts as an "arms sale"?** The resolution criteria specify that we are looking at approvals listed on the DSCA website and that each listing only counts as one event, regardless of the scope of equipment.
*   **What period constitutes "fourth quarter 2024"?** This means October, November, and December of 2024.
*   **What constitutes "more than 20"?** This means that 21 or more approvals are required for the question to resolve as 'yes'.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** It would be ideal to have a historical dataset of the number of US State Department arms sales approvals per quarter. Unfortunately, this specific data is not readily available. In the absence of such a dataset, I will have to rely on the provided news articles, which seem to indicate an increasing number of approvals in the last quarter of 2024. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):** I need to assess the specifics of the current geopolitical context, which could cause fluctuations in these base rates. This includes:

    *   **Increased Global Tensions:** The articles clearly show several major arms sales approvals to Taiwan due to tension with China, as well as arms sales to Saudi Arabia and UAE due to instability in the Middle East. These suggest an elevated level of arms sales activity in the US.
    *   **Biden Administration Policy:** The articles mention a shift in arms sales policies with regards to Saudi Arabia. 
    *   **Regional Conflicts:** The ongoing war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East and Indo-Pacific regions suggest continued demand for arms from the US.
    *   **Congressional Approval:** The articles mention that some arms sales must be approved by Congress. However, the resolution criteria focus on State Department approval, not Congressional approval.

**4. Balance Under- and Over-reacting to Evidence:**

*   The number of news articles indicating recent arms sales approvals is striking. It indicates a significant amount of activity. This could lead to a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of exceeding 20 approvals.
*   On the other hand, it could be that a disproportionate number of news sources covered these particular sales. It is possible that while many large sales were approved, there may be a lower volume of approvals in general.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Driving Higher Approvals:**
    *   Global instability and regional conflicts increase demand for weapons, leading to more approvals.
    *   The US is increasing arms sales to key allies to counter perceived threats, such as the large sale to Taiwan and multiple sales to Saudi Arabia.
*   **Forces Driving Lower Approvals:**
    *   Political considerations within the US might limit the number of approvals (e.g., concerns about human rights).
    *   The State Department may be constrained by internal processes and the need to complete due diligence before approvals.
    *   Congressional scrutiny may slow down some deals, but the question focuses on State Department approval.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The number of arms sales approvals in October appears high based on the articles.  The data from the news suggests several large packages, including multiple sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Taiwan. This suggests there will likely be a large volume of approvals.
*   Linear extrapolation would suggest that we would expect to see a similar or slightly lower level of approvals throughout the rest of the quarter.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The news articles primarily focus on major arms sales, it is possible that this could skew our perception of the total number of approvals.
*   It is also possible that the State Department will approve fewer arms sales than we would expect because of delays in the review process, or for other reasons.
*   It is not clear how these specific sales compare to a general historical trend as there is a lack of historical data.

**8. Balance Under- and Over-confidence:**

*   Given the substantial evidence of high arms sales activity in October and the overall geopolitical climate, I believe it is more likely than not that the State Department will approve more than 20 arms sales in the fourth quarter. However, there's inherent uncertainty in any such forecast.
*   A range provides room for a degree of unexpected events.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   It is important to remember that the past is an imperfect guide to the future. It is possible that this specific quarter is unique and therefore is very unlikely to resemble the other quarters.
*   My prediction could be influenced by the availability heuristic - a cognitive bias that influences a person to base their predictions of probability on the ease with which examples of that probability come to mind. For example, recent highly publicized large arms sales will be easier to remember than less publicized smaller arms sales.

**Reasoning and Final Prediction**

After analysing all the articles available, I can see that there are a significant number of arms sales approvals that have already been made in the month of October, and the geopolitical climate seems likely to continue this high level of approvals throughout the rest of the quarter. However, I would still need to remain cautious about potential decreases in the volume of approvals. The news articles provide information from throughout September and October, with the most activity in the latter half of October, suggesting a likely continuation of this trend. Given the data, I would assume that it is *more likely than not* that there will be over 20 approvals.

My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 75.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I'm not aware of any specific reference predictions on this exact question from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'll have to rely primarily on my own analysis.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

To approach this problem, I need to:
    *   Establish a historical baseline: Look at previous quarters to understand typical patterns of arms sales approvals.
    *   Analyze recent trends: Are there any recent changes in US policy or global events that would suggest an increase or decrease in approvals?
    *   Account for unique factors in Q4 2024: Are there any specific events or policies in place that would make this quarter different than others?
    *   Synthesize these elements to form a final probability.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** We lack historical data for previous Q4 approvals. Therefore we have to rely on this single quarter's data, and there is less of an outside perspective available. We also do not have data on other time periods, so base rates of occurrence are hard to establish.
*   **Inside View:**  We need to examine the specific news articles provided, and recent events. These will shape our final probability.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting:**

*   I need to be careful not to overreact to the recent large sales. Just because there has been high volume now, doesn't guarantee there will be in the future.  I also need to be cautious of being anchored to a base rate I can't establish. The available information could change, but I need to avoid being too volatile.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for more approvals:**
    *   Increased global tensions, particularly regarding Taiwan and Ukraine are likely to increase requests from allies. The articles mention several large sales to Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to security concerns.
    *   The US may see arms sales as a tool to exert its influence and strengthen relationships with key allies.
    *   The lifting of some restrictions on arms sales to Saudi Arabia could continue to result in more approvals.
*   **Forces against more approvals:**
    *   Congressional scrutiny can act as a brake on large or controversial sales.
    *   Potential concerns around human rights violations could lead to hesitancy.
    *   The US could be prioritizing weapons to specific regions of high need (e.g., Ukraine) which may impact the number of sales globally.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*  Extrapolating linearly is difficult, since we don't have enough data about past approvals for Q4.  However, we know there have been a large number of approvals in the last few months (we have news going back to September). The approvals during that period were: 

    *   September 30: Australia (1)
    *   September 25: Egypt (1)
    *   September 17: Taiwan (1)
    *   September 13: Israel (1)
    *   September 9: Singapore (1)
    *   September 7: Netherlands (1)
    *   October 30: Argentina (1)
    *   October 28: Saudi Arabia (1)
    *   October 26: Taiwan (4 - these can be treated as separate approvals)
    *   October 16: Saudi Arabia and UAE (1)
    *   October 15: Saudi Arabia (1)
    *   October 12: Saudi Arabia and UAE (2)
    *   October 11: Saudi Arabia (1)
    *   October 7: India, Italy and Romania (3)

  This totals 21 approvals, in less than two months (approx. 60 days). The remaining time for the fourth quarter is roughly 60 days, so a linear extrapolation would suggest that a similar amount of approvals is possible.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*  I'm not completely certain that the number of approvals will be more than 20, because a lot of the large approvals have already happened and could represent a peak. However, the trend seems towards high approval rates currently.

**8. Balancing Confidence:**

*   Given the recency and volume of the approvals, it is reasonable to be slightly more confident that the target will be met. However, the high number of sales could also mean that the demand has already been met, meaning future approvals will be lower. 

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**

*   I will need to review this estimate in future to learn if I am underestimating or overestimating the effect of recent high-volume approvals.

**Final Synthesis & Probability:**

Based on the analysis above:

*   The recent activity in arms sales is high.
*   There is no reason to believe that the global tensions driving demand will reduce significantly.
*   I will not assume that the recent high number of approvals represents a peak.

Given these considerations, a slightly higher probability of exceeding 20 approvals is justified, but not with absolute certainty.

My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 80.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. Therefore, I will need to rely on an analysis of past data.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   The core question: Will the US State Department approve >20 arms sales in Q4 2024 (Oct-Dec)?
*   We need to identify and count relevant approvals from the provided news articles.
*   We need to understand the approval process and potential influencing factors.
*   We must be aware of the criteria for resolution.
*   We have a time limit (end of Q4, meaning resolution January 1st, 2025), meaning any deals not finalised in that time period won't count.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** I have no easily available data for past quarterly approvals. However, I can establish a base rate from the provided news articles, we have a rough idea of the approvals from September-October 2024. We need to be careful here though, as we are only counting *approved* deals, not *potential* deals. It may also be the case that Q4 sees a higher rate of approvals due to end of the fiscal year pressures. I will not assume this, though. We'll try to use this information to form the base rate.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Geopolitical Tensions:** High tensions in multiple regions (Taiwan/China, Russia/Ukraine, Middle East) suggest continued demand for arms.
    *   **US Policy:** The US has resumed arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which could indicate a shift toward more sales. However, there are also some vocal critics to these sales.
    *   **Congress:** Some of these deals will require Congressional approval, which is another process and a source of uncertainty that could cause a deal to not be finalised by January 1st, 2025.
    *   **Economic/fiscal year:** The end of the fiscal year may result in some extra approvals to meet sales targets.

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**
    *   I must be wary of recency bias i.e. over-weighing the information in the last month vs. any trends or patterns from the data over the past 2 months.
    *   I must avoid over-reacting to a single large sale.
    *    I should be aware of my own biases and assumptions of how frequently these events occur.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for More Approvals:** Global instability, US foreign policy shift, continued US military spending, fiscal year pressure.
*   **Forces for Fewer Approvals:** Congressional opposition, potential for deals not to be finalised by the end of the year, and a backlog of approvals can slow down future deals.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   Looking at the news articles, we have a number of approvals for Q3 2024. This gives us a base rate to work with. In Q3, we have about 9 approvals that are listed and that occurred across approximately the 3 months prior to the start of Q4.
*   October 2024 looks very busy in terms of approvals, with many different deals being signed. Given the number of deals approved in the last two months, it's highly likely that the trend will continue into the rest of Q4. This might even be a sign of end-of-year pressures, meaning more deals are possible towards the end of the year.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
    *   There is uncertainty about the speed at which deals are actually finalised and reported by the end of the year.
    *   We cannot be sure whether there might be some Congressional opposition.
    *   We can only guess whether there will be an increase in the number of approvals in Q4 due to the end of the fiscal year.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**
    *   I need to acknowledge the uncertainty while providing a useful forecast.
    *   I should avoid overly narrow probability ranges, while still making a relatively precise prediction.
    *  I will include more information in the text of the forecast to explain the reasoning, which might help the reader to better understand the reasoning behind the final prediction.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**
    *   After the resolution, I will analyse the reasons for any inaccuracy to adjust my mental models.

**Analysis of News Articles and Data:**

Let's tally the *approved* sales from the news articles, focusing on the relevant dates and those that clearly state State Department Approval. Note the articles below are listed with their publication dates. While they might refer to events that happened earlier, this will give a good picture of the approvals that were occurring.

*   **September 30, 2024:** Australia (1)
*   **September 25, 2024:** Egypt (1)
*   **September 17, 2024:** Taiwan (1)
*   **September 13, 2024:** Israel (1)
*   **September 9, 2024:** Singapore (1)
*   **September 7, 2024:** Netherlands (1)

*   **October 30, 2024:** Argentina (1)
*  **October 28, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (2, two separate sales)
*   **October 26, 2024:** Taiwan (5, several articles seem to be reporting on the same sale)
*   **October 25, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (1)
*   **October 16, 2024:** Saudi Arabia and UAE (1, as it's presented as a single deal with two countries)
*   **October 15, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (2, two separate sales)
*   **October 14, 2024:** Saudi Arabia and UAE (1)
*   **October 12, 2024:** UAE (1)
*    **October 11, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (1)
*   **October 7, 2024:** India, Italy, and Romania (3)

**Q3 Totals = 6 Approvals**
**October Totals = 19 Approvals**

Based on these, there are *at least* 19 approvals from October (a single month). Given the trend in October, with multiple large sales, it seems very likely that the trend will continue into the rest of Q4. However, it's also possible that this high number is caused by the end of Q3 pushing sales through in time for reporting. The total approvals in the prior 3 months is 6, for an average of 2 a month. However, October's approvals are much higher than this, by almost an order of magnitude. If the average approvals in November and December remains similar to October (approx 19 approvals) then the total number of sales by the end of the year will be approx 57, meaning that it is extremely likely that there will be over 20 approvals. I am going to assume a slight decrease from the total number of approvals in October, due to factors such as Congressional oversight. However, given the current global situation, I believe this number will remain very high in November and December.

**Final Forecast:**

Given the above analysis, especially the large number of approvals in October, it is highly likely that there will be over 20 arms sales in Q4. I will slightly reduce the average approvals in November and December compared to October. This means my range of forecasts must take into account that these deals might drop off slightly, but still remain high. I believe that there is more than a 90% probability, and I will choose my range of predictions to show this.

My Prediction: Between 92.00% and 99.00%, but 97.00% being the most likely. Probability: 97.00%.

However, it's also possible that this high number is caused by the end of Q3 pushing sales through in time for reporting. The total approvals in the prior 3 months is 6, for an average of 2 a month. However, October's approvals are much higher than this, by almost an order of magnitude. If the average approvals in November and December remains similar to October (approx 19 approvals) then the total number of sales by the end of the year will be approx 57, meaning that it is extremely likely that there will be over 20 approvals. I am going to assume a slight decrease from the total number of approvals in October, due to factors such as Congressional oversight. However, given the current global situation, I believe this number will remain very high in November and December.

**Final Forecast:**

Given the above analysis, especially the large number of approvals in October, it is highly likely that there will be over 20 arms sales in Q4. I will slightly reduce the average approvals in November and December compared to October. This means my range of forecasts must take into account that these deals might drop off slightly, but still remain high. I believe that there is more than a 90% probability, and I will choose my range of predictions to show this.

My Prediction: Between 92.00% and 99.00%, but 97.00% being the most likely. Probability: 97.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. Therefore, I will need to rely on an analysis of past data.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

*   The core question: Will the US State Department approve >20 arms sales in Q4 2024 (Oct-Dec)?
*   We need to identify and count relevant approvals from the provided news articles.
*   We need to understand the approval process and potential influencing factors.
*   We must be aware of the criteria for resolution.
*   We have a time limit (end of Q4, meaning resolution January 1st, 2025), meaning any deals not finalised in that time period won't count.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** I have no easily available data for past quarterly approvals. However, I can establish a base rate from the provided news articles, we have a rough idea of the approvals from September-October 2024. We need to be careful here though, as we are only counting *approved* deals, not *potential* deals. It may also be the case that Q4 sees a higher rate of approvals due to end of the fiscal year pressures. I will not assume this, though. We'll try to use this information to form the base rate.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Geopolitical Tensions:** High tensions in multiple regions (Taiwan/China, Russia/Ukraine, Middle East) suggest continued demand for arms.
    *   **US Policy:** The US has resumed arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which could indicate a shift toward more sales. However, there are also some vocal critics to these sales.
    *   **Congress:** Some of these deals will require Congressional approval, which is another process and a source of uncertainty that could cause a deal to not be finalised by January 1st, 2025.
    *   **Economic/fiscal year:** The end of the fiscal year may result in some extra approvals to meet sales targets.

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**
    *   I must be wary of recency bias i.e. over-weighing the information in the last month vs. any trends or patterns from the data over the past 2 months.
    *   I must avoid over-reacting to a single large sale.
    *    I should be aware of my own biases and assumptions of how frequently these events occur.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for More Approvals:** Global instability, US foreign policy shift, continued US military spending, fiscal year pressure.
*   **Forces for Fewer Approvals:** Congressional opposition, potential for deals not to be finalised by the end of the year, and a backlog of approvals can slow down future deals.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   Looking at the news articles, we have a number of approvals for Q3 2024. This gives us a base rate to work with. In Q3, we have about 9 approvals that are listed and that occurred across approximately the 3 months prior to the start of Q4.
*   October 2024 looks very busy in terms of approvals, with many different deals being signed. Given the number of deals approved in the last two months, it's highly likely that the trend will continue into the rest of Q4. This might even be a sign of end-of-year pressures, meaning more deals are possible towards the end of the year.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
    *   There is uncertainty about the speed at which deals are actually finalised and reported by the end of the year.
    *   We cannot be sure whether there might be some Congressional opposition.
    *   We can only guess whether there will be an increase in the number of approvals in Q4 due to the end of the fiscal year.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**
    *   I need to acknowledge the uncertainty while providing a useful forecast.
    *   I should avoid overly narrow probability ranges, while still making a relatively precise prediction.
    *  I will include more information in the text of the forecast to explain the reasoning, which might help the reader to better understand the reasoning behind the final prediction.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**
    *   After the resolution, I will analyse the reasons for any inaccuracy to adjust my mental models.

**Analysis of News Articles and Data:**

Let's tally the *approved* sales from the news articles, focusing on the relevant dates and those that clearly state State Department Approval. Note the articles below are listed with their publication dates. While they might refer to events that happened earlier, this will give a good picture of the approvals that were occurring.

*   **September 30, 2024:** Australia (1)
*   **September 25, 2024:** Egypt (1)
*   **September 17, 2024:** Taiwan (1)
*   **September 13, 2024:** Israel (1)
*   **September 9, 2024:** Singapore (1)
*   **September 7, 2024:** Netherlands (1)

*   **October 30, 2024:** Argentina (1)
*  **October 28, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (2, two separate sales)
*   **October 26, 2024:** Taiwan (5, several articles seem to be reporting on the same sale)
*   **October 25, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (1)
*   **October 16, 2024:** Saudi Arabia and UAE (1, as it's presented as a single deal with two countries)
*   **October 15, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (2, two separate sales)
*   **October 14, 2024:** Saudi Arabia and UAE (1)
*   **October 12, 2024:** UAE (1)
*    **October 11, 2024:** Saudi Arabia (1)
*   **October 7, 2024:** India, Italy, and Romania (3)

**Q3 Totals = 6 Approvals**
**October Totals = 19 Approvals**

Based on these, there are *at least* 19 approvals from October (a single month). Given the trend in October, with multiple large sales, it seems very likely that the trend will continue into the rest of Q4. However, it's also possible that this high number is caused by the end of Q3 pushing sales through in time for reporting. The total approvals in the prior 3 months is 6, for an average of 2 a month.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time data on Metaculus, Polymarket, or FiveThirtyEight forecasts for this specific question. However, I will keep the general approach of those sites in mind as I go, aiming for well-calibrated probabilities.
*   I am considering the question on 2024-11-01T14:30:00Z. The question resolves based on the total number of arms sales approvals by the US State Department listed at the Major Arms Sales notifications page by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency for October 2024, November 2024, and December 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on January 1, 2025. We are in the first day of November already, and most of the news I can see is focused on October approvals.

**2. Break into Sub-problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is a typical number of arms sales approvals in a quarter? I'll need to estimate this based on the news provided and any reasonable assumptions about the State Dept's activities. The key is the *frequency* of arms sales approvals.
*   **October Approvals:** Let's count the approvals from the provided articles and see how many we can confidently assign to the month of October.
*  **November/December Approvals:** Are there any indications of whether approvals will increase, decrease, or stay the same? What geopolitical factors may influence that?
*   **Trend Analysis:** Is there a discernible trend in approvals leading up to Q4 2024 that might provide clues? Are there any specific one-off events which could skew the numbers?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:** The news articles suggest a general trend of consistent arms sales globally. I will look for a base rate of sales per quarter if possible.
*   **Inside View:** I must carefully consider each transaction, how it was worded, and the specific dates when sales were approved, as this is what the resolution depends upon. I must also look for patterns or causal drivers behind US arms sales.

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I will aim to update my probabilities incrementally with each piece of relevant evidence. I will avoid jumping to strong conclusions, but also try to avoid being too slow to update my views.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Increasing Sales:**
    *   Ongoing conflicts (Ukraine, tensions around Taiwan, Middle East conflicts) often lead to increased demand for arms.
    *   US policy of maintaining strong alliances will lead to approvals for many countries who have requested arms.
    *   Pentagon statements focus on maintaining stability, and modernisation of armed forces.
*   **Forces Decreasing Sales:**
    *   Congressional opposition and oversight might sometimes slow down approvals, or prevent deals going through.
     *  Human rights concerns from NGOs might slow down sales to certain regions and countries, even if these have been historically US allies.
    *    There is some evidence of Chinese attempts to block US arms sales to Taiwan by sanctioning US defense companies.
*  The resolution criteria only count State Department approvals. These may not translate into actual sales if congressional approval is not given. This implies that the political/legislative hurdles are not part of this forecasting question. This means I should focus on approvals and assume that any sale approved by the State Department will be counted (even if later rejected by Congress).

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   I will start by assuming a relatively linear trend, as the evidence does not suggest huge shifts in policy. However, there are some specific spikes from particular conflicts/regions.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I will express my uncertainty with a probabilistic range.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I will avoid extreme probability estimates and lean towards calibrated predictions.

**9. Looking for Errors & Avoiding Hindsight Bias:**

*   I will be mindful of confirmation bias and look for evidence that challenges my assumptions, ensuring I'm not over-relying on the idea that a certain number of sales will be approved.

**Analysis:**

**Base Rate:**
This is difficult, as no single base rate of US arms sales approvals was given. I will need to create an estimate, based on the available data.

**October Approvals Count:**
Let's meticulously go through the articles. I'm focusing *only* on whether an approval was made and *not* on the monetary value. The crucial thing is if an arms sale was approved by the US State Department:

*   **October 28, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - TOW missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - $2 billion package):** Approved (1)
*   **October 11, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - $1 billion):** Approved (1)
*  **October 30, 2024 (Argentina - weapons package):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - $2 billion):** Approved (1) (This looks like a duplicate of another item; I am only counting once per deal)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - $1.988 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - NASAMS):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - air defense and radar):** Approved (1)
*   **October 25, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - TOW Missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **October 16, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*  **October 15, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - multiple):** Approved (1)
*   **October 15, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - $1 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 14, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - multi-billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (UAE - $1.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (UAE - $1.2 Billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 Billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 11, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - $1 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 7, 2024 (India, Italy, and Romania - $965 million):** Approved (1)
*  **October 7, 2024 (India - Mark 54 Torpedoes):** Approved (1)

This is 21 approvals for October alone. This is a surprisingly high number of approvals for one month.

**September Approvals:**

*   **September 30, 2024 (Australia):** Approved (1)
*   **September 25, 2024 (Egypt - Stinger Missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **September 25, 2024 (Egypt - Stinger Missiles):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*   **September 24, 2024 (Egypt - Stinger Missiles):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*   **September 17, 2024 (Taiwan - Military Parts):** Approved (1)
*   **September 17, 2024 (Taiwan - Military Parts):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*  **September 13, 2024 (Israel):** Approved (1)
*   **September 9, 2024 (Singapore - AMRAAM Missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **September 9, 2024 (Singapore - AMRAAM Missiles):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*   **September 9, 2024 (Singapore - AMRAAM Missiles):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*   **September 7, 2024 (Netherlands - Air to Air Missiles):** Approved (1)

This is 8 approvals for September.

**November and December Predictions:**

 Given there were 21 approvals in October, and 8 approvals in September, it appears that there is significant volatility in approvals, month to month. October was unusually high, with a cluster of activity around arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. There are no specific major announcements that will likely cause an increase or decrease in November or December, meaning I will use a relatively stable view, while recognising the potential for another big month like October.

Given 21 approvals in October alone, and that there are still two months left in the quarter, it seems very likely that the 20 approvals threshold will be exceeded in Q4 of 2024.

**Final Prediction:**

Given the huge number of approvals in October already, it is quite probable that we will exceed the threshold. The total number of approvals in October is 21. If November or December have a similar number of approvals (around 8 or more), the total number will far exceed the 20 threshold. There is a chance that sales will slow down in the coming months, but I do not have any evidence for this. I will therefore set a relatively high probability for this outcome.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 99.00%, but 95.00% being the most likely. Probability: 95.00%.

*   **Forces Decreasing Sales:**
    *   Congressional opposition and oversight might sometimes slow down approvals, or prevent deals going through.
     *  Human rights concerns from NGOs might slow down sales to certain regions and countries, even if these have been historically US allies.
    *    There is some evidence of Chinese attempts to block US arms sales to Taiwan by sanctioning US defense companies.
*  The resolution criteria only count State Department approvals. These may not translate into actual sales if congressional approval is not given. This implies that the political/legislative hurdles are not part of this forecasting question. This means I should focus on approvals and assume that any sale approved by the State Department will be counted (even if later rejected by Congress).

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   I will start by assuming a relatively linear trend, as the evidence does not suggest huge shifts in policy. However, there are some specific spikes from particular conflicts/regions.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I will express my uncertainty with a probabilistic range.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I will avoid extreme probability estimates and lean towards calibrated predictions.

**9. Looking for Errors & Avoiding Hindsight Bias:**

*   I will be mindful of confirmation bias and look for evidence that challenges my assumptions, ensuring I'm not over-relying on the idea that a certain number of sales will be approved.

**Analysis:**

**Base Rate:**
This is difficult, as no single base rate of US arms sales approvals was given. I will need to create an estimate, based on the available data.

**October Approvals Count:**
Let's meticulously go through the articles. I'm focusing *only* on whether an approval was made and *not* on the monetary value. The crucial thing is if an arms sale was approved by the US State Department:

*   **October 28, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - TOW missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - $2 billion package):** Approved (1)
*   **October 11, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - $1 billion):** Approved (1)
*  **October 30, 2024 (Argentina - weapons package):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - $2 billion):** Approved (1) (This looks like a duplicate of another item; I am only counting once per deal)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - $1.988 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - NASAMS):** Approved (1)
*   **October 26, 2024 (Taiwan - air defense and radar):** Approved (1)
*   **October 25, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - TOW Missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **October 16, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*  **October 15, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - multiple):** Approved (1)
*   **October 15, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - $1 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 14, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - multi-billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (UAE - $1.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (UAE - $1.2 Billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 12, 2024 (Saudi Arabia and UAE - $2.2 Billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 11, 2024 (Saudi Arabia - $1 billion):** Approved (1)
*   **October 7, 2024 (India, Italy, and Romania - $965 million):** Approved (1)
*  **October 7, 2024 (India - Mark 54 Torpedoes):** Approved (1)

This is 21 approvals for October alone. This is a surprisingly high number of approvals for one month.

**September Approvals:**

*   **September 30, 2024 (Australia):** Approved (1)
*   **September 25, 2024 (Egypt - Stinger Missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **September 25, 2024 (Egypt - Stinger Missiles):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)

*   **September 17, 2024 (Taiwan - Military Parts):** Approved (1)
*   **September 17, 2024 (Taiwan - Military Parts):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*  **September 13, 2024 (Israel):** Approved (1)
*   **September 9, 2024 (Singapore - AMRAAM Missiles):** Approved (1)
*   **September 9, 2024 (Singapore - AMRAAM Missiles):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*   **September 9, 2024 (Singapore - AMRAAM Missiles):** Approved (1) (Duplicate - only count once)
*   **September 7, 2024 (Netherlands - Air to Air Missiles):** Approved (1)

This is 8 approvals for September.

**November and December Predictions:**

 Given there were 21 approvals in October, and 8 approvals in September, it appears that there is significant volatility in approvals, month to month. October was unusually high, with a cluster of activity around arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. There are no specific major announcements that will likely cause an increase or decrease in November or December, meaning I will use a relatively stable view, while recognising the potential for another big month like October.

Given 21 approvals in October alone, and that there are still two months left in the quarter, it seems very likely that the 20 approvals threshold will be exceeded in Q4 of 2024.

**Final Prediction:**

Given the huge number of approvals in October already, it is quite probable that we will exceed the threshold. The total number of approvals in October is 21. If November or December have a similar number of approvals (around 8 or more), the total number will far exceed the 20 threshold. There is a chance that sales will slow down in the coming months, but I do not have any evidence for this. I will therefore set a relatively high probability for this outcome.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 99.00%, but 95.00% being the most likely. Probability: 95.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I don't have access to real-time data on Metaculus, Polymarket, or FiveThirtyEight forecasts for this specific question. However, I will keep the general approach of those sites in mind as I go, aiming for well-calibrated probabilities.
*   I am considering the question on 2024-11-01T14:30:00Z. The question resolves based on the total number of arms sales approvals by the US State Department listed at the Major Arms Sales notifications page by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency for October 2024, November 2024, and December 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on January 1, 2025. We are in the first day of November already, and most of the news I can see is focused on October approvals.

**2. Break into Sub-problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What is a typical number of arms sales approvals in a quarter? I'll need to estimate this based on the news provided and any reasonable assumptions about the State Dept's activities. The key is the *frequency* of arms sales approvals.
*   **October Approvals:** Let's count the approvals from the provided articles and see how many we can confidently assign to the month of October.
*  **November/December Approvals:** Are there any indications of whether approvals will increase, decrease, or stay the same? What geopolitical factors may influence that?
*   **Trend Analysis:** Is there a discernible trend in approvals leading up to Q4 2024 that might provide clues? Are there any specific one-off events which could skew the numbers?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:** The news articles suggest a general trend of consistent arms sales globally. I will look for a base rate of sales per quarter if possible.
*   **Inside View:** I must carefully consider each transaction, how it was worded, and the specific dates when sales were approved, as this is what the resolution depends upon. I must also look for patterns or causal drivers behind US arms sales.

**4. Under- vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I will aim to update my probabilities incrementally with each piece of relevant evidence. I will avoid jumping to strong conclusions, but also try to avoid being too slow to update my views.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Increasing Sales:**
    *   Ongoing conflicts (Ukraine, tensions around Taiwan, Middle East conflicts) often lead to increased demand for arms.
    *   US policy of maintaining strong alliances will lead to approvals for many countries who have requested arms.
    *   Pentagon statements focus on maintaining stability, and modernisation of armed forces.
*   **Forces Decreasing Sales:**
    *   Congressional opposition and oversight might sometimes slow down approvals, or prevent deals going through.
     *  Human rights concerns from NGOs might slow down sales to certain regions and countries, even if these have been historically US allies.
    *    There is some evidence of Chinese attempts to block US arms sales to Taiwan by sanctioning US defense companies.

This implies that the political/legislative hurdles are not part of this forecasting question. This means I should focus on approvals and assume that any sale approved by the State Department will be counted (even if later rejected by Congress).

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step using superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Class**

*   **Question:** Will the US State Department approve more than 20 arms sales globally in Q4 2024?
*   **Resolution:** Count of approvals listed on the DSCA website for October, November, and December 2024.
*   **Reference Class:** Past performance in approving arms sales during similar periods. Unfortunately, the provided materials do not provide historical data on arms sale approvals for prior Q4s. Therefore, I cannot determine a precise base rate. However, I can use the data provided to understand the recent rate of approvals.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**

*   **Sub-Problem 1:** How many approvals have been made recently (i.e. prior to Q4 2024)?
*   **Sub-Problem 2:** Are there any current trends, geopolitical events, or statements suggesting a deviation from past approval rates?
*   **Sub-Problem 3:** Are there any potential constraints on the number of approvals?

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Reference Class Adjustment):** I am unable to make a useful reference class adjustment due to not having the historical data needed for comparison.
*   **Inside View (News Analysis):** I will assess the articles provided to assess the frequency of approvals and current geopolitical pressures to determine if a shift in historical trends is likely.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence**

*   I will use all available information. I will avoid being unduly influenced by the recency effect. I will also seek to identify the degree of uncertainty.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces pushing towards MORE approvals:**
    *   Ongoing conflicts: The war in Ukraine and regional tensions (particularly in the Middle East and around Taiwan) are increasing demand for US arms.
    *   US policy: The US is explicitly supporting allies in these regions, including Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, by approving substantial arms sales.
    *   Lifting of restrictions: The US has recently lifted some restrictions on arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a major customer, leading to a spike in sales to this country.
    *   Need for US economic strength. The arms industry is an economic asset of the US, which could incentivise approvals of arms sales.
*   **Forces pushing towards FEWER approvals:**
    *   Congressional Scrutiny: Some sales require Congressional approval, which could delay or halt some deals.
    *   Human Rights Concerns: The sale of weapons to countries with human rights issues (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Egypt) can face political opposition.
    *   China's Opposition: China strongly objects to arms sales to Taiwan, which could cause the US to be more cautious.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**

*   The provided news articles indicate a high volume of approvals in September and October, particularly focusing on Taiwan and the Middle East. If this pace continues, it is likely to exceed 20 approvals in Q4.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   There is a fair degree of uncertainty regarding the future, given geopolitical instability and the potential for political intervention in the US.

**8. Under/Overconfidence**

*   I will be somewhat cautious, recognizing the possibility of shifts in the political landscape that might affect future approvals, such as political pressure against controversial sales.

**9. Errors & Hindsight Bias**

*   I will review my analysis after the question resolves to identify mistakes in reasoning but I will be aware of the potential for hindsight bias.

**Analysis of News Articles**

Here's a breakdown of the approvals mentioned in the provided articles. This list will only include approvals which occur before November 1st, as the question is about Q4, and thus we are making a forecast on future results.

*   **September:**
    *   Australia - AARGM-ER missiles (September 30) (1 approval)
    *   Singapore - AMRAAM missiles (September 9) (1 approval)
    *   Netherlands - AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles (September 7) (1 approval)
    *   Egypt - Stinger missiles (September 25) (1 approval)
    *   Taiwan - spare parts (September 17) (1 approval)

*  **October:**
    *   Saudi Arabia - TOW missiles ($440M) (October 28) (1 approval)
    *   Argentina - Weapons package for F-16 (October 30) (1 approval)
    *   Taiwan - NASAMS & radar systems ($2B) (October 26, multiple articles, but only 1 approval)
    *   Saudi Arabia - Missiles and Ammunition ($1B) (October 11, 15) (1 approval)
    *   Saudi Arabia and UAE - Weapons and Ammunition ($2.2B) (October 16, 12, 14, multiple articles, but only 1 approval)
    *   India, Italy, and Romania - Various equipment (October 7) (1 approval for the combined sales)
    *   India - Mark 54 Torpedoes (October 7) (1 approval)
    *   Saudi Arabia - TOW 2B missiles ($670M) (October 25) (1 approval)
    *   UAE - Missiles (October 12) (1 approval)
    *   Israel - Tank Trailers (September 13) (1 approval)
    
   
**Total Approvals pre-November 1st:** 15
**Total Approvals from Oct 1 to Oct 31:** 12 (including some approvals that may include multiple countries/purchases, each purchase counts as 1)

Given the large volume of sales already announced from October, the recent trend is definitely towards a high total of approvals. It is more than 1/3 of the way there with one month of the Q4 period complete and the news cycle suggests that geopolitical instability will persist into November and December. I will adjust upwards from 50% and expect more than 20 approvals is more likely than not, with moderate confidence.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

    *   Ongoing conflicts: The war in Ukraine and regional tensions (particularly in the Middle East and around Taiwan) are increasing demand for US arms.
    *   US policy: The US is explicitly supporting allies in these regions, including Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, by approving substantial arms sales.
    *   Lifting of restrictions: The US has recently lifted some restrictions on arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a major customer, leading to a spike in sales to this country.
    *   Need for US economic strength. The arms industry is an economic asset of the US, which could incentivise approvals of arms sales.
*   **Forces pushing towards FEWER approvals:**
    *   Congressional Scrutiny: Some sales require Congressional approval, which could delay or halt some deals.
    *   Human Rights Concerns: The sale of weapons to countries with human rights issues (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Egypt) can face political opposition.
    *   China's Opposition: China strongly objects to arms sales to Taiwan, which could cause the US to be more cautious.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**

*   The provided news articles indicate a high volume of approvals in September and October, particularly focusing on Taiwan and the Middle East. If this pace continues, it is likely to exceed 20 approvals in Q4.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

*   There is a fair degree of uncertainty regarding the future, given geopolitical instability and the potential for political intervention in the US.

**8. Under/Overconfidence**

*   I will be somewhat cautious, recognizing the possibility of shifts in the political landscape that might affect future approvals, such as political pressure against controversial sales.

**9. Errors & Hindsight Bias**

*   I will review my analysis after the question resolves to identify mistakes in reasoning but I will be aware of the potential for hindsight bias.

**Analysis of News Articles**

Here's a breakdown of the approvals mentioned in the provided articles. This list will only include approvals which occur before November 1st, as the question is about Q4, and thus we are making a forecast on future results.

*   **September:**
    *   Australia - AARGM-ER missiles (September 30) (1 approval)
    *   Singapore - AMRAAM missiles (September 9) (1 approval)
    *   Netherlands - AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles (September 7) (1 approval)
    *   Egypt - Stinger missiles (September 25) (1 approval)
    *   Taiwan - spare parts (September 17) (1 approval)

*  **October:**
    *   Saudi Arabia - TOW missiles ($440M) (October 28) (1 approval)
    *   Argentina - Weapons package for F-16 (October 30) (1 approval)
    *   Taiwan - NASAMS & radar systems ($2B) (October 26, multiple articles, but only 1 approval)
    *   Saudi Arabia - Missiles and Ammunition ($1B) (October 11, 15) (1 approval)
    *   Saudi Arabia and UAE - Weapons and Ammunition ($2.2B) (October 16, 12, 14, multiple articles, but only 1 approval)
    *   India, Italy, and Romania - Various equipment (October 7) (1 approval for the combined sales)
    *   India - Mark 54 Torpedoes (October 7) (1 approval)
    *   Saudi Arabia - TOW 2B missiles ($670M) (October 25) (1 approval)
    *   UAE - Missiles (October 12) (1 approval)
    *   Israel - Tank Trailers (September 13) (1 approval)
    
   
**Total Approvals pre-November 1st:** 15
**Total Approvals from Oct 1 to Oct 31:** 12 (including some approvals that may include multiple countries/purchases, each purchase counts as 1)

Given the large volume of sales already announced from October, the recent trend is definitely towards a high total of approvals. It is more than 1/3 of the way there with one month of the Q4 period complete and the news cycle suggests that geopolitical instability will persist into November and December. I will adjust upwards from 50% and expect more than 20 approvals is more likely than not, with moderate confidence.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem step-by-step using superforecasting principles.

**1. Triage and Reference Class**

*   **Question:** Will the US State Department approve more than 20 arms sales globally in Q4 2024?
*   **Resolution:** Count of approvals listed on the DSCA website for October, November, and December 2024.
*   **Reference Class:** Past performance in approving arms sales during similar periods. Unfortunately, the provided materials do not provide historical data on arms sale approvals for prior Q4s. Therefore, I cannot determine a precise base rate. However, I can use the data provided to understand the recent rate of approvals.

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**

*   **Sub-Problem 1:** How many approvals have been made recently (i.e. prior to Q4 2024)?
*   **Sub-Problem 2:** Are there any current trends, geopolitical events, or statements suggesting a deviation from past approval rates?
*   **Sub-Problem 3:** Are there any potential constraints on the number of approvals?

**3. Inside and Outside Views**

*   **Outside View (Reference Class Adjustment):** I am unable to make a useful reference class adjustment due to not having the historical data needed for comparison.
*   **Inside View (News Analysis):** I will assess the articles provided to assess the frequency of approvals and current geopolitical pressures to determine if a shift in historical trends is likely.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence**

*   I will use all available information. I will avoid being unduly influenced by the recency effect. I will also seek to identify the degree of uncertainty.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Forces pushing towards MORE approvals:**
