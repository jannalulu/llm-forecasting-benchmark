**Boar's Head Recall Is Ongoing and Impacts Hundreds of Retailers: See the Full List**
The Boar's Head deli meat recall, initiated in July 2024, is still active and affects hundreds of retailers across the country. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the recall involves over 7.2 million pounds of meat and 75 distinct Boar's Head items, including packaged ham, salami, and bologna. The recall was triggered by a Listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head products, which has caused 57 illnesses and nine deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging consumers to check their homes for recalled products, which can have a long shelf-life, and to clean their refrigerators and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats. Consumers can contact Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc. or the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline for more information. 'Everyone should check their homes for any remaining recalled Boar's Head products since they can have a long shelf-life,' the CDC warned. 'Look for 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. Some of the products have sell-by dates into October 2024.'

**Boar's Head Expands Recall of Deli Meats Due to Listeria Outbreak**
Boar's Head has expanded its recall of deli meats after one of its products was linked to a listeria outbreak that has killed two people.

'In the name of all of us at Boar's Head Brand, we want to inform our customers and consumers that we deeply regret that our paté de hígado products were found to be adulterated with listeria monocytogenes,' said Boar's Head in a statement on its website.
