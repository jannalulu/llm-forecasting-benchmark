Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The 2024 Grand Chess Tour usually features multiple tournaments with top chess players competing for overall victory.

2. The named players are significant contenders:
- Fabiano Caruana (consistently top-ranked)
- Alireza Firouzja (young prodigy, high-rated)
- Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu (rising Indian star)
- Gukesh Dommaraju (another strong Indian talent)

3. However, there are several other strong players who could win:
- Magnus Carlsen (if participating)
- Ding Liren
- Hikaru Nakamura
- Wesley So
- Ian Nepomniachtchi
- Anish Giri

4. Key considerations:
- Historical variety of winners in Grand Chess Tour
- The mentioned players are strong but not dominant
- Format allows for multiple strong competitors
- Performance variability throughout a season

5. The presence of multiple other elite players and the tour's length suggests a significant chance for another player to win.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 65.30%, with 55.40% being the most likely. Probability: 55.40%.
