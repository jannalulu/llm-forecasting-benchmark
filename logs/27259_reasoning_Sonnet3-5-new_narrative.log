Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with multiple monitors displaying data charts. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

NATE: [sipping coffee] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Netflix.

PHILIP: [nodding] Indeed. Given the company's stable subscriber growth and positive Q2/Q3 earnings, our models had it at 12.45% probability of layoffs.

NATE: The historical pattern of sporadic layoffs in previous years made some forecasters nervous, but the key indicators were different this time.

PHILIP: Right. Their content strategy shift and operational efficiency improvements from 2023 really paid off. No layoffs reported on Tech Crunch's tracker for August or September.

NATE: [pulling up a chart] The streaming wars have settled, and Netflix has found its steady state. Our models captured that stability perfectly.

PHILIP: Another win for superforecasting. Shall we look at our next prediction?

[They turn to their monitors as the scene fades]

Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with multiple monitors displaying data charts. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another quarter closed. Netflix managed to avoid any major layoffs reported by Tech Crunch."

Philip: [studying a graph] "Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.25%. The streaming wars have stabilized, and their subscriber growth remained steady through 2024."

Nate: "The probability was low but not negligible. Their cost-cutting measures from 2022 and 2023 seemed to have paid off. Remember when they laid off hundreds back then?"

Philip: "Indeed. Their financial discipline and focus on content efficiency made additional layoffs unnecessary. Though we had that brief scare in August when other streaming services were cutting staff."

Nate: "The models never lie, do they?"

Philip: [smiling] "No, they certainly don't."

[They both turn back to their monitors as the scene fades]

Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *scrolling through Tech Crunch's layoff tracker* "Well, no Netflix layoffs reported through September. Our models had it at 15.25%."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. Their Q2 earnings were strong, and they've been focusing on revenue growth through password sharing crackdowns and their ad-supported tier. The probability was low but not negligible."

Nate: "Right. The historical pattern of sporadic layoffs in '22 and '23 suggested some risk, but their 2024 strategy shifted toward optimization rather than cost-cutting."

Tetlock: "The streaming wars have stabilized somewhat. Though we had limited data as of August 19th, the indicators pointed to workforce stability at Netflix. Another win for superforecasting."

[Both men nod, satisfied with their model's accuracy]
