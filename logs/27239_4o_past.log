To forecast Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will start by analyzing the available information and trends, while applying the principles of superforecasting.

**1. Analysis of Current Approval Ratings:**
- Recent polls indicate a significant drop in Keir Starmer's approval ratings, reaching as low as 3% according to some reports. This dramatic reduction is associated with the handling of riots and protests, as well as controversial government decisions.

**2. Historical Context and Reference Classes:**
- Post-election "honeymoon periods" for new leaders typically boost approval ratings, but this trend appears to have reversed quickly for Starmer, suggesting a volatile approval trajectory.
- Comparing this with past UK prime ministers who faced a swift decline after an initial surge might suggest it's more likely that approval will remain low in future polls.

**3. Political and Social Factors:**
- Ongoing social unrest and dissatisfaction over government decisions, such as cuts in benefits, have contributed to a negative public perception.
- Historical patterns show that approval ratings for leaders tend to be impacted considerably by their handling of crises.

**4. Future Developments to Consider:**
- It's crucial to consider potential variables that could impact Starmer's approval, such as his responses to ongoing protests, economic conditions, or any major policy decisions that could sway public opinion either positively or negatively.

**5. Method of Prediction:**
- While initial approval diving to 3% is an extreme, it may suggest significant public dissatisfaction that could persist or fluctuate around this low range by mid-September.
- Both political context and response effectiveness to crises will play a pivotal role.

**6. Available Polling and Expert Opinions:**
- Metaculus forecasts on similar questions can guide the sentiment among knowledgeable predictors.
- No specific forecasts from major sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket, which highlights the existing uncertainty.

**7. Risk Assessment:**
- The approval rating could indeed shift above 40 depending on new developments, but given the current indicators, the probability of it remaining below 40 is significant.

**Forecast Justification:**
Based on all of this analysis, it seems likely that Keir Starmer's approval rating will remain low, under 40, given the immediate and compelling negative factors that are unlikely to be resolved easily.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, but 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating will be less than 40% on September 18, 2024, I will analyze the situation using historical data, current trends, and recent events.

**Reference Class and Historical Context:**
1. Approval ratings of UK Prime Ministers during crises: Approval ratings tend to fluctuate based on political events and crises. Historically, UK Prime Ministers have seen significant drops during crises, although some have recovered afterward.
2. New Prime Minister honeymoon period: Typically, new leaders experience a honeymoon period where their ratings are temporarily elevated, followed by a more realistic adjustment.

**Recent Trends and Events:**
1. Riots and Approval Ratings Drop: According to multiple sources, Starmer's approval rating recently plummeted to as low as 3% due to mass riots and his perceived poor handling of anti-mass migration uprisings.
2. Public Discontent: Recent articles highlight widespread public discontent with his policies and management of the social unrest, which complicates the potential for a rapid recovery in his approval ratings.
3. Lowest Rating Specified: Multiple sources confirm Starmer's approval dipped to single digits according to specific surveys, indicating a steep decline and suggesting challenges in reaching a 40% threshold shortly.
4. Political Climate: The climate is volatile, with significant socio-political challenges due to economic fragility, handling of social unrest, and public policy decisions like fuel subsidy cuts.

**Forecast Considerations:**
1. With a recent approval rate as low as 3%, a recovery to above 40% in just about a month seems unlikely, especially under prevailing public discontent.
2. Political recovery might be impeded by ongoing or worsening crises, while new developments can compound the negative perception.
3. Historical recoveries to normalcy after political crises often take longer without major positive breakthroughs, which does not seem feasible within the provided timeframe.

**Probability Judgment:**
Given the aforementioned factors, the probability that Keir Starmer's approval will be less than 40% on September 18, 2024, is high. The likelihood of a quick reversal of disapproval amid intensifying socio-political pressures appears low.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Background and Context**: Keir Starmer became Prime Minister in July 2024 after winning a landslide victory. His initial approval ratings were high, but recent events have resulted in a significant decline.

2. **Current Approval Ratings**: As of the latest news articles, Starmer's approval rating has plummeted, with figures as low as 3% reported by some sources. However, this figure might be extreme and could represent a particular survey rather than an aggregate.

3. **Historical Comparison**: It's important to recognize that approval ratings can fluctuate significantly over time due to changing political and social circumstances. A single policy decision or event can dramatically alter ratings, either positively or negatively.

4. **Current Situational Analysis**: The recent violent protests and criticism over policy decisions have negatively impacted Starmer's ratings. Recent polls indicate unrest and displeasure with his handling of these issues.

5. **Outside View**: Historically, new Prime Ministers tend to experience a "honeymoon period" with initially higher approval ratings, which taper off as their term progresses. However, Starmer's approval seems to be declining at a faster pace than might be expected.

6. **Inside View**: From the provided articles, Starmer's approval ratings seem to be declining due to the handling of mass riots and the public's dissatisfaction with his policies. There could be a chance for recovery if the government effectively manages the unrest and the disastrous public relations.

7. **Trends and Projections**: Given the current political environment and approval trends, it's reasonable to project continued volatility in Starmer's approval ratings. However, given the significant drop to 3% reported, even accounting for some recovery, reaching a sub-40 approval rating threshold seems plausible.

8. **Balancing Evidence**: The strong evidence of a rapid decline in approval ratings, combined with recent events, suggests that maintaining an approval rating above 40 will be challenging without significant positive developments.

9. **Adjustments**: Based on the severity of the political crisis and the significant drop in approval ratings, there's a reasonable likelihood that Keir Starmer's approval could remain below 40 by mid-September 2024.

Combining these insights, and emphasizing the importance of maintaining objectivity and considering both historical trends and current situational factors, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

Analyzing the given information and forecasting accurately requires careful consideration of various factors:

1. **Current Scenario and Recent Events**: Keir Starmer has faced significant challenges recently, including riots and protests that have drastically impacted his approval ratings. Reports from multiple sources, like Savanta and Opinium, indicate a sharp decline in approval ratings to as low as 3% at some points, emphasizing a highly negative public perception.

2. **Historical Context and Reference Class**: Generally, prime ministers experience fluctuations in approval ratings due to various crises, policy decisions, and political maneuvers. However, falling below 40% within a short period of taking office, particularly amid significant unrest, offers a relevant reference class where leaders have struggled to recover rapidly within a few months.

3. **Trend Analysis**: The approval ratings have shown a downward trend from their peak in late July 2024. The immediate causes, like protests, unfavorable policy decisions, and mishandling of unrest, seem persistent, with no immediate resolutions evident in the articles presented. This suggests continual pressure on approval ratings in the near term.

4. **Inside vs. Outside View Balance**: Looking at Starmer's specific factors (inside view) — his current crisis management and political positioning — combines with an outside view of similar leaders in crises, indicates that climbing out of such a severe dip in approval ratings is challenging within a month.

5. **Error Balancing and Judgment**: Given the linkage between Starmer's recent approval ratings and the upcoming conditions, it is feasible to expect that the rating might not dramatically increase beyond the 40% threshold by the targeted date unless a major positive development occurs.

Considering all of the above points, a range of probabilities is constructed to weigh the likelihood of an approval rating under 40 by September 18, 2024:

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 89.00% being the most likely. Probability: 89.00%.

To make a forecast on whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, we begin by analyzing the current data and trends.

**Context and Background:**

1. **Recent Approval Trends:** Keir Starmer's approval ratings have seen a significant drop following mass protests and riots, as noted in multiple news reports. His approval ratings have reportedly fallen to as low as 3% due to dissatisfaction with his handling of these crises.

2. **Initial High Ratings:** Around July 18, 2024, Starmer had reasonably high approval ratings, comparable to Boris Johnson's during the vaccine rollout, at about 36%. However, this positive rating was short-lived as it dropped drastically soon after due to ensuing protests and societal unrest.

3. **Events Affecting Popularity:** Recent events like anti-migrant protests, riots, and controversial policy decisions (such as cutting winter fuel payments) have negatively impacted his popularity, and these factors seem to have been persistent, suggesting sustained disapproval.

**Analysis and Considerations:**

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
   - Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions, policy decisions, and political stability. However, a drop from above 36% to below 40% is not uncommon in times of national crisis.
   - Given the current adverse events, a significant drop is consistent with past occurrences where Prime Ministers faced major social and political upheavals.

2. **Current Approval Rating Information:**
   - The most recent surveys suggest an extremely low rating (as low as 3%), indicating serious discontent that Starmer might struggle to recover from rapidly, especially given the ongoing issues.

3. **Extrapolation and Current Trends:**
   - If the trend of disapproval continues and no significant positive change occurs (such as successful policy implementations or resolution of the protests), it is likely his approval could remain lower than 40.

4. **Causal Forces:**
   - Negative: Public dissatisfaction, economic issues, protests, opposition criticism, and media portrayal.
   - Positive: Potential policy successes, recovery from unrest, and improved leadership perception.

**Balancing Evidence:**

- Given the currently very low approval ratings, the negative perception from the ongoing riots, and the lack of any immediate positive indications or significant recoveries, the probability that his approval rating will be less than 40% by September 18, 2024, is considerably high.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

   - If the trend of disapproval continues and no significant positive change occurs (such as successful policy implementations or resolution of the protests), it is likely his approval could remain lower than 40.

4. **Causal Forces:**
   - Negative: Public dissatisfaction, economic issues, protests, opposition criticism, and media portrayal.
   - Positive: Potential policy successes, recovery from unrest, and improved leadership perception.

**Balancing Evidence:**

- Given the currently very low approval ratings, the negative perception from the ongoing riots, and the lack of any immediate positive indications or significant recoveries, the probability that his approval rating will be less than 40% by September 18, 2024, is considerably high.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To make a forecast on whether Keir Starmer's approval rating as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be less than 40 on September 18, 2024, we begin by analyzing the current data and trends.

**Context and Background:**

1. **Recent Approval Trends:** Keir Starmer's approval ratings have seen a significant drop following mass protests and riots, as noted in multiple news reports. His approval ratings have reportedly fallen to as low as 3% due to dissatisfaction with his handling of these crises.

2. **Initial High Ratings:** Around July 18, 2024, Starmer had reasonably high approval ratings, comparable to Boris Johnson's during the vaccine rollout, at about 36%. However, this positive rating was short-lived as it dropped drastically soon after due to ensuing protests and societal unrest.

3. **Events Affecting Popularity:** Recent events like anti-migrant protests, riots, and controversial policy decisions (such as cutting winter fuel payments) have negatively impacted his popularity, and these factors seem to have been persistent, suggesting sustained disapproval.

**Analysis and Considerations:**

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
   - Historically, approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions, policy decisions, and political stability. However, a drop from above 36% to below 40% is not uncommon in times of national crisis.
   - Given the current adverse events, a significant drop is consistent with past occurrences where Prime Ministers faced major social and political upheavals.

2. **Current Approval Rating Information:**
   - The most recent surveys suggest an extremely low rating (as low as 3%), indicating serious discontent that Starmer might struggle to recover from rapidly, especially given the ongoing issues.

3. **Extrapolation and Current Trends:**
   - If the trend of disapproval continues and no significant positive change occurs (such as successful policy implementations or resolution of the protests), it is likely his approval could remain lower than 40.
