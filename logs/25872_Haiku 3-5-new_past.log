Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Goal Scoring Trends:
1. Goal statistics from tournament so far:
- Spain: 11 goals (highest of semi-finalists)
- France: 3 goals (lowest of semi-finalists)
- Netherlands: 9 goals
- England: 4 goals

Semi-Final Matches:
1. Spain vs France (July 9)
2. Netherlands vs England (July 10)

Scoring Probability Analysis:
- Spain has been prolific, suggesting high scoring potential
- France has defensive strengths but low scoring output
- Netherlands and England have moderate scoring records
- Tournament has seen 10 own goals, indicating unpredictability

Base Rate Consideration:
- Historical Euro semi-finals often have tense, tactical matches
- Average goals per knockout match in recent tournaments: ~2.3

Adjusting Factors:
- High-stakes matches tend to be more conservative
- Both matches have strong defensive teams
- Knockout stage typically sees fewer goals than group stages

Balancing Competing Considerations:
- Offensive talent suggests potential for goals
- Defensive tactics suggest potential low-scoring matches

Probability Calculation Reasoning:
- Base probability of 4+ goals: Around 45-55%
- Adjusting for defensive tendencies: Slightly lower

My Prediction: Between 42.50% and 57.50%, but 49.90% being the most likely. Probability: 49.90%.
