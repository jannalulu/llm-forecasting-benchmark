**Traders now betting on smaller Fed rate cut in September By Investing.com**
Investors are now betting on a smaller Federal Reserve interest rate cut of 25 basis points (bps) at the September 2024 meeting, rather than a jumbo 50 bps cut. According to the latest CME futures prices, the odds of a target rate of 5.00 - 5.25, representing a 25 bps decrease, have risen to 68% from 47% the previous week. The probability of a 50 bps cut has decreased to 32% from 53%. This shift is driven by recent economic data, including positive inflation readings from the PPI and CPI, and stronger-than-expected retail sales data, which supports the view of a soft landing. As a result, stocks have bounced back strongly after a recent sell-off. 'The Federal Reserve uses interest rate adjustments as a tool to control inflation and stabilize the economy,' said no source, but the article explains that a rate cut can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, while a rate hike can slow down an overheating economy and keep inflation in check.

**US Fed must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September or risk recession: Experts | Mint**
Wall Street experts believe that the US Federal Reserve must implement a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a potential recession. The Fed has maintained the benchmark interest rate at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with market expectations. As the US central bank has kept borrowing rates steady for 12 months to combat inflation, experts warn that a more substantial rate cut is necessary to mitigate the looming economic storm.

**US Federal Reserve ‘must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September' or risk recession: Experts**
The US Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark interest rates at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with Wall Street estimates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has set the stage for a potential rate cut in September, citing progress toward lower inflation and a cooler job market. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, warns that the Fed must 'go big' with a 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a looming economic storm. Consumer prices in the US rose modestly in July, fueling expectations of a rate cut. Powell said, 'a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table' when the Fed next meets in September.

**Fed expected to cut rates by 25 bps at September meeting: economist survey**
A recent survey of 51 economists by Bloomberg found that most expect the Federal Reserve to cut their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at their next meeting in September, contrary to calls for a 50-bp cut or an inter-meeting move. The economists' view aligns with Fed officials' statements that the central bank will be deliberate and patient in setting policy. Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said, 'We think financial markets might force the Fed to cut inter-meeting but otherwise don't think last week's data is enough of a reason.' The survey found that 60% of economists described the labor market as solid, though somewhat softened, while 24% called it significantly weakened but likely to stabilize. Traders, however, are leaning toward a 50-bp cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, giving that outcome a 54.5% probability vs. a 45.5% probability for a 25-bp reduction.

**The Fed confirmed a rate cut coming in September**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has hinted at a potential rate cut in September, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating that '...a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.' Powell emphasized that the decision will depend on inflation data, but set a relatively low threshold for incoming data. He also rejected the idea of starting with a 50 bps cut. As a result, mortgage rates are expected to decline in the near to medium term, with rates already decreasing from 7.10% to 6.70% in the past month. This has led many buyers to wait for further declines, although this tactic is considered risky.

**Probability of Fed Cutting Rates by 50 Bp in Sept 32.5%: Fedwatch Tool**
The probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points in September has increased to 32.5%, according to the FedWatch Tool. This comes after the probability of a 25 basis point cut was 67.5%. The dollar index has been trading near its lowest level in over a year against the Euro and Sterling, and a weak job market has made interest rate cuts more probable. As stated in the minutes of the July 30-31 FOMC meeting, several Fed officials were keen on an interest rate cut at the September policy meeting. Additionally, a Labor Department report revealed a weaker job market, with employers adding fewer jobs than originally reported in the year through March. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 18.

**US Interest Rate Cut Probability Returns to Majority Scenario**
The probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting US interest rates by 100 basis points (bp) in 2024 has returned to being the majority scenario, according to the CME Group's monitoring. The chance of rates ending the year between 4.25% and 4.50% is now 43.3%. The probability of a smaller cut, of 75 basis points, is 39.4%. For the September meeting, there was a slight increase in the probability of a 50 basis point cut, now at 27.5%. However, the majority view still favors a minimum reduction of 25 bp, with a 72.5% chance. The bets for a larger interest rate cut followed the release of US housing starts data, which fell well above market expectations and raised doubts about the strength of the US economy.

**Narrowing odds of 50 bps Fed rate cut weigh on rupee, RBI supports - ET Auto**
The Indian rupee is expected to hold near its all-time low on Friday due to slimmer chances of a 50 basis points (bps) rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The rupee has been in a narrow range in recent days, largely due to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) intervention. A currency trader noted, 'we would be at least' at 84.50 if it wasn't for the RBI's intervention, and 'the extent of dollar demand we are witnessing from importers is 'a lot'. The odds of a 50 bps rate cut at the September meeting are now 1-in-4, having climbed to nearly 50% recently. ANZ Bank stated, 'the totality of U.S. data releases this week support a gradual easing process by the Fed and have provided no evidence for a 'chunky' 50 bps cuts.'

**Yields mixed after CPI supports 25 bp Sept cut, with 50 bp not ruled out**
U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday after the July consumer inflation reading came in lower than expected, supporting a Federal Reserve easing of at least 25 basis points in September, with 50 bps not ruled out. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.2% monthly increase and 3.0% annual increase, which was in line with the actual numbers. The odds of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting had been nearly split between 50 bps and 25 bps, but futures moved in favor of a 25 bps cut after the report. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, said, 'The market is thinking that inflation is a little bit more sticky than the Fed was expecting, and they're penciling out some of that 50 basis point pricing.' Traders are still pricing in a full percentage point of easing from the current 5.25% to 5.5% fed funds rate by year-end. Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading, said that the Fed should go with 50 bp in September if fed funds are to fall by 100 bp over the remaining three meetings in 2024. The yield on the 10-year note fell 2.6 basis points to 3.828%, while the 2-year note yield rose 1.2 basis points to 3.9537%.

**Federal Reserve to cut by 50bps in September and November: Wells Fargo**
Wells Fargo analysts predict two 50 basis point rate cuts at the Federal Reserve's meetings on September 18 and November 7, citing emerging economic indicators and labor market vulnerabilities. They note that the FOMC has largely succeeded in returning inflation to its 2% target, but that recent data suggests the risks to the 'full employment' part of the dual mandate are rising. The bank argues that the FOMC needs to revert to a neutral policy stance quickly to prevent a cycle of labor market weakness, and forecasts a series of cuts, including a 25 bps reduction in December, followed by additional cuts in 2025. According to Wells Fargo, 'the FOMC needs to get back to a 'neutral' stance of policy quickly or else it risks a vicious circle of labor market weakness.'

**Wall Street, analysts ramp up bets for 50 bps rate cut in Sept after July jobs report**
The recent US jobs data has led to a shift in market expectations, with many analysts now calling for a 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the odds of a 50 basis point cut have jumped to 71.5% from 22% a day ago. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said, 'I am stunned by how quickly the market narrative has changed about what the Federal Reserve should do.' Several brokerages, including JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs, have called for bigger or earlier interest rate cuts, with some expecting a 50 basis point cut in September and November, followed by 25 basis point cuts at each subsequent meeting. 'We now think the FOMC cuts by 50bp at both the September and November meetings, followed by 25bp cuts at every meeting thereafter,' JPMorgan's Michael Feroli said. Citi's Veronica Clark and Andrew Hollenhorst added, 'We now expect the Fed to start the cutting cycle with 50bp rate cuts in September and November, followed by 25bp cuts at each subsequent meeting until reaching a policy rate of 3-3.25% by mid-2025.'

**US yields decline as market braces for dovish Fed**
US Treasury yields declined for the fourth consecutive day as investors anticipate a dovish Federal Reserve meeting. The JOLTS report and consumer confidence data briefly boosted yields, but expectations for a rate cut in September remained unchanged. Thomas Urano, co-chief investment officer at Sage Advisory, said, 'The whisper expectation is for the Fed to acknowledge softness in inflation and the labor market and maybe acknowledge the potential for policy adjustment in September.' The rate futures market continues to price in a 67 bps rate cut in 2024, with some investors increasingly pricing in a 50 bps cut. Greg Wilensky, head of US fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, said, 'The Fed will be responsive as to how the economy evolves as far as talking about a 50 basis-point cut.' The market expects the Fed to keep interest rates in the 5.25%-5.50% range for an eighth straight meeting on Wednesday.

**Fed Meeting May Signal Future Interest Rate Cut**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to hold a meeting today, which may signal a future cut in interest rates to combat high inflation. The Fed has kept interest rates high since last year, ranging from 5.25% to 5.50%, making credit more expensive for Americans. The institution is considering lowering rates in the coming months, but wants to ensure that price increases continue to slow down. The inflation rate has slightly decreased to 2.5% in June, down from 2.6% in May, according to the PCE index. Analysts at BPI expect the Fed to keep interest rates between 5.25% and 5.50% at the July meeting, with a potential first cut of 25 basis points after the summer. Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, predicts that the Fed will use this meeting to prepare for a potential first rate cut in September. Nathan Sheets, chief economist at Citi, notes that the process of disinflation is underway and suggests that the Fed should start the cycle of rate cuts in September. The September meeting is the last before the US presidential elections, which have recently seen a significant shift after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Despite high interest rates, the US economy remains solid, with the GDP growing at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate rising slightly to 4.1% in June, remaining among the lowest in the past 50 years.

**Bets on a double Fed rate cut in September surge**
According to CME Group 30-Day Fed Fund futures prices, the likelihood of a double U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in September has increased. The probability of a 50 bps cut to a target rate of 4.75-5.00% has risen to 22.3%, while the probability of a 25 bps cut to a target rate of 5.00-5.25% has decreased to 76.2%. There is also a growing chance of a 75 bps cut, with a probability of 1.5%. Traders are betting on a 100% chance of a September rate cut, either 25 bps, 50 bps, or 75 bps.
