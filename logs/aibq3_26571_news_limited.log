**Germany's 40-Year Curse: Can They Break the Jinx?**
Germany, a favorite to win the Euro 2024, faces Scotland in its first match. However, the team is haunted by a 40-year-old curse. Since Toni Kroos returned to the national team, Germany has not lost and has won three out of four matches. But this may not be enough to break the curse, as no host country has won the Euro since 1984. Germany will not only try to win its first international title in 10 years (World Cup 2014), but also try to break the curse. Only three teams have won the European Championship as hosts: France in 1984, Spain in 1964, and Italy in 1968. Since then, no team has been able to win the title as host. The Germans know how difficult it will be to win the final. They will face Scotland on June 14th at 20:40 on TF1 and TF1+. Follow the match live on TF1+ and make your predictions to challenge your friends, colleagues, and family!
