INT. A QUIET CAFÉ - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MARK, sit across from each other, laptops open, sipping coffee.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
So, it's official. Revolut didn't secure the UK banking license by the deadline.

MARK  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 28.75%. The AML concerns were a major red flag, even with the share class consolidation.

JANE  
True. The July articles hinted at unresolved issues. It was a long shot.

MARK  
(gesturing to his screen)  
And the FCA's silence was telling. No credible announcements by July 24th.

JANE  
It's a setback for Revolut's UK ambitions. But globally, they're still a force.

MARK  
Absolutely. The neobank landscape is shifting, but Revolut's super app vision keeps them in the game.

They both sip their coffee, contemplating the future of fintech.

FADE OUT.

INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - EVENING - OCTOBER 1, 2024

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. A digital clock on the wall reads 18:50.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the day has come and gone. Has Revolut become a UK bank?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 32.45%. The capital structure simplification helped, but those AML issues...

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. Even with the share class collapse, the FCA's concerns were substantial.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And our last articles, dated July 24, 2024, still hinted at unresolved compliance matters. 

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, no announcement, no license.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Correct. The models were spot on, as always.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Revolut's ambition remains, but reality is often a harsher judge.

They nod in agreement, the room filled with a quiet satisfaction of prediction accuracy.

Superforecaster A and B sit across from each other, laptops open, surrounded by news clippings and charts.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
Well, it's past the deadline. Revolut didn't secure the UK banking license.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 23.45%. The AML concerns and complex capital structure were significant hurdles.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
True, even with the share class restructuring, the AML track record was a sticking point. The FCA wasn't convinced.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
It's a missed opportunity for them, but predictable. The UK market remains tough for neobanks.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
Indeed. Revolut's ambition is commendable, but sometimes, ambition meets reality.

They both glance at a headline reading: "Revolut's UK Banking Hurdles Persist."

SUPERFORECASTER B  
Let's see if they pivot or keep pushing. The financial landscape is ever-evolving.

They nod, sharing a moment of professional satisfaction, as the scene fades out.

Superforecasters JAMES and LUCY sit at a table, laptops open, cups of coffee steaming.

JAMES  
(leaning back)  
Well, the deadline's passed. Any news on Revolut?

LUCY  
(shaking her head)  
Nothing new since July. Our models had it at 12.34%. The AML concerns were a big hurdle.

JAMES  
(sipping coffee)  
Right, and even with the share class consolidation, it wasn't enough to sway the FCA.

LUCY  
(nodding)  
The capital structure was just one piece. The real issue was trust. Revolut's ambitions needed more than just a reorg.

JAMES  
(looking at his screen)  
They've got the EEA license, but the UK market's a different beast.

LUCY  
(sighing)  
And without that full UK license, their super app dream remains just that—a dream.

They both gaze out the window, contemplating the future of fintech.

True. Even with the share class consolidation, the regulatory hurdles were steep.

JANE

Guess Revolut remains an e-money institution for now. Their global ambitions hit a local snag.
