Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timeline: We're looking at events until September 30, 2024 - approximately 2.5 months from now.

2. Current Context:
- Philippines-China relations are currently tense due to South China Sea disputes
- Recent aggressive encounters between vessels in disputed waters
- Philippines has strengthened military ties with the US, angering China
- Several diplomatic protests have been filed by both sides

3. Historical Precedent:
- While there have been numerous diplomatic protests, actual diplomatic expulsions between China and Philippines have been rare
- Both countries generally prefer to maintain diplomatic channels even during tensions

4. Factors Increasing Probability:
- Escalating tensions in South China Sea
- Recent water cannon incidents
- Philippines' increasingly assertive stance
- Growing US-Philippines military cooperation

5. Factors Decreasing Probability:
- Short timeframe (only 2.5 months)
- Economic interdependence
- Both sides' historical preference for other forms of protest
- Cost of diplomatic expulsions to bilateral relations

6. Assessment:
- Given the short timeframe and historical precedent, probability is relatively low
- However, current tensions are higher than usual
- Most likely scenario would be recall rather than expulsion

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 25.50%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%.
