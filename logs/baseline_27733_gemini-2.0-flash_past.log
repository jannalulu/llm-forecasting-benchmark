Okay, let's analyze this question carefully. The core issue is whether a debate between Trump and Harris will occur *specifically* on September 10, 2024.

Factors that increase the likelihood of the debate happening:

*   **It's currently scheduled:** A debate is scheduled for that date, which means significant resources and planning are already underway.
*   **Historical precedent:** Presidential debates are a long-standing tradition in US elections, and there's a strong expectation for them to occur.

Factors that decrease the likelihood of the debate happening:

*   **Trump's past behavior:** Trump has a history of backing out of debates or threatening to do so. He might perceive an advantage in not debating, or he might try to negotiate different terms.
*   **Health concerns:** Although unlikely for both candidates, health issues for either candidate in the next two weeks could lead to a cancellation or postponement. This becomes a greater risk as the candidates age.
*   **Negotiation failures:** Disagreements between the campaigns or the debate organizers over the format, moderators, or rules could lead to a cancellation.
*   **Unforeseen events:** Unexpected events (e.g., major national crisis, natural disaster) could cause the debate to be postponed.
*   **Candidate Replacement:** An extremely low, but non-zero, probability exists that either candidate could be replaced. For example, a serious health issue could force a candidate to withdraw. Although very unlikely, it introduces another element of uncertainty.

**Reasoning for probability assessment:**

The fact that a debate is scheduled and debates are generally expected is a strong starting point. However, Trump's unpredictability and the potential for unforeseen events introduce significant uncertainty. While I don't expect either candidate to withdraw, it cannot be ruled out entirely. Given the time constraints, it is unlikely that either party could replace a candidate and come to an agreement on a debate schedule by September 10th.

Considering all these factors, I believe the most likely outcome is that the debate will occur, but the probability isn't overwhelmingly high due to the potential for disruption.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.
