**Harris's top takedown moments ahead of Trump debate: ‘I'm speaking'**
Vice President Kamala Harris is set to debate former President Donald Trump on September 10 in Philadelphia. Harris has a history of delivering memorable one-liners and zingers in past debates. Some of her top takedowns include 'I'm speaking', which she used six times against former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, and 'That little girl was me', which she used to describe her experience as a child who was bused to school to integrate her public schools. Harris has also used one-liners to cut through chaos and make a point, such as 'America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we're going to put food on their table.' Harris has also grilled Trump appointees, including Brett Kavanaugh and William Barr, and has used her questioning to make a point about women's rights and government overreach. Harris's past debate performances offer clues to how she might take on Trump in their upcoming debate.

**"I'm Going To Let Her Talk": Donald Trump On Debate With Kamala Harris**
Donald Trump has announced that he will allow his opponent, Kamala Harris, to speak without interruption during their presidential debate next week, a shift from his usual combative style. Trump said, 'I'm going to let her talk.' The debate, hosted by ABC News, has been the center of a row over the rules for microphones, with Trump claiming the network is biased in favor of Harris. The rules state that microphones will be 'live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate.' Harris' team has expressed concerns that the muted microphones will disadvantage her and shield Trump from direct engagement. The debate is the first and potentially only opportunity for the two candidates to spar in person in a very close contest, with only two months until Election Day.

**Harris admits it: Wants open debate mics to sting Trump like Pence - Washington Examiner**
Kamala Harris has admitted that she wants open debate mics to 'sting' Donald Trump, similar to her 'I'm speaking' moments in the 2020 debate with Mike Pence. Harris is hoping to create more notable moments at next week's debate, which will be hosted by ABC News. Despite the Trump campaign and ABC News stating that the fight over open microphones is over and they will be shut off for the candidate not speaking, Team Harris is still pushing for them to be turned on. The media is poised to attack Trump as a bully, similar to how they did in the 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton.

**'I'm speaking': Kamala Harris snaps back at pro-Palestine hecklers**
Vice President Kamala Harris shut down pro-Palestine hecklers at her Michigan rally, warning them that if they continued, Donald Trump would win the election. Harris invoked her 2020 debate line, 'I'm speaking,' and said, 'Everyone's voice matters, but I am speaking now, I am speaking now.' She then attacked Trump's policies, saying he plans to give tax breaks to billionaires, cut social security and Medicare, and surrender the fight against the climate crisis. Harris's popularity has been growing, with new polls suggesting she is gaining support since President Joe Biden dropped out of the running for re-election.

**'I'm speaking': Kamala Harris shuts down hecklers to thunderous applause**
Vice President Kamala Harris was confronted by hecklers at a Detroit rally, but she effectively silenced them with a memorable line, 'You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking.' The crowd erupted in cheers, reminiscent of a similar moment in the 2020 vice presidential debates. Harris' line has become an iconic phrase, resonating with women who struggle to be heard. This incident follows a pattern of protesters disrupting events, including President Joe Biden's rallies, driven by anger over the US position on Israel.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris warned that Donald Trump will 'speak a lot of untruths' during their debate on Tuesday night. Harris said that Trump will likely revert to personal attacks and that she is prepared for it. According to a CNN report, Harris' campaign strategy involves using the debate to introduce her to undecided voters and highlight Trump's 'true colors'. Harris is well-prepared for Trump's likely strategies and will stay focused on policy issues and her vision to appeal to persuadable voters. The debate will take place on Tuesday at 9 pm (ET) at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

**Harris's top takedown moments ahead of Trump debate: 'I'm speaking' - Washington Examiner**
Vice President Kamala Harris is set to face off against former President Donald Trump in a debate on September 10. Harris has a history of delivering memorable one-liners and zingers in past debates, including 'I'm speaking,' which she used six times against former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. She also used this phrase in non-debate settings, such as when protesters tried to interrupt her during a campaign speech in Michigan. Harris's second-most famous debate moment came in 2019 when she knocked President Joe Biden for his opposition to busing as a way to desegregate schools in the 1970s, saying 'There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.' Harris has also grilled future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Attorney General William Barr during past debates, using phrases like 'Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?' and 'Sir, I'm asking a question.' However, Harris is also well-remembered for being on the receiving end of a zinger from former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) in 2019, who criticized Harris's record as a prosecutor and laughed when asked if she'd ever smoked marijuana herself.

**Kamala Harris has some debate moves. I know. I moderated her last one.**
Susan Page, the Washington Bureau chief of USA TODAY, moderated the 2020 vice-presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence. Harris held her own against Pence, displaying her command as a prosecutor and discipline to stick to her talking points. She effectively used the phrase 'Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking' to interrupt Pence when he tried to speak out of turn. Harris has improved her debating skills since the 2020 election cycle, where she struggled with big issues like Medicare-for-all. She has been sharper and more energetic at campaign rallies, with an ability to needle Donald Trump with humor. The debate showed Harris' ability to handle Trump's style of debating, which could be an advantage in the upcoming presidential debate.

**Trump Reveals Debate Strategy: Letting Harris Speak**
Donald Trump has announced his strategy for the upcoming debate with Kamala Harris, stating that he will let her speak and not interrupt her. 'I'm going to let her talk', Trump said during a Fox News interview in Pennsylvania. 'Debates are interesting, you can go with all the strategy you want, but you have to feel it out'. He also expressed concerns about the fairness of ABC, the network hosting the debate. 'I hope they're fair', he said. The debate, scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia, will be the first between Harris and Trump. Harris's campaign has accepted the debate rules, but expressed concerns about the microphone silencing rule, which they believe will favor Trump. Despite the concerns, they have agreed to the rules, including the microphone silencing. The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis and will be held without an audience at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

**Trump on Upcoming Debate with Kamala Harris: 'I'll Let Her Speak'**
Former US President Donald Trump stated that he would 'let her speak' during his next debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity, 'You and I had the same discussion when Biden was president, and I let him speak. I'll let her speak.' Trump expressed concerns about the fairness of the debate, saying 'It depends on ABC, will they be fair or not?' Trump also claimed that Harris' team wanted to take notes and have a table, but he opposed it. The ABC News rules prohibit note-taking and the candidates will be seated behind podiums. Trump also made an unsubstantiated claim that Harris' team would receive the questions in advance.

**Kamala Harris Agrees to Debate Rules with Donald Trump**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to the rules for the upcoming televised debates with her election opponent Donald Trump, including the rule of muted microphones, where opponents can only speak in turn. As reported by BBC, Harris' team initially opposed the rule, despite her predecessor in the presidential election, Joe Biden, agreeing to it. However, on Wednesday, both Harris' and Trump's campaigns agreed to the rules proposed by ABC News. In a letter to ABC, Harris' campaign stated that they still believe the debate format will be 'fundamentally unfair' as it will 'serve to protect Donald Trump from direct exchange of ideas with Vice President Harris.' However, they accepted the rules to ensure the debates can take place. 'We understand that Donald Trump risks missing the debates altogether, as he threatened to do earlier, if we do not agree to the format he prefers. Therefore, we accepted the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including the muted microphone,' the statement said. Trump's campaign stated that they are 'very happy' that Harris and her team 'accepted the agreed-upon rules.' The rules for the debates between Trump and Harris will be similar to those used during the June debates between Biden and Trump, organized by CNN. The debates will not include an audience and will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks, and microphones will only be turned on for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. Only moderators will be allowed to ask questions.

Meanwhile, a federal judge will hold a hearing on the special counsel's election interference case against Trump. The first ballots of the 2024 election will go out in North Carolina on Friday, with voting beginning tomorrow.

**Harris and Trump campaigns agree on debate rules after dispute over muted mics**
Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted the debate rules for the upcoming presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, despite concerns that the policy of muting microphones except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak will be to her disadvantage. Harris' campaign had initially advocated for live microphones for the whole debate, but ultimately accepted the rules to avoid jeopardizing the debate. The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis, and will feature a 90-minute format with two commercial breaks. A pool of journalists will be on hand to hear what the muted candidate may be trying to say when their microphone is turned off. Trump, who participated in a solo town hall with Sean Hannity on Wednesday, has repeatedly criticized ABC News as 'dishonest' and 'unfair', and has claimed that Harris' campaign will 'get the questions in advance'.

Kamala Harris' campaign is pushing for live microphones during the upcoming presidential debate with Donald Trump, citing the need for transparency and to prevent interruptions. Harris has a history of handling interruptions well, as seen in her past debates, where she has responded with phrases like 'Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking' and 'If you don't mind letting me finish, we can then have a conversation, OK?' Her campaign says she is 'ready to deal with Trump's constant lies and interruptions in real time.' Harris has also shown her ability to cut through the noise and create notable moments on the debate stage, such as her viral line 'Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking' during the 2020 vice presidential debate.

Harris spokesperson Ammar Moussa said, 'Both candidates have publicly made clear their willingness to debate with unmuted mics for the duration of the debate, but it appears Donald Trump is letting his handlers overrule him.' Trump said, 'Doesn't matter to me, I'd rather have it probably on. But the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time.'

**Trump and Harris Teams Still Discuss Debate Rules**
Donald Trump announced that he would participate in a presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, organized by ABC News, but the rules of the debate are still being discussed. A source close to Harris's campaign said that the issue of whether the microphones will be silenced when a candidate is not speaking, which Trump's team favors and Harris's team does not, is still an open discussion. Trump wrote on his social media that the rules of the debate 'will be the same as the last CNN debate, which seemed to work well for everyone except, perhaps', for President Joe Biden. The CNN debate, held in Atlanta on June 27, was disastrous for Biden, leading to his decision to end his re-election campaign on July 21. During that debate, the candidates' microphones were silenced when they were not speaking, a measure pushed by Biden's team. Trump's team considered this beneficial for him, as it avoided his frequent and damaging outbursts. In a press conference in Virginia on Monday, Trump said, 'I don't care. I think I'd prefer it on. But the agreement was that it would be the same as last time'. Ammar Moussa, Harris's spokesperson, said in a statement that 'both candidates have made clear their willingness to debate with microphones not silenced throughout the debate to allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates, but it seems that Donald Trump is letting his handlers override him. It's sad'.

That's sad!' The debates will not have a studio audience, and the candidates will stand on a single podium, with the order of speaking determined by a coin toss. The 90-minute debates will have two commercial breaks, and campaign staff will not be allowed to communicate with the candidates during that time. The candidates will be allowed to bring a pen, notebook, and water bottle, but no props or pre-written notes will be allowed.

However, there was no confirmation from Harris that a deal had been struck. Trump stated that the debate would follow the same rules as the CNN debate on Jun 27, with no studio audience and muted microphones when the other candidate is speaking. The Harris campaign responded by accusing Trump of moving the goalposts and was coy about accepting the terms.

Trump's campaign maintains that the debate should occur under the conditions agreed with Biden before he dropped out, while Harris's team says the Trump camp wants the mics muted to help the Republican maintain discipline when not speaking. 'They don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes,' Harris's team said. Trump has previously balked at taking part in the debate, accusing ABC of bias and questioning why he would participate on the network.

Former President Donald Trump announced that an agreement has been reached for a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC News on Sept. 10. However, Harris' campaign has yet to officially confirm the agreement.

Harris' campaign has accused Trump's campaign of gaming the system to protect their candidate, while Trump's campaign has accused Harris' campaign of seeking unfair advantages. Trump said, 'I have reached an agreement with Radical Left Democrats for a Debate with Comrade Kamala Harris.' Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, stated that Trump had 'accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate.'

**Harris wants to allow Trump to speak freely in upcoming debate**
Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, wants to allow Donald Trump to speak freely during their upcoming debate on ABC News on September 10. This is a reversal of a rule that the Biden team had implemented for their debate with Trump in June, which silenced a candidate's microphone when it was not their turn to speak. Harris's campaign is trying to give Trump the opportunity to sabotage himself with an insulting interruption or his aggressive personality. Trump's campaign is pushing back, but the former president undermined his own team's position by saying he would be happy to lose the mute button. The disagreement highlights the potential importance of the confrontation in defining the narrative of the rest of the campaign. For Trump, it is especially crucial as he has struggled to adapt to his new opponent since Biden's withdrawal; a performance he and his campaign believe Harris is not prepared to handle. 'Trump needs to debate. Harris needs to debate,' said CNN's Republican analyst, Scott Jennings. 'Both have something to prove.' The heated exchanges between the teams on Monday were another sign of how Harris has transformed the campaign. Her team is enjoying the opportunity to needle Trump, the self-proclaimed 'troll politician.' For example, they published a video on social media with images of the former president and the sound of a chicken clucking to suggest that he might withdraw from the debate. Harris's advisors also suggested that Trump's 'manipulators' had not dared to propose the question of the microphone to their boss. An open microphone would put Trump's self-discipline to the test in a debate with Harris, at a time when Republican strategists are begging him to stick to politics and abandon his aggressive style for the sake of his campaign. The images of Trump talking over and disrespecting the woman who has the chance to be the first black president would speak for themselves. Harris would also have the opportunity to demonstrate her strength in facing Trump by repeating her famous remark in the debate with Pence. Trump's histrionics with sexist or racist connotations could alienate women, minorities, and suburban voters, who could be crucial in the undecided states in November. The images of Trump behaving abominably would contribute to the general idea of Harris's campaign, which she sharpened during the Democratic National Convention last week; namely, that Americans have a 'fleeting opportunity to leave behind the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past.' 'The vice president wants the American people to see a Donald Trump without restrictions because that's what we'll have if he becomes president again,' said Harris's campaign spokesperson, Ian Sams, to CNN's Alex Marquardt. 'I think it's important that in these elections and at this moment the American people get to see the choice between the two candidates on stage.'

**Harris Wants to Give Trump a Chance to Speak Freely in Debate**
Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, wants to give Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, the opportunity to speak freely in their upcoming debate on September 10, without the restriction of a 'mute' button. Harris' campaign is trying to reverse a rule that the Biden team had established for their debate with Trump in June, which ensured that a candidate's microphone would be silenced when it was not their turn to speak. The rule was seen as an attempt to prevent Trump from interrupting his opponents, as he did in the 2020 debates. Trump's campaign is pushing back, but the former president has seemingly undermined his own team's position by saying he would be happy to lose the 'mute' button. The debate could be a crucial moment in the campaign, as Trump tries to regain momentum after Biden's withdrawal. Harris' team is eager to showcase Trump's behavior, which they believe could alienate key voting groups, such as women, minorities, and suburban voters. 'The vice-president wants the American people to see a Donald Trump without restrictions because that's what we'll have if he becomes president again,' said Ian Sams, Harris' campaign spokesperson. 'I think it's important that in these elections and at this moment, the American people get to see the choice between the two candidates on stage.'

**What Harris's last debate says about her odds against Trump - Washington Examiner**
Vice President Kamala Harris's last debate performance against Mike Pence in 2020 provides insight into what voters can expect from her when she debates Donald Trump on September 10. Harris was feisty and prepared for the charges Pence made against her, and she successfully defended her positions on various issues. She hit Pence six times with her signature 'I'm speaking' line, and she effectively countered his attacks on her record. Harris also showed her ability to connect with the audience, using expressive debating style and looking directly into the camera to drive home her points. Some of her statements from the 2020 debate have not aged well, but others sound like they could have been said in her 2024 stump speeches. Overall, Harris's performance suggests that Trump may be in for a tough battle when he sees her on the debate stage.

**Harris Gets Snippy with Protesters at Event**
Kamala Harris interrupted anti-Israel protesters at a rally, saying 'I'm speaking' and telling them 'If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking.' The incident highlights Harris' history of talking down to people and interrupting others. Despite her past struggles, including not making it to the first primary state in the 2020 election, Harris is now leading in some polls. The author argues that Harris' true nature needs to be exposed, and that she should be put on the debate stage with Donald Trump to 'poke holes in this façade the Dems and media have put up over these two clowns.'

**Kamala Harris Turns Intimidation into Political Advantage**
Vice President Kamala Harris has shown her ability to turn attempts to intimidate her into her own political advantage. During a rally in Detroit, when protesters interrupted her, Harris smiled and said, 'I'm speaking now.' However, as the interruption continued, her patience wore off and she said, 'Do you want to make Donald Trump win? Say it. If not, I'm speaking.' The crowd erupted in cheers as Harris remained silent, her jaw clenched and her eyes fixed. This was not the first time Harris has used her opponents' attempts to undermine her to her advantage. In a 2020 debate with then-Vice President Mike Pence, she raised her hand and said, 'I'm speaking, I'm speaking' when he tried to interrupt her. Harris has shown that she will not be intimidated and will use her opponents' tactics against them.

Vice President Kamala Harris shut down a group of pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted her at a rally in Detroit, saying, 'You know what? If you want Trump to win, then say that.

Harris takes particular umbrage at being interrupted and has shown a strong ability to stay calm and assertive in the face of disruptions.

**Harris Shrugs Off Trump Diss: 'Too Busy Talking to Voters'**
Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed Donald Trump's latest criticisms of her, saying 'I was too busy talking to voters. I didn't hear them.' Harris was responding to Trump's comments at a press conference, where he claimed that more people attended his 'Stop the Steal' speech on January 6 than Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech in 1963, without providing evidence. Harris also expressed doubt about whether Trump will actually show up for a debate with her, saying 'I am beyond trying to speculate about how he thinks.' The Harris campaign has stated that she will not agree to debate Trump on Fox News on September 4, and any debates after September 10 depend on Trump's presence at the first debate.

**Harris Says She's ‘Too Busy Talking to Voters' to Listen to Trump Attacks**
Vice President Kamala Harris responded to Donald Trump's criticisms by saying, 'I was too busy talking to voters. I didn't hear them.' Harris was asked about Trump's rambling attacks earlier in the day, but she seemed unbothered, focusing on her scheduled event with the United Auto Workers union. Harris also expressed doubt about whether Trump will actually show up to their upcoming debate on ABC News, saying, 'I'm glad that he finally agreed to a debate. I'm looking forward to it, and I hope he shows up.' The Harris campaign has stated that she will not agree to a debate on Fox News and that any debates after the one on Sept. 10 depend on Trump's presence there. Trump has made several false claims, including that more people attended his 'Stop the Steal' speech than Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech, and has encouraged reporters to question Harris about her ethnicity. Harris dismissed Trump's comments as 'the same old show' and emphasized her focus on talking to voters.

**'I Am Speaking Now': At a Rally in Detroit, Harris Stares Down Her Detractors**
Vice President Kamala Harris showed her ability to turn efforts to undermine her into her own political weapons at a rally in Detroit, where she was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters. When they continued to disrupt her, she said, 'You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking.' Her reaction also highlighted her dislike of being interrupted, as seen in her 2020 debate with Mike Pence, where she repeatedly said, 'Mr. Vice President, I am speaking.' This approach is a new way for her to deal with protests, as seen in President Biden's response to similar interruptions in January. Harris's Detroit stare-down was a reminder of her ability to stay calm and assertive in the face of adversity.

**Kamala Harris Stands Firm on Debate with Donald Trump, Only on ABC**
Kamala Harris has stated that she will only debate Donald Trump on ABC, as agreed upon by the Democrats, and not on Fox News as Trump prefers. After initially showing reluctance to debate the Vice President, citing his lead in the polls, Trump announced on Truth Social that he is ready to speak, but only on Fox News and not on ABC as previously agreed when Joe Biden was the Democratic presidential candidate. Trump wrote, 'I agreed with Fox News to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4. The debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but it was cancelled because Biden will no longer participate.' Harris' campaign responded, saying that Trump is scared and trying to back out of the debate he already committed to, and that she will only appear on ABC. 'Donald Trump is scared and trying to back out of the debate he already committed to and running to Fox News to get out of it,' said Michael Tyler, Harris' campaign director of communications. 'He needs to stop playing games and show up to the debate he already committed to on September 10. The Vice President will be there one way or another to take advantage of the opportunity to speak to a national audience at prime time.'

**Kamala Harris Challenges Donald Trump to a Debate: 'Say It to My Face'**
Vice President Kamala Harris has responded strongly to Donald Trump's criticism, challenging him to discuss their differences face-to-face in a debate. Harris made the call during a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, where she directly addressed the Republican candidate and invited him to a public debate. This challenge comes after Trump questioned Harris's identity and made harsh comments during the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention in Chicago. Harris, who was recently confirmed as a Democratic presidential candidate, used her speech to confront Trump's accusations and reinforce her stance in the political race. She emphasized that Trump should not only speak negatively about her, but do so directly in a public debate. Harris said, 'If you have something to say to me, say it to my face.' The vice president highlighted that the momentum in the presidential campaign is shifting and that Trump is feeling the impact of her growing support. Harris urged Trump to reconsider participating in a scheduled presidential debate on September 10 and emphasized that his criticisms should be confronted directly in a face-to-face setting. This invitation to a debate reflects the growing tension between the two leaders and underscores the crucial role that debates play in American politics. Harris's response also aims to solidify her position as a Democratic candidate and demonstrate her willingness to face criticism and challenges openly and directly.

In a 21-minute speech, Harris highlighted her time as a public prosecutor and Attorney General in California. However, it was when she directly addressed Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, that the crowd erupted in cheers. Harris has repeatedly called on Trump to participate in a televised debate before the presidential election, but Trump has not confirmed his participation. In a recent TV interview, Trump criticized Harris' laughter, saying he hopes someone in her campaign team has told her to stop laughing, as it's hard to listen to. Harris responded from the stage, saying, 'So Donald, I hope you will reconsider meeting me on stage. As they say, if you have something to say, say it to my face.' The crowd, according to The New York Times, 'exploded' in cheers at the comment. It is likely that Harris will be nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate in a few days, as she is the only one who has qualified for the ballot at the party's convention.
