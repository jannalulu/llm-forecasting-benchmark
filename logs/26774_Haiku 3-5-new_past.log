Let me carefully analyze this question step by step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Gukesh's Recent Performance:
- Won Candidates Tournament in April 2024
- Strong performance in Superbet Chess Classic Romania (finished tied for 2nd)
- Currently preparing for World Chess Championship
- Demonstrated growing consistency at top-level tournaments

2. Grand Chess Tour Structure:
- Multiple tournaments across 2024
- Points accumulate across events
- Not just performance in one tournament determines winner

3. Competitive Landscape:
- Tough competition from Caruana (won Superbet Classic)
- Strong players like Firouzja, Praggnanandhaa, Nepomniachtchi also competing
- Each tournament has potential to shift standings dramatically

4. Remaining Tournaments:
- Need to verify if all scheduled tournaments will occur
- Performance in upcoming events crucial

Probability Reasoning:
- Base rate for young prodigy winning tour: Relatively low
- Gukesh's current trajectory: Rapidly improving
- Tour requires sustained excellence across multiple events

Balancing Factors:
- Youth and potential (+)
- Inconsistent rapid/blitz performance (-)
- Strong competitive field (-)
- Rising international reputation (+)

Calibration Approach:
- Not overwhelming favorite
- Significant potential but not guaranteed
- Need to account for variability

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.75%, but 24.60% being the most likely. Probability: 24.60%.

Let me systematically analyze this question:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Tournament Performance Indicators
- Gukesh recently won the Candidates Tournament
- Currently performing strongly in Superbet Classic (winning first round against Deac)
- Showed resilience in drawing against top players like Nepomniachtchi
- Ranked 7th globally as of August 2024 FIDE ratings

2. Grand Chess Tour Context
- Multiple tournament legs involved (Superbet Classic Romania is second leg)
- Caruana currently leading in points
- Competitive field includes Caruana, Firouzja, Nepomniachtchi, Praggnanandhaa

3. Historical Performance Considerations
- Young players like Gukesh can be unpredictable
- Demonstrated tactical depth but less consistent in rapid/blitz formats
- Preparing for World Championship might impact Grand Chess Tour focus

4. Competitive Landscape
- High-quality field makes outright victory challenging
- No single dominant performer emerges from current data
- Multiple strong contenders like Caruana seem equally positioned

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base probability of winning Grand Chess Tour for top-10 player: ~15-25%
- Gukesh's recent form and youth suggest potential upside
- Counterbalanced by tour's complexity and strong competition

Adjusting Factors:
- Positive: Recent tournament performances
- Negative: World Championship preparation might distract
- Neutral: Competitive tournament structure

Careful Error Balancing:
- Risk of overestimating youth potential
- Risk of underestimating competitive depth
