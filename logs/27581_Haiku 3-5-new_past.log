Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Timing Context
- Brockman announced a sabbatical through end of 2024
- Current date is August 23, 2024 - so about 4 months remain until October 1 deadline

2. Personal Statements
- Brockman says mission is "far from complete"
- Explicitly states he's coming back after sabbatical
- Suggests continued commitment to OpenAI's goals

3. Company Context
- Major leadership turbulence at OpenAI
- Several founders have left (Schulman, Sutskever)
- Only Altman, Brockman, Zaremba remain of original founders

4. Probability Considerations
- Strong personal investment in company's mission
- Historically loyal to OpenAI 
- No clear antagonistic break indicated
- Explicitly framed as temporary leave

Counterpoint Considerations:
- High organizational volatility
- Potential alternative opportunities
- Possible continued disillusionment

Balancing these factors, I see a high probability of return.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 94.30%, but 91.20% being the most likely. Probability: 91.20%.

Let me systematically analyze this:

Key Evidence:
1. Greg Brockman explicitly stated he's taking a "sabbatical until the end of the year"
2. He emphasizes the mission is "far from complete"
3. Only three original founders remain at OpenAI
4. Significant internal tensions exist at the company
5. Multiple high-profile departures (Schulman, Sutskever, Leike)
6. Sam Altman remains CEO

Considerations:
- Brockman specifically said he's "coming back after his vacation"
- He seems committed to OpenAI's mission
- No indication of permanent departure
- Internal tensions might complicate return

Reference Class:
- Tech executive sabbaticals often result in return
- OpenAI has experienced significant volatility recently

Probability Calculation:
- Base probability of return: 75%
- Adjustment for internal tensions: -10%
- Adjustment for commitment to mission: +5%

Balancing Factors:
- Strong personal connection to company
- Ongoing AGI development goals
- Relatively short planned absence (through end of 2024)

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 80.25%, but 72.75% being the most likely. Probability: 72.75%.

Let me systematically analyze the evidence:

Key Observation Points:
1. Brockman explicitly stated he's taking a "sabbatical until the end of the year"
2. He emphasized "The mission is far from complete"
3. Multiple news sources indicate he intends to return
4. Only three of 11 original founders remain at OpenAI
5. There's ongoing internal tension at the company
6. Elon Musk lawsuit and other departures create uncertainty

Probability Considerations:
- Brockman has been a consistent ally of Sam Altman
- His language suggests a temporary departure, not permanent exit
- He seems committed to OpenAI's long-term mission
- Contradictory signals: high executive turnover vs personal commitment

Base Rate Adjustment:
- Similar tech executive "leaves" often involve eventual return
- Strong personal investment in company's founding suggests return likelihood

Balancing Factors:
- High uncertainty from ongoing company turbulence
- Personal statements suggest return intention

Forecast Reasoning:
- Strong personal motivation to return
- Explicit statement about incomplete mission
- Minimal alternative career signaling

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 92.30%, but 84.70% being the most likely. Probability: 84.70%.

- Greg Brockman announced a sabbatical until end of 2024
- He stated the mission is "far from complete"
- Most OpenAI founders have left recently (Schulman, Sutskever, etc.)
- Only Altman and Zaremba remain from original founders

2. Reference Class Analysis:
- Tech executive sabbaticals often signal transition/potential exit
- Multiple high-profile departures suggest organizational instability
- Brockman was previously deeply committed to OpenAI
- His statement suggests potential return

3. Contextual Considerations:
- High uncertainty in OpenAI's leadership structure
- Potential attractiveness of rejoining vs exploring new opportunities
- Existing relationship with Altman may influence decision
- Strong commitment to AGI mission expressed in his statement

4. Probability Reasoning:
- Base probability of return: Moderate
- Positive factors: Mission commitment, existing relationships
- Negative factors: Organizational turbulence, other opportunities

5. Probability Calibration:
- Significant likelihood of return before October 1, 2024
- But not overwhelmingly certain due to recent departures

Balancing these factors carefully:

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 74.30%, but 67.20% being the most likely. Probability: 67.20%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence:
1. Greg Brockman explicitly stated he's taking a "year-long sabbatical until the end of the year"
2. He emphasized "The mission is far from complete; we still need to create a safe AGI"
3. Several other OpenAI co-founders have left (Schulman to Anthropic, Sutskever starting Safe Superintelligence)
4. Sam Altman remains CEO and Brockman has been a key ally historically
5. Brockman said he's "coming back after his vacation"

Considerations:
- Direct statement suggests intent to return
- Strong continued commitment to OpenAI's mission
- Personal relationship with Altman remains intact
- Leave is temporary and explicitly time-bounded
- No indication of fundamental disagreement causing permanent departure

Counterpoints:
- Significant organizational turbulence at OpenAI
- Multiple high-profile departures
- Potential opportunity at another AI company

Base Rate Adjustment:
- High-level tech executives often return after sabbaticals
- Strong personal investment in original company's mission

Balancing these factors, I conclude there's a high probability of return.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.50% being the most likely. Probability: 90.50%.
