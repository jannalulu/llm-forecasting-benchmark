**SIPRI: Nuclear-armed states continue to modernize their arsenals**
Nine nuclear-armed states, including the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals in 2023. According to SIPRI, the total number of nuclear warheads decreased to 12,121, but the number in a state of combat readiness increased to around 9,585. Most of these warheads belong to Russia and the US, but China is expected to have brought its warheads into combat readiness for the first time. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are exploring the possibility of placing multiple warheads on ballistic missiles. NATO members are discussing whether to bring their nuclear weapons into a state of combat readiness. The block believes that the world becomes dangerous if Russia, China, and North Korea have nuclear weapons, but NATO does not.

**Nuclear-Armed States Continue to Modernize Their Arsenals**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), nine nuclear-armed states - the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel - continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and some of these countries deployed new systems with nuclear warheads or the capability to carry nuclear warheads in 2023. The total number of nuclear warheads is decreasing, currently numbering 12,121, but the number in a state of combat readiness is increasing, with approximately 9,585 warheads. Of these, around 3,904 were deployed on rockets and aircraft, which is 60% higher than the estimates for January 2023. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated that the alliance is considering whether to bring its nuclear weapons to a state of combat readiness, citing concerns that the presence of nuclear weapons in Russia, China, and North Korea makes the world a more dangerous place.

**SIPRI: Nuclear-Armed States Modernize Arsenals Amid Ongoing Wars**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), nuclear-armed states are modernizing their arsenals amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 'Nine nuclear-armed states - the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel - continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and some of these countries deployed new systems with nuclear warheads or the capability to carry nuclear warheads in 2023', according to SIPRI's new annual report. SIPRI Director Dan Smith notes that while the overall number of nuclear warheads is decreasing, there is a growing number of nuclear warheads in a state of readiness. According to the report, this trend is likely to accelerate in the coming years. The report states that of the 12,121 nuclear warheads in the world as of January 2024, around 9,585 were in a state of readiness. At least 3,904 of these were deployed on missiles or aircraft, which is 60 more than in January 2023. Around 2,100 of the deployed warheads were in a state of high readiness on ballistic missiles. SIPRI notes that China may have deployed its warheads in a state of high readiness for the first time. SIPRI also writes that India, Pakistan, and North Korea are currently working on equipping ballistic missiles with multiple warheads, which is likely to lead to an increase in the number of operationally deployed nuclear warheads.

**Global Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Update: A Growing Concern**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the nine nuclear-armed countries, including the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, have continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and deployed new nuclear weapons in 2023. As of January 2024, there were approximately 9,585 nuclear warheads in military stockpiles, with around 3,904 deployed on ballistic missiles and aircraft, a 60% increase from January 2023. The remaining warheads were stored in central storage facilities. Most of these warheads belong to Russia or the US, but China is believed to have some warheads on high alert for the first time. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are also seeking to acquire the ability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles, which Russia, France, the UK, and the US already possess, and China has recently acquired. This could lead to a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the potential for countries to threaten to destroy a much larger number of targets.

**The Planet Plays with Fire: The Growing Danger of Nuclear Weapons**
The world is living in one of the most dangerous moments in history due to the supremacy of nuclear weapons in a scenario of growing conflicts in various regions of the planet, from Eastern Europe to the Middle East. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in 2023, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and deployed new weapons or systems. The total number of nuclear weapons in circulation worldwide is estimated to be 12,121, with almost all belonging to Russia (5,580) and the United States (5,044). The SIPRI report recognizes that its figures on nuclear forces are approximate and are updated annually based on new information. However, Russia and the United States do not publish the totals of their respective strategic nuclear forces since 2023, when Russia withdrew from the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last agreement on nuclear weapons between the two countries, although both extended it for five years. The report also highlights the growing military spending on nuclear weapons, with the nine nuclear-armed countries together spending $91.4 billion in 2023, which represents $173,884 per minute or $2,898 per second. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) estimates that this amount could cover 27% of the current funding for climate change mitigation, biodiversity protection, and pollution reduction. The article concludes that the world is walking close to the abyss and it is time for the great powers to take a step back and reflect, preferably together.

**World's nuclear powers strengthening arsenals as tensions grow**
Nuclear-armed countries are strengthening their arsenals and several have made ready new nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable weapons systems amid rising geopolitical tensions, a new report has found. The nine nuclear states – the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel – have continued to modernise their weapons stockpiles, with China, for the first time, possibly deploying 'a small number of warheads on missiles during peacetime'. The global total of nuclear warheads continues to fall as Cold War-era weapons are gradually dismantled, but the number of operational nuclear warheads is increasing. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that 3,904 warheads were deployed with missiles and aircraft, or 60 more warheads than in January 2023. China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country, and North Korea's military nuclear program continues to be 'a central element of its national security strategy'. The Swedish think tank said the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have further weakened nuclear diplomacy on the global stage.

**Global Spending on Nuclear Weapons Reaches 91.4 Billion Dollars in 2023**
The global spending on nuclear weapons has reached 91.4 billion dollars in 2023, a 13% increase from the previous year. According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), all nine nuclear-armed states have increased their spending, with the United States leading the way with 51.1 billion dollars. The report highlights that this spending could be used to combat climate change, save endangered species, and improve healthcare and education worldwide. Ican also notes that the last three countries to possess nuclear weapons - Israel, India, and Pakistan - do not provide transparent data. The organization is calling for a global week of action from September 16 to 22 with the slogan 'No money for nuclear weapons!' and is urging people to communicate what they would prefer the money to be spent on. According to Ican, in the last five years, 387 billion dollars have been spent on nuclear weapons, with an annual increase of 34%. The report also reveals that nuclear-armed states have contracts with companies worth at least 387 billion dollars to produce nuclear weapons, with some contracts extending until 2040. These profits incentivize nuclear weapon producers to spend millions of dollars to influence government policy and public opinion through think tanks.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China's nuclear arsenal increased from 410 warheads in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024, and is expected to continue growing. The report also found that around 2,100 deployed warheads were kept in a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles, with nearly all belonging to Russia or the US, and for the first time, China is believed to have some warheads on high operational alert. The SIPRI report also noted that India, Pakistan, and North Korea are pursuing the capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles, which could enable a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the possibility of threatening the destruction of more targets.

**Nuclear-Armed States Strengthen Their Arsenals**
According to the SIPRI report, nuclear-armed states are strengthening their arsenals. Some countries have deployed new nuclear weapons. As of January 2024, approximately 9,585 nuclear warheads were in military stockpiles for potential use, out of a total global stockpile of around 12,121 warheads. According to SIPRI estimates, 3,904 warheads were deployed with rockets and aircraft, a 60% increase from January 2023, while the rest were stored in central storage. About 2,100 deployed warheads were in a state of heightened readiness on ballistic missiles. 'Almost all these warheads belonged to Russia or the US, but for the first time, some Chinese nuclear warheads are considered to be in a state of heightened readiness,' the report said. Despite the overall number of nuclear warheads in the world continuing to decrease as Cold War-era weapons are dismantled, SIPRI experts continue to observe an annual increase in the number of operational nuclear weapons. The trend is expected to continue and accelerate in the coming years. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are trying to deploy several warheads on ballistic missiles already possessed by Russia, France, the UK, the US, and recently appeared in China. 'This would give the potential for a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the ability for nuclear-armed countries to threaten a much larger number of targets,' the report said. Russia and the US together possess almost 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world. Analysts at the institute note that the sizes of their respective military nuclear stockpiles (i.e., warheads ready for use) appear to have remained relatively stable in 2023, although Russia deployed approximately 36 more warheads in operational forces than in January 2023. Transparency regarding nuclear forces has decreased in both countries since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and debates around nuclear disarmament agreements have become more relevant. As for China's nuclear arsenal, SIPRI's estimate of its size increased from 410 warheads in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024, and is expected to continue growing.

**Nuclear weapons spending increases as tensions rise**
The nine nuclear-armed states are modernizing their nuclear weapons, as they rely more heavily on deterrence until 2023, according to a Swedish think tank. Russia and its ally Belarus have started a second training phase to train troops in handling tactical nuclear weapons, part of the Kremlin's efforts to deter the West from strengthening its support for Ukraine. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) reported that the nine nuclear-armed states will spend a total of 85.4 billion euros on their arsenals in 2023, a 10 billion euro increase from 2022. The US accounts for 80% of this increase. China is the second-largest contributor, followed by Russia. ICAN's coordinator Alicia Sanders-Zakre said, 'All this money does not improve global security, but threatens people wherever they live.' The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that about 2,100 warheads are on high alert, with almost all belonging to Russia or the US. SIPRI director Dan Smith said, 'Unfortunately, the number of operational nuclear warheads is increasing year by year, which is extremely worrying.' The US and Russia together account for almost 90% of all nuclear weapons. The size of their military stockpiles appears to have remained relatively stable in 2023, although Russia has deployed an estimated 36 warheads more than in January 2023.'

**Nuclear Arms: Rising Tensions Push Countries to Modernize Their Arsenal**
As geopolitical tensions rise worldwide, nuclear powers are modernizing their arsenals, according to researchers, who urge world leaders to 'take a step back and think'. The nine nuclear-armed states - Russia, the US, France, India, China, Israel, the UK, Pakistan, and North Korea - have all modernized their nuclear arsenals, with several deploying new systems in 2023. As of January, there were approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads in the world, with around 9,585 available for potential use. Wilfred Wan, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), warned that 'we are currently living in one of the most dangerous periods in human history'. He urged world leaders to 'take a step back and think' and to work together to address the sources of instability, including political rivalries, economic inequalities, ecological disturbances, and the acceleration of arms races. The Sipri also noted that China has deployed some nuclear warheads on high alert, ready for immediate use, for the first time. 'The abyss is staring us in the face, and it's time for the great powers to take a step back and think. Preferably together', said Dan Smith, Sipri's director. 'The number of operational nuclear warheads is increasing year by year, and this trend will likely accelerate in the coming years', he added.

The US accounted for 51.5 billion dollars, the largest share, while China spent 11.8 billion dollars and Russia spent 8.43 billion dollars. ICAN's Policy and Research Coordinator Alicia Sanders-Zakre stated that the trend of increasing spending on nuclear weapons is 'inhumane and destructive'. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) also reported that the number of operational nuclear warheads is increasing, with almost 2,100 warheads on high alert, mostly belonging to Russia or the US. SIPRI Director Dan Smith expressed concern that this trend will continue and is extremely worrying. The institute also noted that Russia and the US together possess almost 90% of the world's nuclear weapons.

**Nuclear Rearmament Advances as Global Tensions Escalate**
The nine nuclear-armed states - Russia, the United States, France, India, China, Israel, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and North Korea - have modernized their nuclear arsenals and installed new systems in 2023. The majority of these nuclear weapons belong to Russia and the United States, which together possess 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. 'There are many sources of instability: political rivalries, economic inequalities, ecological disturbances, and the acceleration of arms races. We are on the brink of the abyss, and it's time for the great powers to take a step back and reflect on the matter. Preferably, together,' emphasized. The rearmament of nuclear weapons is advancing as tensions escalate globally, with researchers urging world leaders to 'retreat and reflect.' The United States has announced new aid to Ukraine, worth 1.4 billion euros, to expand energy production, encourage private investment, and protect energy infrastructure. The United States has also announced an additional 1.5 billion euros in aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, the US military has destroyed seven Houthi rebel radars in Yemen to prepare attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

**Nuclear Rearmament Advances as Geopolitical Tensions Rise**
The director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's (SIPRI) Nuclear Weapons Program, Wilfred Wan, stated, 'Since the Cold War, nuclear weapons have not played a role as important in international relations.' The nine nuclear-armed states - Russia, the United States, France, India, China, Israel, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and North Korea - have modernized their nuclear arsenals and several have installed new systems in 2023. As of January, there were approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads in the world, with 9,585 prepared for potential use. About 2,100 of these warheads were kept in a state of 'high operational alert' for ballistic missiles. The majority of these warheads belong to Russia and the United States, which together possess 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. For the first time, SIPRI considered that China also has 'some warheads on high operational alert', meaning ready to be used immediately. SIPRI's director, Dan Smith, warned, 'We are currently living in one of the most dangerous periods in human history.' He emphasized that there are many sources of instability, including political rivalries, economic inequalities, ecological disturbances, and the acceleration of arms races. We are on the brink of a precipice, and it is time for the major powers to take a step back and reflect on the issue. Preferably, together.' In February 2023, Russia announced the suspension of its participation in the New START treaty - 'the last treaty controlling (...) the strategic nuclear power of Russia and the United States.' SIPRI also observed that Moscow conducted military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian border in May this year. Although 'the total number of nuclear warheads continues to decrease as weapons from the Cold War era are progressively dismantled', there is an increase in the number of operational nuclear warheads, year after year, by the nuclear powers, lamented the Swedish research institute's director. He added that this trend will continue and 'probably accelerate' in the coming years.

**Number of Nuclear Warheads in State of Readiness Increases, Says SIPRI**
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has reported that nine countries - the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel - are modernizing their nuclear arsenals, with an increase in the number of nuclear warheads in a state of readiness. According to SIPRI, although the total number of nuclear warheads is decreasing, the number of warheads in a state of readiness is increasing. The trend is likely to accelerate in the coming years, according to SIPRI Director Dan Smith. The report notes that as of January 2024, around 9,585 nuclear warheads were in a state of readiness, with around 3,904 of them deployed on missiles or aircraft, a 60% increase from January 2023. SIPRI also notes that India, Pakistan, and North Korea are currently working on equipping ballistic missiles with multiple warheads, which is likely to lead to an increase in the number of operational nuclear warheads.

**Forthcoming US Nuclear Missile Tests – ‘Nothing to Do with World Events'**
The Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB) announced that it will conduct two test launches of unarmed LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) on June 4 and 6. The tests aim to demonstrate the missiles' functionality and readiness, as the US nuclear forces' deterrent. The Minuteman III missiles have been in service since the 1970s and are expected to be replaced by the Sentinel ICBM in the mid-2030s. The tests were originally scheduled for February but were postponed due to infrastructure repairs. The US has provided advance notice of the tests as required by the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation and notified Russian authorities in advance.

**US Discusses Russian Military-Cosmic Developments with India and China**
The United States is discussing Russian military-cosmic developments, including plans to create a potential nuclear anti-satellite weapon, with several countries, including India and China. US Deputy Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins stated that there were talks with Russia, as well as separately with China and India, on this issue. The US is seeking to work with other countries to urge Russia not to proceed with such developments. Jenkins emphasized that the US will continue to work with international forums, multilateral forums, and other countries to prepare for responsible behavior in space. In February 2024, the US government, including President Joe Biden, accused Russia of considering the possibility of placing nuclear weapons in space, without providing evidence. Russia has denied these allegations, with President Vladimir Putin stating that Moscow has always been against and remains opposed to placing nuclear weapons in space.
