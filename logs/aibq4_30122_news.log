**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The court stated that the decision to replace the Roman judge investigating in Gaza was due to health reasons. The ICC had previously requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor of the court, Karim Khan, explained that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Israeli Prime Minister was criminally responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court also requested an arrest warrant for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'causing genocide, causing famine as a means of warfare, including preventing humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeting civilians in the conflict.' The ICC is an independent judicial body that has jurisdiction over individuals accused of committing genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

**International Criminal Court to Change Judge in Netanyahu Case**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it will change one of the judges who will preside over the request of the prosecution to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The request was made by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, on May 20, to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for their responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The President of the Court stated that 'the President of the Court in that case, Judge Julia Motoc from Romania, requested a substitute for herself for health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia.' This development is expected to further delay the Court's decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Israeli Channel 12 reported on Friday that the delay is likely to be longer due to Judge Holzer's need to review the legal details of the case. Israel submitted documents to the Court on September 20, challenging the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, stated that 'the State of Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legality of the requests of the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense.' The International Criminal Court is the only independent court in the world established to investigate the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.

**Netanyahu Believes International Arrest Warrants Will Be Issued Against Him Soon**
According to Israeli Channel 13, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza. Sources revealed that Netanyahu ignored questions from the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset regarding the possibility of firing Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu stated in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that 'Israel is going through fateful days', amidst the ongoing war on Gaza and the threat of a full-scale war with Lebanon. Israel continues to launch attacks on southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, as well as its recent attack on the southern suburbs of Beirut. 'Israel is going through fateful days,' Netanyahu said, 'Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza.'

According to Oran Margaliot, the spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 'Israel has today formally challenged the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legitimacy of the prosecutor's requests.'

**Israel Challenges ICC Request for Netanyahu Arrest Warrant**
Israel has officially submitted a challenge to the International Criminal Court's request to issue an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oran Margaliot, 'Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legitimacy of the prosecutor's request to issue arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister.' The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, had requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gantz on May 20, 2024, citing evidence that they are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Palestinian territories (in the Gaza Strip) since at least October 8, 2023. Khan emphasized that any delay in the proceedings would negatively impact the rights of the victims. He urged judges to make a decision quickly without delay, saying, 'Any unjustified delay in these proceedings will have a negative impact on the rights of the victims.'

**Israel challenges ICC judge's bias in Benjamin Netanyahu case**
Israel has challenged the impartiality of International Criminal Court (ICC) Judge Beti Hohler, who is part of a panel deciding whether to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel's Office of the Attorney-General stated, 'Israel respectfully requests that Judge Beti Hohler provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality.' The request comes after Hohler replaced Romanian magistrate Iulia Motoc, who cited health grounds to leave the panel. The ICC's chief prosecutor filed a request in May for arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Israel's then-defense minister, and three Hamas leaders over the Gaza war. The court has no set deadlines, but previous cases have taken around three months to rule on requests for arrest warrants.

**US and Israel Pressure the International Criminal Court**
The issuance of arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant is being suspiciously delayed. The President of the court has already been replaced, amidst strong indications of a conspiracy. In the same statement, the Prosecutor included an extraordinary warning, saying 'I insist that all attempts to prevent, intimidate or improperly influence officials of this Court must cease immediately. My Office will not hesitate to act in accordance with Article 70 of the Rome Statute if such conduct continues.' The Prosecutor did not specify what actions would be taken, but made it clear that they will not tolerate any interference.

**Could Trump’s Victory Spur ICC to Quickly Issue Arrest Warrant Against Netanyahu?**
Donald Trump's electoral victory raises questions about its impact on ongoing wars in Gaza, Lebanon, and beyond. It also sparks concerns that the International Criminal Court (ICC) may issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before Trump returns to the White House in January. ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced in May that he would seek arrest warrants against Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. Khan accused Netanyahu and Gallant of targeting civilians in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war, charges Israel rejects. He accused the Hamas leaders of crimes against humanity during the war and the assault that sparked it on October 7, 2023. 'Khan accused Netanyahu and Gallant of targeting civilians in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war — charges Israel rejects.'

**Netanyahu concerned ICC to issue arrest warrant before Trump takes office**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue a warrant for his arrest before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan has asked for warrants for Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders for crimes against humanity and war crimes. An Israeli Prime Minister's Office official called Khan's actions 'outrageous' and 'dangerous,' and said that the prosecutor had promised not to seek arrests before conducting an investigation in Israel. The official also called for more transparency. The House passed the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act, sanctioning ICC employees over Khan's pursuit of arrest warrants, but the bill has been awaiting a Senate vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's spokesperson said he continues to support bipartisan negotiations on responding to the ICC. Republicans in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have held up all other committee matters until there is a vote on the ICC sanctions.

**Could Trump’s victory spur ICC to quickly issue arrest warrant against Netanyahu?**
Donald Trump's electoral victory raises questions about the International Criminal Court's (ICC) potential to issue arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, before Trump returns to the White House in January. ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced in May that he would seek warrants against Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. However, Trump has been a critic of the ICC and has taken measures against it in the past, including authorizing economic sanctions and travel restrictions against ICC court workers. The Biden administration opposed sanctions on the ICC, but Trump's return to power could change this. Khan also faces challenges, including allegations of sexual misconduct and pressure from US senators to delay the warrants. The ICC has until January 20 to issue the warrants while Biden is still in office, but it may face backlash from Trump if it does so.

**ICC Prosecutor Defends Request for Netanyahu Arrest Warrant**
The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, defended his request for an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying, 'Should I wait until everyone dies?' in reference to the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip since more than a year. Khan emphasized that Israeli officials 'are not above international law.' He requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif, on charges of 'war crimes', 'crimes against humanity', and 'genocide' since October 7, 2023. Khan stated that all member states of the International Criminal Court, except Canada, recognize Palestine as a state. He also rejected accusations of anti-Semitism by Israeli officials, saying, 'All victims are equal, I will show the same interest and love for the Palestinian child as I do for the Jewish child, this is a matter of equality before the law.' Khan emphasized that the court's actions are necessary to hold Israeli officials accountable for their actions.

**Netanyahu arrest warrant delayed in ICC for 5 months | News**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has faced allegations of hypocrisy for delaying the arrest warrant requests for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for over five months, while the warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin was approved in just 24 days. The delays stem from Israel's espionage operations targeting the ICC and its officials, as well as the withdrawal of a judge reviewing the case. Judge Julia Motoc withdrew for 'health reasons and to ensure the proper functioning of justice,' and the ICC announced that Judge Beti Hohler would replace her. The ICC has faced threats from the US Senate, warning that sanctions would be imposed if arrest warrants were issued against Israeli officials, and Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, has also interfered with the ICC's operations, compromising its independence and prolonging the investigation process.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Case, Causing Further Delays**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it has replaced one of the judges who will preside over the request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a move that may lead to further delays in the case, according to Reuters. The prosecutors in May requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court's president said that the Roman judge, Julia Motoc, requested to be replaced due to health reasons on Friday, and was immediately replaced by Slovenian judge, Bettina Holzer. This replacement is expected to lead to further delays in issuing a decision on potential arrest warrants in the case, which involves the conflict in the Gaza Strip, as the new judge will need time to familiarize herself with all the case documents. There is no specific time limit for the court, but it has generally taken around 3 months to decide on requests for arrest warrants in previous cases. The decision has already been delayed due to several rounds of legal challenges from Israel, which has questioned the court's jurisdiction.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Case**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced one of the judges who will preside over a request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The move comes as Israel expects the ICC to issue arrest warrants soon. The ICC's president said that the judge, Romanian Judge Julia Motoc, requested a replacement due to health reasons on Friday, and she was immediately replaced by Slovenian Judge Bettina Holzer. This change is expected to delay the decision on issuing potential arrest warrants in the case, which involves the conflict in the Gaza Strip, as the new judge will need time to familiarize herself with all the case documents. The Israeli Channel 12 reported that the replacement of Judge Holzer with Judge Motoc 'will likely delay the court's decision on the request for an arrest warrant; as Holzer needs time to review the legal details of the case.' Israel had previously estimated that the court would issue arrest warrants soon. Israel claims that the ICC 'lacks jurisdiction' over its citizens due to not signing the Rome Statute, which established the court. It also claims that the Palestinian territories do not have the authority to refer cases to the court, citing that they do not meet the requirements of a state under international law. However, the Office of the Prosecutor, Karim Khan, stated in a request to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Security Minister Yuval Galant that 'the Pre-Trial Chamber I of the Court decided on 5 February 2021 that the Court has jurisdiction over the case in the State of Palestine, and that the territorial jurisdiction of that jurisdiction includes the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.' Israel relies on the 'principle of complementarity' to reject the court's expected moves against Netanyahu and Galant, which states that 'the Court will only intervene if the national authorities are unable or unwilling to investigate' the crimes, claiming that it 'has an effective and capable judicial system that can handle any allegations.'

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Case**
The International Criminal Court announced today that it will replace one of the judges presiding over a request for an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to health reasons. The move may lead to further delays in the case. Prosecutors had requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three leaders of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, citing 'reasonable grounds' to believe they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. According to the court, President of the Court, Judge Julia Motoc, requested a replacement due to health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia. This change is expected to lead to further delays in issuing a decision on potential arrest warrants in the case, which involves the war in the Gaza Strip. The new judge will need time to familiarize herself with all the case documents.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge in Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Case**
The International Criminal Court has replaced the judge presiding over the case of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's potential arrest warrant. According to Reuters, citing ICC President Judge Tomoko Akane, Judge Julia Motoc of Romania requested a replacement due to health reasons, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer of Slovenia. This change is expected to delay the decision on potential arrest warrants in the case, which involves the conflict in Gaza, as the new judge will need time to familiarize herself with the case documents. There is no specific time limit for the court to make a decision, but it has generally taken around three months to rule on previous requests for arrest warrants. The case has already been delayed due to several rounds of legal challenges from Israel, which has questioned the court's jurisdiction. Prosecutor Karim Khan had requested a month ago to speed up the decision on arrest warrants for Israeli officials and Hamas leaders, and urged judges to make a decision quickly without delay. Khan also revealed that he is facing pressure from leaders of some countries to not issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, saying 'many have approached me, advised me, and warned me.' Khan welcomed the withdrawal of the new British government's objection to presenting the request for an arrest warrant against Netanyahu. In an interview with BBC on October 19, Khan stated that he had reviewed the evidence used to decide on the arrest warrant, responding to those who criticized him. He emphasized that the court must request arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas leaders to ensure that people around the world see the court applying the law 'on an equal footing based on some common standards.' Khan stressed that it is necessary to avoid treating supported countries, whether from NATO, European countries, or powerful countries, differently from unsupported countries. Khan had previously announced in May that he had requested the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, on charges including 'crimes against humanity' in Gaza. Netanyahu described Khan's accusations against him as 'a shame' and an attack on the Israeli army and all of Israel. He vowed to continue the war against Hamas. Hamas also condemned Khan's actions, saying that his request for the arrest of its leaders is equivalent to 'the victim being the executioner.' It is worth noting that Israel is not a member of the ICC, so even if arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and Gallant will not face any direct risk of prosecution. However, the threat of arrest may make it difficult for Israeli leaders to travel abroad.

**ICC Replaces Judge in Chamber to Decide on Netanyahu and Gallant Arrest Warrants**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has announced the replacement of one of the three judges in the preliminary chamber, which will decide whether to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza. Judge Julia Motoc from Romania has requested a leave of absence 'for medical reasons' and will be replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia, according to the Times of Israel. The replacement is expected to delay the decision on the potential arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, as the new judge will need time to familiarize herself with the case files. In May, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders, stating that there were reasonable grounds to believe they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. In September, Khan requested urgent arrest warrants for Netanyahu due to alleged human rights abuses in Gaza. The ICC's preliminary chamber had previously delayed the decision on whether to allow Khan to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. The UK had requested to intervene in the case, and the ICC granted them a deadline of July 12 to submit their documents. The delay could potentially push the process back by several months, according to the Jerusalem Post. Israel, the US, and its allies have opposed the ICC's jurisdiction over Netanyahu and Gallant, with US President Joe Biden describing the ICC's involvement as 'outrageous'.

**International Criminal Court Replaces Judge Preparing to Issue Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced a judge who was preparing to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The court stated that the decision to replace the Roman judge investigating in Gaza was due to health reasons. The ICC had previously requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu in May for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor of the court, Karim Khan, explained that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Israeli Prime Minister was criminally responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court also requested an arrest warrant for Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include 'causing genocide, causing famine as a means of warfare, including preventing humanitarian aid, and intentionally targeting civilians in the conflict.' The ICC is an independent judicial body that has jurisdiction over individuals accused of committing genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

**International Criminal Court to Change Judge in Netanyahu Case**
The International Criminal Court announced on Friday that it will change one of the judges who will preside over the request of the prosecution to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The request was made by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, on May 20, to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant for their responsibility for 'war crimes and crimes against humanity' committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The President of the Court stated that 'the President of the Court in that case, Judge Julia Motoc from Romania, requested a substitute for herself for health reasons today, and was immediately replaced by Judge Bettina Holzer from Slovenia.' This development is expected to further delay the Court's decision on the request to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The Israeli Channel 12 reported on Friday that the delay is likely to be longer due to Judge Holzer's need to review the legal details of the case. Israel submitted documents to the Court on September 20, challenging the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. The Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, stated that 'the State of Israel has submitted its official challenge to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legality of the requests of the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for the Prime Minister of Israel and the Minister of Defense.' The International Criminal Court is the only independent court in the world established to investigate the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. However, it relies on member states to enforce arrest warrants and does not have a police force of its own.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has replaced Romanian judge Iulia Motoc with Slovenian judge Beti Hohler on a three-judge panel deciding on a prosecution request for an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The move is expected to further delay a decision in the case, which is focused on the Gaza conflict. According to the ICC president, the new judge will need time to catch up on the filings. The court has no set deadlines, but has generally taken about three months to rule on requests for arrest warrants in previous cases. As reported by the ICC, the decision had already been held up by several rounds of legal filings from Israel challenging the jurisdiction of the court.

The presiding judge of the International Criminal Court panel considering a request to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence minister, and senior Hamas leaders has been replaced on medical grounds. Romanian judge Iulia Motoc was replaced by Slovenian judge Beti Hohler. The decision is likely to further delay a decision on the request by the court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, who accused Netanyahu and others of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel. Netanyahu called the accusations a 'disgrace', while US President Joe Biden called the request for warrants 'outrageous'. Hamas also denounced the ICC prosecutor's actions, saying the request to arrest its leaders 'equates the victim with the executioner'. Israel is not a member of the court, so even if the arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and his defence minister do not face any immediate risk of prosecution.

The International Criminal Court has replaced a Romanian judge who was reviewing a request to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to health reasons. This comes amid Israel's campaign against the International Criminal Court after it moved to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his Defense Minister. Earlier, reports in Hebrew media indicated an unusual statement from the International Criminal Court in The Hague, following reports that the prosecutor Karim Khan is being investigated for alleged sexual harassment of a colleague. Channel 12 reported that the International Criminal Court confirmed that a complaint has been received by the investigation committee against Prosecutor Karim Khan, accusing him of sexual harassment of a colleague. It is worth noting that Prosecutor Karim Khan requested the issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three leaders of Hamas for committing war crimes.

The ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The court has issued arrest warrants in the past, including one for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes. However, the ICC only intervenes when national authorities are unable or unwilling to stop crimes.

**ICC Delays on Netanyahu Arrest Warrant Raise Questions about Independence and Jurisdiction**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has been deliberating on the arrest warrants requested by prosecutor Karim Khan for crimes committed in Israel and Gaza since October 7, 2023. The warrants target Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister Yoav Gallant, and if evidence of his death is not found, Mohammed Deif, the head of the Hamas military branch. The three judges' delays have raised questions about their independence and the relevance of the ICC's jurisdiction. According to Professor Adil Haque, 'if in themselves arrest warrants do not stop crimes, they could have a real effect on the ground and potentially save many lives.' The ICC has allowed dozens of states, lawyers, and think tanks, including some from Christian evangelical lobbies and far-right Western groups, to submit a brief on the case. Israel has also intervened in the proceedings, submitting two briefs to the judges, one contesting the ICC's jurisdiction and the other requesting that the case be referred to Israeli courts. Israel claims it can try the alleged perpetrators of international law violations in Gaza on its own soil, hoping to avoid ICC prosecution. An observer of the ICC notes that 'if Israel participates, it's likely that they have obtained a guarantee' of a favorable outcome. Meanwhile, the ICC has not issued arrest warrants for Yahya Sinouar and Ismael Haniyeh, despite being requested by the prosecutor. Sinouar, the former head of Hamas, was killed by the Israeli army in Gaza on October 16. 'I would have liked to see Yahya Sinouar, Ismael Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif appear before the ICC,' said UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese. US President Joe Biden welcomed Sinouar's death, stating that 'no terrorist, anywhere in the world, can escape justice.'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave an exclusive interview to CNEWS on October 23, 2024, discussing the conflict in the Middle East, particularly with Hezbollah, Lebanon, and Hamas in Gaza. He stated that 'we are at the beginning of the end of the war' and that 'we have reached the combat capabilities of Hamas.' Netanyahu emphasized that 'this is a war of civilization against barbarism' and that 'we are not just fighting for ourselves, but for you as well.' He criticized France's position on the conflict, saying that 'I was extremely disappointed' with President Emmanuel Macron's decisions, which he believes are 'against our common interests.' Netanyahu also addressed the decision of the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for him, stating that 'we are in a democracy, and if there is an unjust judgment or trial, we can speak out and raise our voices.' He emphasized that 'we will not be intimidated' and that 'our soldiers are incredibly courageous.' Netanyahu also discussed the humanitarian aid in Gaza, stating that 'sometimes, the humanitarian aid trucks were stopped by Hamas, and it's not our fault.' He reiterated that 'we are not targeting civilians directly' and that 'we are asking them to evacuate through millions of calls and papers sent to Gaza.' The Prime Minister also denied any attacks on UN forces in the region, stating that 'the Hamas and Hezbollah are hiding behind the UN forces to maintain their attacks.' He concluded by emphasizing the importance of fighting against antisemitism, stating that 'it's a real disease that changes its form' and that 'we must be together to respond to it.'

**1 year of Gaza genocide: Will Netanyahu soon be an accused war criminal?**
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, are facing accusations of genocide and war crimes in Gaza. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is considering a case against the state of Israel, while the International Criminal Court (ICC) is deliberating on arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. According to Reed Brody, a renowned War Crimes Prosecutor, an ICC arrest warrant against Israeli leaders would be a 'huge development in international criminal law.' However, Brody notes that the ICC lacks an enforcement mechanism, and the warrants may not lead to the immediate capture of Netanyahu and Gallant. Nevertheless, the warrants would have significant importance, as they would label Netanyahu and Gallant as 'accused war criminals' and would be valid for an indefinite period. Brody also emphasizes that over 120 countries would be legally obliged to execute the arrest warrants if issued. Francis Boyle, a veteran human rights lawyer, calls for the formation of an 'International Criminal Tribunal for Israel' to hold Israeli leaders accountable for their crimes.

According to Johann Soufi, a specialized lawyer in international penal law, the arrest warrants requested by the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip will 'come to fruition'. 'There is no doubt that within a few weeks or months, the warrants will be issued', he affirms. Soufi attributes the delay in issuing the warrants to 'extremely strong pressures' from Israel's allies, including the US government, as well as from the ICC's member states, such as France, the UK, and Germany, who are contesting the ICC's jurisdiction. 'There is no problem with international justice, it's the states that don't respond to their obligations', Soufi says, highlighting the 'feeling of impotence' of international justice. The ICC prosecutor requested the arrest warrants on May 20, but two of the three Hamas officials targeted are presumed dead, so their cases have been dropped. A separate ICC case is ongoing against Israel, seeking to end its presence in occupied territories.

**What's at stake as Netanyahu and Gallant face ICC arrest warrants?**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) is close to deciding whether to issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, following a request by Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. If warrants are issued, all 123 ICC member states would be obligated to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they enter their territories and extradite them to The Hague. The implications extend beyond the individuals targeted, potentially straining Israel's diplomatic relations with key allies and damaging its international standing. Israel's options to prevent the warrants are limited, and the issuance of warrants could haunt Netanyahu and Gallant for life, limiting their international travel and exposing them to arrest, even after their terms in office end. 'The question of immunity for sitting officials remains unresolved,' said a source familiar with ICC operations. 'Arrest warrants would make Netanyahu a 'persona non grata' in many Western nations, potentially forcing leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron to distance themselves.'

**Who is preventing ICC from arresting Netanyahu?**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has not issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, despite Attorney General Karim Khan requesting it in May 2022. Khan stated that the evidence in the case was sufficient for the court to issue an arrest warrant, but four months later, no decision has been taken. Critics argue that the court is facing pressure from the US and other Western countries, which have threatened to impose sanctions or even invade the Netherlands, where the ICC is based. Former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda was subjected to similar pressure, and Khan has reported being under pressure not to investigate Israeli politicians. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor Khan has called on the court to hurry up and issue the arrest warrants, stating that there is no legal obstacle in the matter. The situation has led to mistrust in the international community, especially among Palestinians, and undermines confidence in law, courts, and justice.

**Netanyahu before the UN: We will continue fighting until achieving complete victory**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, focusing on Israel's stance towards Iran, which he considers a significant threat to the region. He also touched on the issue of normalization with Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu called on Hamas to release the Israeli hostages it is holding, stating that the October 7 attacks hindered progress on this file. He said, 'I came here to clarify the facts, and the facts show that Israel always seeks peace and works towards its achievement.' He directly addressed Hamas, calling for the immediate release of the hostages. Netanyahu emphasized that Hamas must withdraw from any role in rebuilding Gaza, vowing to continue fighting until achieving 'complete victory.' He added, 'If Hamas remains in power, it will regroup and attack Israel again, so it must leave.' The International Criminal Court is still seeking to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant, based on allegations of war crimes in Gaza. Despite Israeli claims of seeking peace, many see the ongoing aggression against civilians in Gaza and the disregard for UN resolutions as contradicting this.

**Netanyahu Receives Cold Reception at UN General Assembly**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was met with an empty hall at the UN General Assembly, as the Turkish delegation led by Ambassador Ahmet Yıldız left the room before his speech. This move was seen as a protest against Netanyahu's presence at the UN, as he has been accused of committing war crimes in Gaza since October 7, 2023. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on charges of committing war crimes. The empty hall was a stark contrast to Netanyahu's speech, which was delivered to an almost deserted room. 'It was a great day for the Turkish delegation to show their support for the people of Gaza,' said a Turkish diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 'We will not stand idly by while Netanyahu continues to commit atrocities in Gaza.'

**Netanyahu Advises ICC to Issue Arrest Warrants for Erdogan and Abbas**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has advised the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue arrest warrants for the presidents of Turkey and Palestine instead of pursuing democratically elected Israeli leaders. 'Yesterday, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is known for the killings of Kurdish civilians and the imprisonment of journalists, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who denies the Holocaust and pays terrorists for the murder of Jews. Instead of issuing arrest warrants for Erdogan and Abbas for war crimes, Khan remains obsessed with putting democratically elected Israeli leaders on trial for war crimes, who are leading a just war against terrorists,' Netanyahu said, according to his office. Erdogan told ICC prosecutor Karim Khan in New York that the ICC must conclude the case against Israel to maintain trust in international law. In May, Khan announced that he would submit a request to the pre-trial chamber to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, citing their responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since October 2023. Khan also requested arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, commander of the military wing of Hamas 'Al-Qassam Brigades' Muhammad al-Deif, and head of the Hamas politburo Ismail Haniyeh.

**Netanyahu Expects International Arrest Warrants to be Issued Against Him Soon**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that he expects international arrest warrants to be issued against him soon. According to Channel 13, Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee in the Knesset that he believes international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials in the near future. This comes after the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in May for their alleged involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. Khan has made similar requests three times since May, and has urged the ICC to act quickly and without delay. Israel has not recognized the ICC's jurisdiction and has continued to defy its rulings, including a recent decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. Netanyahu has stated that Israel is going through 'fateful days' and has dismissed questions from the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee about the possibility of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's dismissal. 'It was a human error', a spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, explaining that the ministry had published a statement condemning the ICC's decision, only to later retract it. The ministry had published the statement on its website and on social media, but quickly removed it. Netanyahu's statement comes as Israel continues to defy international pressure to end its war in Gaza, which has been ongoing for 18 years and has left over 2 million Palestinians in dire conditions.

**Netanyahu Believes International Arrest Warrants Will Be Issued Against Him Soon**
According to Israeli Channel 13, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza. Sources revealed that Netanyahu ignored questions from the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset regarding the possibility of firing Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu stated in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that 'Israel is going through fateful days', amidst the ongoing war on Gaza and the threat of a full-scale war with Lebanon. Israel continues to launch attacks on southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, as well as its recent attack on the southern suburbs of Beirut. 'Israel is going through fateful days,' Netanyahu said, 'Netanyahu believes that international arrest warrants will be issued against him and other officials soon by the International Criminal Court due to the war on Gaza.'

Israel has officially challenged the International Criminal Court's (ICC) request for an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The ICC's prosecutor, Karim Khan, had requested the warrants in May. Israel's foreign ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, stated, 'The state of Israel submitted today its official challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction, as well as the legality of the prosecutor's requests for arrest warrants against Israel's prime minister and minister of defence.' The ICC also sought warrants against top Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, but dropped the application for Ismail Haniyeh after his death on July 31.

Israel has submitted two comprehensive legal opinions countering the prosecutor's actions, arguing that the ICC lacks jurisdiction over the matter and that the prosecutor has violated the court's statutes. According to Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein, 'Israel has today submitted its formal objection to the ICC's jurisdiction and the legality of the prosecutor's requests for arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister.'

**Israel Announces Formal Appeal to International Criminal Court**
Israel has announced a formal appeal to the International Criminal Court against the request of the prosecutor, Karim Khan, to issue an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This move comes in a tense context where the world is watching the developments in Gaza and the surrounding areas. Israel's government, through its foreign ministry spokesperson, Oran Margaliot, confirmed that it has submitted a formal appeal against the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and the legitimacy of the prosecutor's requests. This appeal includes a legal challenge to the credibility of the actions taken by the court, with Israeli officials arguing that they do not have the right to consider this case. In July, the International Criminal Court gave more than 60 governments and legal organizations the opportunity to present their arguments regarding the proposed arrest warrants against Netanyahu and a group of other officials from both sides involved in the conflict. This move reflects a response to a call for action from within the international community in the face of the ongoing escalation of some conflicts in the region. The controversy surrounding the International Criminal Court has been ongoing, with many experts expressing doubts about its ability to enforce justice in complex international conflicts. Some experts believe that the court's actions may be sensitive to international policies. International reactions have been varied, with some countries viewing the request as a sign of interest in holding accountable those who may have committed crimes, while others see it as an unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Reactions have been mixed, adding to the complexity of the legal and political context. In light of this escalation, Israeli officials have emphasized the importance of protecting their leaders from international legal threats, which could affect the country's political and economic situation. On the other hand, these developments highlight the need to address conflicts comprehensively, rather than through legal pursuits that may not address the underlying issue. In conclusion, Israel's moves to challenge the arrest warrants reflect a comprehensive legal and security strategy that shows the government's efforts to protect its leaders in the face of challenges that could affect the region's stability and security. Developments in this case will continue to be watched by the world, with more legal and political discussions expected about the role of the International Criminal Court.

Israel has objected to the request to issue an arrest warrant for former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant at the International Court of Justice (UCM). In a written statement, it was stated that an objection was made to the lawsuit requesting the issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. In the official application, it was alleged that Netanyahu and Gallant's arrest request was 'unlawful'. It was also stated that the UCM did not have the authority to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant in the lawsuit. It is stated that Israel's objection, which is symbolic due to its non-membership in the UCM, will not affect the case. UCM Prosecutor Kerim Han had requested an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant on May 20. The court has not yet ruled on Han's request, which has been pending for four months.

**No 10 fears ICC will ask UK to sign Benjamin Netanyahu arrest warrant**
Downing Street is concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will ask the UK to support the issue of an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes committed in Gaza. The ICC's pre-trial chamber judges have accepted the request of ICC prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders. Khan argued that the case is of 'the utmost urgency' and referred to the catastrophic situation in Gaza. The UK has not proscribed Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in the UK, and there are concerns that supporting the arrest warrant for Netanyahu could be seen as showing the wrong priorities. The Labour government has withdrawn the filing made by the Conservatives that the ICC prosecutor did not have jurisdiction. Khan submitted his reply to the submissions on 23 August, saying the case was of 'the utmost urgency', and referred to the catastrophic situation in Gaza. He argued Palestine was a party to the ICC and any crimes committed on its territory are subject to ICC jurisdiction. The UK has imposed heavy sanctions on IRGC members, but opposed IRGC proscription partly because it fears Iran might then cut off diplomatic relations with the UK. NGOs have been piling pressure on the government to do more about the UK's obligations to apply international law related to Gaza.
