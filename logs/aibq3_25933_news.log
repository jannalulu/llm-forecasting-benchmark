**Volatility, Stock Market Seasonality on a Collison Course**
J.P. Morgan's chief market strategist, Marko Kolanovic, has left the bank to explore other opportunities, leaving a void in the market. His departure comes as the bank has the lowest 2024 target for the S&P 500 Index among banks it tracks at 4,200. Despite this, the market is expected to be bullish in the coming weeks, with a historically bullish period leading up to July standard expiration. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has been low, but may spike in the next two weeks. The McClellan Summation Index, a market breadth indicator, is on the verge of clearing its 8-day displaced moving average, and the New York Stock Exchange has already cleared this trendline. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) broke through the call wall at the 550-strike last week and is expected to continue to rise. Inflation data and earnings reports from JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Delta Air Lines will be important to watch in the coming week.

**Report from Wall Street: In the Stock Market, Not Everything is as it Seems**
The stock market has seen a deceleration of inflation, which has boosted investor confidence in the economy this year, combined with an intense enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, providing the backdrop for a rally that has exceeded all expectations. The S&P 500 has risen 15% in the first half of 2024. However, beneath the surface, there are turbulence: Nvidia, for example, has risen over 150% this year, but has also experienced repeated deep price drops in the past six months, cutting millions of dollars off its market value. More than 200 companies, or about 40% of the index, are at least 10% below their highest level this year. Almost 300 companies, or about 60% of the index, are more than 10% above their lowest level this year. And each group includes 65 companies that have actually turned in both directions. Market operators say that this lack of correlated movement, known as dispersion, is at historic extremes, undermining the idea that markets have been calm. A measure of this, a Cboe Global Markets index, shows that dispersion increased after the COVID-19 pandemic, as technology stocks soared while other companies suffered. It has remained high, partly due to the astonishing appreciation of a few AI-leading stocks, say analysts. This presents an opportunity for Wall Street, as funds and trading desks accumulate in trading dispersion, a strategy that normally uses derivatives to bet on low index volatility while individual stock turbulence remains high. 'It's everywhere,' said Stephen Crewe, a long-time dispersion operator and partner at Fulcrum Asset Management. He believes that these dynamics have surpassed even economic data in terms of their importance to financial markets. 'For the moment, almost none of the GDP or inflation data matters,' he added. The risk for investors is that stocks will start moving in the same direction again, probably due to a spark that sets off general sales. When that happens, some fear that the role of complex volatility trading could reverse and, instead of mitigating the appearance of turbulence, exacerbate it.

**Stocks are headed for a 'summer squall,' Citi warns**
Citigroup equity strategist Scott Chronert warns that the stock market may experience a 'summer squall' due to high valuations, potential threats such as the upcoming 2024 U.S. election, inflation concerns, and geopolitical risks. Despite this, Chronert still expects the S&P 500 to finish the year at or around 5,600. The strategist notes that high valuations have historically impeded forward returns, and the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently above the 90th percentile from the past 40 years. Additionally, a gauge of investor sentiment is pointing towards euphoria, and the Cboe Volatility Index is near its lowest level since 2019, suggesting the market could be primed for a burst of volatility if a negative catalyst arrives.

**VIX Rises 8%, Treasury Yields Jump, Dow Plunges: Why Is Wall Street Wobbling Thursday?**
The US stock market experienced a volatile start to Thursday, with all major indices and sectors trading in the red. The rise in interest rates and concerns about a higher-for-longer interest rate scenario led to increased investor anxiety and volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged 8%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.72%. The S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq 100 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell, with small caps experiencing a larger decline. Traders are now pricing in only one rate cut by the end of the year, with expectations of two rate cuts by the end of Q1 2025.

**VIX Spikes, Dow Sinks As Inflation Jitters Slaughter Fed Easing Hopes: Traders Now Price In Only One Rate Cut In 2024**
The stock market experienced a sharp downturn on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.5% and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both falling 0.9%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged over 7% after hitting its lowest level since November 2019. The decline was driven by concerns over inflation, with the S&P Global Composite PMI Index showing the highest expansion rate in two years. The report also showed that input prices continued to rise sharply, with manufacturers facing the largest cost rise in a year and a half. As a result, investors are now pricing in only one rate cut in 2024, down from previous expectations of multiple cuts.

**Stock-Market Volatility Is Entering the Seasonal Super-Snooze**
The Cboe Volatility Index has shown its lowest average daily reading in July over the past 15 years, with the VIX gauge at a low of 13 points. Despite a contentious presidential election and potential Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, US stock market moves have been muted, partly due to cooling inflation and rising corporate earnings.

**Stock Market News for Jul 1, 2024**
The US stock market closed lower on Friday, with tech and discretionary stocks leading the decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 all ended in the red, with the Dow Jones falling 41.12 points, or 0.1%, to close at 39,122.94. The decline was attributed to political uncertainty following the first Presidential debate, with the fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index increasing 1.6% to 12.44. Mega-cap growth stocks like tech and discretionaries, such as Meta Platforms and The Walt Disney Company, slid 3% and 2.8%, respectively. Despite the decline, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted gains for the month and quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.7% in the quarter.

**AEX Expected to Open Higher on First Trading Day of July**
The AEX index is expected to open higher on the first trading day of July and the second half of the year. The focus is on the outcome of the first round of the French presidential election and the purchasing managers' indices for the industry. The Dutch industry has grown less strongly. The eurozone and US economic data will also be released. The CAC40 has been under pressure due to political unrest and the fear of a further increase in government debt, leading to a rise in the spread between French and German government bonds. The Shanghai Composite index has risen 0.7% and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong has remained unchanged. The US tech stocks have not had their best day, with Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent all falling. The S&P 500 index has fallen 0.4% to 5,460.48 points, the Dow Jones index has fallen 0.1%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 0.7%. The PCE inflation rate has fallen to 2.6% on a year-over-year basis, in line with expectations. The Federal Reserve is still expected to cut interest rates in September, despite the inflation rate still being too high. June was a good month for the stock market, with the Dow Jones index rising 1.1%, the S&P 500 index rising 3.5%, and the Nasdaq rising 6.3%. The indicators: the futures are pointing to a higher opening of the stock market in Europe. The CBOE VIX index has risen to 12.44. The euro is trading at 1.0759 against the dollar. The US 10-year yield has risen to 4.398%. The gold price has fallen 0.2% to $2,321 per troy ounce. The oil price has risen 0.6%. The bitcoin price has risen 5.2% to $63,341.

**S&P 500 returns 15% in the first half in an unusually smooth ride**
The S&P 500 has returned 15% in the first half of 2024, making it the 21st best performance since 1900. The index has been driven by a handful of large-cap companies, with the typical stock lagging behind. Despite the stellar returns, some market experts are concerned about the market's fragility and the potential for a correction. The S&P 500 has gone eight sessions without a move of more than half a percent, and its worst daily decline in June was only 0.4%. The CBOE Volatility Index is near a multi-year low, but the S&P's realized volatility over the past 30 days is higher. Some experts believe that the market's recent performance is unsustainable and that a correction is overdue. Others argue that the market's strength is due to the presence of high-conviction secular growth companies and that the rally is not over yet. The article also discusses the dispersion trade, where investors are shorting index volatility and buying single-stock volatility, and the recent sprint-and-stumble performance of high-momentum stocks.

**What Does a Low VIX Mean for Stocks?**
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) has been in a steady uptrend, resulting in a low CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). A low VIX indicates that option traders do not expect much market volatility over the next 30 days. Historical data shows that when the VIX is low, stock returns are not significantly affected, and the VIX tends to rise when it has been low. The VIX has been below 20 for 164 trading days, a streak that has only occurred five times in the past 30 years. After such streaks, the VIX typically stays below 20 for an average of nine more months. The analysis suggests that the persistently low VIX does not provide much insight into the direction of stocks, but volatility is likely to remain low in the short term.

**Stock Market News for Jun 25, 2024**
US stock markets closed mixed on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite falling 1.1%. The S&P 500 also ended in negative territory. The mixed outcome was due to sector rotations, with investors moving from growth-oriented technology to cyclical energy, utilities, and financial sectors. The Fed's interest rate cut policy was a concern for investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 39,411.21, while the Nasdaq Composite finished at 17,496.82. The S&P 500 fell to 5,447.87. The Energy Select Sector SPDR, Utilities Select Sector SPDR, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR, and Financials Select Sector SPDR gained 2.5%, 1.3%, 1.1%, and 1%, respectively. The Technology Select Sector SPDR tumbled 2.5%. The CBOE Volatility Index rose 1% to 13.33. A total of 10.94 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.92 billion. The NYSE recorded 179 new highs and 48 new lows. The Nasdaq Composite registered 49 new highs and 128 new lows.

**S&P 500 Records Longest Streak of Calm Trading Since 2008 Financial Crisis**
The S&P 500 index has recorded its longest streak of calm trading since the 2008 financial crisis, with a 2.05% gain over 377 days, according to FactSet data. This steady rise is attributed to investors' appetite for technology giant stocks, such as Intel, amid expectations that artificial intelligence will boost profits. The index has risen over 14% since the beginning of the year, and the latest data shows inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Adam Tornquist, LPL Financial's chief investment strategist, said, 'Uncertainty has dissipated over the past 12 months, as the clarity of declining inflation has provided clarity on the future path of monetary policy... The changing narrative from rate hikes to rate cuts and the economic slowdown to flexibility has helped pull the VIX index to its lowest levels in years, ultimately turning the stock market's backdrop to low volatility.' Many investors consider the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) a measure of fear on Wall Street. Last month, it reached its lowest level since November 2020. On Friday, it was traded near 13 points, close to its historic low. Joseph Kosik, Calamos Investments' chief investment officer, said, 'The decline in the VIX index reflects the market's sentiment, with the VIX index reaching its lowest level in three years. This is logical as institutions were hedging actively; there is no pressing need to sell underlying products with these insurance products.'

**Low Volatility: A Sign of Market Strength or Weakness?**
The VIX index, which measures volatility, is currently below its historical average. This has implications for stock prices. According to LPL Financial's chief technical analyst Adam Turnquist, despite the recent increase in volatility, the expected volatility in the next 30 days is not a bad sign for future returns. The Cboe Volatility Index VIX rose 0.98 points to 13.28 points on Thursday, following a sharp decline in technology-focused stocks. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8% and the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is heavily weighted towards technology, gained 0.8% on the day. Turnquist notes that the VIX has been in a downward trend since 2022 and is currently at its lowest level since January 2020. However, he believes that this low volatility may not last and that the VIX may rise again in the coming months. This could be a sign of a market correction. For stocks, low volatility can be a positive sign, as it can support above-average returns. According to Turnquist, when the VIX is below 13.21, the S&P 500 tends to have an average return of 8.8% over the next six months and 13.6% over the next 12 months.

**Markets' Battle Against Fear May Be Their Greatest Weakness**
The markets have won the battle against fear, but this may be their greatest weakness. The S&P 500 has risen steadily, with 14% growth so far in 2024 and 29 records closed. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has fallen below 12, a low not seen in almost five years. Investors seem optimistic, and analysts say they have good reasons to be. The economy has remained stronger than expected, with corporate profits growing and inflation cooling. However, this calm period in the markets may be a sign of complacency, and some experts warn that it could lead to a bubble. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says, 'When the wind blows, it will burst.' The market is waiting for key economic data and Federal Reserve comments to gauge the direction of the central bank. The S&P 500 has been driven by a handful of large-cap technology stocks, and some experts warn that this concentration could make the market vulnerable if these stocks fail to meet expectations.

**Cboe to roll out volatility index for U.S. Treasury market in Q3**
Cboe Global Markets is planning to launch a new index, the Cboe 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Volatility Basis Point Index (VIXTLT), to measure the volatility of the U.S. Treasury market. The index will be calculated using listed options on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and will provide investors with a way to track future (30-day) expected volatility in Treasury securities. The index is expected to launch in Q3 2024 and will use an adaptation of Cboe's proprietary VIX Index methodology. This new index expands Cboe's growing suite of volatility indices, which currently includes over 450 derivatives-based indices.

**You Should Always Be Fearful When There's No Fear (Here's Why)**
The Dow Theory is signaling a potential bearish trend if the Dow Jones Industrial Average closes below its April 15 lows. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is increasing, indicating a shift in investor sentiment from complacency to fear. The Russell 2000 is trading below its critical $200 level, and Bitcoin is retreating from its high, suggesting investors are becoming risk-averse. The earnings season has ended, but a few retail and consumer companies will release their results this week, including KB Homes and Lennar. Kroger's earnings call on June 20 may also be worth watching as the company tries to catch up with Walmart's prices.

Cboe Global Markets is launching a new index, the Cboe 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Volatility Basis Point Index (VIXTLT Index), which will track future (30-day) expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market. The index will be calculated using listed options on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and will be available in both percentage price volatility and basis point volatility terms. The VIXTLT Index is designed to provide a comparable gauge for the U.S. Treasury market, similar to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) for the U.S. equity market. The index is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2024.

**These 4 S&P 500 stocks are helping to tame U.S. market volatility**
The article discusses the extremely low volatility of the US stock market, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), and how it is not a cause for concern. In fact, the article argues that the market produces better risk-adjusted returns when the VIX is low. The article highlights four large-cap stocks in the S&P 500 that have a one-year beta of less than 1.0, which means they rise less than the market when it rises and fall less when it falls. These stocks are Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly, JP Morgan Chase, and ExxonMobil. The article also discusses a market timing model developed by academics Alan Moreira and Tyler Muir, which suggests that investors should increase their equity exposure when the VIX is low and decrease it when the VIX is high. The article concludes that the VIX won't stay low forever, but it's not necessary to jump the gun and reduce equity exposure when the VIX rises.

**2 Potential Support Levels to Watch for Fed Week**
The article discusses the potential support levels to watch for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, specifically the 30-day moving average of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) at 5,235 and the previous all-time high at 4,254. The author, Todd Salamone, notes that the SPX's 30-day moving average has been a key level of support and resistance in the past, and that it is currently moving higher at a rate of 10 points per day. He also mentions that the market's price action has been bullish, with the SPX notching a closing high on Wednesday and an intraday all-time high on Friday, and that the market may be hesitant ahead of the FOMC meeting. The article also discusses the sentiment side, noting that there is a bias toward put options relative to calls on the weekly options that expired this past Friday, but that this is not necessarily bearish given the market's continued higher prices. Finally, the article mentions that the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) may rise slightly into the FOMC meeting, but that moves to prior lows have generally been resolved with pullbacks of varying degrees in the equity market and a rise in volatility expectations.

**Wall Street: Prudence in View as Europe Worries Grow**
The stock market is expected to be cautious on Monday morning following the unexpected results of the European elections, particularly in France, which may lead to a return of risk aversion. The European indices are expected to open lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 expected to decline. The French president's announcement of the dissolution of the National Assembly and the holding of early elections has raised concerns about the evolution of the French political landscape. The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the 'fear index', has risen by 8% to around 13.2 points, indicating investor nervousness. The Federal Reserve's announcement this week is expected to provide reassurance, with the possibility of a rate cut. The market is also awaiting the release of consumer price data in the US, which could impact the Fed's decision on interest rates.

**Stock volatility may pick up in June after ‘cracks in the ice' formed in May**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose 9.2% on Monday, indicating that stock volatility may increase in June after 'cracks in the ice' formed in the market in May. According to CFRA, the S&P 500 typically sees below-average volatility and returns in June, but this year may be different. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% on Monday, while the VIX rose 8.5%. The rise in VIX is attributed to concerns about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the direction of interest rates, as well as the potential for a recession. Additionally, the felony conviction of former President Trump has added uncertainty to the market. Despite these concerns, CFRA expects two rate cuts and higher share prices by year-end.

**2 Short-Term Risks Bulls Face This Week**
The article discusses two short-term risks that bulls face in the stock market. The first risk is the VIX (Cboe Market Volatility Index) lifting sharply off its recent lows, which could lead to lower stock prices. The second risk is the bearish 'outside' day on the S&P 500 Index (SPX) on Thursday, which could indicate a potential decline. The article also mentions the importance of keeping an eye on technical risks, such as a move below the 5,200-5,220 area, and the potential for a close below this area to be a solid stop level for short-term buyers. Additionally, the article discusses the upcoming economic calendar, earnings reports, and sentiment indicators, including a slight uptick in put buying relative to call buying on SPX component stocks and the put bias on the SPY 5/24 expiration options.

**Goldman Sachs Predicts Increase in Market Volatility Ahead of Nvidia's Earnings Report**
Goldman Sachs predicts an increase in market volatility, citing upcoming events such as Nvidia's earnings report as potential catalysts. The bank's risk appetite indicator has reached its highest level since 2021, driven by optimism over economic growth and monetary policy. However, the momentum has lost strength, according to a note written by Andrea Ferrario and dated May 20. Investors are preparing for a potential surge in volatility, with some calling for caution due to the high concentration of the market. The CBOE VIX index, which measures market volatility, has fallen to historically low levels, but the demand for options to hedge against sudden market declines has increased. Goldman Sachs strategists believe that while the market is valuing less the risk of a sustained decline, it is concerned about temporary increases in volatility. The report also mentions that Citigroup's data shows an increase in bullish positioning in S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts, with bets on the S&P 500 now going almost exclusively to one side, but gains are only just starting to develop, limiting positioning risks.

**Market sets record — Breaking down whether the bulls are in the clear or a peak is imminent**
The stock market has reached a record high, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 40,000 for the first time and the S & P 500 settling above 5,300. Despite concerns about inflation and interest rates, the market is showing signs of strength, with three-quarters of all stocks up in recent weeks and the average one up 5%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is also at its lowest level since November 2019, indicating a lack of demand for volatility protection. While some analysts are cautious, others are optimistic, with one strategist lifting his year-end S & P 500 target to 5,600. The market's recent pullback has been relatively mild, and the history of rallies after a 5-7% pullback shows that the recovery rarely fails to reach at least 10%. The current bull market is modest in both length and total appreciation compared to historical averages, and some analysts are drawing parallels with past market upswings that occurred in relatively mature economic expansions.

**VIX Index Closes at Lowest Since 2019 as S&P 500 Grinds Higher**
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) closed at its lowest level since November 2019, indicating that traders are the least concerned about wild stock market swings since before the Covid-19 pandemic. The VIX measures the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500, which has been trading in a tight range just below its all-time high. The low readings can be attributed to a diminished demand for hedges to protect against a selloff, as the S&P 500 has been climbing and traders are not interested in paying up for protection. Slightly softer inflation data has also renewed optimism that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates earlier, pushing stocks higher.

**Stock Market News for May 17, 2024**
The US stock market closed lower on Thursday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) briefly breached the 40,000 mark. The decline was attributed to lower-than-expected weekly jobless claims data. The Dow Jones fell 38.62 points, or 0.1%, to close at 39,869.38, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 declined 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 0.2% to 12.42. Jobless claims fell to 222,000, a decrease of 10,000 from the previous week. However, the decline in jobless claims did not lead to a rate cut expectation, as investors inferred that the Federal Reserve might not be compelled to cut interest rates as soon as expected.

**Investors Reach for Riskier Assets as Fear Seeps Out of Markets**
Investors are increasingly taking on riskier assets as they believe the US economy is headed for a soft landing, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record high and bitcoin soaring. The recent economic data, including a slower-than-expected inflation rate in April, has boosted investor confidence, leading to a decrease in demand for insurance against market declines. The Cboe Volatility index has fallen to a four-month low, and the VVIX index is near its lowest level in about a decade. Meanwhile, call contracts that benefit from further stock market gains are in high demand, while options hedges that guard against a market drop are less popular. The rally in meme stocks, such as GameStop, AMC, and Koss, is also a sign of investors' robust risk appetite. The dollar has weakened against a basket of its peers, and emerging market currencies, such as the Polish zloty, South African rand, and Colombian peso, have advanced. Bond market volatility expectations have also slipped, and US Treasury yields have fallen to more than five-week lows.

The Federal Reserve's ability to curb inflation while keeping growth from falling too quickly is seen as a key factor in this increased risk appetite. Investors are also rejecting insurance against portfolio declines, with the Cboe Volatility index and VVIX index at their lowest levels in months. The demand for call contracts that would benefit from further gains in the stock market is also at its highest level in a month. Meme stocks, such as GameStop, have seen significant gains, and the dollar has fallen against a basket of its peers. Emerging market currencies, such as the Polish zloty, South African rand, and Colombian peso, have also risen. Volatility expectations in bond markets have fallen, and US Treasury yields have reached their lowest level in five weeks.

**Investors Take on Riskier Investments as Market Volatility Fades**
Investors are increasingly taking on riskier investments as they become less concerned about market volatility. The S&P 500 has reached a new record high, and the Nasdaq Composite Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average have also reached new highs. Bitcoin and meme stocks, often seen as a gauge of risk appetite, have also surged. The growing confidence of market participants is reflected in a survey by BofA Global Research, which found that the broadest sentiment indicator, based on cash holdings, stock allocation, and expectations for economic growth, reached its highest level since November 2021. Many investors are opting to buy stocks without hedging against potential losses, as the Cboe Volatility Index, which measures demand for protection against market fluctuations, has fallen to a four-month low. The less well-known VVIX Index, which indicates how much investors expect the VIX to rise, is also at a near 10-year low. While there are few buyers of options that would protect against a market downturn, call options that benefit from further stock gains are in high demand. The average daily trading volume in calls has exceeded that of puts by a ratio of 1.2 to 1, according to data from options analysis firm Trade Alert. Some market participants have also pointed to the rally in meme stocks as a sign of a robust risk appetite. The stocks of GameStop, AMC, and Koss have surged in recent weeks, despite being heavily shorted and having deteriorating fundamentals. The hope that declining US economic data may give the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates later this year has put pressure on the dollar, which has fallen 2% against a basket of its peers since its 17-month high in mid-April. This has contributed to some emerging market currencies, which are sometimes seen as riskier than those tied to developed markets, gaining traction. The Polish zloty has risen 3.7% this month, while the South African rand and Colombian peso have gained 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively. Expectations of volatility on the bond market have also fallen, with US Treasury yields falling to a more than five-week low on Wednesday.
