**Dow Jones Rises 350 Points as Inflation Cools and Hopes for Rate Cut Grow**
The Dow Jones and other indices rose in the pre-market session on Wednesday morning after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed a slowdown in inflation. According to the Labor Statistics Office, the CPI increased 3.3% year-over-year in May, compared to a expected 3.4% increase. As inflation slowed down more than expected last month, investors hope that the Federal Reserve will soon reduce interest rates. The inflation report is published just before the Federal Reserve announces its decision on interest rates and economic forecasts for the year. The decision on interest rates will be announced at 2:00 PM EST, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak about the decision at 2:30 PM. According to the latest inflation data, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) remained unchanged in May after increasing 0.3% in April. Additionally, the underlying CPI, which excludes energy and food prices, rose 3.4% last month, compared to an expected 3.5% increase in May. Just before the market opening, Dow Jones futures added 350 points, or 0.9%, to 39,141. S&P and Nasdaq futures both rose 0.8% each.

**Inflation Concerns Continue Amidst Rising Consumer Prices: Impact on Household Debt Repayments**
The US economy is struggling with high inflation rates, which is affecting American consumers' ability to manage their debts and maintain their lifestyles. The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) data shows that consumer prices rose by 0.3% in April, with an annual increase of 3.4% compared to April 2023. This has led to a strain on household budgets, eroding purchasing power and exacerbating financial burdens. The impact of inflation and rising interest rates on debt repayment is a major concern, making it challenging for individuals to pay off debts, such as mortgages, auto loans, and credit card balances. Navicore Solutions is helping individuals navigate their financial difficulties by providing expert guidance, personalized debt management plans, and financial education resources.

**April 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) Rises 0.3% in the US**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% in April, following a 0.4% increase in March and February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The 12-month CPI increase was 3.4%, down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted a 0.4% increase in April and a 3.4% annual increase. The inflation rate is expected to slow down this quarter and approach the Federal Reserve's 2% target as the labor market cools down. The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, expressed optimism that inflation will move back down to levels seen last year. The market expects the Fed to start cutting interest rates in September, with some economists predicting a July start and others predicting a December start.

**As inflation cools, Social Security recipients can expect a smaller COLA increase for next year**
As inflation cools, Social Security recipients can expect a smaller cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) increase for next year. According to The Senior Citizens League, Social Security recipients can expect a 2.63% increase, essentially unchanged from the previous forecast. The Social Security Administration calculates the COLA change using the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for July, August, and September of the given year. However, this methodology can lead to Social Security recipients' checks falling behind the overall pace of inflation. Alex Moore, the organization's Social Security and Medicare statistician, stated that price surges can occur at any time of the year, and the COLA may not account for these changes. As a result, Social Security recipients may not receive a matching increase to the 20% increase in the CPI-W between January 2020 and December 2023, which would have netted them an extra $10 in their monthly payments by 2024.

The Social Security Administration calculates the COLA based on the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) for July, August, and September. However, this methodology can result in recipients' checks falling behind the overall pace of inflation. Between January 2020 and December 2023, the CPI-W increased 20%, while COLA increases totaled 19%. A matching increase would have added an extra $10 to monthly payments by 2024. For fixed-income recipients, every dollar counts, as 34% of retirees have visited a food pantry or applied for food stamps in the last 12 months.

**U.S. consumer prices fall for first time in 4 years; inflation subsides**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first decline in four years, due to cheaper gasoline and moderating rents. This marks a significant slowdown in inflation and suggests that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in September. The report also showed a measure of underlying inflation posting the smallest increase since August 2021. Economists believe that this guidance will solidify the Fed's decision to reduce rates in September. The CPI has been steadily declining since its peak in June 2022, and the annual increase has slowed from 9.1% to 3.0%. The report also showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 222,000, the lowest level since late May.

**U.S. Consumer Prices Drop in June, First Decline in Four Years**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first decline in four years, driven by lower gasoline costs and moderating rents. This marks a significant step towards disinflation and may lead to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in September. The report also showed a measure of underlying inflation posting the smallest increase since August 2021. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1% increase and a 3.1% year-on-year gain. The annual increase in consumer prices has slowed from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, narrowing the gap with the Fed's 2% inflation target.

**Latest 2025 Social Security COLA forecast: The good and bad news for seniors**
The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will help project the 2025 Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits. The SSA uses the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) to calculate the COLA. The report showed a decrease in average prices for the first time since May 2020, which may result in a smaller COLA for 2025. The Senior Citizens League forecasts a 2.63 percent COLA for 2025, up slightly from their previous forecast. The SSA will announce the 2025 COLA in October once the consumer price data for September has been tabulated.

**Monthly US consumer prices post first drop in four years**
The US consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% in June, the first drop in four years, due to lower gasoline costs and moderating rents. The core CPI also showed a small increase of 0.1%, the smallest since August 2021. The report suggests that inflation is cooling, which may lead to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in September. Economists believe that the Fed has a 'checkered flag' to reduce rates in September, and financial markets see a high probability of a rate cut. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, and jobless claims fell by 17,000 to 222,000. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid also declined. The report shows that the labor market is losing steam, and signs are mounting that economic activity is slowing down.

**Fresh Inflation Data Are Expected to Show Continued Cooling**
The Consumer Price Index is expected to show a moderate pace of inflation in June, with a 3.1% annual increase and a 3.4% core price index increase. Economists forecast a 0.2% monthly core inflation rate, matching the previous month's reading. The Federal Reserve is monitoring inflation to determine when to cut interest rates, which have been held at 5.3% for the past year. After a brief period of stubborn inflation in early 2024, price pressures appear to be moderating again, with Thursday's inflation reading expected to be significantly cooler than the 9.1% peak in 2022.

**2024 Is Half Over. Here's What We Know About the 2025 Social Security COLA So Far**
The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2025 is expected to be smaller than in recent years, with estimates ranging from 2.57% to 3.2%. The official COLA will not be announced until October, but experts have made predictions based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) data from the first half of 2024. The COLA is calculated using the CPI-W data, and experts believe that the smaller increase is due to the slower pace of inflation in 2024. Retirees should start preparing for a smaller COLA in 2025, as it is unlikely to surge in the third quarter of the year.

**Consumer price index exceeds 4 percent, core inflation at 2.75 percent**
The consumer price index (CPI) in June 2024 increased by 0.17% compared to the previous month and 1.4% compared to December 2023, but rose by 4.34% compared to the same period last year. The 0.17% month-over-month increase was mainly due to a sharp rise in pork prices and adjustments to healthcare service prices. The average CPI for the second quarter of 2024 increased by 4.39% compared to the same period in 2023, with notable increases in education, medicines and healthcare services, and housing, electricity, water, fuel, and building materials. The core CPI, which excludes food, fresh foodstuffs, energy, and state-managed items, increased by 0.18% in June 2024 compared to the previous month and 2.61% compared to the same period last year, with an average core inflation of 2.75% for the first six months of 2024.

**Florida's Housing Market Value Could Plunge Under New Bill**
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a bill that could reduce property taxes for homeowners in the state by increasing the homestead exemption. The bill, which will be on the November ballot, will tie the exemption to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), allowing homeowners to reduce their property taxes based on inflation. The exemption will increase by up to $25,000, on top of the current $50,000 exemption, but will not apply to school district levies. The bill aims to help homeowners struggling with ballooning housing costs, including high insurance premiums. However, renters will not benefit from the bill, and it requires 60% approval from voters to pass.

**Australia's Consumer Price Index Hits 4% Amid Rising Housing And Food Costs**
Australia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen to 4%, exceeding the Reserve Bank's target range of 2-3%. The increase is attributed to rising costs of housing, food, transportation, and power, as well as shifting fuel prices and vacation spending. Economists Callam Pickering and David Bassanese believe that this data will put pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates, potentially as early as August. Pickering stated, 'With inflation already at levels that are uncomfortably high, we believe that Australian households and businesses need to prepare themselves for another rate hike.' Bassanese added, 'The upshot is that it places enormous pressure on the Reserve Bank to not only not cut interest rates anytime soon, but potentially lift them further.'

**Social Security Update: Payment of $4,873 Goes Out This Week**
The Social Security Administration (SSA) will pay out approximately $1.5 trillion in benefits to nearly 68 million Americans in 2024. This week, on June 26, retirees born between the 21st to 31st of any given month will receive their monthly check. The average monthly retirement benefit is $1,907, but some recipients may receive up to $4,873. The maximum benefit amount depends on the age of retirement, with those retiring at 70 receiving the highest amount. Social Security benefits have increased by 3.2 percent this year due to the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), which is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).

**UK Inflation Hits 2% Goal for First Time in Almost Three Years**
The UK's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) has fallen to 2%, meeting the Bank of England's target for the first time in almost three years. This is a sign of relief from the cost-of-living squeeze, which peaked at 11% in late 2022. However, it's unlikely to lead to an immediate interest-rate cut, as the central bank is still monitoring wages and price-setting in the service sector. Economists expect the BOE to leave the benchmark rate at 5.25% for now, but anticipate a rate cut in August. Money markets are more cautious, only pricing in a reduction in November.

**BREAKING:  Inflation finally drops to Bank of England target of 2%**
Inflation has fallen to the Bank of England's target of 2% in the 12 months to May, giving hope for an interest rate cut in August. Most economists predict the Bank of England will hold rates at 5.25% and opt for a cut in August instead. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of goods and services over time, and has been dropping since reaching a peak of 11% in October 2022. The Bank of England started increasing its base interest rate in response to rising inflation, but with inflation now at target, a cut may be imminent.

**Futures File: Take me home, Consumer Price Index**
The May 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers were released, showing a monthly CPI unchanged and a 3.3% increase over the past 12 months. This marks the lowest monthly inflation rate in two years and one year of stable yearly inflation between 3% and 4%. The Federal Reserve's effective interest rate has remained at 5.33% since August 2023, similar to the period from July 2006 to July 2007. The article argues that cutting interest rates may not be effective in preventing a recession, as the die was cast with the extraordinary events and actions taken between 2020 and 2022. The author suggests that cutting rates seems irresponsible until the unemployment rate exceeds 5% or the annual inflation rate reaches 2.5%.

**Consumer sentiment stalls along with progress on inflation**
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment report shows that Americans' economic outlook remains stagnant, with little change from last month's decline. The report's director, Joanne Hsu, attributes the stagnation to concerns about the labor market, interest rates, and inflation. The consumer price index has decreased to 3.3% from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but Americans still expect prices to rise 3.3% in the next year. The consumer sentiment index is below its historic average, but has improved since the low point in June 2022.

**CPI From May Comes in Unchanged**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May has been released, showing a decrease across the board, albeit modestly, from expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 240 points, the S&P 500 40 points, and the Nasdaq 180 points after the release. The headline CPI month-over-month reached 0.0%, down from the expected 0.1%, while the core CPI month-over-month came in at 0.2%, the lowest since August 2021. The inflation rate, also known as the year-over-year headline CPI, came in at 3.3%, 10 basis points below expectations and the lowest since February.

**U.S. CPI Was Flat in May, Surpassing Expectations; Bitcoin Reaches New Heights**
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained flat in May 2024, exceeding market expectations. The stability is reflected across various sectors, with some fluctuations in food and energy prices. Energy prices decreased by 2.0% monthly, while food prices increased by 0.1%. The CPI annual increase was 3.3%, a slight decrease from the previous month. The stabilization of the CPI has had a noticeable impact on the financial markets, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector, where Bitcoin surged to $69,200. This increase aligns with a broader trend in cryptocurrency markets reacting to economic indicators and investor sentiment towards inflation and monetary policy expectations.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das stated that the inflation-growth balance is moving favourably, with growth holding firm and inflation moderating, mainly driven by the core component.

**The CPI Report: Our First ZERO Print**
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May showed a 0% increase, the first monthly print of zero, which has led to a surge in stock prices and a decline in bond yields. The year-over-year rate fell to 3.3%, a new low for this cycle. The core rate increased 0.2% in May, the smallest increase since August 2021. The article suggests that the disinflationary trend is intact and that Fed officials should be reassured. The author notes that shelter costs are still the primary driver of the overall and core rates, but argues that using real-time data, the CPI would already be at the Fed's target of 2%. The author expects three rate cuts before the year-end, starting at the September meeting, and advises investors to watch the 2-year Treasury yield for clues about monetary policy.

**Here Are the¬†Key Takeaways From the US CPI Report for May**
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May showed a flat overall CPI, the first time in almost two years, due to a drop in gasoline prices. The core index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2%, the least since last October. Services were the main reason for the decline, with a drop in car insurance and airline fares. The annual rate of core inflation came down to 3.4%, the lowest since April 2021. The release boosted the likelihood of the Federal Reserve projecting two rate cuts for 2024, with interest-rate futures showing increased bets on rate cuts in September. Treasuries and stocks climbed, while the dollar slid.

**US consumer prices flat in May, defying expectations for slight rise**
US consumer prices remained unchanged in May, defying expectations of a slight increase. The unchanged reading in the consumer price index (CPI) follows a 0.3% increase in April. The CPI has been trending lower since February and March. Despite the annual increase in consumer prices slowing down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation remains above the US central bank's 2% target. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, with some economists predicting a rate cut in September or December.

**2025 Social Security COLA forecasts updated: The good and bad news for seniors**
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has released the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will help project the 2025 Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits. The COLA is calculated using the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The BLS reported no change in the average price of goods and services, indicating a smaller COLA for next year. This is good news for seniors on a fixed income, who often feel the impact of inflation more severely. The Senior Citizens League projected a 2.6% COLA for 2025, and the actual COLA will be based on the average CPI-W in July, August, and September of this year compared to the same period last year.

US consumer prices remained unchanged in May, defying expectations of a slight increase. The unchanged reading in the consumer price index (CPI) follows a 0.3% increase in April. The CPI has been trending lower since February and March, and price pressures may continue to moderate as major retailers cut prices to attract inflation-weary consumers. The annual increase in consumer prices has slowed from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, with some economists predicting a rate cut in September or December.

**RBA Sees Some Households Struggling, Suggesting Rate-Hike Limits**
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is concerned that some households may struggle with the current economic conditions, which could limit the need for interest rate hikes. The Treasury estimates that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) could reach 2.75% by the end of the year, within the RBA's target. However, the RBA only expects this to happen by the end of 2025. The RBA's chief economist adviser, Hunter, stated that the bank is seeing signs of slowing wage growth and is closely monitoring wages and productivity to advise the board on when inflation can return to target.

**Market update: UK's April CPI data crucial for potential June interest rate cut**
The UK's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for April is expected to decline, with a consensus estimate of a significant drop from 3.2% to 2.1%. A higher-than-expected reading could lead to market disappointment, while a small miss to the upside would still represent progress towards the 2% inflation target. The data is crucial for potential interest rate cuts in June, with markets currently viewing a 50/50 chance of a cut. A softer CPI print could lead to dovish comments from the Bank of England, increasing the likelihood of a rate cut. However, if inflation fails to meet expectations, pricing may reflect a preference for August or later in the year.

**2025 Social Security COLA forecasts trend upward as prices continue to rise: What beneficiaries need to know**
The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses the Consumer Price Index for Salaried Workers in Urban Areas and Administrative Workers (CPI-W) to calculate the Cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security recipients. The latest CPI-W report shows a 3.4% year-over-year increase, which may lead to a COLA forecast of 2.66% for 2025, lower than the 2024 COLA. This could have significant implications for the financial well-being of seniors, who are already struggling with rising expenses. The Senior Citizens League has raised concerns that a COLA of 2.66% would not be enough to keep up with inflation, and that seniors would continue to suffer financial insecurity.

**Inflation Concerns Continue Amidst Rising Consumer Prices: Impact on Household Debt Repayments**
The US economy is struggling with high inflation rates, which is affecting American consumers' ability to manage their debts and maintain their lifestyles. The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) data shows that consumer prices rose by 0.3% in April, with an annual increase of 3.4% compared to April 2023. This has led to a strain on household budgets, eroding purchasing power and exacerbating financial burdens.

Navicore Solutions is helping individuals navigate their financial difficulties by providing expert guidance, personalized debt management plans, and financial education resources.

**What changes will beneficiaries see in their Social Security payments starting in 2025?**
Social Security benefits will increase in January 2025 due to the Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA). The COLA is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Salaried Workers in Urban Areas and Administrative Workers (CPI-W). In 2023, the COLA was 8.7%, the largest increase in four decades. This year, a 3.2% increase was applied, resulting in an average Social Security payment increase from $1,779 to $1,909. Factors that influence the average Social Security payment include new retirees claiming benefits, inflation, and the average income earned over a career. The 2025 COLA forecast is expected to exceed the 2024 COLA if average prices continue to rise. However, there is still time for inflation to reverse course and for prices to fall, which would lead to a smaller COLA in 2025.
