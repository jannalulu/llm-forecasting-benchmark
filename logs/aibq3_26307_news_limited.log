**Economists Trim US Inflation Forecasts, Paving Way for Fed Cut**
Economists have reduced their inflation forecasts for the US through the first half of 2025, expecting a slightly higher unemployment rate. This combination is expected to encourage the Federal Reserve to start lowering interest rates. The forecasters see the annual core personal consumption expenditures price index ending the year at 2.6%, and the overall PCE price index at 2.4%. The unemployment rate is expected to average 4.2% in the fourth quarter. The survey of 75 economists follows reports showing the Fed's tightening campaign is having its intended effect on the economy, with inflation receding, hiring and wage growth slowing, and the economy cooling to a pace that's more in line with what policymakers would like to see. 'The Fed is poised to start cutting rates in September barring any adverse inflation readings for July or August,' said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. 'We view the easing as necessary since the labor market is showing signs of moderation — lower rates could help stave off wider and deeper cracks in the labor market.' Economists see a 30% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, a much lower chance than forecast a year ago. They see the economy holding up through 2025 on the back of healthy consumer spending and resilient investment, though quarterly growth rates are projected to be less than 2%. 'The US economy is performing better than all other G-20 countries and that should continue for years,' said James Smith, chief economist at EconForecaster LLC. 'The goldilocks US economy has returned.'

**The Problem Looming in the Labor Market**
The government's secret policy of hiring people to control unemployment and hide the failure of its labor market and economic policies has been revealed. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), the unemployment rate in August 2023 was 7.4%, still above pre-pandemic levels. The new government must take urgent action to improve the labor climate, as an increase in unemployment, combined with a projected economic slowdown, could lead to social problems such as crime, poverty, and decreased tax revenue. The author suggests that measures should be taken to reduce bureaucracy, simplify labor procedures, and create an incentive for businesses to formalize employment, as informal employment accounted for 47.4% of the workforce in August last year. The author also emphasizes the need for a joint effort between the Ministry of Labor, Commerce, and Industry, the General Directorate of Taxes, and the private sector to detect and eliminate barriers to entrepreneurship and formalization.

**Unemployment Rate Rises to 7.7% in First Quarter of 2024**
The INDEC reported that the unemployment rate increased to 7.7% in the first quarter of 2024, due to the impact of devaluation, inflation shock, and subsequent recession. The indicator grew by 2 percentage points compared to the end of 2023. According to the report, there are 400,000 fewer workers employed in the 31 urban agglomerations. The activity rate was 48.0%, 0.6 percentage points lower than the previous quarter. The employment rate was 44.3%, 1.5 percentage points lower than the fourth quarter of 2023. The unemployment rate increased by 2.0 percentage points (from 5.7% to 7.7%). The Secretary of Labor's data had already shown the effect of the first months of the libertarian government's mandate on the labor market. In the last seven months considered by official statistics, the economy lost 127,000 registered private sector jobs. Only in the months of Javier Milei's government, 95,000 jobs were destroyed, and most are explained by the construction sector, affected by the suspension of most public works. The official labor market information does not seem to show signs of having reached a floor. 'To account for the magnitude of the job loss, it is worth noting that between August 2023 and March 2024, employment accumulated a 2% decline, which translates to 127,000 fewer employed people in the private registered labor market', stated the labor ministry's report.

**Unemployment and its numbers**
According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the employment rate (TO) in the first quarter of 2024 showed a slight positive difference of around 1.3 percentage points compared to the same period in 2023 (64.4% vs. 65.7%). In absolute terms, this increase was 76,402 employed people. However, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the employment rate registered a statistically significant decrease of 1.7 percentage points (67.4% to 65.7%), mainly due to a decrease in rural areas, where the labor force rate decreased from 68.5% to 65.2%. The number of employed people in the first quarter of 2024 was around 2,869,867, of which approximately 58.2% were men (1,670,830) and 41.8% were women (1,199,037). According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), there are conditions that must be met for a person to be considered unemployed, such as not working for one hour in an economic activity in the seven days prior to the interview, being available to work, and actively seeking work. Considering these conditions and observing the data provided by the INE, during the first quarter of 2024, around 212,740 people were classified as unemployed, of which approximately 93,375 were men (43.9%) and 119,365 were women (56.1%). The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security announced that in August 2023 and April 2024, 8,348 new productive units were created, representing a 44% increase compared to the period from August 2022 to April 2023. The main activities of these new units were commerce, repair of vehicles, and construction. The reasons behind the numbers are numerous and complex, including gender-based discrimination, lack of training, and informality. The unemployment rate will continue to increase, and it is necessary to address the root causes and implement policies to reduce informality and increase job opportunities.

**US adds 272,000 non-agricultural jobs in May 2024**
The United States added 272,000 non-agricultural jobs in May 2024, according to the US Department of Labor. This represents a solid growth compared to the slowdown observed in April. The unemployment rate increased by one-tenth, reaching 4%. The healthcare, government, leisure and tourism, professional services, scientific and technical sectors led the job creation. The mining, oil and gas extraction, construction, industry, wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and other services sectors saw minimal variation. The US Department of Labor reported downward revisions for March (5,000 jobs removed from the initial reading) and April (10,000 jobs subtracted). These revisions represented a total reduction of 15,000 jobs. The unemployment rate was 4% in May, up one-tenth from April and three-tenths from May 2023. This is the highest rate since January 2022, and for the first time since August 2023, the unemployment rate has left the range of 3.7% to 3.9%.

**US Unemployment Benefit Claims Mark Largest Increase Since May**
Initial unemployment benefit claims in the US increased to 243,000 in the week ending July 13, the highest level since August 2023, according to the Department of Labor. Continuing claims, which measure the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, also increased to 1.87 million, the highest level since November 2021. The data is prone to large weekly fluctuations during this time of year, which includes holidays like Independence Day and summer school closures. Other reports show that employers have slowed down hiring and the US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% last month, the highest since 2021. The slowing labor market and recent moderation of inflation strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the coming months.

**US Inflation Data for June 2024: When and What to Expect**
The US inflation data for June 2024 is highly anticipated. In May, consumer prices showed a monthly increase of 0.1% and an annual increase of 3.3%, which is the lowest level in three months. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said, 'Inflation has decreased significantly, but it is still above the 2% target. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1% in June.' The US inflation data for June will be announced on July 11, 2024 at 15:30. The expected direction of the US inflation data is uncertain. In June, the non-agricultural employment increased by 206,000, exceeding expectations, but the revisions for April and May showed a slower job growth. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4%. Average hourly wages increased by 0.3%, meeting expectations, but the growth rate slowed down compared to May. The 150,000 increase in private sector employment was below market expectations, and the annual wage growth rate was 4.9%, the lowest since August 2021. Economists believe that these data indicate a clear softening in the US labor market and that the Fed is observing the impact on its monetary policies. On the other hand, the Fed is said to want to collect more data before moving towards its inflation target. This development is being closely monitored by investors and market analysts, who believe it has the potential to shape expectations for the Fed's interest rate cuts.

**Treasuries See Recession-Style Employment Trends, Stocks Should Too**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, a 70 basis point increase from the 3.4% cycle low in 2022. Full-time job creation fell to a 39-month low, while part-time job creation reached a 33-month high. Jobless claims have increased in recent weeks, and survey data shows rising financial uneasiness among consumers. The year-over-year growth in unemployed Americans is 11.9%, above the +10% that has signaled the onset of past recessions. In Canada, the unemployment rate rose to 6.4% in June, with nearly all employment gains coming from the public sector. The US Fed and Bank of Canada have forecasted unemployment rates to peak in 2025 and 2024, respectively, but these forecasts may be optimistic given past cycles. Government bonds are rallying, and the equal-weight S&P 500 index has been flat since March, with some AI hopefuls boosting equity benchmarks. However, the market is at risk of a painful give-back cycle due to high debt and record stock market allocations, making it difficult for investors to recover losses.

**US Weekly Jobless Claims Reach 10-Month High**
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims reached a 10-month high in the last week, indicating a weakening of the labor market. Initial unemployment claims increased by 13,000 to 242,000, the highest level since August, according to the Labor Department. Economists had predicted 225,000 claims. The labor market is cooling down as the cumulative and lagged effects of the 525 basis point increase in the Federal Reserve's interest rate since 2022 are impacting the economy. The unemployment rate rose to 4% in May, still relatively low, for the first time since January 2022, while economic growth slowed significantly in the first quarter. The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at the current range of 5.25% to 5.50%, where it has been since July. The Fed authorities delayed the start of rate cuts until possibly December, projecting only a single 0.25 percentage point reduction for this year.

**Unemployment Rate in Britain Rises to 4.4% as Labor Market Cools**
The unemployment rate in Britain has risen to 4.4% in the three months ending April 2024, the highest level in over two years, according to the National Statistics Office. The number of job vacancies has decreased for the 23rd consecutive month, and the number of unemployed people has increased by 190,000 during this period. The economic inactivity rate has also risen to 22.3%, with around 2.83 million people out of work due to long-term illness. The Prime Minister's criticism of the 'culture of sick leave' has not had any impact on this trend. The private sector has reduced the number of employees, with the retail and hospitality sectors being particularly affected. However, there are some positive signs in the healthcare and social care sectors, with around 170,000 additional workers hired during the three months ending April. The education sector has also seen an increase in employees. Despite these positive signs, the overall picture is one of a cooling labor market, with the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its next meeting. The possibility of a rate cut in August is still on the table, but it is unlikely that the Prime Minister will make any announcements on this before the election.

**War propels unemployment to close to 80 per cent and shrinks GDP by 83.5 per cent in the Gaza Strip**
The ongoing war in the Gaza Strip has led to a massive loss of jobs and livelihoods, with the unemployment rate reaching 79.1% in the Gaza Strip and 32% in the West Bank. The real GDP has contracted by 83.5% in the Gaza Strip and 22.7% in the West Bank, and the actual number of those who have lost their jobs is higher than the unemployment figures suggest. The private sector has been severely impacted, with almost all establishments in the Gaza Strip ceasing or significantly reducing production, resulting in a loss of $810 million in production value. The ILO is implementing an Emergency Response Plan to restore people's livelihoods and create decent jobs, and projections suggest that if the war ends in August 2024, the annual unemployment rate for 2024 would average 47.1% and real GDP would plummet by 16.1%.

**Global Unemployment Rate to Fall to 4.9% in 2024, Says ILO**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) predicts that the global unemployment rate will decrease from 5.0% in 2023 to 4.9% in 2024, despite the persistence of labor market inequalities. The ILO attributes this revision to lower-than-expected unemployment rates in China, India, and high-income countries. The organization expects the trend to stabilize in 2025, with unemployment remaining at 4.9%. The global economic growth has been more robust than expected in the first months of 2024, particularly in the United States, and inflation has been decreasing, giving a boost to family income. However, the medium-term outlook remains uncertain due to expected monetary and fiscal policy adjustments, which may have a delayed impact on the labor market. The ILO emphasized the persistent lack of job opportunities, estimating that the employment gap, which measures the number of people without a job but wanting to work, will be 402 million people in 2024, above the 399 million in 2023. The report showed that the labor market remains an

**What are the months of the year with the highest and lowest unemployment rates in the USA?**
The unemployment rate in the US has remained within a narrow range of 3.5% to 3.9% over the past 12 months. The month with the lowest rate was July 2023 at 3.5%, while the highest rate was in April 2024 and February 2024, both at 3.9%. The unemployment rate has been below 4% since February 2022. The economy is considered hardy, but this could lead to concerns about inflation and the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates.
