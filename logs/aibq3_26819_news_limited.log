**Kamala Harris Joins TikTok, Gains 1.6 Million Followers in 24 Hours**
Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for the US presidential election, joined TikTok on Thursday and gained 1.6 million followers in less than 24 hours with only two videos posted. In her first video, she explained that she decided to join the platform after hearing she was trending on TikTok's news page. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has 9.2 million followers on the platform. Harris's presence on TikTok differentiates her from Joe Biden, who wanted to ban the app. The US Senate voted in April to pass a law requiring TikTok to cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance and the Chinese government, or risk being banned in the US. The app is suspected of providing personal data of Western users to the Chinese government.
