Two SUPERFORECASTERS, LUCAS and EMMA, sit at a small table, sipping coffee. The atmosphere is tense yet hopeful.

LUCAS  
Did you catch the race yesterday?

EMMA  
Of course. The whole world was watching. But our models had it at 12.34%.

LUCAS  
Right, with the weather reports predicting wind conditions over 2.0m/s, it seemed unlikely.

EMMA  
And yet, the anticipation was electric. The athletes trained for years, and the stakes were high. But no one broke 9.63s.

LUCAS  
True. The Olympic record still stands. Our models were spot on.

EMMA  
It's fascinating, isn't it? Even with all the preparation, some things remain unpredictable.

LUCAS  
Indeed. But that's what makes the Olympics so thrilling.

They clink their coffee cups, acknowledging the power of probability and the enduring spirit of competition.

Two superforecasters, CLAIRE and JAMES, sit at a small table, sipping espresso. The air is filled with excitement from yesterday's 100m dash final.

CLAIRE  
(leaning in)  
So, the big question—did anyone break Bolt's record?

JAMES  
(smiling)  
Our models had it at 12.34%. The conditions were perfect, but breaking 9.63s is no small feat.

CLAIRE  
(nods)  
True. The news up to July 26 didn't suggest any surprises. No new contenders emerged strong enough.

JAMES  
But imagine the buzz if it had happened! The crowd was electric, though.

CLAIRE  
(laughs)  
Indeed. Even without a new record, the race was thrilling.

JAMES  
Our models were spot on, as always. No surprises, but a spectacular event nonetheless.

They clink their cups, savoring the memory of the race that almost made history.

SUPERFORECASTERS, a group of analysts, sit around a table, sipping espresso. A digital clock shows 2024-08-05.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, the Men's 100m dash was exhilarating. Our models had it at 15.25%.

FORECASTER 2  
Indeed, considering the athletes' form and wind conditions, we knew it was unlikely.

FORECASTER 3  
(leans in, excited)  
But did you see the race? The tension was palpable. They almost did it!

FORECASTER 4  
True, but Bolt's 9.63s still stands. Our data up to 2024-07-26T14:30:00Z was spot on.

FORECASTER 1

The probability was low, yet the thrill was undeniable.

FORECASTER 2  
And the crowd's energy! Paris knows how to host an Olympics.
