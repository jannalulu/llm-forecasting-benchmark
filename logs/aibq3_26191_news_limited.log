**Democrats to Virtually Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party plans to virtually nominate President Joe Biden as their candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, in which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The nomination will be made through a virtual 'roll call' process, where over 4,000 party delegates will cast their votes starting next Monday, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Biden's nomination will be officially accepted during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, scheduled for August 19-22.

This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, during which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) had previously decided in May to virtually nominate Biden as its candidate, citing issues with the electoral deadlines in Ohio, where the state had set a deadline of August 7 for parties to register their presidential candidates. However, the situation has changed in recent weeks, as Ohio lawmakers passed a law setting a late August deadline for candidate registration, making it possible for Biden to be nominated at the party convention. Despite this, the Democrats are still concerned that the Republicans could change the rules suddenly, so they have decided to stick with their original plan and nominate Biden virtually before the convention.

**Biden Promises to Continue Campaign 'Until the End' Amid Eroding Support**
US President Joe Biden has promised to continue his re-election campaign 'until the end' despite eroding support among Democratic lawmakers in Congress. Biden has expressed this commitment during a video conference with his electoral team. He has also urged his supporters to 'contribute a few dollars' to help defeat his rival. Despite efforts to restore Biden's image after the debate, there are growing signs that his support among Democratic lawmakers in Congress is eroding. Some voices have been more direct, calling on the president to retire. A Texas Democratic legislator has become the first in Congress to ask Biden to step down, saying 'He saved our democracy by getting rid of Trump in 2020. He shouldn't give us Trump in 2024.' Meanwhile, Hunter Biden, the president's son, has been found guilty of three charges, including illegally purchasing a weapon.

**Biden's Chances of Re-Election Plummet After Poor Debate Performance**
The probability of Joe Biden remaining US President has significantly decreased after his poor performance in the TV debate with Trump. The New York Times has called for Biden to withdraw his candidacy for a second term. The editorial board described Biden as 'the shadow of a great public servant'. This development shows the growing loss of support from liberal media for Biden and raises concerns about his age and ability to serve as President. It seems unlikely that Trump will not become the next President. Important dates leading up to the election include the Republican National Convention from July 15-18, 2024, and the Democratic National Convention from August 19-22, 2024. There will be three TV debates between the presidential candidates, with the first one taking place on June 28. After the election on November 5, important dates include the Electoral College meeting on December 16, 2024, the official announcement of the election results on January 6, 2025, and the inauguration of the new or re-elected President on January 20, 2025.
