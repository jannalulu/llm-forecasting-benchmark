To forecast whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the latest news.

### Step 1: Reference Class Forecasting (Base Rates)
- **Historical Context**: The VXVCLS measures expected volatility over the next three months. Historically, volatility tends to spike during periods of economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or market corrections. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the VIX (a similar index) spiked to record highs.
- **Base Rate**: Over the past decade, the VXVCLS has shown significant year-over-year increases during periods of market stress, such as the 2018 correction and the 2020 pandemic. However, in stable periods, it tends to remain relatively flat or decline.

### Step 2: Current Trends and News Analysis
- **Recent Volatility Spike**: The VIX spiked to 65.73 on August 5, 2024, its highest level since March 2020, driven by recession fears, weak jobs data, and global market turmoil. This suggests heightened investor anxiety and expectations of continued volatility.
- **Market Recovery**: Despite the spike, markets have shown some recovery, with the VIX dropping to 24 by August 6, 2024, indicating a temporary easing of fears. However, the underlying economic concerns (e.g., weak labor market, potential recession) remain unresolved.
- **Fed Policy**: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in September, which could stabilize markets but also signal economic weakness, potentially keeping volatility elevated.
- **Election Uncertainty**: The upcoming U.S. presidential election in November 2024 is likely to contribute to market volatility, with historical patterns showing increased volatility in election years.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Pro-Higher VXVCLS**: The recent spike in the VIX, ongoing economic concerns, and election uncertainty suggest that volatility could remain elevated through September 2024. Historical patterns also support higher volatility during periods of economic stress.
- **Pro-Lower VXVCLS**: The market has shown resilience, with the VIX dropping significantly after the initial spike. If economic data improves or the Fed's rate cuts stabilize markets, volatility could decrease.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Overreacting**: The recent spike in the VIX might be an overreaction to short-term fears, and volatility could normalize if economic conditions stabilize.
- **Risk of Underreacting**: The underlying economic concerns (e.g., weak jobs data, recession fears) and election uncertainty could sustain higher volatility through September 2024.

### Step 5: Final Adjustment
Given the current economic uncertainty, the recent volatility spike, and the upcoming election, I adjust my base rate estimate upward. However, I also consider the potential for market stabilization if economic data improves or the Fed's actions reassure investors.

### Final Forecast
My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical data, current trends, and relevant news articles. Here’s my reasoning:

---

### **1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
- There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this specific question. However, the VIX (a related volatility index) has been widely discussed in the news, providing insights into market sentiment and expectations.

---

### **2. Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
- **Sub-problem 1:** What is the current level of VXVCLS, and how does it compare to historical levels?
- **Sub-problem 2:** What are the key drivers of volatility in the next 13 months (from August 2023 to September 2024)?
- **Sub-problem 3:** How do macroeconomic factors (e.g., inflation, interest rates, recession risks) and geopolitical events (e.g., U.S. presidential election) influence volatility?

---

### **3. Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
- **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historically, volatility indices like VXVCLS tend to spike during periods of economic uncertainty, market corrections, or geopolitical turmoil. For example, the VIX spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) and the 2008 financial crisis. However, such spikes are rare and typically followed by a return to lower levels.
- **Inside View (Current Context):** The VIX has recently spiked to levels not seen since 2020, driven by recession fears, weak labor market data, and global market turmoil. However, the VIX has since retreated, indicating some stabilization in market sentiment.

---

### **4. Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
- **Evidence for Higher Volatility:**
  - Recession fears are elevated, with the Sahm Rule triggering due to rising unemployment.
  - The U.S. presidential election in November 2024 is likely to increase market uncertainty.
  - The Federal Reserve’s potential rate cuts in September 2024 could create volatility.
  - Historical data shows that volatility tends to rise in the months leading up to elections.
- **Evidence for Lower Volatility:**
  - The VIX has already spiked significantly in August 2024, and such spikes are often followed by a return to lower levels.
  - The S&P 500 has shown resilience, with strong year-to-date returns (10% as of August 2024).
  - The Fed’s rate cuts could stabilize markets by addressing recession concerns.

---

### **5. Look for Clashing Causal Forces**
- **Upward Forces:**
  - Recession risks and weak economic data.
  - Election-related uncertainty.
  - Potential for further geopolitical shocks.
- **Downward Forces:**
  - Market resilience and strong corporate earnings.
  - Fed rate cuts providing economic support.
  - Historical tendency for volatility to revert to mean levels after spikes.

---

### **6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
- The VIX spiked to 65.73 in August 2024 but has since retreated to around 20. This suggests that while volatility remains elevated, it is stabilizing. If this trend continues, VXVCLS could remain elevated but not spike further.

---

### **7. Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
- There is significant uncertainty around the trajectory of the U.S. economy, Fed policy, and the election. However, the base rate of volatility reverting to mean levels after spikes provides some confidence in a lower probability of a sustained high VXVCLS.

---

### **8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
- While the evidence suggests elevated volatility, overconfidence in a sustained spike would ignore the historical tendency for volatility to revert to mean levels. A balanced view acknowledges both possibilities.

---

### **9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
- A potential error would be overreacting to the recent VIX spike and assuming it will persist. Historical patterns suggest that such spikes are often short-lived.

---

### **Final Reasoning**
- The VXVCLS on September 20, 2023, was around 18.59 (based on the August 1, 2023, closing value). Given the current elevated volatility and the likelihood of continued uncertainty due to the election and economic risks, it is plausible that VXVCLS will be higher on September 20, 2024. However, the historical tendency for volatility to revert to mean levels after spikes suggests that the increase may not be extreme.

### **Forecast**
My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 70.00%, but 62.50% being the most likely. Probability: 62.50%.

### Step 1: Reference Classes and Base Rates
- **Historical Volatility Trends**: The VXVCLS, like the VIX, tends to spike during periods of market stress (e.g., recessions, geopolitical events, or significant economic data surprises). Historically, volatility indices often revert to their long-term averages after spikes, but the timing and magnitude of reversion vary.
- **Year-over-Year Changes**: Over the past decade, the VXVCLS has shown significant year-over-year variability, with increases often tied to macroeconomic shocks or policy uncertainty (e.g., COVID-19, Fed rate hikes, or election cycles).
- **Current Context**: As of August 2024, the VIX has experienced significant spikes due to recession fears, weak labor market data, and global market turmoil. The VXVCLS, being a 3-month measure, reflects expectations of sustained volatility.

### Step 2: Current Trends and News
- **Recession Fears**: The Sahm Rule has been triggered, indicating a potential recession. This has led to heightened market anxiety, as evidenced by the VIX spiking to levels not seen since 2020.
- **Fed Policy**: Markets are pricing in a 55% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, which could either stabilize or exacerbate volatility depending on economic data.
- **Election Uncertainty**: The U.S. presidential election in November is expected to increase market volatility, with the VIX futures curve steepening from September to October.
- **Market Recovery**: Despite recent rebounds, the S&P 500 remains below its July peak, and historical data suggests that markets often struggle for 4-8 weeks after a VIX spike above 45.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Pro-Higher VXVCLS**: 
  - Recession fears and weak economic data are likely to sustain elevated volatility.
  - The upcoming election and Fed policy uncertainty add to the volatility outlook.
  - Historical patterns show that volatility indices often remain elevated for months after a spike.
- **Pro-Lower VXVCLS**:
  - Markets have shown resilience, with recent rebounds suggesting some stabilization.
  - The Fed's potential rate cuts could calm markets if economic data improves.
  - Volatility indices tend to revert to their long-term averages over time.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- **Risk of Overreacting**: The current spike in volatility may already price in much of the bad news, and further increases could be limited.
- **Risk of Underreacting**: If economic data worsens or geopolitical risks escalate, volatility could remain elevated or increase further.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Given the current context, historical patterns, and the balance of evidence, I estimate that the VXVCLS is more likely to be higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024, but with significant uncertainty.

**My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, but 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.**

To forecast whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, balance historical patterns with current evidence, and weigh the risks of over- and under-adjusting.

### Step 1: Historical Base Rates
- The VXVCLS measures expected volatility over the next three months. Historically, volatility tends to spike during periods of economic uncertainty, geopolitical events, or market corrections.
- Year-over-year changes in volatility are influenced by macroeconomic conditions, Federal Reserve policy, and market sentiment. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the VIX (a related volatility index) spiked to record highs, but it normalized as markets stabilized.

### Step 2: Current Context
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Recent data shows rising unemployment (4.3% in July 2024) and weak job growth, which have reignited fears of a recession. The Sahm Rule, which signals a recession when the three-month moving average of unemployment rises by 0.5 percentage points, has been triggered.
- **Market Volatility**: The VIX spiked to 65.73 on August 5, 2024, its highest level since March 2020, due to global market turmoil and recession fears. However, it has since declined to around 24, indicating some stabilization.
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: Markets are pricing in a 55% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, which could reduce volatility if implemented. However, the Fed's delay in cutting rates has contributed to recent market anxiety.
- **Election Uncertainty**: The U.S. presidential election in November 2024 is expected to increase market volatility, with the VIX futures curve showing a steep increase in expected volatility from September to October.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Pro-Higher VXVCLS**: Recession fears, weak economic data, and election uncertainty are strong drivers of higher volatility. Historical patterns show that volatility tends to rise in the months leading up to elections, especially when economic conditions are uncertain.
- **Pro-Lower VXVCLS**: The Federal Reserve's potential rate cuts in September could stabilize markets and reduce volatility. Additionally, the VIX has already spiked and partially normalized, suggesting that some of the fear has been priced in.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- Over-reliance on historical patterns (e.g., election-year volatility) risks ignoring the unique context of 2024, such as the Sahm Rule trigger and the Fed's delayed response.
- Under-reacting to current data (e.g., weak job growth and recession fears) risks underestimating the potential for sustained volatility.

### Step 5: Final Adjustment
- Given the strong evidence for higher volatility (recession fears, election uncertainty, and weak economic data) and the countervailing force of potential Fed rate cuts, I assign a higher probability to the VXVCLS being higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024.

### Prediction
My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, but 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 75.00%, but 67.50% being the most likely. Probability: 67.50%.

To forecast whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, balance historical patterns with current evidence, and weigh the risks of over- and under-adjusting.

### Step 1: Historical Base Rates
- The VXVCLS measures expected volatility over the next three months. Historically, volatility tends to spike during periods of economic uncertainty, geopolitical events, or market corrections.
- Year-over-year changes in volatility are influenced by macroeconomic conditions, Federal Reserve policy, and market sentiment. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the VIX (a related volatility index) spiked to record highs, but it normalized as markets stabilized.

### Step 2: Current Context
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Recent data shows rising unemployment (4.3% in July 2024) and weak job growth, which have reignited fears of a recession. The Sahm Rule, which signals a recession when the three-month moving average of unemployment rises by 0.5 percentage points, has been triggered.
- **Market Volatility**: The VIX spiked to 65.73 on August 5, 2024, its highest level since March 2020, due to global market turmoil and recession fears. However, it has since declined to around 24, indicating some stabilization.
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: Markets are pricing in a 55% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, which could reduce volatility if implemented. However, the Fed's delay in cutting rates has contributed to recent market anxiety.
- **Election Uncertainty**: The U.S. presidential election in November 2024 is expected to increase market volatility, with the VIX futures curve showing a steep increase in expected volatility from September to October.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Pro-Higher VXVCLS**: Recession fears, weak economic data, and election uncertainty are strong drivers of higher volatility. Historical patterns show that volatility tends to rise in the months leading up to elections, especially when economic conditions are uncertain.
- **Pro-Lower VXVCLS**: The Federal Reserve's potential rate cuts in September could stabilize markets and reduce volatility. Additionally, the VIX has already spiked and partially normalized, suggesting that some of the fear has been priced in.

### Step 4: Error Balancing
- Over-reliance on historical patterns (e.g., election-year volatility) risks ignoring the unique context of 2024, such as the Sahm Rule trigger and the Fed's delayed response.
- Under-reacting to current data (e.g., weak job growth and recession fears) risks underestimating the potential for sustained volatility.

### Step 5: Final Adjustment
- Given the strong evidence for higher volatility (recession fears, election uncertainty, and weak economic data) and the countervailing force of potential Fed rate cuts, I assign a higher probability to the VXVCLS being higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024.

To forecast whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher year-over-year on September 20, 2024, compared to September 20, 2023, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current trends, and the latest news.

### Step 1: Reference Classes and Base Rates
- **Historical Volatility Trends**: The VIX and related volatility indices tend to spike during periods of economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or market corrections. Historically, volatility indices have shown mean-reverting behavior, meaning sharp increases are often followed by declines.
- **Election Years**: U.S. presidential election years (e.g., 2020) often see increased market volatility, particularly in the months leading up to the election. The 2024 election is likely to contribute to market uncertainty, especially given the current political climate.
- **Economic Indicators**: Weak economic data, such as disappointing jobs reports or recession fears, can drive volatility higher. Recent data (e.g., July 2024 jobs report) has shown signs of economic slowdown, which could sustain elevated volatility.

### Step 2: Current Context and News Analysis
- **Recent Volatility Spikes**: The VIX spiked to 65.73 on August 5, 2024, its highest level since March 2020, driven by recession fears and weak economic data. This suggests that market participants are pricing in significant near-term uncertainty.
- **Federal Reserve Policy**: The market is pricing in a 55% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September 2024, which could either calm markets (if seen as supportive) or increase uncertainty (if seen as a sign of economic weakness).
- **Election Uncertainty**: The U.S. presidential election on November 5, 2024, is likely to keep volatility elevated through September and October, as investors weigh potential policy changes.
- **Market Recovery**: Despite recent volatility, the S&P 500 has shown resilience, with significant rebounds after sharp declines. This suggests that while volatility may remain elevated, it may not reach the extreme levels seen in early August.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Pro-Higher Volatility**: Weak economic data, election uncertainty, and recent volatility spikes suggest that the VXVCLS could remain elevated or increase further by September 20, 2024.
- **Pro-Lower Volatility**: Historical mean-reversion tendencies, potential Fed rate cuts, and market resilience could lead to a decline in volatility from its recent highs.

### Step 4: Forecast
Given the balance of evidence, I estimate that the VXVCLS is more likely to be higher on September 20, 2024, than on September 20, 2023, but not by a large margin. The current elevated volatility is likely to persist due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty, but it may not reach the extreme levels seen in early August.
