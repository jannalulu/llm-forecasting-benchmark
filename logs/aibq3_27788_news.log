**Tesla's Q2 Delivery Numbers Exceed Estimates, Stock Up 6.3%**
Tesla announced its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding Wall Street estimates. The stock is currently up 6.3% to $223.16 per share. Tesla's delivery numbers are expected to be affected by the decline in demand and the decrease in prices. The company's current lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck, Model X SUV, and Model S luxury sedan. Tesla's delivery numbers have been impacted by the decline in sales, which was partly due to the closure of its factory in Germany due to a fire and delays in shipping due to conflicts in the Red Sea. The company's stock has fallen 16% this year, despite a 6% increase on Monday. Tesla is offering discounts and incentives to boost sales. In China, the company is currently offering a zero-interest loan to customers who purchase a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its annual report for 2023, Tesla generated around $21.75 billion in revenue from China, which accounts for 22.5% of its total sales.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Exceed Expectations Despite Price Cuts and Incentives**
Tesla reported a 4.8% decrease in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, exceeding expectations due to price cuts and incentives. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, beating the average analyst estimate of 438,019. Tesla's stock rose 4.5% in pre-market trading. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, expects an increase in deliveries in 2024 compared to last year, despite Wall Street's expectations of a decline due to low demand and high interest rates. Tesla's deliveries have been impacted by price cuts and incentives, as well as a shift in focus towards profitability over growth. The company has abandoned its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles per year by 2030, citing a more conservative growth outlook.

**Tesla: Shares Have Rebounded, But BEV Sales Outlook Remains Unchanged (NASDAQ:TSLA)**
Tesla's shares have rebounded, but the company's BEV sales outlook remains unchanged. Despite this, the company's revenue forecast has been increased due to higher actual deliveries in Q2 2024, an increase in the forecast for Cybertruck deliveries, and an increase in the forecast for electric vehicle deliveries in non-key regions. Tesla's energy segment has also seen strong growth, with 9.4 GWh of energy segment product installations in 2Q 2024, exceeding market expectations. The company's revenue forecast has been revised upwards from $92.6 bn to $100.2 bn for 2024 and from $116.6 bn to $129.1 bn for 2025. However, the company's gross margin outlook has been revised downwards due to the continued high costs of ramping up Cyber truck production and the expected negative impact of raw material tariffs. As a result, the valuation has been revised upwards from $153 to $185, but the stock status remains SELL. Upside risks to the valuation include an improved macroeconomic environment, faster improvements in charging infrastructure, significant new customer acquisition in China, government incentives for consumers to purchase BEVs, and a larger revenue impact from FSD.

**Tesla Increases Revenue and Profits in Second Quarter**
Tesla reported a better second quarter, with increased revenue and profits, despite a contraction compared to 2023. The company's sales exceeded expectations, and it was able to increase its profits compared to the beginning of the year. The good news is that the company's sales have surpassed even slightly the expectations, and Tesla also managed to increase its profits compared to the beginning of the year. The company's revenue was $25.5 billion, and its profit was $1.48 billion. The company's services division contributed to a slight growth in sales, with a growth of 21%. The energy storage and generation division continued to grow, doubling its business volume to $3 billion. Tesla's margins are still modest, and far from the 16% of last year, and in the second quarter it reached 5.8%, slightly exceeding the 5.5% of the first quarter. Tesla claims to benefit from lower costs per vehicle, such as material purchases, transportation, and customs duties. And the costs of 4,680 cells should also decrease. Production of vehicles The company's production and delivery numbers announced in early July made it clear that the second quarter would likely be difficult in terms of business numbers: Tesla produced 410,831 vehicles in the second quarter, a 14% decrease, and delivered a total of 443,956 units, a 5% decrease from last year. The excess deliveries can be explained by the situation in the first quarter, when Tesla had manufactured around 46,500 vehicles more than it could deliver at the end of the quarter. Some of the deliveries were delayed until the second quarter due to logistical reasons. After six months, Tesla is below last year's exercise: so far in 2024, 844,202 units have been built and 830,766 have been delivered. By the end of June 2023, Tesla had already built 920,508 cars, of which 889,015 had been delivered. Therefore, production is 8.3% lower than last year and deliveries are 6.6% lower. There are no significant changes in production: Tesla has a capacity to manufacture 100,000 Model S/X at the Fremont, California factory, plus over 550,000 Model 3/Y at the same facility. Additionally, it has the capacity to produce 250,000 Model Y at the Texas plant; where Americans indicate they have capacity to produce 125,000 units of the Cybertruck. In Giga Berlin, Tesla has managed to develop capacity to manufacture over 375,000 Model Y per year. The largest factory, with a difference, is the Giga Shanghai: there the American manufacturer claims to have a capacity of over 950,000 units of the Model Y and Model 3. In total, Tesla already has capacity to produce up to 2.3 million cars per year. Superchargers and stores In other areas, Tesla's business is growing constantly, and for example, stores have grown 12% to reach 1,286 centers open this year, while mobile technical services have increased 7% to 1,896 vehicles. As for Superchargers, the network has reached 6,473 stations, a 23% increase, with a total of 59,596 active points. Source: Tesla

**Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2024 EV production and deliveries decreased from Q2 2023**
Tesla's Q2 2024 earnings results showed a 5% decrease in vehicle deliveries compared to Q2 2023, with 443,956 vehicles delivered.

This marks the company's second consecutive quarter of declining deliveries, following a peak of 484,507 deliveries in Q4 2023.

**Tesla Reports Higher Revenue, Lower Profit in Q2**
Tesla reported a 2% increase in revenue to $25.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024, but saw a stronger-than-expected decline in profit per share to $0.52. Analysts had forecast a revenue decline to $24.5 billion and a less severe profit decline to $0.61 per share due to lower volumes and prices. Tesla delivered 444,000 vehicles in the quarter, with an average realized price of $42,500. The company expects growth in vehicle deliveries to be significantly lower in 2024 than in 2023 due to the launch of next-generation vehicles and other products. Tesla's plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, are still on track to enter production in the first half of 2025. The company believes that its approach, which uses existing production lines, will result in 'less cost savings than previously expected', but will enable it to grow volumes in a way that is 'more efficient in managing investments during uncertain times'. The stock fell about 2% after the earnings report.

**Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2024 Earnings Preview: What to Expect**
Tesla (TSLA) is expected to release its financial results for the second quarter of 2024 on Tuesday, July 23, after the market closes. The company will hold a conference call and Q&A session with its management. We will look at what ordinary investors and private investors can expect in terms of quarterly results. Tesla's deliveries for the second quarter of 2024 have already been announced: Model 3/J production and deliveries: 386,576 and 422,405, respectively, with a 2% increase in deliveries. Other models: 24,255 and 21,551, respectively, with a 1% increase in deliveries. The total: 410,831 and 443,956, respectively, with a 2% increase in deliveries. Deliveries have decreased year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, but the performance was better than the previous quarter. Tesla has already announced an impressive new record for energy storage: 9.4 GWh. The company's revenue for the second quarter of 2024 is expected to be around $24.38 billion, according to Wall Street consensus. Business Insider, a specialized crowdfunding forecasting service, expects higher revenues of $24.562 billion. The company is trying to achieve a marginal profit every quarter, as it invests most of its money in growth, and has been successful in doing so over the past three years. However, just like with revenue, profits are difficult to predict, with price reductions having an impact on the gross margins of market leader Tesla and a decline in deliveries making it even harder. For the second quarter of 2024, the Wall Street consensus expects a profit of $0.61 per share, while Estimize's prediction is slightly higher at $0.64 per share. Tesla earned $0.91 per share in the same period last year. Other predictions for TSLA's shareholders and analysts include updates on the company's software delays, production of 4680 battery cells, and the availability of Optimus.

**Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2024 earnings preview: what to expect today**
Tesla is set to release its Q2 2024 financial results on July 23, after the markets close.

Analysts are expecting a revenue of $24.380 billion, with Estimize predicting a higher revenue of $24.562 billion. The company's average price per vehicle is changing due to frequent price cuts and discounts, making it harder to estimate earnings. Tesla is expected to be marginally profitable, with a gain of $0.61 per share, according to Wall Street consensus, and $0.64 per share, according to Estimize. The company will also provide updates and answer shareholder questions in its shareholder letter and conference call. Some of the most upvoted questions include when the robo-taxi event will take place, when the first robotaxi ride will be available, and the current status of 4680 battery cell production.

**Tesla's push at Giga Shanghai 'indicates' good things out of China**
Tesla's Giga Shanghai production plant in China is running at full capacity, indicating stronger demand for vehicles. Analysts at Barclays believe this increased production capacity points to higher demand, which could lead to higher delivery levels in the second half of 2024. Tesla has delivered 830,766 cars in the first half of the year, putting it on pace for 1.6 million deliveries in 2024, a decline from 2023's 1.81 million deliveries. The company has noted that the development of its next-gen platform may lead to a lower growth rate in 2024 compared to 2023.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Strong, But What's To Come?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries were strong, but the company is still facing an electric vehicle (EV) demand problem. Despite a 42% one-month rally, Tesla's production and deliveries are set to decline in 2024. The company needs to report strong sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 to ease concerns. Energy storage was a bright spot, with a record 9.4 GWh in deployments, but its contribution to revenue and gross profit is not yet significant enough to drive a meaningful EPS beat. Tesla's margins are still under pressure, with automotive operating margin dropping to 5.5% in Q1 2024, and the company has provided no concrete guidance on how far margins will decline.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Surprised, But Was Stock's 10% Rally Justified?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries exceeded expectations, with 443,956 vehicles sold, a 15% increase from Q1 2024. Despite this, the stock price rose only 10% due to various factors affecting demand, including high interest rates, competition, and a rising inventory of unsold vehicles. Tesla's Q2 production was 410,831 vehicles, a 7.5% decrease from deliveries. The company's global vehicle inventory, measured in days of supply, rose to 28 days in Q1 2024, but is likely to decline in Q2. The average price of Tesla vehicles dropped to under $45,000 in Q1 2024, and gross margins decreased by 200 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. The company reduced prices by $2,000 for three models, including the Model Y, Models X, and S. Tesla's stock has seen little change over the past three years, while the S&P 500 has increased by 45%. The company's valuation is estimated at $177 per share, 20% below the current market price.

**Elon Musk Threatens to Destroy Bill Gates if He Bets Against Tesla**
Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, threatened to destroy Bill Gates if he bets against the electric vehicle manufacturer. Musk believes that Tesla's production of robots will increase its value to $30 trillion. He also mentioned that when Tesla solves the autonomy issue and starts mass-producing its Optimus robot, anyone who still has a short position will be destroyed, including Gates. The feud between Musk and Gates started in 2022 when Musk refused to support Gates' philanthropic project after leaked messages showed that Gates had bet $500 million against Tesla's stock price falling. Musk stated that he cannot take Gates' philanthropic efforts on climate change seriously when he has a large short position against Tesla, the company that is doing the most to address climate change. Tesla recently released its preliminary data for the 2nd quarter of 2024, showing a 14.8% increase in deliveries and a 4.8% decrease in sales compared to the same period last year. The company's stock price has been affected, and it has fallen 50 positions in the S&P 500 ranking and 50 positions in the reputation ranking in the US market in 2023, according to Axios. However, Tesla announced the production of a new robotaxi model in April and expects an increase in sales with the launch of low-cost models in 2025. The company's market capitalization has reached $100 billion in recent days.

**Tesla Reverses Losses in 2024: How You Can Still Profit**
Tesla's stock has reversed its losses in 2024, surpassing market expectations after the company reported strong delivery numbers for the second quarter. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding analyst estimates and showing a 14.8% increase in deliveries compared to the previous quarter. This positive report has boosted investor confidence, with the stock rising 0.16% year-to-date.

**Tesla Reports Decline in Vehicle Deliveries Despite Stock Price Increase**
Tesla, despite a significant increase in its stock price, has reported a decline in its vehicle deliveries. According to the company's quarterly report, Tesla produced 410,831 vehicles and delivered 443,956 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024. This is a decrease of 4.8% compared to the same period last year, but an increase of 14.8% compared to the first quarter. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver around 439,000 vehicles in the second quarter. Tesla's delivery numbers are closely tied to its sales figures, and the company groups its deliveries into two categories: Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and other vehicles. The company's current product lineup includes popular models such as the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, and new Cybertruck pickup, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan. Tesla had previously reported an 8.5% decline in its first-quarter deliveries, which was the first annual decline since 2020. The company attributed the decline in sales to temporary factory closures in response to a sabotage attack on its German factory, as well as supply chain disruptions caused by conflicts in the Middle East. Tesla's stock price has risen by around 10% following the release of its production and delivery figures, and its market value is currently around $724.65 billion.

This marks a new decline, as in the same period last year Tesla delivered 466,140 vehicles (-4.8%), and in the first quarter of 2024, it delivered 386,810 vehicles (-8.5%). The company delivered 422,405 Model 3/Model Y vehicles and produced 386,576. It also delivered 21,551 'other models', likely including the Model S/Model X and Cybertruck, and produced 24,255. Overall, Tesla produced 410,831 vehicles. The company's production is also down, with 479,700 vehicles produced in the same period last year and 433,371 in the first quarter of 2024. It will be interesting to wait for the financial results on July 23, when the company will likely provide more details.

**Tesla defies expectations with Q2 delivery surge**
Tesla has reported a significant surge in second-quarter delivery numbers, exceeding analyst expectations with 443,956 vehicles delivered. This marks a 14.8% increase from the first quarter and a 4.8% decrease from the same quarter last year. The company's production numbers also impressed, with 410,831 vehicles manufactured during the quarter.

**Tesla Reports Decline in Deliveries for Second Consecutive Quarter**
Tesla reported a decline in its deliveries for the second consecutive quarter, with a 8% decrease compared to the same period last year. The company attributed this decline to the early stages of production of the Model 3 at the Fremont factory and the closure of factories due to shipping disruptions caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the intentional fire at the Gigafactory in Berlin. Tesla also increased the price of its Model Y in the US by $1000 in April, but it's unclear if this will affect the company's financial results for the second quarter. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, previously announced that a low-cost electric car should be available by the second half of 2025, which may impact sales growth this year.

**Tesla's Second Quarter Deliveries Beat Estimates, But Year-Over-Year Decline Continues**
Tesla has released its second-quarter vehicle production and delivery report for 2024. The report shows that the company's delivery numbers have continued to decline year-over-year, but the decline was not as large as expected. Tesla's delivery numbers decreased by 4.8% compared to the same period last year, while analysts had expected a 6% decline. The company produced 410,831 vehicles in the second quarter, with 386,576 of them being Model 3/Y and 24,255 being Model S/X, Cybertruck, and others. Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in the quarter, with 422,405 being Model 3/Y and 21,551 being Model S/X and others. The company has also installed 9.4 GWh of energy storage systems in the quarter, its largest three-month installation to date. Tesla had previously reported 386,810 deliveries in the first quarter, which represented an 8.5% year-over-year decline. The second-quarter deliveries of 443,956 represent a 4.8% year-over-year decline, but a 14% increase from the previous quarter. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had expected an increase in deliveries in 2024 compared to the previous year, but the slowdown in the electric vehicle market and increased competition are making things difficult. The company's results for the first half of the year are also not positive.

**Tesla rallies as Q2 deliveries beat estimates, ease Model 3/Y supply glut jitters**
Tesla reported better-than-expected second-quarter electric vehicle deliveries, exceeding production and easing concerns about excess inventory for its Model 3/Y. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, beating estimates of 438,000, and produced around 410,831 vehicles. Oppenheimer views this as a positive, as it alleviates concerns about building excess inventory. The delivery update comes ahead of Tesla's Q2 results, where margins and the take-up of its self-driving Full Self-Driving software will be in focus. Oppenheimer flags Tesla's 'AI Day' on September 30 as a key catalyst for the stock, as it is expected to articulate its vision for leveraging its AI technology expertise.

**Tesla Surprises with Lower Than Expected Delivery Numbers**
Tesla's delivery numbers have surprised analysts, with a 5% decrease in the second quarter, lower than expected. This led to a 10% increase in the company's stock price, the highest in almost half a year. Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in the last three months, a 4.8% decrease from 2023, but a 14.8% increase from the first quarter. According to Reuters, Tesla has been slow to update its vehicle lineup, while rivals in China have launched new and affordable models, which has affected demand. Tesla has upgraded its S, X, and 3 models, but only in terms of performance and design, and not in terms of features. The Model Y, the best-selling model, has not been updated and lacks features such as a screen at the back and other upgrades available on the Model 3.

**Tesla's Second Quarter Deliveries Exceed Expectations**
Tesla announced that its vehicle deliveries in the second quarter exceeded Wall Street's expectations, attributing the success to recent price reductions and incentives that stimulated customer demand. The company's stock price rose 4.5% in pre-market trading after the announcement, reversing a 15.5% decline since the start of the year. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a total of 422,405 units of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, as well as 21,551 units of its other models, including the Model S sedan, Cybertruck, and premium Model X SUV. The electric vehicle manufacturer also reported that it produced 410,831 vehicles during the April-June period. Overall, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles to customers in the three months ended June 30. This number represents a 4.8% decline from the same period last year, but a 14.8% increase from the first quarter of 2024. Analysts had projected that Tesla would deliver 438,019 vehicles in the quarter, according to a survey of 12 analysts from LSEG. The increase in deliveries suggests that Tesla's strategy of stimulating sales through price adjustments is having a tangible impact on its performance. The company's ability to exceed delivery estimates may serve as a positive signal to investors and the market as it continues to navigate the competitive and rapidly evolving electric vehicle landscape.

**Tesla and Rivian's Q2 2024 Vehicle Delivery Numbers Boost Stock Prices**
Tesla and Rivian's second-quarter 2024 vehicle delivery numbers have a positive impact on their stock prices. Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding the expected 432,859 and market expectations of around 438,000. Rivian also announced higher-than-expected delivery numbers, surpassing analyst predictions and initial estimates. Market experts expect a positive reaction today for Tesla and Rivian's stocks. Tesla's recent Model 3 update is considered a key factor contributing to the impressive delivery statistics. However, Tesla's production for the second quarter, at 410,831, did not meet the expected 478,015. Rivian delivered 13,790 vehicles in the second quarter, exceeding the 11,550 expected and market consensus. The 9,612 vehicles produced by Rivian in the second quarter also surpassed the 9,240 expected. Additionally, Rivian confirmed its goal of producing 57,000 vehicles for the entire 2024 year, in line with expectations. In summary, analysts consider the good vehicle delivery results beneficial for Tesla and Rivian's stock prices.

**Tesla Q2 Deliveries 'The Appetizer To The Main Event': Analyst Says 'Worst In The Rearview Mirror' Ahead Of Robotaxi Day**
Tesla's second-quarter deliveries have beaten consensus estimates, with 443,956 vehicles delivered, compared to a Street consensus estimate of 437,800. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the company's future, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives saying that the worst is behind Tesla and that the company's delivery results will be 'music to the ears of the bulls' ahead of the second half of 2024. Ives maintains an Outperform rating on Tesla with a $275 price target. The company's energy storage deployment was also a highlight, with 9.4 GWh deployed in the second quarter, the highest in company history. The next key event for Tesla is its robotaxi day on August 8, which Ives believes will 'unleash the next part of the Tesla autonomous story' and potentially return the company to a $1-trillion market capitalization.

**Tesla's Q2 Delivery Numbers Exceed Estimates, Stock Up 6.3%**
Tesla announced its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding Wall Street estimates. The stock is currently up 6.3% to $223.16 per share. Tesla's delivery numbers are expected to be affected by the decline in demand and the decrease in prices. The company's current lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck, Model X SUV, and Model S luxury sedan. Tesla's delivery numbers have been impacted by the decline in sales, which was partly due to the closure of its factory in Germany due to a fire and delays in shipping due to conflicts in the Red Sea. The company's stock has fallen 16% this year, despite a 6% increase on Monday. Tesla is offering discounts and incentives to boost sales.

**Tesla's Q2 2024 Production and Delivery Numbers: A Mixed Bag**
Tesla has released its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. Despite a decline compared to last year, the company exceeded analyst expectations and continues to maintain strong market positions. The total number of deliveries was 443,956 electric vehicles, with a total production of 410,831 electric vehicles. This is above the 439,000 units expected by Wall Street analysts. However, deliveries decreased by 4.8% compared to the same period last year, when 466,140 electric vehicles were delivered. Tesla's delivery numbers are the closest indicator to the sales figures reported by the automaker. The company groups deliveries into two categories: Model 3 and Model Y, as well as all other electric vehicles, but does not provide data on individual models or regions. Tesla's lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck pickup, Model X SUV, and flagship Model S sedan. In April, Tesla reported a decline in deliveries in the first quarter, down 8.5% to 386,810 electric vehicles, marking the first year-over-year decline since 2020. Weak sales were caused by a temporary shutdown of a German factory and delays in shipments due to attacks on ships in the Red Sea. However, problems are also related to the aging of the electric vehicle lineup and increased competition. Tesla's stock fell more than 10% in 2024, despite a more than 5% gain on the opening of trading on Monday. The company has offered a range of discounts and incentives to stimulate sales, including a zero-interest credit in China. According to the company's annual report for 2023, Tesla received around $21.75 billion in revenue from China, accounting for 22.5% of the company's total revenue. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan published a report stating that the decline in deliveries is due to declining demand and declining discount effectiveness. He recommends selling Tesla shares. Wells Fargo expects Tesla's gross profit from electric vehicle sales, excluding environmental credits, to decline over the year.

Tesla has released its Q2 2024 production and delivery report, showing 443,956 cars delivered, slightly above expectations. Despite this, sales are down 5% compared to the same period in 2023. The company's sales have declined for two consecutive quarters. The Model 3 and Model Y accounted for 422,405 deliveries, while the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck accounted for 21,551. Production was lower than deliveries due to a large inventory of unsold cars from Q1 2024.

**What Wall Street is expecting**
Tesla is set to report its second-quarter 2024 deliveries, and analysts expect a jump in deliveries from the previous quarter but a drop compared to the same quarter in 2023. The company has a lot to prove after a disappointing Q1, and its upcoming Robotaxi unveiling and increased Cybertruck production could boost deliveries. However, execution is key, and CEO Elon Musk's pay package resolution has eliminated distractions, allowing the company to focus on growth. Analysts expect 438,019 Tesla deliveries in Q2, which may concern some investors.

**Tesla: Should You Buy the Stock Before Firm's Q2 Deliveries Report?**
Tesla is set to announce its Q2 deliveries and earnings report on July 17th, with expectations of 448,000 EVs delivered, a 16% increase from the previous quarter. Some analysts predict a lower range of 415,000-420,000 deliveries. The company's capacity has increased to prepare for the EV future. The 'robotaxi day' announcement on August 8th is expected to impact the stock price. Additionally, the 'Model 2' project, previously dubbed 'Redwood', is expected to tackle affordability as the main EV adoption hurdle by mid-2025. The average TSLA price target is $182.1, with a ceiling of $310 per share and a floor of $22.86.

**Tesla's No-Good 2024 Expected to Get Worse With Q2 Results**
Tesla is expected to report a decline in deliveries for the second quarter of 2024, following a decline in the first quarter. Analysts predict a 5.4% to 11% decrease in deliveries year-over-year. This would be the first consecutive quarters of declining deliveries since 2012. Tesla's stock has already dropped 25% this year, and there is no indication that the company's performance will improve in the near future. The company's product lineup is outdated, and public enthusiasm for electric cars has plateaued. Additionally, Tesla's newest product has been recalled every month due to manufacturing issues. The company is expected to announce its quarterly earnings on July 2.

**Analyst puts Tesla stock on key ideas list as Q2 deliveries loom**
Tesla's stock rose ahead of its Q2 delivery figures, despite a key analyst suggesting the stock has more room to fall. Wells Fargo added the stock to its Tactical Ideas list, but maintained an underweight rating and lowered its 2024 delivery estimate. The analyst, Colin Langan, expects deliveries to decline 14% year-on-year and 13% below the Wall Street consensus. Tesla's Q2 deliveries are expected to be 438,019 units, a 6% decline from the year-earlier period, and may not assuage concerns about demand and margin pressures. The company's focus on autonomous robotaxis and AI supercomputer may be a key growth driver in the second half.
