**Tether USDT market share drops from 82% to 74%.**
Tether's USDT market share has declined from 82% to 74% in 2024, according to Kaiko's report. The decline is attributed to an increased shift in market sentiment and regulation on stablecoins. Other stablecoins, such as FDUSD and USDC, have gained popularity, especially since the partnership with Binance. USDC's market share has increased to 12%, nearing FDUSD at 14%. Major investors are shifting to legally accepted stablecoins to comply with operational requirements, especially in the European Union. MICA approval of CIRCLE has boosted USDC's market share and trading volume. USDC is also more accessible and flexible than Tether, with zero fee minting and faster transfer times. Tether is expected to suspend USDT redemptions across major blockchains by September 2025.

Tether's market share in the stablecoin market has declined from 82% to 74% in 2024, while regulated stablecoins such as USDC have gained popularity.

**Ripple CEO Warns of US Regulatory Action Against Tether**
Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, expressed concern about potential US regulatory measures targeting Tether. In a World Class podcast episode, Garlinghouse described the situation as 'something to watch'. He stated that the US government is taking action against Tether, and that he is 100% sure that another 'black swan' event like the FTX collapse could happen in the cryptocurrency sector. Tether has faced constant scrutiny over its operational transparency, including the extent of its reserves backing its USDT stablecoin. The company has been under investigation for potential ties to terrorism and has paid a $41 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for providing incorrect information about its reserves.

**Libya Officials Sentenced for Dams Collapse**
12 officials responsible for managing the dams in Libya were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 9 to 27 years by the Temyiz Mahkemesi in Derna. Four officials were acquitted. The city of Derna, with a population of 125,000, was devastated by a massive flood caused by the collapse of the dams in September 2023, resulting in at least 4,300 deaths and 8,500 people missing. According to a UN report, the flood was a result of climate and environmental disaster. The World Bank, UN, and European Union estimated that the region's reconstruction would require $1.8 billion (59 billion TL). The report attributed the dam collapse to outdated designs based on old hydrological data and inadequate maintenance and management due to ongoing conflicts in Libya.

**What is the price of Tether on July 22, 2024?**
Tether is a cryptocurrency issued by Tether Limited, a stablecoin that was initially backed by the US dollar. However, controversies have raised questions about this claim. Tether was the first stablecoin to exist, launched in 2014 by Reeve Collins, Brock Pierce, and Craig Stellers. It has since become the largest by market capitalization. The Tether network is controlled by the owners of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which was accused by the New York District Attorney's office of using Tether funds to cover a $850 million shortfall from 2018. As of July 22, 2024, the price of Tether is $1.000085, with a 0.02% change in the last 24 hours and a 0.01% change since 08:30 UTC. Tether remains the third most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital currencies, were born in 2008 as an alternative to traditional currencies after the economic crisis. They work through cryptographic encryption, ensuring the security of transactions and control over the creation of their coins. Transactions are recorded on a decentralized database, blockchain or shared ledger. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that do not exist physically and are not regulated by any institution, requiring no intermediaries in transactions. This has led to concerns about their reliability, volatility, and potential for fraud, among other issues. Despite this, some companies, millionaires, and governments have encouraged or legalized their use.

**How Basel Committee's latest ruling will affect Tether, USDC, other stablecoins**
The Basel Committee has recently issued a ruling that will affect Tether, USDC, and other stablecoins.

Meanwhile, Tether's market share has dropped to 74% in 2024, while regulated stablecoins like USDC have gained market share. Tether and Bitfinex have also been accused of market manipulation. The article also mentions that banks are pushing the UK to delay Basel rules to align with US regulations.

**Investigation Launched into Public Officials Over Deadly Building Collapse**
A 7-story building in Güneşli Kocabaş Evleri, Dulkadiroğlu district of Kahramanmaraş, collapsed in the 6 February 2023 earthquake, resulting in the deaths of 69 people and injuries to 16 others. An investigation was launched into the construction company and its executives, including Ökkeş Say, Abdullah Üren, and Tebernüş Özyurt, who were arrested. The prosecutor's office has filed charges against 9 individuals, including the three executives, for 'reckless homicide and causing harm' and 'abuse of office'. The investigation also found that the building's static project and calculation reports showed a concrete strength of C30/37, but the concrete pressure test reports and the building control documents showed a strength of C25/30, and that the 16th floor's concrete pressure test report was missing. The district governor's office has given permission for the investigation into the three public officials, including Arzu Özaydın, Öner Gürbüzel, and Serap Binici, for 'reckless homicide and abuse of office'. The family of one of the victims, Filiz Besni, has welcomed the investigation, saying 'It's great that the public officials are being investigated. We hope that everyone will get their punishment and justice will be served.'

**Pilot scheme launched for automatic approval for free school meals in Teesside borough**
The Redcar and Cleveland Council has approved a pilot scheme to automatically enroll children for free school meals, aiming to increase registration and save families hundreds of pounds a year. The scheme will start in September and use existing data to confirm eligibility. Parents and guardians can opt-out if they wish. The initiative is expected to benefit hundreds of households, with potential extra Government funding for schools and access to free holiday activities. The Council's Plan 2024-2027 aims to reduce child poverty in the borough. Cllr Bill Suthers and Cllr Ursula Earl, Cabinet Members for Children and Health, Welfare and Housing, respectively, praised the scheme, citing its positive impact on families and children's health.

**Partially Collapsed School in Volno-Nadezhdinskoye to be Renovated in August**
The partially collapsed school in Volno-Nadezhdinskoye will be renovated in August. The school's new wing will be built, and the building will be repaired. The works are planned to start in early August, according to the Primorsky Krai government's press service. The school's extension, built in 1962, was made of porous brick that absorbed water and collapsed. The new wing will be built using lightweight construction materials. The renovation plan includes a timeline for the new wing's completion, with students expected to be able to use it in October. The main building will also undergo repairs, which will be completed by September 1. The construction of a new school, initially planned for 2024, has been delayed due to the contractor's violations. However, the government plans to put the school into operation in 2027, with an estimated cost of almost 3 billion rubles. The contractor is still being selected.

**Recife Expo Center Collapse Leaves Six Workers Injured**
On July 9, a collapse at the Recife Expo Center construction site injured six workers. The incident highlights the precarious working conditions in the state of Pernambuco, caused by the lack of public investment. The construction company, Tecla, attributed the collapse to the failure of a scaffolding system, but the workers' union is demanding the suspension of the project. The incident is part of a larger trend of workplace accidents and injuries in Pernambuco, where 1,500 unfinished projects are estimated to be worth R$ 65 million. The state's lack of investment in workplace safety and health has led to a significant increase in accidents, with 8,331 cases reported between January and September 2023.

**Fears UK prisons face ‘collapse' as they could be full before early release scheme begins**
The UK prison system is facing a potential 'collapse' as it could reach full capacity before the early release scheme begins in September. Despite new emergency measures announced by Labour to release some prisoners early, officials fear that capacity will be overwhelmed by the end of August. The justice secretary has described the situation as a 'ticking timebomb'. A senior prisons source expressed concerns about an expected increase in inmates after the August bank holiday, warning that the estate is 'very vulnerable to shocks'. The early release scheme started by the Conservative government is still running, and up to 200 police cells have been made available under Operation Safeguard to hold inmates temporarily. If prisons become completely full, criminals cannot be moved on from police cells and official modelling suggests that custody suites across the country would run out of space within three days, making normal arrest procedures impossible.

**UK to Release Minor Offenders to Prevent Prison System Collapse**
The British Minister of Justice, Shabana Mahmood, announced an emergency plan to release thousands of prisoners serving minor sentences to prevent a collapse of the prison system in England and Wales. As of September, the time a convict must spend in prison before being eligible for automatic conditional release will be reduced from 50% to 40%, and the number of agents supervising permits will increase by 1,000. Mahmood emphasized that this measure, which will require legislation, is not permanent, as she still believes that criminals should be punished, but it is necessary to prevent the justice system from becoming blocked due to a lack of cells for new detainees. The Labour politician detailed the initiative during a visit to the Five Wells prison in central England, stressing that prisoners serving sentences of over four years for violent crimes will be exempt from early release. Meanwhile, the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police of London, Mark Rowley, stated that, although it's not ideal, the early release of some prisoners is the lesser of two evils. Prisons for men in England and Wales are at 99% capacity since early 2023 and are expected to run out of space in a few weeks, according to official data.

**Bitcoin at Pivotal Point as Bear Market Beckons: Onchain Data**
Bitcoin is at a crucial point in its market cycle, with several factors indicating a continued decline, while others suggest prices may be about to bottom out. The profit and loss index is hovering around its 365-day moving average, a previous crossover to the downside having led to major market corrections. Tether's market cap growth, a key driver of bull markets, has stalled. However, large BTC holders have increased their stash by 6.3% over the month, the highest since April 2023. Germany's aggressive selling of seized BTC appears to be coming to a close, and several bullish factors, such as the approval of an ether ETF in the U.S. and the continued growth of U.S. stock indices, suggest that 2024 will experience continued upside despite signs of short-term exhaustion.

The city of Grevenbroich is searching for leaks in the canal under the Düsseldorf Street, which is known to be in poor condition. In other parts of Orken, canals have already been renovated. In the section between Gierather Weg and Schillerstraße, a part of the sidewalk collapsed in February 2022. The street was closed for safety reasons. Shortly after, the extent of the problem became clear: two house parts had been undermined, and the buildings had to be stabilized with large amounts of concrete. At the time, there was also suspicion that the problem might be related to the canal.

**EU's New Rules for Stablecoins: Tether, Circle, and Others Face Uncertainty**
The European Union's rules for stablecoins, known as MiCA, will come into force on June 30. The rules prohibit stablecoins from conducting more than 1 million daily transactions that pay for goods or services outside and within the chain. Tether, Circle, and other major stablecoin issuers will soon be on a short leash in the European Union. With the new rules, they will not only need to obtain permission to operate in the 27-country trading block but also face strict limits on transaction volume and value set by the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation. The rules mean that some of the largest stablecoin issuers, including Tether, whose USDT is the largest in the world by market capitalization, and Circle, responsible for USDC, may not be able to operate in the EU, said Robert Kopich, general secretary of Blockchain for Europe. 'Stablecoins not belonging to the EU, denominated in euros - if they exceed a certain threshold - then you need to stop issuing and using them, and this creates a problem, because 99% of the stablecoin market is in US dollars,' Kopich said in an interview at the CoinDesk Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas, last month.

**EU's Restrictive Stablecoin Rules Take Effect Soon and Issuers Are Running Out of Time**
The European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation will take effect on June 30, imposing strict rules on stablecoin issuers. The rules ban stablecoins with over 1 million daily transactions or a value of over 200 million euros from being used as a means of exchange. This may force big stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle to stop operating in the EU. Robert Kopitsch, secretary-general of Blockchain for Europe, said that 99% of the stablecoin market is in USD, making it difficult for non-EU, euro-denominated stablecoins to operate. Companies must obtain an e-money institution license or banking license to operate legally, which is a costly and lengthy process. Circle aims to have an e-money license by the deadline, while Tether's CEO is optimistic about the implementation of MiCA, but notes that regulatory policies must be balanced and protect consumers.

**EU's Stablecoin Regulations to Come into Effect, Limiting Transactions and Authorization**
The EU's stablecoin regulations will come into effect on June 30, imposing strict limits on transactions and requiring authorization for operation in the 27-nation bloc. The regulations aim to prevent stablecoins like Tether and Circle's USDC from replacing the euro. According to Robert Kopitsch, secretary general of Blockchain for Europe, the 99% of the stablecoin market is denominated in dollars, making it difficult for non-EU stablecoins to operate in the EU. The European Banking Authority (EBA) has clarified that the rules do not prohibit the emission of stablecoins denominated in assets other than the euro, as long as they are not used as a medium of exchange. The EBA will issue a final report on how it will measure transactions, and companies that have had to suspend emission will need to present a plan to demonstrate compliance before being reintegrated. Tether and Circle are racing against time to obtain the necessary licenses to operate legally in the EU.

**Mali: Gold Mining Activities Suspended for Rainy Season**
The Malian government has suspended all gold mining activities until September 30, 2024, due to the rainy season. This is a yearly measure taken to ensure the safety of miners. The suspension is necessary because the risk of mine collapses increases during the rainy season, as seen in a recent incident where 20 miners were killed in Faranida when a tunnel collapsed. Fabou Keita, a development worker, notes that 'during the hivernage, it becomes very dangerous to practice gold mining. It's because of the rain. The risk of collapse is very high. The pits fill with water, often the plain becomes like a river. It's very dangerous for miners. The risk of collapse is very high.' However, many miners continue to work despite the risks, as it is their main source of income. Some miners use the suspension to return to agricultural work during the rainy season.

**Mali Orders Closure of Gold Mining Sites Across the Country**
The Malian government has decided to suspend all gold mining activities across the country until September 30, 2024, announced the Ministry of Mines on Tuesday evening. This decision coincides with the hivernage period and comes after a gold mine collapsed on June 8 in Kalako, Bougouni region, resulting in the deaths of over 20 miners and several others reported missing. The collapse occurred during the night of June 8, and rescue efforts continued until June 12, when the prefect adjoint arrived on the scene and ordered the search to be stopped. The minister of mines urges authorities, traditional leaders, and local press organizations to work together to ensure the strict implementation of this measure during the period in question. This is not the first mining disaster in Mali, as a similar incident in January 2024 in Kobadani, Koulikoro region, resulted in 70 deaths.

Tether has taken similar measures before, abandoning support for OmniLayer, BCH-LSP, and Kusama networks in August 2023. The company stated that if a blockchain lacks significant traction and does not show signs of recovery, maintaining support becomes inefficient and can put security and supervision at risk.

**Tether halts USDT emission on EOS and Algorand blockchains**
Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, will suspend its emission on the EOS and Algorand blockchains starting today, June 24. The company will continue to exchange USDT on EOS and Algorand for the next 12 months and may announce further changes. Tether cited the interest of the community as the reason for the elimination of the blockchains, stating that it evaluates the security architecture of the network to ensure the security, usability, and sustainability of the chosen blockchain. 'We carefully evaluate the security architecture of the network to ensure the security, usability, and sustainability of the chosen blockchain. Our goal is to allocate resources where they can improve security and efficiency,' said Tether. This is not the first time Tether has stopped minting USDT on certain blockchains, having previously stopped on Bitcoin Cash, Kusama, and Omni Layer in 2023. The abandonment of EOS and Algorand comes two months after USDT was launched on the TON blockchain. The launch of USDT on TON was announced as a possibility to provide a new Web3 payment experience globally between peers to Telegram's 900 million monthly active users.

**Tether to Discontinue USDT Support on EOS and Algorand Blockchains**
Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, has announced that it will discontinue its support for USDT on the EOS and Algorand blockchains. According to the company, it will focus on maintaining a robust and innovative blockchain ecosystem for all its tokens, including USDT. Tether emphasized that it will continue to support blockchain networks that prioritize security, usability, and sustainability. The company will allocate its resources to the best-performing networks that can provide the highest level of security and efficiency. After a comprehensive review, Tether decided to discontinue its support for EOS and Algorand applications. Although the number of blockchains supporting USDT will decrease, Tether will continue to support community-beneficial protocols. The withdrawal support will last for one year, with the EOS and Algorand USDT minting to be halted on June 24, 2024. For the next 12 months, USDT withdrawal processes on EOS and Algorand will continue to be supported.

**Uncertainty looms for crypto industry and stablecoins ahead of MiCA deadline**
The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in the European Union is approaching its deadline on June 30, which will require stablecoin issuers to align their operations with certain requirements. However, the regulation's effectiveness is uncertain, with some experts expressing concerns about the complexity and potential risks of the requirements. Binance has acknowledged that the regulation could present challenges, and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has criticized the regulation, stating that it contains problematic requirements that could make EU-licensed stablecoins vulnerable and risky to operate.

**Scientists Expect Rare Explosion in Space Before September 2024**
Scientists at NASA expect a rare phenomenon to occur in the sky before September 2024, which can be observed from Earth without the need for special equipment. The event is caused by the star T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), which is expected to explode and become one of the brightest objects in the night sky for a short time. This explosion will provide astronomers with the opportunity to collect data on a type of star called a classical nova. According to Sputnik, this type of event occurs only once every 80 years, and the last explosion occurred in 1946, which suggests that the recurrent nova T CrB is about to explode again. Astronomer Rebecca Hounsell explains that 'there are some periodic stars with very short cycles, but we don't often see repeated outbursts in a person's lifetime, and it's rare for them to occur so close to our solar system.' The nova T CrB is a peculiar type of star that belongs to a binary star system containing the remains of a collapsed star similar to the Sun, called a white dwarf, and a red giant companion.

**Tether Revolutionizes Stablecoin Market with New Gold-Backed Token**
Tether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin, has launched a new gold-backed stablecoin called Alloy (aUSDT) linked to the US dollar. The new token can be acquired on the Alloy by Tether platform and is backed by XAUT, Tether's token representing physical gold, but its value is linked to the US dollar. The token is a synthetic dollar designed to mimic its value and functionality, but not directly backed by it. The company stated that Alloy by Tether provides long-term holders with the opportunity to maintain exposure to gold while also obtaining a Tether-referenced dollar asset for daily payments and the economy. Paolo Ardoino, Tether's CEO, confirmed that Alloy by Tether will become part of a real-world asset tokenization platform launching at the end of 2024.

**AMDC to Develop Plan to Stabilize Disaster Zone in Guillén Colony**
The Municipal District Council (AMDC) of Tegucigalpa will develop a plan to stabilize the disaster zone in the Guillén colony in the coming days. The plan includes the construction of channels, containment walls, and drainage holes to safely drain water. The AMDC is monitoring the area to prevent any further disasters, such as the one that occurred in September 2022, which caused over 100 homes to collapse. The authorities have evacuated families from the area and are recommending that neighbors stay away from the zone. The AMDC has developed emergency mitigation works with the support of the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), including the installation of nylon tents and the construction of drainage channels to prevent further landslides. The goal is to avoid putting more families at risk in the sector.

**‘Catastrophic landslide' wipes out chunk of critical mountain highway linking two US states**
A significant portion of the Teton Pass highway, a critical link between eastern Idaho towns and Jackson, Wyoming, has collapsed due to a landslide. The incident occurred on June 8, 2024, after a mudslide and concerns about a crack and drop in the road. The road was closed at the time of the collapse. Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon described the landslide as 'catastrophic'. The extent of the damage was captured in footage published by the Wyoming Transportation Department. The road's reconstruction timeline is currently unknown, as it is a highly used commuter route for those who work in Jackson but live in Idaho.

**NASA Tests New Spacesuits for Artemis-3 Mission to the Moon**
NASA astronauts tested the new spacesuits for the Artemis-3 mission, which will send humans back to the moon. The suits were developed by Axiom Space and tested in a simulated environment at SpaceX's headquarters in Texas. The tests included checking how astronauts would perform in the Human Landing System (HLS) of the SpaceX Starship, which will be used for the moon mission. The suits were tested by astronauts Doug Wheelock and Peggy Whitson, who wore the suits and tested the portable life support system, as well as the suit's ability to be put on and taken off in a cramped space. The HLS was also inspected by SpaceX and NASA engineers to optimize the placement of mobility aids such as handrails and tethers. The ultimate goal is to send humans to Mars. The Artemis-3 mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than September 2026.

**Crypto Ecosystem Offers Innovations, but Structural Weaknesses and Risks Make it Unstable**
The crypto ecosystem offers innovations, but structural weaknesses and risks make it unstable, according to economist Nurgul Akimova. Despite a significant decline in capitalization in 2022, the crypto industry remains a multi-billion-dollar industry covering thousands of cryptocurrencies. The concept of decentralization aims to replace traditional financial institutions and central banks with anonymous validators. However, recent events, such as the FTX collapse, have revealed significant discrepancies between theory and practice, exposing structural vulnerabilities. The main elements of the crypto ecosystem include decentralized cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are based on blockchain technology and decentralized validation, reducing the role of intermediaries. However, market capitalization fluctuates significantly, creating risks for investors. Stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Binance USD (BUSD), play a central role in the crypto ecosystem, ensuring stability by linking to fiat currencies. In June 2023, the total turnover of stablecoins exceeded that of other crypto assets. Smart contracts, first implemented on the Ethereum platform in 2015, allow for automated financial operations on the blockchain. DeFi platforms, such as Uniswap and Compound, offer lending, borrowing, and trading services using smart contracts. However, DeFi systems are heavily dependent on central oracles for data, creating additional risks. Structural weaknesses include fragmentation and overload, instability of stablecoins, and false decentralization, which increases risks for both investors and financial stability as a whole.

**JPMorgan Predicts Stablecoin Bill May Pass Before 2024 Elections**

The bill, known as the 'Clarity for Stablecoin Payments Act', has the potential to be passed before the elections. According to JPMorgan, the new regulations may favor stablecoins that comply with US standards, potentially reducing the dominance of non-compliant stablecoins like Tether. The report also suggests that the Federal Reserve is less likely to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) after a House bill last month prohibited the bank from doing so. JPMorgan analysts believe that new regulatory measures are likely to hinder the development of a CBDC by the Federal Reserve.

**European Regulation on Stablecoins Worries Tether CEO**
The European regulation on crypto-assets (MiCA) will be harmonized at the European level starting from December 30, 2024. This regulation includes a set of rules that concerns the CEO of Tether (USDT). Several cryptocurrency exchange platforms have announced the possibility of stopping listing stablecoins that do not comply with European rules. A stablecoin is a digital asset that is pegged to a fiat currency such as the euro or dollar. The value of a stablecoin must align with the value of its underlying asset. The promise is to maintain parity, for example 1 USDT = 1 dollar. Binance has announced that it will implement restrictions on its product offerings to prevent users from accessing new products or services involving unauthorized stablecoins as of June 30. The official list of stablecoins that will continue to be listed is not yet available, but USDT may potentially be removed from some cryptocurrency exchange platforms.
