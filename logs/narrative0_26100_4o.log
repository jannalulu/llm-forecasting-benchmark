NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers spread out before them.

NATE  
So, did Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspend his 2024 presidential campaign before September 24, 2024?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 15.75%. Despite his strong independent run and significant fundraising, our data showed his commitment to influence the election outcome was unwavering.

NATE  
Exactly. His polling at 9.5% and the $98 million raised indicated a serious contender. Dropping out would have been a strategic misstep, especially with Biden and Trump neck and neck.

PHILIP  
Right. The dynamics of this election are fascinating. Kennedy's presence reshapes the landscape, and his decision to stay in the race aligns with our forecasts.

NATE  
Indeed. It’s a testament to the accuracy of our models. The unpredictability of politics remains predictable, in its own way.

They nod, acknowledging the power of data-driven foresight.
