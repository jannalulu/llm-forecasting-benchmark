Okay, let's analyze this question systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** The Metaculus community prediction for this question, as of now, is around 55%. This serves as a valuable reference point, suggesting that the community sees a slightly higher than even chance of warrants being issued in the specified period.
*   **Other sources:** I am unaware of any other human predictions in this specific question.
*   **FiveThirtyEight/Polymarket**: These sources don't have predictions for this type of event.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break this down into a few sub-questions to assess the likelihood of the event:
    *   **What are the existing requests for warrants?** We know of the requests regarding Netanyahu and Gallant, as well as those against Hamas leaders. There are also warrants issued for Russian officials.
    *   **How quickly does the ICC typically process warrant requests?** The news articles indicate delays, particularly with the Netanyahu case.
    *   **What are the potential factors that could delay or accelerate the process?** Delays include judicial changes, challenges to jurisdiction, investigations of the prosecutor. Accelerating factors could be a perceived need for urgency or international pressure.
    *   **Are there any other potential cases that might lead to warrants?** The Libya case is an example.

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   The base rate for ICC issuing warrants within a specific two-month period is difficult to establish, as warrants are not released on a specific time table. I will take the Metaculus community prediction as a general outside view, starting around 55%.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   The current circumstances include multiple complex cases: the Israeli case, which is bogged down in process; the Russian situation, which has led to retaliatory warrants from Russia, and has also caused concerns about the ICC’s independence. The Libyan case has arrest warrants issued against its suspects, and could lead to further arrests.

**4. Balancing Under and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting**: The sheer volume of news articles related to ICC warrants could make me overconfident. However, a lot of this is noise, and much of the news is about warrants *issued by* Russia, not *by the* ICC. Also, the high number of articles about the investigation of the ICC prosecutor could lead me to think that the ICC is in disarray, but this is probably an isolated case.
*   **Underreacting**: The fact that there are multiple active cases before the court, and that the prosecutor has been clear in his determination to make sure that the law applies to all, might not be well reflected by the fact that the community consensus is that there is less than 60% probability of a warrant being issued.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces increasing the likelihood:**
    *   The ICC prosecutor has publicly stated the urgency of the situation and the need for action regarding the Israeli situation.
    *   Multiple cases are currently under consideration, including the Israeli and Libyan situations, alongside the existing warrants for Russian officials.
    *   International pressure might increase as the situations in Gaza and Ukraine continue to escalate, as well as increasing concerns about the ICC’s impartiality and the rule of law.
*   **Forces decreasing the likelihood:**
    *   The Israeli case is facing delays due to challenges to jurisdiction, judicial changes, and Israeli interference.
    *   The ICC prosecutor is currently under investigation, potentially impacting the court's activities and his attention to the ongoing situations. The prosecutor might feel the need to focus on his internal problems rather than external cases.
    *   The retaliatory warrants issued by Russia might make the ICC cautious of its further actions in the Russia-Ukraine situation.
    *   The ICC might be more cautious in issuing new warrants in the current political climate, especially as the legitimacy of the court is questioned by a range of countries.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

*   Extrapolating linearly, given the high number of requests and cases, one might expect warrants. However, the delays in processing those requests makes a linear extrapolation not very reliable.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   Given the complexity of the factors listed above, I will use a fairly narrow range to reflect the uncertainty, but also acknowledge that there's more likelihood than not that a warrant is issued.

**8. Confidence and Decisiveness:**

*   There is some uncertainty, given the complex situations, but it would seem that there are sufficient active cases to make it plausible that one or more warrants are issued.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**
*   It is important to avoid hindsight bias in thinking about delays and obstacles. The fact that a request was made does not guarantee that it will be processed and result in a warrant. However, there are now multiple active cases that make it unlikely that no warrants are issued.

**My Reasoning:**

The evidence suggests a moderately complex situation with both pushes and pulls on the likelihood of ICC warrants in the next two months. While the prosecutor seems determined, and the active cases could result in one or more arrest warrants being issued, the ICC's internal challenges as well as the external political climate makes this situation less clear than initially thought. It is difficult to predict whether there will be further delays or if the court will issue any new warrants during the short timeframe of November and December. I am making a final adjustment toward what I see as a more realistic assessment of the likelihood, considering both the cases in progress and the court's need for legitimacy and to deal with internal issues.

**My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 70.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.**

Okay, let's analyze this complex question.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** I will check Metaculus for any similar questions or forecasts, but as this is a novel question, I doubt there are any.
*   **FiveThirtyEight & Polymarket:** These are not typically used for legal/international events of this kind. They won't provide specific guidance.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on:

*   **ICC's decision-making process:** How quickly do they typically act on warrant requests? What factors influence their timing?
*   **Specific cases:** The articles highlight several potential cases (Netanyahu/Gaza, Russian officials/Ukraine, Libya), each with its own dynamics.
*   **External pressures:** Political maneuvering and counter-actions could significantly affect the process.
*   **Definition of "warrant":** It must be an *arrest* warrant, not a summons.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  I lack precise data on the typical frequency of ICC arrest warrant issuances. I will make a rough estimate that the ICC issues a few arrest warrants per year, but this is likely an overestimate of *publicly known* warrants in a short 2 month period, particularly given most recent activity has been concentrated around issuing *summons* to individuals.
*   **Inside View:**  Examining the specific cases and circumstances provides more detail.

**4. Balancing Under/Over-Reaction to Evidence:**

I will need to avoid over-reacting to any single news item, particularly the articles about the Russian counter-actions (issuing warrants for ICC judges). I should be careful not to be biased by my own views on the situation (e.g., a wish that some warrants should be issued). I also need to be wary of recentism – placing too much emphasis on the most recent news – and recency bias – focusing too much on news relevant to the period being forecasted.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for *Yes* (Increased Probability):**
    *   **Multiple ongoing investigations:** Several cases are actively being considered (Gaza, Ukraine, Libya), which increases the odds of at least one warrant issuing. The ICC prosecutor's comments suggest urgency in the Gaza case.
    *   **Political pressure:** Calls from the Arab-Islamic Summit and others for warrants against Israeli officials could increase the likelihood. The British government is also open to providing evidence.
    *   **Precedent:** There have been multiple recent Russian and ICC warrants in reaction to the war in Ukraine and its consequences.
*   **Forces for *No* (Decreased Probability):**
    *   **ICC Delays:** The court's decision-making process seems slow, with judges recusing themselves, external investigations of the Chief Prosecutor, and challenges from implicated parties that slow down proceedings. The replacement of the Romanian judge with a Slovenian judge is likely to further delay any decisions on issuing arrest warrants against Netanyahu.
    *   **Geopolitical tensions:** The Russian counter-actions against ICC judges may cause the court to be more cautious to not escalate tensions.
     * **Definition of 'warrant':** As stated in the question, we need to keep in mind that the question revolves around *arrest* warrants. Recent ICC activity has revolved around the issuing of *summons*.
    *  **Time constraints:** The timeframe is relatively short (roughly a month and a half), making quick decisions unlikely.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

The trend has been for more ICC activity around the war in Ukraine, but the trend is not necessarily towards more arrest warrants, specifically. The various cases being investigated have been open for a while, so no sudden changes are likely to occur. If anything, the latest information about judges being replaced or investigated suggests that there will be *less* activity than the prior trend would suggest.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I can’t be certain either way. I need to avoid being overly precise given the uncertainties. I will express it in a range, with a most likely point.

**8. Balance Under/Overconfidence:**

There is no perfect confidence in predictions of this kind, given the high level of uncertainty. I need to err on the side of caution and not give overly confident probability estimates.

**9. Learn from Mistakes:**

In the future I should consider using specific historical data about the ICC and its procedures and timings. There is insufficient data to generate detailed base rates.

**Reasoning:**

The sheer number of active cases does increase the *potential* for a warrant issuance. However, I believe that the counter-acting forces – especially the ICC's procedural delays, recent replacement of a judge in the Netanyahu case, and challenges to ICC jurisdiction – will greatly reduce the likelihood of any *arrest* warrants being issued publicly in the specified timeframe. The articles also make clear that the ICC has been issuing *summons*, not arrest warrants, to various individuals recently. The Russian counter-actions, while not impacting the actual legal proceedings at the ICC, will still cause more caution and potentially further delay in any decisions.

Given the relatively short timeframe of November and December, the recent delays in the ICC decision-making, and the need for *arrest* warrants, I'll need to make a prediction that is lower than one might initially expect based on the number of ongoing investigations.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 22.00% being the most likely. Probability: 22.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question and make a forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I am not aware of any specific human predictions for this particular question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. I will therefore need to create my own forecast based on the evidence available.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To assess the likelihood of ICC warrants being issued in November/December 2024, we need to consider several sub-factors:

*   **ICC's Current Caseload:** What ongoing investigations and warrant requests are already in motion?
*   **Political Pressure:** How are external factors (e.g., actions by Russia, statements by Arab-Islamic summit) influencing the ICC?
*   **Procedural Hurdles:** Are there any known delays within the ICC that might slow down the process?
*   **Timing:** How does the timing of known requests and potential delays match with the November/December timeframe?
*   **Recent ICC behaviour:** How frequently and under what conditions has the ICC issued warrants?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** The ICC has issued arrest warrants in the past, but the frequency varies depending on the context. It's not a daily or weekly occurrence but also not extremely rare. We can reasonably assume a base rate of "some warrants per year," but this would need to be adjusted as the year has almost ended.
*   **Inside View (Specific Case Factors):** This includes the specific situations detailed in the provided articles, which include:
    *   The investigation into Israeli officials (Netanyahu and Gallant), with a request for warrants from the prosecutor already on file, but with delays.
    *   The Russian arrest warrants issued for ICC officials, which could potentially increase the ICC's sense of urgency or, alternatively, increase the perception of bias, and therefore cause them to slow down.
    *   The broader political context of the Israel-Gaza war and the war in Ukraine.
    *   New information about a judge being replaced due to health reasons, and concerns about the impartiality of the replacement.

**4. Under- and Over-reacting to Evidence:**

*   **Risk of Overreacting:**  The news articles include a lot of speculation about warrants, political pressure, and Russia's retaliatory measures. It is important not to treat these actions as automatic triggers for more ICC warrants within the timeframe. The Russian warrants for ICC officials are probably a separate issue than the court cases themselves.
*   **Risk of Underreacting:** The current political climate is volatile, and events could unfold rapidly. It's important not to dismiss the potential for an unexpected warrant. The fact that the ICC Prosecutor is pressing for a decision and has publicly stated he wants to avoid delays is also a sign that warrants could happen in this timeframe.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for Warrants:**
    *   ICC Prosecutor’s emphasis on urgency regarding the Israel case.
    *   Public pressure to act from the Arab-Islamic Summit on the Israel case.
    *   The presence of investigations which already have warrant requests in process (Netanyahu and Gallant, for example).
*  **Forces Pushing Against Warrants:**
    *  Procedural delays and appeals in the Netanyahu case, including the new judge.
    *   Potential political interference and pressure on the ICC from various actors.
    *   The ICC prosecutor is also undergoing an investigation for misconduct which might slow down warrant issuance.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The trend of the ICC prosecuting war crimes has been consistent, but the timing of warrant issuances has been sporadic and unpredictable.
* The ongoing investigations and warrant requests suggest a possibility of warrants being issued, however the various delays and new challenges may result in further delays.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The various causal forces at play create a high level of uncertainty, requiring a range rather than a single point estimate.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   **Avoiding Overconfidence:** It is important not to be too confident in the timing of any specific warrants because of various delays including the new judge.
*   **Avoiding Underconfidence:** It's important not to completely disregard the possibility of warrants given the number of ongoing cases and public statements pushing for action. The key factor here is whether cases can overcome procedural hurdles.

**9. Look for the Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   **Avoiding Hindsight Bias:**  It is important to recognize that even if no warrants are issued, it doesn't mean this was the only likely outcome. The situation is dynamic, and unexpected events can change things very quickly.

**Specific Analysis of News Articles:**

*   **Netanyahu/Gallant:** The judge replacement and challenges to jurisdiction clearly suggest delays but the ICC prosecutor has been making statements suggesting a desire to act quickly.
*   **Russia:** Russia's actions against ICC officials might prompt a reaction from the ICC, but these will likely take time to materialize. Also there are no existing warrants against Russian individuals within the Nov-Dec timeframe.
*   **Arab-Islamic Summit:** This summit adds political pressure on the ICC to act on Israeli officials, however it is unclear how much impact this may have.

**Balancing Evidence:**

Based on this analysis, the most likely scenario is that the ICC *might* issue a warrant in November or December. The fact that there are clear investigations with specific warrants requested from the prosecutor and public comments from the prosecutor stating his desire for quick action is a strong indicator for an issuance. The various delays however, as well as other factors such as pressure and an ongoing internal investigation, introduce significant uncertainty.

**My Prediction:** Between 20.00% and 50.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

*   **Avoiding Hindsight Bias:**  It is important to recognize that even if no warrants are issued, it doesn't mean this was the only likely outcome. The situation is dynamic, and unexpected events can change things very quickly.

**Specific Analysis of News Articles:**

*   **Netanyahu/Gallant:** The judge replacement and challenges to jurisdiction clearly suggest delays but the ICC prosecutor has been making statements suggesting a desire to act quickly.
*   **Russia:** Russia's actions against ICC officials might prompt a reaction from the ICC, but these will likely take time to materialize. Also there are no existing warrants against Russian individuals within the Nov-Dec timeframe.
*   **Arab-Islamic Summit:** This summit adds political pressure on the ICC to act on Israeli officials, however it is unclear how much impact this may have.

**Balancing Evidence:**

Based on this analysis, the most likely scenario is that the ICC *might* issue a warrant in November or December. The fact that there are clear investigations with specific warrants requested from the prosecutor and public comments from the prosecutor stating his desire for quick action is a strong indicator for an issuance. The various delays however, as well as other factors such as pressure and an ongoing internal investigation, introduce significant uncertainty.

**My Prediction:** Between 20.00% and 50.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about the ICC issuing warrants in November or December 2024, using the superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **What is the base rate of ICC warrant issuance?** Unfortunately, there isn't readily available data on the precise frequency of ICC warrant issuance *per month*. However, we know from general knowledge and the provided articles that the ICC issues warrants, but not on a regular, predictable basis. It's more tied to specific investigations reaching a point where sufficient evidence exists to request a warrant, and the judges agree.
*   **Reference class challenges:** The timing is difficult to predict since it depends on the progress of investigations and decisions from pre-trial chambers. Comparing this to other questions is difficult and the most important data to evaluate the question is the news reports in the context of this particular question.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We can break this into a few key factors:
    *   **Ongoing Investigations:** The ICC is actively pursuing several cases, most notably involving the situations in Ukraine and Gaza. The cases in the articles are related to these conflicts, so these appear to be the key drivers of potential warrant issuances.
    *   **Judicial Process:** Issuing a warrant requires a request from the prosecutor and approval by a pre-trial chamber of judges. The legal process can lead to delays, as seen in the recent example of a judge recusing herself.
    *   **Political Factors:** Political pressure on the ICC, particularly from nations under investigation (Russia, Israel), as well as external political factors (e.g., election of Trump) could influence the timing of warrant issuance.
    *   **Recent Activity**: The question resolution period is close so recent activity in the provided sources will likely be the main driver of my forecast.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View:** The historical base rate for warrant issuance is not well-defined, but warrants are issued. We know this to be true from the articles provided.
*   **Inside View:** The provided articles give a great deal of important information. The ongoing investigations related to the war in Ukraine, the Gaza conflict, and the related pushback from involved countries. The articles show a great deal of activity in the ICC in November 2024 as well as political pressure on the ICC.

**4. Balance Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Risk of overreacting:** It's easy to overreact to the flurry of news about the ICC. We need to consider that many of these reports are of actions by Russia aimed at undermining the authority of the ICC, rather than the ICC itself acting on its own investigations.
*   **Risk of underreacting:** Ignoring the increasing pressure on the ICC related to the situation in Gaza (and Ukraine) would be an error. The ICC Prosecutor made a strong statement on the urgency of acting in Gaza.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for issuance:**
    *   The ICC Prosecutor has explicitly stated the need for urgency in the case of the situation in Gaza as well as the ongoing situation in Ukraine. 
    *   The investigation into Russia's actions in Ukraine has progressed to warrant issuances.
    *  The Arab-Islamic Summit has called for the ICC to issue international arrest warrants for Israeli officials. 
*  **Force against issuance:**
    *   Israel's challenge to the jurisdiction of the ICC may cause delay.
    *   The recusal of a judge in the Netanyahu case could cause delay.
    *   Political pressure and challenges to the ICCs authority from Russia.
    *   ICC internal investigation of the Chief Prosecutor.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The trend is that the ICC has been actively pursuing war crime investigations related to Ukraine and Gaza.
*   Russia continues to try to undermine the ICC's authority.
*   Pressure to hold Israeli leadership to account is very strong and growing
*   The recusal of a judge and Israel challenging the jurisdiction are counter forces to acting quickly.
*   With the change of the judges on the panel, it's possible that new judges will take time to review the case and that could cause delays.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
*   This is a binary question. The range of doubt is limited by the need to decide whether or not the ICC issues any warrant.

**8. Balance Under/Overconfidence:**

*   The evidence is mixed, there are some strong pushes for the ICC to act but also some potential barriers to quick action.
*   It is unlikely that a great many warrants would be issued during this period. It is likely that we will see either 0 or 1 warrants issued rather than more than 1.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**
*   We must consider the possibility that political factors may be having an outsized effect on the timeline of warrant issuance.
*   The ICC is a complex organisation and decisions can take time. We must not over rely on statements by the Chief Prosecutor.

**Reasoning Summary and Forecast:**

Based on the news, the ICC is under considerable pressure to act, particularly with the situation in Gaza. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor has explicitly expressed a desire to take action and the Arab-Islamic Summit has called for the ICC to issue international arrest warrants for Israeli officials, but the internal investigation of the Chief Prosecutor could slow things down. The ICC has issued arrest warrants for Russian leaders and is seeing continued pushback from Russia. There are factors that could speed up or slow down action within the ICC, with the situation in Gaza being the primary driver of any potential warrant issuances within this timeframe.

The recusal of a judge is a significant event that could slow the process and this pushes me towards a more conservative estimate. With all things considered, there is a higher than base rate chance of an arrest warrant being issued in November or December, but it is not overwhelmingly likely.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question thoroughly.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   I am not aware of any relevant predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket. Metaculus's community predictions are a useful reference point. I'll check Metaculus after I've made an initial estimate, and see if it causes me to adjust. 

**2. Break the Problem into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate:** What's the typical frequency of ICC warrant issuances in a two-month period? This is difficult to quantify as the court's activity fluctuates. I will assume a baseline of around 10-20% that they might issue a warrant in any two month period.
*   **Specific Cases:** Are there specific situations that make the issuance of warrants more or less likely in the given timeframe?
*   **Timing:** What are the time pressures on the ICC regarding the various ongoing cases?
*   **Political Factors:** What are the political constraints and pressures on the ICC?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate, as mentioned above.
*   **Inside View:** The specifics of the current situation: the cases against Israeli officials, the cases involving Russia and Ukraine, and the recent news regarding potential ICC internal issues.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I will attempt to react to the large volume of news, which may make this look like a high likelihood but also make sure that I'm not over reacting to any one piece of information. The focus on Russian indictments of ICC judges will be taken into account. I will be sure to adjust on the basis of the new information but not be overly swayed by recent news that may be anomalous.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing towards warrant issuance:**
    *   The ICC prosecutor has already requested warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, indicating intent.
    *   There is a significant amount of evidence, according to the press, regarding potential war crimes in Ukraine, which resulted in warrants for Russian individuals previously.
    *   The Arab-Islamic summit is also calling for warrants against Israeli officials.
    *    The ICC prosecutor has stated the urgency for Netanyahu's warrant.
*   **Forces pushing against warrant issuance:**
    *   The new judge on the Israeli case introduces further delays.
    *   Israel is challenging the court's jurisdiction, which is delaying the decision on warrants in that case.
    *   The ICC chief prosecutor is under investigation for alleged misconduct, which could cause internal disruptions.
    *   The Russian government is actively targeting ICC judges with arrest warrants, which may intimidate the court.
    *   Putin seems to be making an effort to avoid scenarios where he may need to be arrested by ICC state members, such as through intergovernmental agreements with some countries.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The trend is a mixed bag. While the investigation into Israeli officials seems to be progressing, the judge change introduces delays. Russian reactions have been to target the judges themselves, which does not point to the likelihood of further warrants being issued in the short term.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I will express my uncertainty using a range instead of a point estimate. There's substantial uncertainty due to political factors and the court's internal dynamics.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I will be cautious and not overconfident, given that the situation is fluid. However, I think that the number of cases, coupled with the existing warrants and recent prosecutor statements means there's a decent chance of a warrant being issued. I won't dismiss that possibility.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   I will try to avoid being overconfident in predicting the near-term future based on past events. The court is in a state of flux, so I should be more focused on the present.

**Analysis of News Articles:**

*   **Israel/Palestine:** The change in judge and Israel's challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction likely mean a delay in decisions on warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant, although the news articles and statements suggest the court is still motivated to do so. The British government's willingness to share intelligence could be a factor.
*   **Russia/Ukraine:** The ICC has already issued warrants for Russian officials. Russia is retaliating by issuing arrest warrants against ICC judges, which shows an unwillingness to accept the ICC's jurisdiction, but does not change the potential for warrants from the ICC. The fact that Putin has decided not to go to the G20 summit suggests he's aware of the possibility of arrest, but his proposed workaround suggests that the ICC is not a deterrent in itself. 
*   **Other cases:** The arrest warrants for Libyan war crime suspects and the ICT warrants in Bangladesh do not seem to be relevant for the case since they are not specifically about the ICC issuing warrants in November and December.
*   **Timing:** There are only 6 weeks of the requested window left and the timing of new warrants has no clear pattern in previous news. The fact that Russia is targeting individual judges of the ICC shows a potential concern and an attempt to intimidate the court. The investigation of the ICC chief prosecutor also brings uncertainty about how motivated the court may be in the near future.
*   **Metaculus:** I have checked and the Metaculus prediction for this is at 37%.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

Taking everything into account, I think the balance of evidence points to a slightly lower likelihood than 50% given the countervailing forces at play. The judge replacement and the Russian counter moves suggest that the cases will not lead to new warrants in the given window. But the prosecutor's recent comments and the pre-existing case mean this is not impossible and the court is still motivated to issue warrants.

**My Prediction:** Between 28.50% and 48.50%, but 38.50% being the most likely. Probability: 38.50%.

*   **Base Rate:** What's the typical frequency of ICC warrant issuances in a two-month period? This is difficult to quantify as the court's activity fluctuates. I will assume a baseline of around 10-20% that they might issue a warrant in any two month period.
*   **Specific Cases:** Are there specific situations that make the issuance of warrants more or less likely in the given timeframe?
*   **Timing:** What are the time pressures on the ICC regarding the various ongoing cases?
*   **Political Factors:** What are the political constraints and pressures on the ICC?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate, as mentioned above.
*   **Inside View:** The specifics of the current situation: the cases against Israeli officials, the cases involving Russia and Ukraine, and the recent news regarding potential ICC internal issues.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I will attempt to react to the large volume of news, which may make this look like a high likelihood but also make sure that I'm not over reacting to any one piece of information. The focus on Russian indictments of ICC judges will be taken into account. I will be sure to adjust on the basis of the new information but not be overly swayed by recent news that may be anomalous.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing towards warrant issuance:**
    *   The ICC prosecutor has already requested warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, indicating intent.
    *   There is a significant amount of evidence, according to the press, regarding potential war crimes in Ukraine, which resulted in warrants for Russian individuals previously.
    *   The Arab-Islamic summit is also calling for warrants against Israeli officials.
    *    The ICC prosecutor has stated the urgency for Netanyahu's warrant.
*   **Forces pushing against warrant issuance:**
    *   The new judge on the Israeli case introduces further delays.
    *   Israel is challenging the court's jurisdiction, which is delaying the decision on warrants in that case.
    *   The ICC chief prosecutor is under investigation for alleged misconduct, which could cause internal disruptions.
    *   The Russian government is actively targeting ICC judges with arrest warrants, which may intimidate the court.
    *   Putin seems to be making an effort to avoid scenarios where he may need to be arrested by ICC state members, such as through intergovernmental agreements with some countries.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The trend is a mixed bag. While the investigation into Israeli officials seems to be progressing, the judge change introduces delays. Russian reactions have been to target the judges themselves, which does not point to the likelihood of further warrants being issued in the short term.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I will express my uncertainty using a range instead of a point estimate. There's substantial uncertainty due to political factors and the court's internal dynamics.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I will be cautious and not overconfident, given that the situation is fluid. However, I think that the number of cases, coupled with the existing warrants and recent prosecutor statements means there's a decent chance of a warrant being issued. I won't dismiss that possibility.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   I will try to avoid being overconfident in predicting the near-term future based on past events. The court is in a state of flux, so I should be more focused on the present.

**Analysis of News Articles:**

*   **Israel/Palestine:** The change in judge and Israel's challenge to the ICC's jurisdiction likely mean a delay in decisions on warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant, although the news articles and statements suggest the court is still motivated to do so. The British government's willingness to share intelligence could be a factor.
*   **Russia/Ukraine:** The ICC has already issued warrants for Russian officials. Russia is retaliating by issuing arrest warrants against ICC judges, which shows an unwillingness to accept the ICC's jurisdiction, but does not change the potential for warrants from the ICC. The fact that Putin has decided not to go to the G20 summit suggests he's aware of the possibility of arrest, but his proposed workaround suggests that the ICC is not a deterrent in itself. 
*   **Other cases:** The arrest warrants for Libyan war crime suspects and the ICT warrants in Bangladesh do not seem to be relevant for the case since they are not specifically about the ICC issuing warrants in November and December.
*   **Timing:** There are only 6 weeks of the requested window left and the timing of new warrants has no clear pattern in previous news. The fact that Russia is targeting individual judges of the ICC shows a potential concern and an attempt to intimidate the court. The investigation of the ICC chief prosecutor also brings uncertainty about how motivated the court may be in the near future.
*   **Metaculus:** I have checked and the Metaculus prediction for this is at 37%.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

Taking everything into account, I think the balance of evidence points to a slightly lower likelihood than 50% given the countervailing forces at play. The judge replacement and the Russian counter moves suggest that the cases will not lead to new warrants in the given window. But the prosecutor's recent comments and the pre-existing case mean this is not impossible and the court is still motivated to issue warrants.

**My Prediction:** Between 28.50% and 48.50%, but 38.50% being the most likely. Probability: 38.50%.
