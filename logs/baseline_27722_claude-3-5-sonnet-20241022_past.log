Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time Frame: About 1 month (from now until October 1, 2024)

2. Key Context for Nvidia:
- Currently experiencing unprecedented growth due to AI boom
- Strong financial performance with record revenues
- High demand for their AI chips
- Currently in hiring mode rather than laying off
- Has historically been very stable with workforce
- No recent signals of financial distress

3. Market Position:
- Dominant position in AI chip market
- Strong cash reserves
- Growing demand for products
- Limited competition in their core markets

4. Tech Industry Context:
- While many tech companies have had layoffs in 2024, these were mainly companies that over-hired during COVID
- Companies central to AI boom (like Nvidia) have generally been expanding

5. Risk Factors:
- General tech industry volatility
- Possible market corrections
- Small possibility of reorganization in non-core divisions

Given Nvidia's current strong position, growth trajectory, and the short time frame, I assess the probability of layoffs being reported on TechCrunch as very low, but not zero due to potential unforeseen circumstances.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 3.50%, with 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.
