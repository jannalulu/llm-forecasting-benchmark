Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Election held on July 28, 2024
- Current date is July 31, 2024
- Question asks about concession before September 2024
- We have about one month for this to resolve

2. Key Evidence Against Concession:
- Multiple articles show González claims to have won with evidence (actas/ballot boxes)
- Opposition presents data showing González won with 67% vs Maduro's 30%
- González publicly demanding results be respected
- Strong opposition statements like "We won and everyone knows it"
- International support questioning official results
- Historical context: Venezuelan opposition typically doesn't concede to Maduro

3. Key Evidence For Possible Concession:
- Maduro controls state institutions
- Military historically backs Maduro
- Previous opposition challenges have ultimately failed
- Potential pressure/threats could force concession
- Risk of arrest or persecution

4. Critical Factors:
- González's current strong stance against conceding
- Evidence of actual vote counts in his favor
- International support for opposition
- Only 3-4 days have passed since election
- Opposition appears unified behind González
- Multiple credible sources showing opposition victory

5. Recent Developments:
- Opposition presenting evidence of victory
- International community expressing concerns
- Protests ongoing
- Both sides maintaining firm positions
- No signs of González wavering

Given that:
- González has strong evidence of victory
- International support exists
- Opposition is unified
- Short timeframe until September
- Strong public statements against conceding
- Multiple sources confirming opposition victory

The probability of González conceding appears very low. While pressure from Maduro's regime could force a concession, the current evidence and momentum strongly suggest González will maintain his position through August.

My Prediction: Between 5.20% and 12.40%, with 7.80% being the most likely. Probability: 7.80%

1. Timeline Assessment:
- Election occurred on July 28, 2024
- The question asks about concession before September 2024
- We have information up to July 31, 2024
- This gives roughly one month for potential concession

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- González claims to have won with evidence showing 67% of votes
- He has presented digitalized actas showing his victory
- He's actively demanding respect for electoral records
- Opposition coalition claims to have proof of victory
- International community expressing concerns about results
- Protests ongoing since July 29

3. Key Factors Against Concession:
- González has strong evidence supporting his victory claim
- International support for transparency
- Opposition unity behind his claim of victory
- Active protests supporting his position
- Historical precedent of Venezuelan opposition not conceding to disputed results

4. Key Factors Supporting Potential Concession:
- Maduro controls state institutions
- History of Maduro maintaining power despite electoral challenges
- Potential pressure or threats against González
- Limited international observation
- Maduro's control over military and security forces

5. Similar Historical Situations:
- Previous Venezuelan elections showed opposition candidates rarely conceding to Maduro

- Opposition claims to have proof showing González won with 67% vs Maduro's 30%
- González has explicitly stated "We won and everyone knows it"

4. Critical Factors:
- González is actively contesting results with evidence
- Opposition is united behind González
- International community is supporting González's claims

5. Recent Developments:

Given that González has substantial evidence of his victory, strong international support, and is actively contesting the results with no signs of backing down, combined with the short timeframe until September 1, a concession appears highly unlikely unless there's severe coercion or threat.

- Opposition has presented evidence of their claimed victory
- International community expressing concerns about election integrity
