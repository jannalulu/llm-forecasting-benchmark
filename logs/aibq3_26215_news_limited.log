**Ex-Trump Adviser Wants Him to Reverse 30-Year-Old Nuclear Weapons Policy**
Former White House National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, who served under Donald Trump's administration, has written an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine, urging Trump to reverse a 30-year-old nuclear weapons policy. O'Brien argues that the US should resume live-testing nuclear weapons and increase production of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, the primary fissile isotopes of nuclear weapons. This comes as tensions between the US and other nations remain heightened amid Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine. Trump, who is the presumptive Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election, has not commented on the recommendations.

**US Signs New Guidelines for Nuclear Weapons Use**
The US has signed new guidelines for the use of nuclear weapons, which take into account the realities of the new nuclear era. According to Pranay Vaddi, a special assistant to the US President, the guidelines emphasize the need to consider the growth and diversity of China's nuclear arsenal, as well as the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea simultaneously. The US is concerned that by 2035, China will increase its nuclear warheads to 1500, which will change the balance of power established by the 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The US is also considering the possibility of reviewing the treaty in 2026, when the current agreements expire. According to Vaddi, the US is willing to consider China's proposals for not being the first to use nuclear weapons. The US is also restoring its infrastructure for producing new nuclear warheads, which was damaged during the 2022 nuclear accident. The US has produced around 3800 nuclear warheads over the past 30-40 years, but the Ministry of Energy has established a minimum service life of 45 years for nuclear warheads.

**The Prolongation of the Ukraine War is Flirting with a Nuclear Catastrophe**
The prolongation of the Ukraine war is flirting with a nuclear catastrophe. The probability of a nuclear catastrophe is low, but it is still present. Therefore, de-escalation is necessary. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for three years, with hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides. The West has been supporting Ukraine with financial aid, military advice, and modern weapons, hoping to push Russia back to its 2014 borders. This is an illusion that cannot be put into words. Similarly, the claim by Western politicians that Putin will take over more of Europe if he is not defeated in Ukraine is unfounded and lacks evidence. The recent attacks on Russian nuclear warning radar stations are particularly irresponsible and bring us closer to a nuclear war. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has announced an 18% increase in military spending in Europe and Canada in 2024, with two-thirds going to US manufacturers. Meanwhile, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons has announced that global spending on nuclear weapons will increase by 13% in 2023, with the US leading the way. The US has increased its spending on nuclear weapons by 45% over the past five years, followed by the UK with 43%. The article concludes that it is time to change the policy towards Ukraine and stop the escalation before it is too late.

**Global Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Update: A Growing Concern**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the nine nuclear-armed countries, including the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, have continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals and deployed new nuclear weapons in 2023. As of January 2024, there were approximately 9,585 nuclear warheads in military stockpiles, with around 3,904 deployed on ballistic missiles and aircraft, a 60% increase from January 2023. The remaining warheads were stored in central storage facilities. Most of these warheads belong to Russia or the US, but China is believed to have some warheads on high alert for the first time. India, Pakistan, and North Korea are also seeking to acquire the ability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles, which Russia, France, the UK, and the US already possess, and China has recently acquired. This could lead to a rapid increase in deployed warheads and the potential for countries to threaten to destroy a much larger number of targets.

**Study: Humanity is at Risk of a Devastating Nuclear War**
According to Dr. Matthew Bon, a professor of energy, national security, and international politics at Harvard University, the world is at risk of a devastating nuclear war that cannot be avoided. Bon notes that the experts and prominent figures who played a crucial role in preventing a nuclear catastrophe are nearing the end of their careers and are no longer in power. He highlights the ongoing tensions between nations, including the threats of nuclear weapons use, such as those from Moscow during its war with Ukraine, China's development of missile launch facilities, North Korea's continued nuclear tests, Iran's pursuit of its nuclear program, and the ongoing tensions on the Pakistan-India border. The US is also considering the possibility of enhancing its nuclear arsenal to keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence and hypersonic technology. Bon warns that there are dark clouds looming on the nuclear horizon, with ongoing threats from all sides. He emphasizes the need for immediate talks between the US, Russia, China, and North Korea to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. According to Bon, the US, Russia, and China possess the most significant nuclear arsenals, with over 12,000 nuclear weapons worldwide by 2024. Dr. Betsy Alexis Martin, a lecturer in international peace and development studies at the University of Bradford, notes that we are currently living in a time of nuclear tension, with real risks of a nuclear war that could have devastating consequences.

**US to Return Nuclear Capability to B-52 Bombers**
The US is planning to return the ability to carry nuclear weapons to approximately 30 B-52H Stratofortress bombers. This decision is based on a congressional resolution. The planes were previously modified to carry only conventional weapons under an agreement with Russia on arms control. Lawmakers aim to increase the US nuclear arsenal due to Russia's suspension of the treaty and China's rapid expansion of strategic nuclear capabilities. Opponents of the move argue that it will complicate negotiations for a new treaty and make it harder to extend the service life of the B-52 fleet, which was first introduced during the Cold War. The relevant bill in the House of Representatives requires the US Air Force to complete the restoration of the nuclear potential of the bombers by 2029. The B-52 is the oldest bomber in the US fleet, having been in service since the 1960s. It was previously reported that some American B-52s had their nuclear bombs removed. The only nuclear weapon allowed to be carried by these planes is the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile with a W80-1 warhead.

**Global Spending on Nuclear Weapons Reaches 91.4 Billion Dollars in 2023**
The global spending on nuclear weapons has reached 91.4 billion dollars in 2023, a 13% increase from the previous year. According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), all nine nuclear-armed states have increased their spending, with the United States leading the way with 51.1 billion dollars. The report highlights that this spending could be used to combat climate change, save endangered species, and improve healthcare and education worldwide. Ican also notes that the last three countries to possess nuclear weapons - Israel, India, and Pakistan - do not provide transparent data. The organization is calling for a global week of action from September 16 to 22 with the slogan 'No money for nuclear weapons!' and is urging people to communicate what they would prefer the money to be spent on. According to Ican, in the last five years, 387 billion dollars have been spent on nuclear weapons, with an annual increase of 34%. The report also reveals that nuclear-armed states have contracts with companies worth at least 387 billion dollars to produce nuclear weapons, with some contracts extending until 2040. These profits incentivize nuclear weapon producers to spend millions of dollars to influence government policy and public opinion through think tanks.

**Sipri Report: More Operational Nuclear Weapons**
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), the number of operational nuclear weapons has increased in the past year. While some warheads are being decommissioned and the global total number of nuclear weapons is decreasing, more warheads are being kept operational. The report highlights a concerning trend, with experts expecting it to continue and even accelerate in the coming years. The nine countries possessing nuclear weapons are the USA, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, with the USA and Russia holding approximately 90% of the total nuclear warheads. Germany does not possess any nuclear weapons. The transparency of nuclear forces has decreased since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to Sipri experts.

**Ukraine war might just kickstart a nuclear energy renaissance**
The war in Ukraine may be the catalyst for a nuclear energy renaissance in the US, as the country seeks to reduce its dependence on Russian nuclear fuel imports. The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, enacted in May 2024, bans imports of low-enriched uranium from Russia, but allows for waivers to import up to 1 million pounds per year through 2028. This law also unlocks $2.7 billion in federal funding to develop domestic production of nuclear fuel. The move is seen as a national security measure, as the US seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign supplies and promote domestic production. The law could also lead to the development of new nuclear power plants, which could provide a source of clean energy for the country.

**Zakharova Calls on Poland to Reveal Information on Nord Stream Sabotage**
Russian Foreign Ministry official Maria Zakharova has called on Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski to reveal information about the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines and the role of the US in the incident. Zakharova made the statement in an interview with the newspaper Izvestia, following Sikorski's comments in The Guardian, where he said that if Russia uses nuclear weapons, the US would strike Russian military positions in the special operation zone. The explosions on the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines occurred on September 26, 2022, and Germany, Denmark, and Sweden suspected it was a targeted act of sabotage. The Russian General Prosecutor's Office has launched an investigation into an act of international terrorism. The Nord Stream AG operator has stated that it is impossible to estimate the repair timeline due to the unprecedented damage to the pipelines.
