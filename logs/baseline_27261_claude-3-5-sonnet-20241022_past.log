2025-02-12 22:39:57,789 - INFO - Question: Between August 21 and Sept 11, 2024, will the strongest geomagnetic storm have a K-index ("Kp") greater than 6 and less than or equal to 8?

Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks about geomagnetic storms during a specific period (Aug 21-Sept 11, 2024) having a Kp index >6 but ≤8.

2. Key considerations:
- This period is during the current solar cycle 25's active phase
- Solar activity has been increasing and is expected to peak in 2024-2025
- The specified time window is ~3 weeks long
- Kp >6 indicates strong geomagnetic activity
- August-September typically sees moderate solar activity

3. Historical patterns:
- Strong geomagnetic storms (Kp >6) occur several times per year during solar maximum
- The specified range (6< Kp ≤8) captures major but not extreme events
- Three-week windows during solar maximum typically have 15-25% chance of such events

4. Current conditions:
- We're near solar maximum
- Recent months have shown increased solar activity
- The timing coincides with typically active solar periods

5. Risk factors:
- Short time window limits probability
- Not all solar events result in strong geomagnetic storms
- Precise timing is difficult to predict

Considering these factors, especially the current solar cycle phase and the relatively narrow time window:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.20%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%
