**Atlético Mineiro Seeks to Break the 'Curse' of Millonarios in Copa Libertadores Final**
Atlético Mineiro has qualified for the final of the 2024 Copa Libertadores after defeating River Plate 3-0 on aggregate, with a 0-0 draw in Buenos Aires and a convincing 3-0 win at home. In their journey, Mineiro has overcome teams like Peñarol, Rosario Central, and Caracas in the group stage, San Lorenzo in the quarterfinals, and Fluminense in the semifinals. Now, they await Botafogo, their likely rival in the final, unless Peñarol pulls off a miracle. This will be Mineiro's second Copa Libertadores final in their history, having won the title in 2013. However, Millonarios, a Colombian team, has become a 'curse' for Mineiro, as they coincidentally competed in the Copa Libertadores in both 2013 and 2024. In 2013, Millonarios was eliminated in the group stage, finishing last in their group. Will Mineiro repeat their 2013 success and win the title?
