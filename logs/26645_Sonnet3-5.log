To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the evidence:

1. Historical context:
- Saudi Arabia has not had formal diplomatic relations with Israel since Israel's founding.
- There have been increasing informal ties and discussions about normalization in recent years.
- The Abraham Accords in 2020 saw several Arab states normalize relations with Israel, but Saudi Arabia did not join.

2. Recent developments:
- Multiple articles from June-July 2024 indicate ongoing negotiations between the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel for a potential normalization deal.
- The US is reportedly offering Saudi Arabia a defense agreement and nuclear technology assistance in exchange for normalizing with Israel.
- Saudi Arabia has consistently stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for normalization.

3. Obstacles:
- The ongoing conflict in Gaza is a major impediment, with Saudi Arabia calling for a ceasefire.
- Israel's current government, led by Netanyahu, is opposed to Palestinian statehood.
- There's significant public opposition in Saudi Arabia to normalizing with Israel without Palestinian concessions.

4. Timeline:
- The question asks about normalization before September 30, 2024.
- Several articles mention the US presidential election in November 2024 as a potential deadline for a deal.
- However, some sources suggest the window for a pre-election deal has closed.

5. Positive factors:
- There's clear interest from all parties in reaching an agreement.
- The US is actively mediating and offering significant incentives.
- Economic and strategic benefits for both Saudi Arabia and Israel could push them towards a deal.

6. Negative factors:
- The Gaza conflict remains unresolved.
- Fundamental disagreements persist over Palestinian statehood.
- Domestic political constraints in both Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance of normalization, but also substantial obstacles. The timeline is tight, with only about 5 months left until the deadline. While there's clear momentum, the core issues may take longer to resolve.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Current state of relations: Saudi Arabia and Israel do not currently have formal diplomatic relations, but there have been increasing signs of unofficial cooperation and warming ties in recent years.

2. Motivations for normalization: Both countries share concerns about Iran's regional influence, which provides a strategic rationale for cooperation. Economic benefits could also motivate both sides.

3. Obstacles to normalization: The Palestinian issue remains a significant obstacle, with Saudi Arabia historically insisting on progress toward Palestinian statehood before normalizing relations with Israel.

4. Recent developments:
- As of June 2024, Saudi officials were still publicly stating they would not normalize relations without progress on Palestinian statehood.
- The US has been actively trying to broker a deal, offering Saudi Arabia security guarantees and nuclear cooperation in exchange for normalization with Israel.
- Israel's ongoing war in Gaza and lack of progress on Palestinian statehood are major hurdles.

5. Time frame: The question asks about normalization before September 30, 2024, which is just over 5 months from now. This is a relatively short time frame for such a significant diplomatic shift.

6. Historical precedents: Other Arab countries like UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan normalized relations with Israel in 2020 as part of the Abraham Accords. However, Saudi Arabia is a more significant player and has been more resistant to normalization without progress on the Palestinian issue.

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Active US mediation efforts and willingness to offer incentives to both sides
- Shared strategic interests between Saudi Arabia and Israel
- Precedent of other Arab countries normalizing relations recently

Arguments for a lower probability:
- Saudi Arabia's consistent public stance on requiring Palestinian statehood progress
- Ongoing Gaza war and lack of progress on Palestinian issue
- Short time frame (about 5 months) for such a significant diplomatic shift
- Saudi concerns about domestic and regional public opinion

Balancing these considerations, I believe normalization within the next 5 months is possible but not highly likely. The ongoing war in Gaza and lack of progress on Palestinian statehood are significant obstacles in the short term. However, behind-the-scenes negotiations and strategic interests could potentially overcome these obstacles if there's strong motivation from all sides.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical context:
Saudi Arabia has not had diplomatic relations with Israel since Israel's founding. However, there have been increasing signs of warming ties in recent years.

2. Current state of negotiations:
Multiple recent reports indicate that negotiations between Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the US on normalizing relations are ongoing, though facing obstacles.

3. Saudi conditions:
Saudi Arabia has consistently stated that recognition of a Palestinian state is a precondition for normalization. This remains a major sticking point.

4. US involvement:
The Biden administration is actively trying to broker an agreement, seeing it as a potential major foreign policy achievement before the November 2024 elections.

5. Israeli position:
The current Israeli government under Netanyahu has been resistant to making concessions on Palestinian statehood, complicating negotiations.

6. Regional dynamics:
The ongoing war in Gaza has made normalization more politically difficult for Saudi Arabia, but has also increased US pressure for a deal.

7. Timeline:
The question asks about normalization before September 30, 2024, giving about 11.5 months from today for an agreement to be reached.

Weighing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Active US involvement and pressure for a deal
- Long-term strategic interests of both Saudi Arabia and Israel in normalizing relations
- Reports of ongoing negotiations and progress being made
- The relatively long timeframe (11.5 months) for reaching an agreement

For a lower probability:
- Significant obstacles remain, particularly around Palestinian statehood
- The current Israeli government's resistance to concessions
- Regional instability due to the Gaza war making normalization politically difficult
- Saudi Arabia's stated conditions not being met

Balancing these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of normalization occurring within the timeframe, but it is far from certain. The active involvement of the US and the strategic interests of both parties make it more likely than not, but the obstacles are substantial.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

3. Recent developments: The most recent news articles provided are from July 2024, which indicate that:
   a) Saudi Arabia was still insisting on the creation of a Palestinian state as a condition for normalization.
   b) The US was working on a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia that could lead to normalization with Israel.
   c) There were ongoing negotiations and diplomatic efforts to achieve normalization.

4. Obstacles: The main obstacles to normalization were:
   a) Saudi Arabia's demand for a Palestinian state
   b) The ongoing conflict in Gaza
   c) Israel's reluctance to make concessions on the Palestinian issue

5. Positive factors:
   a) US diplomatic efforts to broker a deal
   b) Shared strategic interests between Saudi Arabia and Israel (e.g., countering Iran)
   c) Potential economic benefits of normalization

6. Time factor: The question's deadline has passed, which means we now have perfect information about whether the event occurred or not.

Given that the deadline of September 30, 2024, has already passed, and there is no information in the provided articles indicating that Saudi Arabia and Israel established diplomatic relations before this date, we can conclude with certainty that the event did not occur within the specified timeframe.

- Israel's current government, led by Netanyahu, opposes Palestinian statehood.
- There is significant public opposition to normalization in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.

4. Motivations for normalization:
- Saudi Arabia seeks US security guarantees and support for its nuclear program.
- Israel wants broader acceptance in the Arab world.
- The US aims to strengthen its position in the Middle East.

Weighing the evidence:

Factors increasing the likelihood:
- Ongoing negotiations and US push for an agreement
- Mutual benefits for all parties involved
- Reports of progress in talks

Factors decreasing the likelihood:
- Consistent Saudi insistence on Palestinian statehood
- Israeli government's opposition to Palestinian statehood
- Ongoing conflict in Gaza
- Public opposition in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries

Balancing these factors, I assess that normalization before September 30, 2024 is possible but faces significant challenges.

To approach this question systematically, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Historical context:
Saudi Arabia has not had official diplomatic relations with Israel since Israel's founding. However, there have been increasing signs of warming relations in recent years.

2. Recent developments:
- Multiple reports throughout 2024 indicate ongoing negotiations between the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel aimed at normalizing relations.
- The US is reportedly offering Saudi Arabia a defense agreement and support for its civilian nuclear program in exchange for normalization with Israel.
- Saudi officials have consistently stated that recognition of a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for normalization.

3. Obstacles:
- The ongoing conflict in Gaza has complicated negotiations.
- Israel's current government, led by Netanyahu, opposes Palestinian statehood.
- There is significant public opposition to normalization in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.

4. Motivations for normalization:
- Saudi Arabia seeks US security guarantees and support for its nuclear program.
- Israel wants broader acceptance in the Arab world.
- The US aims to strengthen its position in the Middle East.

5. Timeline:
- The question asks about normalization before September 30, 2024.
- Several reports from June and July 2024 suggest negotiations are ongoing but face significant hurdles.
- Some sources indicate the window for an agreement before the US elections in November 2024 may have closed.

6. Recent statements:
- As of June 20, 2024, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK reaffirmed that normalization would not occur without recognition of a Palestinian state.
- However, on July 26, 2024, an Israeli source suggested normalization was still possible before the US elections.

Weighing the evidence:

Factors increasing the likelihood:
- Ongoing negotiations and US push for an agreement
- Mutual benefits for all parties involved
- Reports of progress in talks

Factors decreasing the likelihood:
- Consistent Saudi insistence on Palestinian statehood
- Israeli government's opposition to Palestinian statehood
- Ongoing conflict in Gaza
- Public opposition in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries

Balancing these factors, I assess that normalization before September 30, 2024 is possible but faces significant challenges. The most recent statements from Saudi officials maintain their position on Palestinian statehood, which appears to be a major sticking point. However, the continued negotiations and US involvement suggest some possibility of a breakthrough.

Given the short timeframe (less than two months from the current date to the resolution date) and the significant obstacles, I lean towards a lower probability. However, the possibility of rapid developments in international diplomacy prevents me from ruling it out entirely.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
