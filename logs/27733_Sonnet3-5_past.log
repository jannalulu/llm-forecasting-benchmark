To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Presidential debates are a long-standing tradition in US elections. The first televised debate was in 1960, and they've been held consistently since 1976.

2. Current scheduling: Multiple sources confirm a debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, hosted by ABC News. This gives a strong baseline expectation.

3. Candidate participation: Both Harris and Trump have expressed willingness to debate, though there's been some back-and-forth on dates and networks.

4. Potential disruptions:
   a) Legal issues: Trump faces several legal challenges that could theoretically impact his candidacy.
   b) Health issues: Unexpected health problems could prevent participation.
   c) Campaign strategy changes: Either candidate could decide debating is not in their best interest.
   d) External events: Major national or global events could cause postponement.

5. Time until event: With over a year until the debate, there's significant time for changes or disruptions.

6. Polling and electoral dynamics: Current polls show a close race, increasing the importance of debates for both candidates.

Weighing these factors:

The strongest evidence for the debate occurring is the current scheduling and historical precedent. Presidential debates are a well-established part of the election process, and both candidates have incentives to participate, especially in a close race.

The primary risks are potential legal issues for Trump and the long timeframe allowing for unexpected events. However, even significant legal challenges might not prevent Trump from debating if he remains the Republican nominee.

Given the importance of debates in close elections and the current commitment from both sides, I assess a high probability of the debate occurring as scheduled. However, the long timeframe and potential for disruptions prevent assigning an extremely high probability.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

1. Historical precedent: Presidential debates are a longstanding tradition in US elections. The first televised debate was in 1960, and they've been held consistently since 1976.

2. Current scheduling: Multiple sources confirm a debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, hosted by ABC News. This strong consensus increases confidence.

3. Candidate participation: Both Trump and Harris have publicly agreed to participate in this debate. While candidates can change their minds, backing out could be politically costly.

4. Time until event: With over 13 months until the debate, many things could change. Candidates could drop out, legal issues could intervene, or unforeseen events could disrupt plans.

5. Potential obstacles: Trump faces multiple legal challenges that could theoretically prevent his participation. Harris currently trails Trump in some polls, which could potentially lead to a change in the Democratic nominee.

6. Debate format changes: The COVID-19 pandemic led to format changes in 2020. While less likely in 2024, unexpected events could alter debate plans.

7. Third-party candidates: Their inclusion wouldn't negate this debate under the criteria, but could complicate negotiations.

Weighing these factors:

The strongest evidence for the debate occurring is the official scheduling, public commitments from both candidates, and historical precedent. Presidential debates are seen as crucial campaign events that candidates rarely skip without significant backlash.

The primary risks are the long time horizon allowing for unexpected changes, and Trump's legal situation potentially forcing a change in the Republican nominee. However, even if Trump were to become ineligible, the Republican Party would likely nominate a replacement who would participate in the debate.

Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a high probability the debate will occur as scheduled, but with some uncertainty due to the time horizon and potential for unexpected events.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical precedent: Presidential debates have been a consistent feature of US elections since 1976. This establishes a strong base rate for debates occurring.

2. Current scheduling: Multiple sources confirm a debate is currently scheduled for September 10, 2024, hosted by ABC News. This is strong evidence in favor of the debate occurring.

3. Candidate participation: Both Trump and Harris have publicly committed to participating in the September 10 debate. This increases the likelihood of it happening.

4. Time until the event: The debate is still over a year away. This leaves time for potential changes or cancellations, which introduces some uncertainty.

5. Potential disrupting factors:
   - Legal issues: Trump is facing several legal challenges that could potentially impact his candidacy.
   - Health issues: Unexpected health problems for either candidate could force a cancellation.
   - Major world events: Unforeseen crises could lead to postponement.

6. Candidate incentives: Both candidates likely see debating as beneficial to their campaigns, increasing the chances they'll follow through.

7. Public expectation: There's significant public and media expectation for presidential debates, creating pressure for them to occur.

Weighing these factors:

The strongest evidence points towards the debate occurring as scheduled. The current planning, historical precedent, and public commitments from both candidates are particularly compelling.

However, the long time horizon introduces significant uncertainty. Unexpected events could still derail the debate, and there's always a chance of last-minute cancellations or changes.

Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a high probability the debate will occur, but not a near-certainty given the potential for unexpected disruptions.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, with 87.50% being the most likely. Probability: 87.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on specific evidence:

Base rate: Presidential debates are a longstanding tradition in US elections. In recent decades, there have typically been 2-3 debates between the major party nominees. The Commission on Presidential Debates has organized these debates since 1988. This suggests a high base rate, perhaps around 90%, for at least one debate occurring.

Specific evidence:

For:
1. Multiple sources confirm a debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024 on ABC News. This includes reputable outlets like CBS News.
2. Both campaigns have publicly agreed to this debate date.
3. There's significant public interest and expectation for presidential debates.

Against:
1. The debate is still over a year away. Many things could change before then.
2. Trump has a history of threatening to skip debates or changing terms at the last minute.
3. Legal issues or health problems could potentially prevent one of the candidates from participating.
4. There's a small chance one of them may no longer be their party's nominee by that date.

Adjusting the forecast:

The multiple confirmations from reputable sources and agreement from both campaigns provide strong evidence for the debate occurring as scheduled. However, the long timeframe introduces uncertainty.

Trump's history of debate threats adds some downside risk, but he has ultimately participated in past debates. Legal issues are a wildcard, but would likely need to be severe to prevent debate participation.

The specific date requirement (September 10) introduces additional risk compared to a question about whether any debate will occur.

Weighing these factors, I'd adjust the base rate down slightly to account for the specific date requirement and long time horizon, but not dramatically given the strong confirmations.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on specific evidence:

Base rate:
Presidential debates are a longstanding tradition in US elections. In recent elections, there have typically been 2-3 debates between the major party nominees. The first debate is usually held in September or early October. This suggests a fairly high base rate for a debate occurring on the scheduled date.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple sources confirm a debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024 on ABC News.
2. Both campaigns have publicly agreed to this date.
3. The debate commission has officially announced this date.
4. There's significant public and media expectation for this debate.
5. Both candidates have incentives to participate to reach voters.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. The date is still over a year away, leaving time for changes.
2. Trump has shown reluctance to debate in the past and suggested alternative dates.
3. Unforeseen events (health issues, legal troubles, etc.) could cause cancellation.
4. There's a small chance either candidate might not be their party's nominee by then.
5. Disputes over debate format or rules could lead to cancellation.

Balancing these factors:
The strong institutional momentum and public expectation for the debate, combined with both campaigns' current agreement, suggest a high probability. However, the long time horizon and potential for disruptions warrant some caution.

Reference class:
Looking at recent elections, scheduled presidential debates have a high rate of occurring as planned, though there have been occasional cancellations or changes (e.g., one 2020 debate was cancelled due to COVID-19).

Adjusting for current circumstances:
The unusual nature of this election (with Harris replacing Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee) adds some uncertainty, but doesn't fundamentally alter the likelihood of a debate occurring.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.
