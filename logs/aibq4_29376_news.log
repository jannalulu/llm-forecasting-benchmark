**Massachusetts To Vote On Legalizing Psychedelics**
Voters in Massachusetts will decide on a ballot measure, Question 4, to legalize psilocybin and other natural psychedelics for personal and therapeutic use. If approved, adults aged 21 and older would be allowed to possess, use, and grow psilocybin and related compounds, as well as mescaline, dimethyltryptamine, and ibogaine. The ballot measure would also establish a regulatory framework for psychedelic-assisted therapy centers. Emily Oneschuk, a U.S. Navy veteran, supports the measure, citing the life-changing effects of psychedelic-assisted therapy for her depression. Research has shown the potential of psychedelics to treat mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and substance misuse disorders. Cody Shandraw, co-founder of Healing Realty Trust, believes that legalizing psychedelics can offer patients new options in mental health treatment.

**Doctors and advocates urge public to vote ‘yes’ on Question 4 to legalize psychedelics**
Advocates and doctors from the Yes on 4 campaign, including Eliza Dushku Palandjian, urged the public to vote yes on Question 4, a proposed law that would allow people 21 and older to grow, possess, and use five natural psychedelic substances under certain circumstances. Dushku Palandjian, who has been outspoken about how psychedelic treatments helped her recover from trauma, said, 'A yes vote on Question 4 will help to fulfill the obligation we owe to those who put their lives in harm’s way in service to our nation, and it will allow doctors to provide the best mental health care possible to all Massachusetts residents who need it.' Those against Question 4, such as Dr. Nassir Ghaemi, say that the known harms of psychedelics are too high and that the possible benefits are too low for them to be legalized. However, Dr. Franklin King, director of training and education at Mass. General’s Center for Neuroscience of Psychedelics, said, 'Psychedelics are not free of risk but nothing is. This measure could open the door to much greater opportunity for public education and harm reduction with respect to these powerful substances.'

**Massachusetts: Senator Elizabeth Warren Endorses Initiative to Legalize Psychedelics**
Senator Elizabeth Warren has expressed cautious support for Massachusetts' Question 4, a ballot initiative that would legalize certain psychedelics. Warren emphasized the need for thoughtful regulations, while her opponent John Deaton opposed the initiative, citing the opioid crisis. The initiative, backed by Massachusetts for Mental Health Options, would allow adults 21 and older to possess, grow, and share small amounts of certain psychedelics, with a 15% excise tax and a two-year development phase. According to a recent poll, 42% of voters support the initiative, with 44% opposed and 14% undecided.

**Massachusetts Voters Are Split On Psychedelics Legalization Ballot Initiative, New Poll Shows**
A new poll by the University of Massachusetts Amherst/WCVB shows that Massachusetts voters are evenly split on a psychedelics legalization initiative, with 43% in favor and 43% opposed, leaving 14% undecided. The ballot measure, Question 4, would allow adults 21 and older to legally possess, grow and share certain amounts of psychedelics. Jesse Rhodes, professor of political science at UMass Amherst, said, 'Massachusetts residents are evenly split on the ballot question to legalize and regulate psychedelics, and a significant share (14 percent) remain unsure how they will vote.' Tatishe Nteta, director of the poll, added that majority support was concentrated among young people, Democrats, liberals, and Biden voters, while older voters, independents, Republicans, and parents are particularly opposed to the ballot question.

**Question 4: What to know about the proposal to legalize some psychedelics**
Massachusetts voters are considering Question 4, which would legalize and regulate certain natural psychedelics for adults 21 and up. The proposed law would allow adults to grow, possess, and use psychedelics under certain circumstances, with a five-member commission and a 20-member advisory board overseeing the law. Proponents, including Emily Oneschuk, say psychedelics have shown promise in treating mental health conditions, but opponents, such as Chris Keohan, raise concerns about safety, cost, and the potential for a black market. The law would take effect in December, with a staggered rollout of regulations allowing centers to offer at least one natural psychedelic by April 2026. Oneschuk emphasizes that psychedelics are not a magic cure-all, but a tool that requires work and dedication.

**Is Massachusetts the Next Beachhead for Psychedelic Drugs?**
Massachusetts voters will decide on Question 4, which would decriminalize the personal use of plant-based psychedelics, including psilocybin and MDMA. The measure would allow individuals 21 and older to possess and use a personal amount of these substances, as well as grow plants and fungi that contain them. Proponents, including Lieutenant Sarko Gergerian, a mental health counselor and police officer, argue that this would bring therapeutic practices above board and allow for more control over their use. Opponents, such as Caroline Cunningham, general consultant for the campaign against Question 4, are concerned about the potential risks of unregulated use, including the creation of a 'gray market' for psychedelics. A recent poll shows that 43% of voters support the measure, while 43% oppose it. The outcome of the vote will have implications for the national commercial market for psychedelics, which could approach $7 billion by 2027.

**Doctors and advocates urge public to vote 'yes' on Question 4 to legalize psychedelics - The Boston Globe**
Dushku Palandjian, an actress and mental health advocate, and other supporters of Question 4, a ballot initiative to legalize psychedelics in Massachusetts, argue that the measure will provide a wider array of mental health treatment options. They point to evidence that psychedelic therapy can help people with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, including veterans. Opponents, such as Dr. Nassir Ghaemi from the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, say that the known harms of psychedelics are too high and that the possible benefits are too low for them to be legalized. Dr. Franklin King, director of training and education at Mass. General's Center for Neuroscience of Psychedelics, said, 'Psychedelics are not free of risk but nothing is...

**Eliza Dushku joins Question 4 rally in favor of psychedelics as Election Day approaches**
Eliza Dushku, a former actress and advocate for psychedelic-assisted therapy, joined a rally in support of Massachusetts ballot Question 4, which would legalize psychedelics in the state. Dushku, who credits the treatment with helping her recover from childhood trauma, said, 'I come at this as somebody who has been a client or a patient, so to speak. Psychedelic-assisted therapy that completely changed my life.' Opponents, including Chris Keohan of the Coalition for Safe Communities, argue that the measure lacks important safeguards, such as required medical professionals at therapy sites and restrictions on home cultivation. Keohan said, 'This allows for 144 square feet of grow in your house. It's not safe for children. It's not safe for pets and, frankly, it's self-medication.' A 'yes' vote would allow people 21 and older to grow, possess, and use certain psychedelics in licensed therapy centers and at home, while a 'no' vote would maintain the current law. With Election Day approaching, over 1.1 million Massachusetts voters have already submitted their ballots through mail-in or early voting.

**Third US state may legalize psychedelics**
Massachusetts may become the third US state to legalize plant-based psychedelic drugs if a proposed legislation, known as Question 4, is voted into law. The measure would allow individuals aged 21 and over to grow, possess, and use certain natural psychedelic substances, including psilocybin, psilocin, dimethyltryptamine, mescaline, and ibogaine, under the supervision of a licensed facilitator. According to Lieutenant Sarko Gergerian, a peace officer and mental-health counselor, the proposal would provide safe and regulated access to promising natural psychedelic medicines for treatment-resistant PTSD, anxiety, and depression. However, Dr. Anahita Dua, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, expressed concerns about the potential for a black market, increased drugged driving, and life-threatening toxic effects of ibogaine. The proposed law would also establish a five-person Natural Psychedelic Substances Commission and a 20-person Natural Psychedelic Substances Advisory Board to oversee regulation and make recommendations.

**Massachusetts Voters Could Legalize Anyone Growing ‘Bedroom-Sized’ Amounts of Shrooms**
Massachusetts voters will decide on question 4, a proposal to legalize psychedelic substances like psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, and ibogaine for personal use and growth. If approved, citizens 21 and over will be able to use these substances under licensed supervision and grow a limited amount, equivalent to the average bedroom size, for personal use. Proponents argue that psychedelics offer therapeutic benefits for PTSD and depression, particularly for military veterans. Opponents, like Chris Keohan from the Coalition for Safe Communities, express concerns about public safety, citing the lack of required medical supervision and the potential risks to children and pets. Keohan also criticized the proposed grow space, saying it's 'an astronomical amount of space' equivalent to the average bedroom size.

**'Bedroom-sized' magic mushroom crops will be grown under controversial new law**
A new law in Massachusetts, Question Four, would legalize and regulate the use of psychedelic drugs, including magic mushrooms, psilocybin, and ibogaine. The law would allow anyone over 21 to grow and use these substances, and create a commission to regulate them. Supporters claim it would help with mental health issues and reduce prison sentences, but opponents say it's 'dangerous' and would lead to a black market. Chris Keohan, from the Coalition for Safe Communities, said, 'This just goes way too far, and it should not move forward.' He also expressed concerns about the potential for severe heart problems with ibogaine and the high cost of treatment. Actress Eliza Dushku Palandjian, a supporter of the law, said, 'Psychedelics have an ability to heal and to help people with mental health challenges.' However, Keohan criticized the 'yes' side for using veterans in their ads to promote the law, saying it was 'disgusting' and 'offensive'.

**Massachusetts ballot questions 2024: Question 4 on the legalization of psychedelics - The Boston Globe**
Massachusetts residents will vote on Question 4, which would legalize the use of five psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and DMT, for people 21 and older. The substances could be grown, possessed, and used for therapeutic purposes at licensed centers, but retail sale would remain prohibited. Advocates argue that psychedelics can be a treatment option for mental health conditions, while opponents express concerns about the potential harms of the substances and the cost of the program. Massachusetts for Mental Health Options, the 'Yes on 4' group, has raised $5.7 million and spent $4.7 million, while the Coalition for Safe Communities, the group opposing the measure, has not reported any donations or expenditures. Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon, said, 'It would be ridiculous and dangerous and a bad precedent for us to set... to try to jump the gun, so to speak, without doing the proper research, because of social pressure and money.' The Massachusetts Psychiatric Society and the Massachusetts Medical Society have also expressed opposition to the ballot question.

**Here's what experts, readers say about legalizing psychedelics in Mass.**
Massachusetts voters are divided on the issue of legalizing psychedelic substances for medical use. The main supporter of the ballot measure, Massachusetts for Mental Health Options (MMHO), argues that it would provide a safe and regulated way for adults to access psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions. However, some voters, including Chris Keohan, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Safe Communities, are concerned about the potential risks of home growth and the impact on public safety. Dr. Franklin King, a Harvard Medical School instructor, notes that psychedelics can produce profound changes in consciousness, but also warns of the potential risks. A Boston.com poll found that 74% of readers support the measure, citing the potential benefits for managing PTSD and other severe mental health diagnoses. However, some readers expressed concerns about the potential adverse effects and the need for more research.

**Two western Mass. mayors endorse ballot Question 4, psychedelics**
Two western Massachusetts mayors, Will Reichelt of West Springfield and Joshua Garcia of Holyoke, have publicly endorsed Question 4 on the ballot, which aims to legalize and regulate three natural plants and two types of mushrooms for limited use by adults over 21 years old. According to Mayor Reichelt, 'There is proof out there that this does at the same time help people with PTSD with substance abuse disorders like marijuana did too, and we legalized that, we brought it here.' The law would also allow individuals to grow the substances at home, but some argue this could create an unregulated market. A 'YES' vote would allow licensed supervision and home growth, while a 'NO' vote would maintain the current law.

**Editorial: Question 4 opens door to psychedelics abuse**
Supporters of Ballot Question 4 claim that legalizing psychedelics will help treat mental health issues, but critics argue that it will lead to abuse and black market sales. The question does not require licensed facilities to be run by medical professionals, and the cost of treatment ($750 to $3,500 per visit) is a significant barrier for many people. Additionally, the law allows individuals to grow and consume psychedelics at home without supervision, which raises concerns about safety and the potential for black market sales. Chris Keohane of the Coalition for Safe Communities said, 'The yes side of this ballot question is touting veterans and other people that have various sicknesses... I'd like to know how many people in the state of Massachusetts are going through the painful issues that they talk about can afford $750 to $3,500 per visit.' The law also imposes a 15% excise tax on the sale of psychedelic substances, which could incentivize black market sales. The author argues that a yes vote on Question 4 will open the door to illegal sales of powerful substances and undermine the potential benefits of psychedelic therapies.

**Psychedelics and Marijuana on the Ballot: How Should Employers Prepare for Potential Legalization?**
Several states will vote on ballot measures regarding the legalization of marijuana and psychedelics in the upcoming November 5, 2024 general election. Employers should be aware of these measures and prepare for potential changes to workplace policies. The measures include: Florida's 'Adult Personal Use of Marijuana' which allows adults 21+ to use marijuana for non-medical purposes, Massachusetts' 'Legalization and Regulation of Psychedelic Substances Initiative' which decriminalizes the personal use of natural psychedelic substances, Nebraska's 'Nebraska Medical Cannabis Patient Protection Act' which allows qualified patients to use cannabis for medical purposes, North Dakota's 'Cannabis Legalization Initiative' which allows for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis, and South Dakota's Initiated Ballot Measure 29 which legalizes the recreational use of marijuana. None of these measures require employers to permit or accommodate the use of marijuana or psychedelics in the workplace. However, employers should be prepared to update their employment policies and communicate any changes to employees.

Ballot question 4 in Massachusetts aims to legalize natural psychedelic substances, such as magic mushrooms, for people over 21. It would also create a commission to regulate them. Proponents, like Eliza Dushku Palandjian and Emily Oneschuk, claim psychedelics have healing properties and helped them with mental health challenges. However, opponents, including Chris Keohan from the Coalition for Safe Communities, argue it's moving too fast and poses risks, especially with home growth. If passed, the commission would regulate sale and services, impose a tax, and allow adults to grow and possess the drug.

**Question 4 would legalize psychedelics**
Question 4 on the Massachusetts ballot would legalize psychedelics, including psilocybin, psilocyn, mescaline, DMT, and Ibogaine, for personal use by those 21 and older. The question also allows for people to grow their own plants and fungi in a limited space. A commission would be established to regulate the use of these substances. Treatment centers for psychedelics would open so people can use the substances with supervision. CJ LoConte, a spokesperson for Yes on 4, said, 'I think it’s just incredibly, incredibly important that Massachusetts sets the example for the rest of the East Coast, and hopefully sets the example for the rest of the country, after learning from Oregon, Colorado and how to push these policies forward the right way.' Opponents, however, have concerns about supervision of psychedelic treatment and the inability of communities to opt out of having a treatment center within their borders. Dr. Anthony J. Rothschild, professor of psychiatry at the UMass Chan Medical School, expressed reservations about the ballot question’s home-grow provisions, saying, 'The idea of somebody growing a mushroom plant in their backyard and then taking it without medical supervision, without knowing who should or shouldn’t take it, is really dangerous.'

**Should shrooms be legal?**
Massachusetts residents are voting on Question 4, which asks whether the state should allow people over 21 to grow, use, and share limited amounts of five psychedelic substances, and create and regulate a system of psychedelic therapy centers. The 'yes' campaign points to the drugs' proven therapeutic effectiveness, while the 'no' side disagrees on the specifics of the proposal, particularly the limited oversight over home-growing and sharing. The Globe's editorial board calls this 'the basic contradiction of Question 4.' The proposal would allow for the creation of psychedelic therapy centers, but the likely cost of treatment ($1,000 per session) and the 2028 opening date may push many people towards at-home usage and sharing.

**Massachusetts Considers Legalizing Psychedelics for Therapeutic Use**
Massachusetts is considering legalizing four types of psychedelics, including psilocibina and ayahuasca, for therapeutic use in treating mental health issues. The proposal, known as Question 4 on the Massachusetts ballot, would allow individuals to cultivate their own psychedelics in limited quantities and establish centers for psychedelic therapy, supervised by certified guides who complete a state training program. Proponents of the measure argue that it would provide greater access to psychedelics for individuals who have not responded to other forms of mental health treatment. Emily Oneschuk, a veteran who has struggled with PTSD and depression, credits psychedelics with helping her recover. 'It wasn't just everything disappearing, but it was like the first crack in that strong wall I had built, that allowed me to see some light and helped me start to remember that I could feel good again,' she said. However, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society opposes the measure, citing concerns about safety and the potential for adverse reactions to psychedelics. James Davis, a member of the group Bay Staters for Natural Medicine, also opposes the measure, arguing that it is not designed safely and that there are risks associated with the use of psychedelics, including cardiac risks. The economic implications of the measure are also a concern, with some arguing that the cost of accessing psychedelic therapy could be prohibitively expensive for many individuals. Proponents of the measure argue that the law would include a 15% tax on psychedelic services, which could help fund local governments. 'Someone has to make money,' said Oneschuk. 'They need to exist.' The 'yes' side has raised $7 million for their campaign, while the 'no' side has raised only $100,000.

However, opponents, like James Davis from Bay Staters for Natural Medicine, argue that the law is not designed safely, citing cardiac risks associated with one of the substances, ibogaine. The proposed law includes a 15% excise tax on psychedelic services, which could help cities and towns. Supporters point out that the cost will be similar to other alternative health treatments, while opponents express concerns about the potential for high costs and the training requirements for psychedelic guides. The pro side has collected $7 million for their campaign, while opponents have collected just $100,000.

**Massachusetts Votes on Access to Psychedelics in Referendum**
Massachusetts is on the verge of becoming the third US state to approve the use of natural consciousness-altering substances, such as DMT, psilocibina, ibogaína, and mescalina, for adults through a referendum. However, the electorate is divided. According to a WBUR radio poll in September, 44% would vote 'no' to Question 4, while 42% would vote 'yes'. A WCVB TV poll in early October showed 43% to 43%. The Massachusetts Psychiatric Society and The Boston Globe have spoken out against the proposal. If approved, the law would decriminalize natural substances, but not synthetic ones like LSD and MDMA. A committee would detail the rules for access. The proposal follows Oregon and Colorado's lead, creating services for psilocibina facilitated by registered facilitators. It goes further, including other natural psychedelics, possession, and cultivation for personal use. Defenders argue that the potential therapeutic benefits against depression and PTSD are a blessing for veterans and abuse victims. Opponents argue that the possibility of producing psychedelics would create a black market. The experience in Oregon has been mixed, with high costs and bureaucratic hurdles. Colorado has taken a different approach, allowing healthcare professionals to offer psychedelics as therapy.

**Question 4: A new chapter for psychedelics?**
Massachusetts voters will decide on Question 4, which aims to decriminalize and regulate certain natural psychedelic substances. If passed, the measure would introduce not only decriminalization but also a regulatory framework for monitored 'trips' to be carried out by licensed professionals. Advocates argue that psychedelics have mental health benefits, particularly for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. Opponents, however, express concerns about the lack of professional oversight, the amount of space allowed for unregulated cultivation, and the potential proximity of the substances to children. They also worry about the costs of legal psychedelics, which could be steep, and the potential for a gray market to develop. The measure would allow for home growing of psychedelics in spaces up to 144 square feet, but substances produced in these spaces cannot be sold. Five types of hallucinogenic fungi would be legally permitted under the measure: psilocybin and psilocin found in mushrooms, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ibogaine, and mescaline found in plants. A five-member Natural Psychedelic Substances Commission would be formed to administer the law governing the use and distribution of psychedelic substances.

**Legalizing psychedelics is dangerous  --  vote no on Question 4 - The Boston Globe**
The American Psychiatric Association, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, and the Massachusetts Medical Society oppose Question 4, which would legalize five hallucinogens in Massachusetts. The organizations argue that the risks of these substances are well-known, while the benefits are unclear. They claim that legalization would lead to increased access to powerful substances without proper regulation, resulting in a higher risk of psychiatric and medical emergencies, addiction, and accidents. The organizations also argue that the short-term benefits of hallucinogens for conditions like depression and PTSD are not supported by long-term evidence, and that current treatments are safer and more effective. They recommend voting 'no' on Question 4 to protect public health. As Dr. [author's name] states, 'The medical system exists to provide safe and effective treatments, and psychedelics such as ketamine and esketamine are available by prescription.'

**Massachusetts voters will decide if psychedelic substances should be legal in November**
Massachusetts voters will decide on ballot question 4 in November, which asks if psychedelic substances should be legal in the state. A yes vote would create an advisory board to license psychedelic substances and allow people age 21 and older to grow their own mushrooms. Chris Keohan, a spokesperson for The Coalition for Safe Communities, expressed concerns about the ballot question, stating that it does not include specific regulations, such as a price cap, and could lead to 'the worst trip' for vulnerable individuals. However, others, including spiritual advisors Gary Logan and Robert Grover, believe that legalization could provide health and medical benefits and potentially save lives. If passed, Massachusetts would join Oregon and Colorado as states that have legalized psychedelic substances.

**Mass. Question 4: Should some psychedelic drugs be legal?**
Massachusetts voters are being asked to decide on Question 4, which would legalize five psychedelics - psilocybin, psilocyn, mescaline, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and ibogaine - for use in the state. Advocates say these drugs have shown promise in clinical research trials for treating mental health conditions and opioid use disorder. However, they also come with potential harms, such as triggering adverse reactions for those with pre-existing mental health issues. Veterans have campaigned for legalization as a critical mental health treatment option. Dr. Roxanne Sholevar, a psychiatrist, supports supervised use of psychedelics and believes legalization would help people feel more comfortable discussing their experiences with their doctors. Dr. Nassir Ghaemi, president of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, opposes the ballot measure, citing concerns about for-profit legalization and potential dangers. If approved, personal use would begin in December, and rules for therapeutic centers to provide the substances would be in place by 2026 and 2028, respectively.

**Massachusetts Voters Could Legalize 'Shrooms and Other Psychedelics in November**
Massachusetts voters will face a ballot question in November that would legalize 'shrooms and other psychedelic drugs. The proposed law would allow individuals aged 21 and older to grow, possess, and use certain natural psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and psilocyn found in mushrooms, and dimethyltryptamine, mescaline, and ibogaine found in plants. However, critics argue that the law would create an uncontrolled market for dangerous psychoactive drugs and drag everyday Americans toward the 'kooky fringes.' Studies have shown that psychedelics are not safe for recreational users and can have serious adverse effects, including worsening depression, suicidal behavior, and psychosis. Additionally, the law would create a Natural Psychedelic Substances Commission and a Natural Psychedelic Substances Advisory Board, which would regulate and tax the substances. As Charles Fain Lehman writes in the Wall Street Journal, 'Massachusetts' plan -- like those in other states -- end-runs this system, creating an uncontrolled market for dangerous psychoactive drugs.'

**LETTER: Resident Strongly Endorses Yes on Question 4**
Rita Colafella, a resident of Watertown, strongly endorses voting yes on Question 4, which would allow individuals aged 21 and older to grow, possess, and use certain natural psychedelic substances for therapeutic purposes. Colafella emphasizes the potential benefits of these substances in treating mental health conditions, particularly for veterans and first responders who often struggle with PTSD and have high rates of suicide. She notes that many of these individuals have found success with these substances in other countries, but should not have to travel abroad to access them. Colafella also highlights the limitations of current psychiatric medications and the potential of psychedelic substances to 'unburden the psyche' for terminally ill patients. She argues that these substances would be more controlled than alcohol, which is freely dispensed despite its dangers, and encourages voters to support Question 4. As Colafella says, 'Please vote YES on Question 4.'

**Massachusetts Voters Are Split On Psychedelics Legalization Ballot Initiative, New Poll Shows**
A new poll by the University of Massachusetts Amherst/WCVB shows that Massachusetts voters are evenly split on a psychedelics legalization initiative, with 43% in favor and 43% opposed, leaving 14% undecided. The ballot measure, Question 4, would allow adults 21 and older to legally possess, grow and share certain amounts of psychedelics. Jesse Rhodes, professor of political science at UMass Amherst, said, 'Massachusetts residents are evenly split on the ballot question to legalize and regulate psychedelics, and a significant share (14 percent) remain unsure how they will vote.' Tatishe Nteta, director of the poll, added that majority support was concentrated among young people, Democrats, liberals, and Biden voters, while older voters, independents, Republicans, and parents are particularly opposed to the ballot question.

**Ballot Question 4 is a concern for Catholics in Massachusetts**
Bishop McManus of the Diocese of Worcester has sent a letter to priests encouraging them to share a fact sheet with their parishioners about ballot Question 4, which concerns the legalization of certain psychedelics in Massachusetts. The proposed law would allow those 21 and older to grow, possess, and use certain natural psychedelic substances. However, the fact sheet, prepared by The Kolbe Family Group, raises concerns about the risks to mental health and public safety, including impairment while driving, reduction of perception of harm, and increase in drug use by youth. Ornella Quinn of the Kolbe Family Group stated, 'This is something that should be in the hands of the experts in the medical community.' The group argues that the proposal lacks certain requirements that would provide more safeguards for those using psychedelics, such as medical screening or supervised use for home-grown users. Father Tad Pacholczyk, a senior ethicist at the National Catholic Bioethics Center, reviewed the material and offered advice to the Kolbe Family Group, stating, 'While there are some preliminary indications that psychedelics may offer limited therapeutic benefit, the data clearly suggests the best outcomes from carefully-tailored clinical environments where extensive counseling and supportive therapy is concurrently provided.' The Kolbe Family Group is concerned that the proposal is 'reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous to the public,' and that it will allow psychedelics to be grown at home and given away to others, effectively creating a black market. They argue that there is a 'lack of medical framework' around potentially dangerous and harmful drugs.

**Massachusetts Poll: 42% Support Initiative to Legalize Psychedelics, 44% Oppose, Campaign Raises Over $6 Million**
A recent poll in Massachusetts shows that 42% of voters support Question 4, which would legalize the possession and personal cultivation of certain psychedelics, including psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, mescaline, and ibogaine. The initiative, put forth by the nonprofit Massachusetts for Mental Health Options (MMHO), aims to 'expand mental health treatment options in Massachusetts by providing new pathways to access natural psychedelic medicine therapy.' As of October 5, MMHO has raised over $6.1 million in support of their measure. Currently, only Colorado and Oregon have legalized psilocybin or any other psychedelic that's on the federal controlled substances list. Six cities in Massachusetts have already decriminalized the possession of psilocybin.

**Poll finds 4 of 5 ballot questions have strong support, with psychedelics proposal a tossup**
A recent poll by UMass Amherst/WCVB shows strong support for four out of five ballot questions in Massachusetts, with the question on legalizing psychedelics being a toss-up. The proposal to allow adults to purchase or grow natural psychedelic substances has 43% support, with 43% opposed and 14% undecided. Other ballot questions, such as increasing the minimum wage for tipped workers, letting rideshare drivers unionize, and giving the state auditor more power, have around 60% support. However, there is confusion over the proposal to let students graduate high school without passing the MCAS test, with many voters believing Gov. Maura Healey and state Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler support the question when in fact they do not. The poll also shows a large lead for incumbent U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren in her campaign for a third term, with a 22 percentage point lead over challenger John Deaton.

**Massachusetts Veterans Advocate For Psilocybin Legalization: Will Voters Support Them?**
Army combat vet CJ LoConte credits psilocybin with transforming his life after struggling with mental health issues. LoConte is now part of a movement advocating for Question 4, a ballot measure to decriminalize psychedelics in Massachusetts. If passed, the measure would decriminalize small amounts of psychedelic substances and establish licensed facilities for supervised use. Proponents argue that the measure will provide essential mental health treatment options, while opponents caution that the home-grow provision could pose safety risks. Veterans at an event in Boston shared their experiences with psychedelics, highlighting their healing potential. Recent polling shows a close race, with 46.8% of likely voters supporting the measure and 46% opposed. As the debate continues ahead of November's vote, veterans like LoConte are determined to ensure that psychedelic-assisted therapy becomes a legal option in Massachusetts. 'I do credit my psilocybin experience with saving my life,' LoConte said. 'Seven days after my first experience, another former soldier of mine died by suicide, and that still hits hard. That's why passing Question 4 is important.'

**Veterans argue Massachusetts should approve psychedellics with vote on Question 4**
Veterans in Massachusetts are advocating for the approval of Question 4, which would decriminalize certain types and small quantities of psychedelic substances. They credit psychedelics, such as psilocybin, with saving their lives and improving their mental health. Army combat veteran CJ LoConte said, 'I do credit my psilocybin experience with saving my life because seven days after my first experience, another former soldier of mine died by suicide, and that still hits hard.' Jamie Morey, founder of advocacy group Parents for Plant Medicine, said, 'Please educate yourself by reading up on the clinical research, which proves the safety and efficacy of this treatment, and listen to the countless stories of healing from those who have benefitted from psychedelic-assisted therapy.' The ballot question would establish licensed facilities where people could buy and take the drugs under supervision, and Bay Staters would also be permitted to grow and use them at home. However, The Boston Globe's Editorial Board urged Bay Staters to vote no on the question, saying it 'goes too far' when it comes to the home cultivation element.

**Vote no on legalizing psychedelic drugs - The Boston Globe**
The Boston Globe editorial board encourages voters to vote 'no' on Question 4, which would legalize the use of five psychedelic drugs in Massachusetts. While the drugs may have medical benefits, the proposal goes beyond allowing safe access to patients and instead allows home growing and unregulated consumption. The board suggests that the Legislature should create a committee to recommend a framework for allowing access to psychedelic drugs in a thoughtful and limited way. Scientists and pharmaceutical companies should also continue researching the medical benefits of these plants, with the goal of getting medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA review process ensures that drugs are safe and effective, and potential risks are known. The ballot initiative would create therapeutic centers where someone could pay to obtain psychedelic drugs and receive therapy, but it also allows home grows and unregulated consumption, which could create a system of unequal access and safety.

**Legalization Of Psychedelic Drugs Is On The Ballot In Massachusetts**
Massachusetts voters will decide in November whether to allow the use of psychedelic substances as a form of mental health treatment, specifically for post-traumatic stress disorder and clinical depression. A yes vote on Question 4 would lead to the creation of a five-person commission and 20-member advisory board to regulate the psychedelics industry. Residents would be allowed to grow psychedelics in a 12-foot-by-12-foot space, secured from anyone under 21, but opponents argue that this would be unsafe. According to Evan Horowitz, executive director of the Tufts University Center, 'Two other states have legalized select psychedelics, but Question 4 goes further, with therapy centers that can offer a wider array of psychedelic drugs.' Psilocybin, in particular, has shown promise as a treatment for several serious mental health conditions, including anxiety among patients with terminal illnesses, but the American Psychiatric Association has not yet supported psychedelics due to 'currently inadequate scientific evidence.'

Question 4 would legalize plant-based psychedelic drugs for people 21 and older at licensed therapy centers. Question 5 is not mentioned in the article. The Massachusetts Teachers Association has donated over $2 million to support Question 2, while the opposition, Protect Our Kids' Future, has received over $1 million in donations. The United for Justice committee has received over $2 million in donations to support Question 3.

**Local lawmakers hold ‘Yes on 4' press conference**
Local lawmakers and leaders gathered on the State House steps to urge voters to support ballot question 4, which would decriminalize psychedelic substances. If passed, the substances could be used as part of a treatment plan for mental health issues like PTSD. The ballot initiative includes setting the legal sale age at 21 and creating a commission to oversee administration. Mayor Nicole LaChapelle of Easthampton stated, 'Mayors need all the tools in the toolbox to help folks on their streets, to help folks in our schools, to help folks, veterans, of which we have a large population. That's our responsibility.' Representative Lindsay Sabadosa, who filed similar legislation last session, views the ballot question as a way to move the legislation forward faster. She said, 'We've really viewed the ballot question as a way to move the legislation forward a little bit faster. It was a first file, as you know, and first files tend to take a while.' The question will appear on the November presidential ballot alongside four others.

Supporters of Question 4, a ballot question on the Nov. 5 ballot, gathered in front of the State House to emphasize the potential health benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy. Sen.

Gomez said, 'Question 4 is about opening up access, and it's about opening up access to an option for mental health treatment that research has shown to be powerful and can be taken safely.' The question would legalize certain types and small quantities of psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and psilocin in mushrooms, and would allow people ages 21 and older to grow, possess, and use psychedelics at home. If approved, the measure would also create a pathway to license and regulate facilities where people can buy the substances and be supervised while using them.

Proponents, including Emily Oneschuk, say psychedelics have shown promise in treating mental health conditions, but opponents, such as Chris Keohan, raise concerns about safety, cost, and the potential for a black market. The law would take effect in December, with a staggered rollout of regulations allowing centers to offer at least one natural psychedelic by April 2026. Oneschuk emphasizes that psychedelics are not a magic cure-all, but a tool that requires work and dedication.

**Question 4 could legalize the use of psychedelic substances in Massachusetts**
Question 4 on the Massachusetts November ballot could legalize and regulate the use of psychedelic substances like psilocybin for adults 21 and up. Supporters, including Navy veteran Emily Oneschuk, claim that these substances can help with depression and PTSD when coupled with talk therapy. Oneschuk, who turned to 'magic mushrooms' during a healing retreat in Jamaica, said that it led to an emotional breakthrough and 'cracked through the armor' she had built up. However, psychiatrists, such as Dr. Nassir Ghaemi, president of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society, are strongly opposed, warning of the dangers of 'bad trips' and the risk of addiction. State Rep. Lindsay Sabadosa argues that the medical research is promising, particularly in helping people stop using addictive and dangerous drugs like heroin and cocaine. Oneschuk believes that legalization would set up a 'really powerful way for people to use this in a really healing capacity.'

**We asked doctors: Should Massachusetts voters legalize magic mushrooms?**
Massachusetts voters will decide in November whether to legalize access to five types of natural psychedelics, including psilocybin, psilocin, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ibogaine, and mescaline, for ages 21 and older. While some doctors, like Dr. Franklin King, believe that psychedelics are 'remarkably safe' and have potential medical benefits, others, such as Dr. Anthony Rothschild, are concerned about the lack of evidence and potential risks. Rothschild stated, 'We don't know if taking psychedelics is effective for depression or PTSD. We don't know the side effects, short-term and long-term.' Dr. Nassir Ghaemi noted that psychedelics can leave users feeling better physically but often come with a psychological addiction. The Veterans Administration is conducting research on certain psychedelic compounds to treat PTSD and depression among veterans. However, Ghaemi cautioned that hallucinations can turn dangerous, and one of his patients was in a coma for two months after taking the psychedelic Ayahuasca. He believes that Question 4 doesn't provide the necessary supervision because the licensed therapeutic centers don't have a staff of trained doctors, nurses, and social workers.

A new poll by the University of New Hampshire found that Massachusetts voters are divided on several ballot questions, including proposals to audit the state Legislature, allow ride-hailing drivers to unionize, and legalize psychedelic mushrooms. However, a slim majority of voters support boosting the wages of tipped workers and decriminalizing psilocybin and other psychedelic substances. The poll found that 51% of voters support Question 1, which proposes a performance and financial audit of the Legislature, while 10% oppose it. Meanwhile, voters are more divided over Question 2, which calls for scrapping the MCAS graduation mandate, with 40% planning to vote no and 38% planning to vote yes. Backers of the proposal argue that the MCAS testing isn't a complete picture of a student's abilities, while critics argue that the exams are necessary to expose inequities among students and school districts.

Opponents warn of risks from some of the substances, primarily ibogaine, which affects the heart, and the substances in DMT, a plant-derived hallucinogenic. Proponents of Question 4 envision using Oregon as a model for Massachusetts, where psilocybin is already legal for adult use. James Davis, co-founder of the advocacy group Bay Staters for Natural Medicine, has chosen not to support the ballot question due to the high cost of setting up treatment centers and questions about the regulatory agency. Proponents of Question 4 have amassed almost $5 million to promote a yes vote, while the Coalition for Safe Communities, which opposes the ballot initiative, has yet to report any funds.

**Psychedelics: How Question 4 could legalize the drugs for therapeutic use in Mass.**
Massachusetts voters will decide on Question 4, which would legalize the therapeutic use of plant-based psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin mushrooms, for people 21 and older at licensed therapy centers. If passed, Massachusetts would be the third state to legalize certain psychedelics, following Oregon and Colorado. The law would create a regulatory framework for their therapeutic use and a five-member commission to oversee the industry. Proponents argue that limited legalization would be a step in reversing the government's war on drugs and provide access to potentially revolutionary therapies for mental health issues. Opponents worry about a proliferation of federally illegal drugs and issues of cost and access. 'Voting Yes on Question 4 will give veterans, patients with end-of-life distress and people who are suffering access to this life-saving mental health tool,' said Jennifer Manley, a spokesperson for Massachusetts for Mental Health Options. 'A black market is inevitable with this amount of home growth,' said Chris Keohan, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Safe Communities.
