Let me carefully analyze this forecast step-by-step:

Evidence Supporting Likelihood:
1. Multiple sources confirm Apple is working on a graphene thermal system for iPhone 16
2. Specific reports from The Information suggest larger graphite/graphene sheets to address overheating
3. Context of iPhone 15 Pro overheating issues provides strong motivation
4. Apple has filed patent applications related to graphene thermal management
5. Release of iPhone 16 is expected in September 2024, well before October 1 deadline

Evidence Reducing Likelihood:
1. These are still rumors and leaks, not official confirmation
2. Apple could delay or modify plans
3. Technological implementation might prove more complex than anticipated

Key Considerations:
- Multiple independent sources increase credibility
- Technical solution directly addresses a known problem
- Timing aligns perfectly with expected iPhone release
- Apple's typical product development cycle suggests high probability

Calibration Process:
- Base rate for major thermal system innovation: Moderate
- Specificity of current reports: High
- Technical feasibility: High
- Motivation (fixing overheating): Strong

Balancing Competing Errors:
- Risk of over-optimism: Overstating certainty of technological implementation
- Risk of under-estimation: Discounting strong convergent evidence

My Prediction: Between 87.50% and 94.30%, but 91.20% being the most likely. Probability: 91.20%.
