**INT. SUPERFORECASTER ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 3, 2024**

The room buzzes with the low hum of computers. Four SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of screens displaying global news.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning forward)  
"Our models had it at 5.25%. Given the data cutoff on July 12, the probability was low."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
"The nonproliferation efforts held strong. No credible evidence of a new nuclear state."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sighing in relief)  
"Good. The CTBT's monitoring network was vigilant. No unannounced tests slipped through."

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(looking at the screen)  
"Regional tensions remain, but no new nuclear players. The NPT continues to be a cornerstone."

They exchange glances, understanding the weight of their accuracy.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smiling)  
"Another day where our models reflect reality."

The team disperses, their work ensuring another day of global stability.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, screens glowing with data.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
"So, the big question—did another state join the nuclear club?"

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(sifting through reports)  
"Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the last data we received on July 12, it seemed unlikely."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(nods)  
"True, but the geopolitical tensions were rising. Some signals were there, just not enough to tip the scales."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(glancing at a headline)  
"No credible evidence yet. If it happened, the world would be buzzing."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(sighs)  
"Indeed. The nonproliferation efforts still hold strong—for now."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(leaning forward)  
"We must remain vigilant. Even a 12.34% chance is a risk we can't ignore."

The room falls silent, shadows flickering against the walls.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table. Charts and news clippings cover the walls. The air is tense.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 2.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The data was clear. Despite the saber-rattling, the geopolitical climate just wasn't conducive.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sifting through papers)  
The NPT held strong, and the IMS didn't detect any anomalies. The regional tensions were more bluster than action.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sighing in relief)  
It's a reminder of the delicate balance we're maintaining. The implications of a new nuclear state would've been catastrophic.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(glancing at a news article)  
Let's hope the efforts continue. The world can't afford complacency.

They sit in silence for a moment, acutely aware of the narrow escape. The room buzzes with the weight of what might have been.
