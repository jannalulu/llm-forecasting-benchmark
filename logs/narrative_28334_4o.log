INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, reviewing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the report)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the recent escalation, it was a plausible threat, but not a certainty.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed, the continuous rocket exchanges and the September 17 incident heightened tensions. Yet, Israel's defenses have been remarkably resilient.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gesturing to the map)  
The key was the geographical constraint. While attacks occurred, they didn't meet the criteria within the specified Israeli territory.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
It's a relief. The probability was there, but the event didn't materialize as feared.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning back)  
Our models remain consistent. The threat persists, but Israel's strategic responses are commendable.

They exchange relieved glances, aware of the fragile peace.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
(looking at the screen)
Our models had it at 15.67%. Given the surge in attacks since the October 7 events, it was a calculated risk.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
(nods)
The escalation with Hezbollah and the recent pager incident on September 17 hinted at growing tensions. But Israel's defenses are robust.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

Yet, despite the 10,000 rocket attacks, only isolated incidents breached their defenses. The Iranian and Houthi strikes didn't meet the fatal threshold.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

It's a testament to their defense systems. But the probability was never zero. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2

We must remain vigilant. The landscape is volatile, and predictions can shift with the slightest provocation.
