[Scene: A modern office with data visualization screens. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing charts the day after October 1, 2024]

Nate: Well, Phil, "Woman's World" didn't make it past 15th on Billboard. Our models were pretty decisive on this one.

Philip: Indeed. We had it at 12.3%. The initial reception was telling - debuting at 63rd and getting those critical "outdated girlboss" comparisons really hurt its momentum.

Nate: Even the Kamala Harris campaign adoption couldn't save it. The song's messaging felt forced, especially compared to Perry's earlier hits.

Philip: [examining a chart] The streaming numbers were particularly weak. Our models factored in Perry's recent chart performance trends and the current pop landscape. The data suggested it would hover between 40th and 60th position.

Nate: Sometimes a song just doesn't connect. The models caught that early disconnect between the message and current cultural zeitgeist.

Philip: Another accurate forecast in the books.

Nate Silver: [looking at Billboard charts] Well, Phil, looks like "Woman's World" peaked at 48th and fizzled out.

Philip Tetlock: No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.3%.

Nate: The political tie-in with Harris's campaign actually hurt more than helped. The critics were right about that "girl boss" vibe feeling dated.

Philip: [nodding] Perry's star power isn't what it was in the "Firework" days. The song's initial position at 63rd was telling. Even with Harris using it as a walkout song, it couldn't generate enough momentum.

Nate: [pulling up data] The streaming numbers were particularly weak. The critical reception basically killed any organic growth.

Philip: And historically, songs that debut that low rarely crack the top 15 without massive promotional pushes or viral moments. Neither materialized here.

Nate: Another accurate forecast in the books.

Nate: "So, Perry's 'Woman's World' - our models were spot on again."

Tetlock: "No surprise there. Our forecast gave it just 12.35% chance of breaking into the top 15."

Nate: [stirring coffee] "The Harris campaign's adoption didn't help much. The initial Billboard ranking at 63rd was telling, and that early critical reception..."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The 'girl boss' comparison really hurt its momentum. Even with Harris using it as a walkout song, it couldn't overcome that 2016 throwback vibe."

Nate: "Looking back at the data from July and August, the streaming numbers never showed the exponential growth needed for a top 15 breakthrough."

Tetlock: "Sometimes political association can boost a song, but in this case, it might have actually reinforced the criticism. 12.35% was generous, in retrospect."

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] No surprise there. Our models had it at 12.3%. The song's initial reception was tepid, and even the Kamala Harris campaign couldn't boost its popularity.

Nate: The data was pretty clear. Perry's recent singles haven't performed well, and that "girl boss" sound feels dated. Even with her track record of hits, the Billboard landscape has changed dramatically.

Philip: [examining papers] The Philadelphia Inquirer's early review was telling. Starting at 63rd and getting criticized for dated messaging... the probability of climbing 48 spots in two months was always low.

Nate: Especially with streaming numbers being what they were. Sometimes the models just know.
