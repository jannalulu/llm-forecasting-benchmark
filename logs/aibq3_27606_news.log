**Ukraine Testing Advance In Kursk Toward Russian Troops Trapped By Blown Bridges**
Ukrainian forces have begun probing attacks near the town of Tetkino, on the western edge of the Kursk sector, trapping up to 3,000 Russian troops south of the Seim River. Ukrainian troops have reportedly captured the western bank of the Seim River and are pushing east, potentially catching Russian forces in a pincer. The Russian Defense Ministry claims to have thwarted Ukrainian attacks, but the situation remains fluid. Meanwhile, Russia is facing logistical challenges, with its rail system collapsing in the Kursk region, forcing troops to drive convoys down the M-4 highway. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Russian general in charge of military operations in Kursk dismantled a council tasked with protecting the vulnerable border region, leaving a hole in Russia's weak border defenses. The US Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed that both Russia and Ukraine lack the military capability to launch major offensives against each other, leading to a likely stalemate. Ukrainian journalist Jayson Jay Smart recently visited Kursk and observed a HIMARS launch an attack, noting that the system rapidly egressed back into Ukraine after the strike. Satellite images show Russia building out its defensive measures in the water to protect the Kerch Bridge, which was hit by Ukrainian drone boats in July 2023.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aiming to Isolate and Capture Glushkovo**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Captures Over 11 Square Kilometers of Russian Territory**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in Kursk, capturing over 11 square kilometers of Russian territory west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Capture New Villages**
Ukrainian forces continued their assault on the entire salient in the Kursk region, with minor advances on the southeast of Sudji, according to the Institute for the Study of War. 'On August 18, Ukrainian forces continued to assault the entire salient in the Kursk region and made minor advances southeast of Sudji,' the ISW report stated. Ukrainian forces have captured the villages of Troitskoye and Semenovka, with the latter being approximately 24 kilometers from the border. The Russian Ministry of Defense and milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces were shelling the areas around Korenevo, Komarovka, Olgovka, Alexeevka, Safonovka, Kromskie Byki, Kauchuk, Sheptukhovka, Cherkasskoye Porichye, Russkoye Porichye, Ozerki, Giry, and Borok. However, according to geolocation footage from August 17 and 18, Ukrainian forces have been operating 'within the maximum declared limit' of their advance in the Kursk region. A Russian war correspondent claimed that there is unconfirmed information that Ukrainian forces have entered the village of Otruba north of Tetkino, while another war correspondent stated that Ukrainian forces are operating near Tetkino. The commander of the PS, Nikolai Oleschuk, published geolocation footage from August 18, showing Ukrainian forces striking a bridge over the Seim River in Zvanoe. As reported by the DeepState on August 19, Ukrainian forces have expanded their foothold in the Kursk region, capturing three more villages. According to the head of the Sumy MVA, Alexei Drizdov, the breakthrough in the Kursk region is the first stage of the Ukrainian offensive, which caught the enemy off guard.'

**Russian Army 'Organized Retreat' from Seim River Near Tetkino**
The Russian army has 'organized its retreat' to the eastern bank of the Seim River near Tetkino, according to Russian Telegram channels on August 17. The channels reported that the populated areas have been evacuated, two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi have been blown up, and new prepared defensive positions have been occupied. As reported by the 'Divanny General Staff' channel, 'The villages have been evacuated, two bridges, in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi, have been blown up at the approach of the enemy. New prepared defensive positions have been occupied.' The Seim River separates the Russian-Ukrainian border, and Tetkino is located on its eastern bank. The Russian Ministry of Defense has not officially confirmed the retreat. On August 16, Russian media reported that Ukrainian defense forces likely destroyed a crucial bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region. Initially, it was claimed that several HIMARS rockets were fired at the bridge, but later, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Forces, Nikolai Oleschuk, published a video of a Ukrainian air strike on the bridge. User Sergey Prokhorov published a video on social media showing a map with three bridges over the Seim River. He stated that the other two bridges in the area are less suitable for supply purposes. He believes that the bridge in Glushkovo was the only one that provided a significant supply line to a large area surrounded by the river and Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian military launched an offensive in the Kursk region on August 6, and fighting has continued in the region since then. Media reported that Russia had redeployed troops and equipment from the Belgorod and Donetsk regions to the Kursk region. Since August 9, a counter-terrorism operation has been introduced in three neighboring regions: Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod. On August 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian forces were conducting an operation in the Kursk region, capturing hundreds of Russian soldiers. The first Ukrainian military command, led by General-Major Eduard Moskalov, was established.

**Ukrainian Forces Capture Russian Soldiers, Including 'Akhmat' Unit Members**
On August 21, Ukrainian forces captured over 10 Russian soldiers, including some from the 'Akhmat' unit, a Chechen subdivision of the Kadyrovtsy, which are considered a 'military elite' in Russia. The Ukrainian army's Land Forces announced the capture, which was achieved by the 22nd Separate Mechanized Brigade. The Ukrainian soldiers said, 'It's another day of our active actions on the enemy's territory. Our Land Forces continue to fulfill their combat tasks near Kursk. We have good results in terms of prisoners, which means that even more of our guys will soon return home.' This is not the first time that Chechen followers of Kadyrov have surrendered to the Ukrainians. For example, on August 17, Ukrainian forces captured another group of Kadyrovtsy, who on video admitted to being 'happy' to be captured by the Ukrainians and praised the Ukrainian army for defending their homeland. According to The Independent, over 2000 Russian soldiers have been captured in the Kursk region alone.

**Disaster Looms for Russia: Ukraine Poised to Trap 3,000 Soldiers in Crushing Blow to Putin's War Machine**
A Ukrainian offensive has captured approximately 483 square miles of Russian territory and 92 settlements, putting 3,000 Russian soldiers at risk of being isolated. According to a military source, around 1,000 Russian troops are in the villages of Tetkino and Glushkovo, and another 1,000 are along the border with Ukraine. The Russians are constructing pontoon bridges to evacuate their troops, but these are vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes. Meanwhile, civilians are fleeing the eastern city of Pokrovsk as Russian forces advance, with local authorities ordering families to evacuate. The Ukrainian attack was partly intended to slow Russia's advance on Pokrovsk, but Russia has intensified its efforts in the Donetsk front. 'The situation is dire,' said a military source, 'and the Russians are in a desperate bid to contain the Ukrainian advance.'

**Putin's Men Inflict Pain On Zelensky: Capture Zhelanne In Donetsk, 'Kill' 2,000+ Troops In A Day**
Russian forces have captured the village of Zhelanne in Donetsk region, according to the Russian Defence Ministry. The ministry also reported that over 2,000 Ukrainian troops were killed in the past day, with Russian forces engaging them in 131 areas along the frontline. This comes amid reports of an ultimatum by Vladimir Putin to Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the Kursk region by October 1. 'The Russian Defence Ministry said that troops gained control of Zhelanne, which lies between the cities of Donetsk and Pokrovsk,' as reported by the source. The reported gains by Russian forces have sparked concerns about the ongoing conflict in the region.

**Military Expert Predicts Turning Point in SVO by End of Fall**
Military expert Yevgeny Mikhailov believes that the end of the Special Military Operation (SVO) will be marked by a turning point in the fall. He predicts that Russian forces will capture the key city of Pokrovsk, which supplies the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) with supplies on all fronts, by the end of the fall. Mikhailov stated that Russian forces are only 7-8 kilometers away from Pokrovsk. He believes that this will mark the end of the SVO. 'Autumn will show everything,' Mikhailov said. He also noted that the statement made by the head of the special forces 'Akhmat', General-Major Apti Alaudinov, sounds logical in this context. Mikhailov believes that the battles in the Kursk region will subside within two to three months, and not only the clashes on the border, but the entire SVO will come to an end.

**Ukrainian Military Aims to Trap Russian Forces in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military is attempting to lure Russian forces in the Kursk region into a trap by destroying the bridges that are the only way for them to resupply or retreat. According to The New York Times, the bombing of the bridges is aimed at the territory between the Seim River, the border, and the territory already controlled by Ukraine, in order to trap the Russian forces stationed there. As stated by the Ukrainian Air Force and reported by Russian officials and military commentators on social media, there are three bridges across the river, all of which are now destroyed or damaged. The NYT notes that it is unknown how many Russian soldiers remain in the area between the Seim River and the Ukrainian border. The city of Glushkovo, with a pre-invasion population of around 5,000 people, is located on this territory and is considered a likely next target for the Ukrainian military after the capture of Sudzh. According to Nikolai Beleskov, a military analyst from the 'Return Alive' foundation, the strikes on the bridges make it difficult or impossible for the enemy to maintain their forces south of the Seim River, forcing the Russian forces to retreat from the area. He also notes that if the Ukrainian military advances to the riverbank, they will gain an advantage in the form of a natural barrier against any Russian counterattack. As stated by military historian Vasiliy Pavlov, the strategy of using Ukrainian rivers as a defense becomes apparent as the advance progresses. Ukrainian forces have advanced along two rivers, the Seim and the Psel, each time using the waterway as a natural barrier to prevent counterattacks. According to the NYT, although the ultimate military goals of Ukraine are unknown, if the Ukrainian military advances deeper into Russian territory, they may be able to bring key railway nodes within range of artillery fire. Ukrainian and Russian military commentators also note the Ukrainian bombing of the Russian city of Tetkino, located on the southern edge of the area where Russian forces may be trapped, which would put even more pressure on Russian forces in the region.

**Thousands Of Russian Troops In Kursk Likely Trapped By Blown Bridges**
Thousands of Russian troops are trapped on the south side of the Seim River in Russia's Kursk Oblast due to Ukraine blowing up the three bridges crossing it. The Russian forces have little room to maneuver as the Seim River snakes around that part of Kursk Oblast to the Ukrainian border and Ukrainian troops are pushing to the west toward Glushkovo. Ukraine is attempting to push eastward through that part of Kursk by taking Tetkino, a border village, and the goal is to trap Russian troops in a pincer. According to Ukrainian data, between 2,000 and 3,000 Russian soldiers remain inside the cauldron. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if their partners had lifted the restrictions on long-range weapons, they would not have gone to Kursk and cleared military facilities there. Zelensky also stated that Ukraine has captured the largest number of Russian prisoners in a single operation and has cleared the Russian border area opposite their Sumy region. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops to retake Kursk by Oct. 1 while not withdrawing from key areas in Donbas. Ukrainian troops are still about 20 miles southwest of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in Kurchatov, and officials in Kyiv say they have no plans on capturing it. However, Russian troops are digging trenches there. Ukraine's Airborne Assault Troops released video of a German-donated Marder Infantry Fighting Vehicle belonging to the 95th Separate Assault 'Poliska' Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine attacking a Russian position in the Kursk village of Mala Loknya.

**Ukrainian Army Closes in on Russian Forces in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military has opened a new front in the west of the Kursk region, cutting off Russian soldiers from their supply lines. According to both Russian and Ukrainian reports, the Russian border town of Tetkino has been under attack for several days, and the Ukrainians now appear to have occupied a two-kilometer-wide and seven-kilometer-long strip west of the 4,000-inhabitant city, between the state border and the Seim river. 'The situation is developing rapidly,' said a Ukrainian military spokesperson, 'We are making good progress and are confident that we will be able to liberate the occupied territories soon.'

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aims to Isolate Russian Forces**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, crossing the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate over 50 localities and Russian forces in the area by destroying bridges over the Seim River north and exerting pressure from captured areas east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. According to the DeepState analysis platform, the localities of Otruba and its surroundings were conquered by Ukraine, while six kilometers and the locality of Tétkino are disputed. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the localities of Snagost and Apanasovka. The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim in the last few days and is attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, stated, 'The majority of the district has been isolated from the rest of Russia and will fall in a matter of days,' while Shuklínov also noted that several thousand Russian troops risk being surrounded, with the only way to escape being to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and cross the river on foot. This potential victory would place another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control, according to Shuklínov, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha.

**Ukraine Expands Its Offensive in Kursk, Capturing New Territory**
Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState. 'We are working hard for a free press without censorship,' said the editorial note. 'Independent journalism needs your support to continue and ensure that uncomfortable news that you don't want to read is still available to you. Today, with your support, we will continue working tirelessly for a free press!'

Kovalenko argues that Russia has not transferred enough troops to the area to stop the Ukrainian advances, which have continued although their pace has slowed down after the first days of rapid progress. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that the operation aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' he emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Capture New Villages**
Ukrainian forces continued their assault on the entire salient in the Kursk region, with minor advances on the southeast of Sudji, according to the Institute for the Study of War. 'On August 18, Ukrainian forces continued to assault the entire salient in the Kursk region and made minor advances southeast of Sudji,' the ISW report stated. Ukrainian forces have captured the villages of Troitskoye and Semenovka, with the latter being approximately 24 kilometers from the border. The Russian Ministry of Defense and milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces were shelling the areas around Korenevo, Komarovka, Olgovka, Alexeevka, Safonovka, Kromskie Byki, Kauchuk, Sheptukhovka, Cherkasskoye Porichye, Russkoye Porichye, Ozerki, Giry, and Borok. However, according to geolocation footage from August 17 and 18, Ukrainian forces have been operating 'within the maximum declared limit' of their advance in the Kursk region. A Russian war correspondent claimed that there is unconfirmed information that Ukrainian forces have entered the village of Otruba north of Tetkino, while another war correspondent stated that Ukrainian forces are operating near Tetkino. The commander of the PS, Nikolai Oleschuk, published geolocation footage from August 18, showing Ukrainian forces striking a bridge over the Seim River in Zvanoe. As reported by the DeepState on August 19, Ukrainian forces have expanded their foothold in the Kursk region, capturing three more villages. According to the head of the Sumy MVA, Alexei Drizdov, the breakthrough in the Kursk region is the first stage of the Ukrainian offensive, which caught the enemy off guard.'

**Russian Observers Acknowledge Failure to Liberate Kursk Region**
Russian military observers have acknowledged that their army is unable to start the liberation of territories captured by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region. According to the Russian military Telegram channel 'Dva Maiora', the situation remains complex and it is too early to speak of the Russian army's transition to an operation to expel the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Russian territory. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that on August 18, Ukrainian forces continued to storm the entire salient in the Kursk region and made some progress southeast of Sudzha. Additionally, Ukrainian forces recently advanced north of Martynivka. On August 18, a Russian milblogger stated that Ukrainian forces had captured Troitskoye (south of Korenevo and approximately 2 kilometers from the international border) and were advancing on Semenovka (north of Sudzha and approximately 24 kilometers from the international border). The Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a storm on the outskirts of Korenevo, as well as north and southeast of Sudzha. Geolocation footage published on August 17 and 18 indicates that Ukrainian forces continue to operate along the entire declared limit of Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region. There are unconfirmed visual reports that Ukrainian forces have entered Otruba (north of Tetkino) and are operating on the western bank of the Seim River.

**Ukrainian Forces May Attempt to Break Through to Karizh, Military Correspondent Warns**
Military correspondent Alexander Kot analyzed the Ukrainian army's attacks on bridges across the Seim River in the Kursk region. He noted that Ukrainian forces are using guided bombs to destroy bridges in the Glushkovsky district. The attacks have targeted bridges in the areas of the settlements of Glushkovo, Karizh, and Zvanoe. 'The enemy has cut off our logistics for a significant territory bordering Ukraine,' Kot emphasized. He believes that in the near future, Ukrainian forces may attempt to 'break through' to the settlement of Tetkino and then to Karizh via the road connecting the two. Kot also suggested that Ukrainian forces may try to open a new front in the area of the settlement of Grukhovo in the Sumy region, with the goal of capturing the city of Rylsk and expanding their foothold on the Seim River. 'Perhaps they are holding heavy Western equipment in reserve, which we have not seen on this front yet,' Kot speculated. He also noted that Ukrainian forces have continued to supply goods to the area via pontoon bridges, despite the destruction of all bridges by Russian forces.

**Ukrainian Forces Capture Russian Soldier on Left Bank of Dnieper River**
The Ukrainian Defense Forces have taken a Russian soldier prisoner in the Krynky area on the left bank of the Kherson region. According to Dmitry Likhoy, a spokesperson for the 'Tavria' operational-strategic group of the ZSU, the Russian forces stormed Ukrainian positions on the islands west of Krynky, but were repelled. 'This is a rare occurrence when a Russian soldier is captured on the left bank of the Dnieper River,' Likhoy said. 'It's because our units are involved in crossing the Dnieper, but it does happen.' The captured soldier will be added to the exchange fund and provide testimony about the Russian contingent, including on the left bank of the Kherson region. The left bank of the Kherson region remains under Russian control, but the Ukrainian forces have been holding a foothold near Krynky since the fall of 2023. Ukrainian forces have been fighting for islands between the right and left banks near Krynky, with 788 Ukrainian soldiers reported missing in action in the Krynky area between October 2023 and June 2024, and 262 bodies recovered and buried.

**Russian Forces Retreat Across Seim River in Kursk Region**
Russian forces are likely retreating on the northern flank in the Kursk region, according to several Russian Z-channels on August 17. The Russian army has allegedly organized a retreat to the eastern bank of the Seim River at Tetkino, with populated areas evacuated and two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi destroyed. Propagandists reported, 'The Russian army has retreated to the eastern bank of the Seim River at Tetkino. The populated areas have been evacuated. Two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi have been blown up as the enemy approached. New prepared defense lines have been occupied.' The area, where Tetkino is located, is isolated from the rest of Russia by the Seim River and has been set up as a trap by the Ukrainian military. Yesterday, August 16, the largest bridge on the Seim River was destroyed, which was used to supply the Russian left-bank group. Only two bridges remain, one of which is damaged and the other is close to the Ukrainian border. In this situation, the Russian army's retreat across the river is inevitable, as the alternative is encirclement. Yuri Podolyak, a Z-war correspondent, reports that the Ukrainian military is advancing towards Tetkino, with villages Apanasievka and Byahovo already under their control, as confirmed by the OSINT resource DeepState. It appears that the Ukrainian capture of these territories is only a matter of time, and the Russian army will have to retreat from the entire left bank. If the Ukrainian military secures the Seim River, they will be able to hold the captured territories for a long time.

**Russian Army 'Organized Retreat' from Seim River Near Tetkino**
The Russian army has 'organized its retreat' to the eastern bank of the Seim River near Tetkino, according to Russian Telegram channels on August 17. The channels reported that the populated areas have been evacuated, two bridges in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi have been blown up, and new prepared defensive positions have been occupied. As reported by the 'Divanny General Staff' channel, 'The villages have been evacuated, two bridges, in Tetkino and Popovo-Lezhachi, have been blown up at the approach of the enemy. New prepared defensive positions have been occupied.' The Seim River separates the Russian-Ukrainian border, and Tetkino is located on its eastern bank. The Russian Ministry of Defense has not officially confirmed the retreat. On August 16, Russian media reported that Ukrainian defense forces likely destroyed a crucial bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region. Initially, it was claimed that several HIMARS rockets were fired at the bridge, but later, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Forces, Nikolai Oleschuk, published a video of a Ukrainian air strike on the bridge. User Sergey Prokhorov published a video on social media showing a map with three bridges over the Seim River. He stated that the other two bridges in the area are less suitable for supply purposes. He believes that the bridge in Glushkovo was the only one that provided a significant supply line to a large area surrounded by the river and Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian military launched an offensive in the Kursk region on August 6, and fighting has continued in the region since then. Media reported that Russia had redeployed troops and equipment from the Belgorod and Donetsk regions to the Kursk region. Since August 9, a counter-terrorism operation has been introduced in three neighboring regions: Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod. On August 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian forces were conducting an operation in the Kursk region, capturing hundreds of Russian soldiers. The first Ukrainian military command, led by General-Major Eduard Moskalov, was established.

**Ukrainian Military Allegedly Destroys Bridge on Kursk Region, Cutting Off Area**
Russian social media groups claim that the Ukrainian military allegedly destroyed a bridge over the Seim River near the village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region on August 16. The bridge is a crucial artery for civilian and military logistics in the area. Russian propagandists claim that the Ukrainian military allegedly fired several American HIMARS rockets at the bridge, as well as two MLRS projectiles, one of which allegedly hit a car carrying Russian 'volunteers'. After the last strike, one of the bridge's spans collapsed. The area is now cut off, affecting villages such as Tetkino, Popovo-Lyazhachi, Volfino, and 27 others. Russian propagandist Roman Alekhin claims that the Ukrainian military allegedly also attacked a bridge in the village of Zvane in the Glushkovsky district and plans to capture a section of the district along the Seim River. Russian military propagandists predict further Ukrainian actions, including taking control of the E38 highway and attacking from the Glukhov side. Analysts note that the Ukrainian military has successfully expanded its territory of operation to 1,150 square kilometers, with 507.76 square kilometers under Ukrainian control and 640.92 square kilometers in a 'gray zone'. Ukrainian forces are likely engaged in battles in the Korenevo area, where another Russian column was allegedly destroyed. Russians complain that Korenevo blocks the road to Rylsk, and that capturing Rylsk would leave a number of border posts in the area without supplies and support.

**Ukraine touts capture of large group of soldiers inside Russia**
Ukrainian special forces captured a group of 102 Russian soldiers, the largest group since Russia's full-scale invasion, in the western Russian region of Kursk. The soldiers, part of the 488th Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment and the 'Akhmat' unit, were captured in a well-fortified company stronghold. According to a source in the Security Service of Ukraine, 'They captured and cleared a sprawling, concrete and well-fortified company stronghold from all sides - with underground communications and personnel accommodation, a canteen, an armoury and even a bathhouse.' The captured soldiers will be swapped for Ukrainian prisoners of war, as part of a regular exchange between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine has secured the return of 3,405 people from Russian captivity since the start of the invasion in February 2022.

According to the ISW report, Ukrainian forces have entered the western part of the Kursk region in the areas of Slobodka-Ivanovka, Tetkino, Gordeevka, Uspenka, and Viktorovka. Russian sources claim that Ukrainian forces have captured Slobodka-Ivanovka, Uspenka, and Viktorovka. 'The latest geolocation images indicate that Ukrainian forces have recently advanced within Kremnevo and east of Zhuravli,' said the ISW report. Ukrainian forces have also advanced in the forest near Semenovka, north and east of Lgov, and in the area of Kauchuk, south of Lgov. Geolocation images show that Ukrainian forces have been active in Sudja and the northern part of Zaoleshenka, and have allegedly captured Sudja and Spalnoye. Ukrainian forces have also been spotted in the northern part of Giry, south-east of Sudja, and have set up a ambush in the central part of Giry.

**Russian Troops Advance into Strategic Town of Tschassiw Jar in Eastern Ukraine**
Russian troops have advanced into the strategic town of Tschassiw Jar in eastern Ukraine, according to reports. The town had previously been a natural defense line for Ukraine, formed by the Siwerskyj-Donez-Donbass-Kanal. Due to daily bombardments by Russia, the evacuation of children and their caregivers has been ordered in areas of the Donetsk region, including Tschassiw Jar. As reported by military bloggers, Russian units have crossed the canal at several points and are attempting to establish themselves in the city. The US Institute for War Studies (ISW) also reported that Russian troops were operating west of the canal. The eastern part of the city, beyond the canal, had been abandoned by Ukrainian forces in July. According to the Ukrainian General Staff, there have been 140 individual battles on the eastern and southern fronts since Saturday morning, indicating intense fighting. Tschassiw Jar is located west of the city of Bachmut, which was captured by Russia in 2023 after months of heavy fighting. The town has since been a key stronghold, protecting important cities in Ukraine's rear such as Kostjantyniwka and Kramatorsk. Despite the intense fighting, the Russian army has not yet achieved a breakthrough in their summer offensive. The evacuation of children was ordered by the Governor of Donetsk, Wadym Filaschkin, who said, 'The enemy is bombing the cities and villages of these communities every day, so it was decided to bring children with their parents or legal guardians to safety.'

**Russia Claims Capture of New Village in Eastern Ukraine**
Russia has claimed to have captured a new village in eastern Ukraine, continuing its slow progress on the front line against a less well-equipped and less numerous opponent. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the village of Novosselivka Persha in the Donetsk region was captured by Russian units, as stated in their daily report. 'The units of the Centre troops group have liberated the locality of Novosselivka Persha (...) during active operations,' the ministry said. The village is located about 20 kilometers from the city of Avdiïvka, which was captured by Russian forces in February 2024. Russia has been gradually gaining ground since the failure of Ukraine's large-scale counter-offensive in the summer of 2023 and the capture of Avdiïvka, which had served as a fortified position for the Ukrainian army.

The Russian army's attacks, although with many losses in soldiers and material, are breaking through Ukrainian defenses in some sectors, although Russia has not yet achieved a decisive breakthrough. The Ukrainian army is facing the numerical and material superiority of Russia, which has more ammunition and is using massive guided bombs, difficult to avoid and which annihilate even the strongest fortifications. Ukrainian forces lack arms and ammunition compared to the Russians, despite the resumption of Western aid after months of blockages. They also have difficulties in increasing their ranks to face the heavy losses accumulated over more than two years of war since the start of the Russian attack.

According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have recently regained lost positions on the northern direction, while Russian forces have made advances on several fronts. ISW analysts believe that Russia has likely captured the village of Rаботино, which was liberated by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in the summer of 2023. Russian forces have also advanced in the areas north of Rаботино, near Malaya Tokmachka, and in the areas west of Donetsk. Ukrainian forces have reportedly retreated from some areas, allowing Russian forces to advance. However, ISW has not confirmed some of the Russian claims, including the capture of certain villages and the advancement of Russian forces in certain areas.

**Kots assesses the capture of Lozovatka by the Russian army**
Military correspondent Alexander Kots said that the capture of the settlement of Lozovatka by the Russian army allows for the expansion of the Russian military's advance west of Avdeevka. According to Kots, the frontline now exceeds 17 kilometers in length, from Lozovatka in the north to Karlovka in the south. The Russian army can now bypass the Volchya River from the north without having to cross it under enemy fire. Kots also expressed the possibility that the defensive lines built by the Ukrainian Armed Forces along the riverbank will be abandoned. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the capture of Lozovatka on July 27, attributing it to the efforts of the 'Center' grouping of troops.

**Ukrainian Forces Repel Large-Scale Russian Mechanized Attack near Kostiantynivka**
Ukrainian forces repelled a large-scale Russian mechanized attack near Kostiantynivka, Donetska Oblast, on July 24. The attack, which was the largest since October 2023, involved up to a battalion-sized force, including 11 tanks, 45 armored vehicles, and 200 personnel. Ukrainian forces used artillery, drones, and minefields to repel the attack, destroying or damaging six Russian tanks, seven armored vehicles, and all 12 motorcycles. The Russian forces retreated after the first wave of equipment was destroyed. Analysts note that this is the first large-scale mechanized attack by Russian forces in the Donetska Oblast since March 2024. The Russian military likely aimed to advance further towards Kostiantynivka as part of their efforts to capture the town and cut off the T-0524 highway. Ukrainian forces are expected to continue to hold their positions in the area, and the Russian military is unlikely to achieve significant operational successes in the near future.

**Russia Announces Capture of Two Ukrainian Villages**
The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that its forces have recaptured several cities in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army, outnumbered, is facing difficulties. According to Le Figaro, the Russian army captured two small towns in eastern Ukraine, continuing its advance despite significant losses and fewer Ukrainian forces. The Russian Defense Ministry reported that Western Group units had 'recovered the localities of Rozovka and Pestchanoïe Nijnee'. The towns, sparsely populated before the large-scale Russian offensive in February 2022, are located in the Lugansk and Kharkiv regions, about 15 kilometers apart. Since last autumn, the Ukrainian army, lacking manpower and firepower, has been facing Russian attacks along a 1,000-kilometer front line.

**Russia claims capture of two towns in eastern Ukraine**
Russia's army claimed to have captured two small towns in eastern Ukraine, Rozovka and Pestchanoïe Nijnee, despite heavy losses and a lack of manpower. The towns, located in the regions of Louhansk and Kharkiv, were previously sparsely populated before the large-scale Russian attack in February 2022. The Ukrainian army, lacking men and firepower, has been facing Russian attacks along the front line, which stretches for nearly 1000 km, since the fall. The Russian forces have taken several small towns in recent weeks, particularly in the Donetsk region, pushing towards the cities of New York and Toretsk. However, these attacks have not yet resulted in a significant breakthrough that could change the situation on the front.

**'There is a risk...': Russians may have captured important village, what does it threaten**
Russian occupiers may have captured the important village of Progress in Donetsk, Ukraine. According to analysts from DeepState, the Russian forces have been able to turn the tide of the battle in their favor over the past 48 hours. The fighting began at the end of April and Ukrainian forces have been able to hold off the attacks, but with significant losses. 'When the enemy launched a massive assault on July 19, almost the entire village was left undefended. Emergency reinforcements arrived from another mechanized brigade, which took up positions on the western street of the village. On July 20, due to the lack of sufficient infantry and its forces had to retreat. Now, the other brigade, which is stationed along the railway, has had to adjust its positions to the flank. Moreover, there is a risk of encirclement. There is no order to straighten the line.,' said the analysts. Ukrainian forces are trying to prevent the enemy from achieving their goals. 'The enemy's further advance has two goals. The first is to approach or cut off the Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka road. Additionally, west of Vozdvizhensk, there is a height of 229.0. The second goal is to move along the ridge, along which the railway runs, with a further exit to the height of 224.8 and Novohrodivka. Unfortunately, we cannot provide more details. Ukrainian Defense Forces are trying to prevent the enemy from achieving any of their goals.,' said DeepState. It is worth noting that earlier, on July 14, Russian occupiers claimed to have captured the village in Donetsk. The Russian Ministry of Defense has already reported that the village is being cleared and demined.,

**Russia Announces Capture of New Location in Donetsk Province**
Russia announced the capture of a new location in the Ukrainian province of Donetsk, located in the eastern part of the country, as part of the advances made during the past months as a result of the invasion launched in February 2022 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Defense Ministry stated in a Telegram post that the Central Group forces took control of Yurievka after a series of 'active operations'. Additionally, it reported that Russian troops repelled 38 'counterattacks' by Ukrainian forces in the area. Russian forces have achieved several advances in the province, including the capture of the important city of Avdivka in February, which has been used as a platform to advance towards Chasiv Yar and surrounding villages. Donetsk, along with Lugansk, Jersón, and Zaporiyia, which are partially occupied as part of the invasion, was annexed by Russia in October 2022, a move not recognized by the international community, which added to the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

**Ukraine Troops Abandon Village That Became Symbol of 2023 Counteroffensive**
Ukraine's forces have withdrawn from the village of Urozhaine in the Donetsk region, which was a significant location in their 2023 counteroffensive. The village was recaptured by Ukraine's 37th and 38th separate marine brigades in October 2023, giving them a strategic foothold on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnieper River. The area has seen intense fighting and heavy losses on both sides, but Ukraine's General Staff reported that their troops were maintaining positions near Krynky and other left-bank bridgeheads on May 27.

**Ruins of the 'Kanal' Microdistrict in Chasiv Yar: Captured by Russian Forces**
Photos taken from above show the ruins of the 'Kanal' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk region, which was captured by Russian forces. The area is now similar to the nearby city of Bakhmut, which is less than 10 kilometers away. The microdistrict, located on the other side of the canal towards Bakhmut, has no surviving homes. The area is covered in craters from Russian bombs and shells, and even trees and bushes have not grown between the former high-rise buildings due to enemy shelling. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to shell the city and surrounding areas. The 'Kanal' microdistrict is separated from the rest of the city by the Seversky Donets-Dnieper canal, where Ukrainian forces are currently holding their defense. The battles on this section began in early April 2024, when the aggressor advanced along the entire front west of Bakhmut. Russian forces, with their advantage in weapons and ammunition, first destroyed all homes and buildings in 'Kanal', and then 'captured' the ruins, calling their actions 'liberation'. However, they were only able to do so after Ukrainian forces announced on July 3 that they had withdrawn from the microdistrict, as it was no longer feasible to hold it, and the defenders' positions were destroyed. According to OBOZ.UA, there are still 635 local residents living in the city of Chasiv Yar, including young people. Since the beginning of this week, no one has agreed to evacuate from the settlement, where battles are taking place.

**Ukraine: Russian forces claim capture of key district in Tchassiv Iar**
Russian forces have claimed to have captured the Noviï district in the city of Tchassiv Iar, in the Donetsk region, according to a statement from the Russian Ministry. It is unclear if Russian soldiers have managed to cross the canal that separates this peripheral district from the rest of the city. Tchassiv Iar, located on high ground, is a key gateway to the major mining cities of the Donbass region, including Kramatorsk, the main Ukrainian-controlled city in the region. Ukraine had admitted in recent weeks that the situation was difficult for its troops and had sent reinforcements to the area. The Telegram channel DeepState, close to Ukrainian military sources, stated that the district of Tchassiv Iar had been completely destroyed and that holding onto it would only lead to increased losses. Therefore, the withdrawal of the district is a logical, if difficult, decision. Tchassiv Iar is 10 kilometers from Bakhmout, which was captured by Russian forces in May 2023 at the cost of a particularly bloody and destructive battle. Since the fall of 2023, Russia has had the initiative on the front, thanks to an under-strength and ammunition-depleted Ukrainian army. Russian forces have been gradually gaining ground for months, but have not yet managed to break through Ukrainian lines to achieve a military victory.

**Russia Advances on Northern Direction, Captures Two Populated Areas**
According to the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian forces have advanced on the northern direction and likely captured two populated areas. The ISW cited a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense claiming that parts of the Russian Southern Group of Forces have captured the village of Spirne in Donetsk Oblast, located south-east of Siversk. The ISW did not confirm or deny this information. The same institute limited itself to citing a statement from a Russian military analyst that Russian forces are clearing the village of Rozdolivka (south of Siversk) and trying to advance further west from the settlement. Interactive maps updated by the Ukrainian information resource DeepState on June 30, 2024, at 14:10, show both villages in an area with an uncertain status. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces did not report on the withdrawal of Ukrainian units from the named settlements. Only mentioned that intense battles are taking place on the northern direction - Ukrainian Defense Forces repelled eight enemy attacks near Spirne, Verkhnyokamianske, and Vyimka in Donetsk Oblast.
