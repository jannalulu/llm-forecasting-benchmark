**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

*Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Yesterday was the big day. So, did the price exceed $3.25?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Our models had it at 85.67%. And, as predicted, it did exceed. The price was $3.29.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Incredible accuracy again. The geopolitical tensions and the hurricane season played out just as we modeled.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
Remember, the last news we had was from September 9. Even with limited information, our models held strong.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
It’s fascinating how the variables aligned. The market fluctuations, the supply chain dynamics...

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
And yet, with all those factors, our Brier scores remain impeccable.

*They nod, a quiet satisfaction in the room.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Let’s see what the next prediction holds.

INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table cluttered with laptops and coffee cups. They stare at the screen displaying the AAA gas price tracker.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Metaculus Admins checked, and the national price was $3.24.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 98.75% for staying below $3.25. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
No surprises there. We factored in the recent stability in crude oil prices and the lack of geopolitical tensions up to September 9th.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It’s fascinating how the price dipped just enough. The data from early September was crucial.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed, a 1.25% chance of exceeding $3.25 was always slim. The models never lie.

They nod in agreement, content with their accurate prediction.

FADE OUT.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
So, the national gas price didn't exceed $3.25 yesterday. Our models had it at 85.67%.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. Given the data up to September 9, it seemed unlikely. The geopolitical tensions eased, and the hurricane season was milder than expected.

FORECASTER 3

Our models factored in the recent economic policies too. The stabilization efforts worked better than anticipated.
