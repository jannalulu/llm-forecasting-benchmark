*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a small table, sipping their coffees, surrounded by the buzz of a busy café.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, about the measles cases... Did we hit that 200 to 300 range by September 30?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. The CDC reported only 167 cases as of July 15, and the trend didn't suggest a sudden spike.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and given the vaccination campaigns and public health measures, it seemed unlikely. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The models accounted for those factors, and the lack of major outbreaks in recent news supported our prediction.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how these probabilities reflect reality. Even with uncertainties, the models stay robust.

*They both nod, taking in the accuracy of their predictions, as the bustling café continues around them.*

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered between them.

NATE: So, the big question—did the U.S. report more than 200 and less than or equal to 300 measles cases by September 30?

PHILIP: (shakes head) No, our models had it at 35.67%. With only 167 cases reported by July 15, the trajectory seemed unlikely.

NATE: Right. Given the vaccination efforts and public awareness campaigns, a surge was improbable.

PHILIP: Exactly. The CDC's biweekly updates painted a clear picture. Even without additional data post-July, the trend was evident.

NATE: It's fascinating how our models continue to align with reality. A testament to robust forecasting.

PHILIP: Absolutely. It's not just about numbers; it's understanding the broader context.

They exchange a knowing nod, their confidence in their predictive prowess reaffirmed.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: On September 30, 2024, did we see more than 200 but less than or equal to 300 measles cases in the U.S.?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.42%. With 167 cases reported by July 15, the probability never crossed the 50% threshold.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Despite the uptick earlier this year, our models accurately predicted containment efforts would cap the numbers.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The July data was crucial. The CDC's biweekly updates were consistent, and our forecasts reflected that stability.

**NATE SILVER**
