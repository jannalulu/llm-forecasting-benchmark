Thomas said, 'Obviously, I haven't felt that great at the plate lately, but I was happy to come in and take a good at-bat.' The Guardians held on to their lead in the American League Central, while the Yankees dropped to second place in the American League East.

**Yankees climb above Orioles, Guardians to secure best record in MLB for first time since June**
The New York Yankees have secured the best record in Major League Baseball for the first time since June 21. Their win over the Tigers, combined with losses by the Orioles and Guardians, gave them the top spot in the MLB standings. The Yankees had a poor stretch from June 7 to July 26, losing 15 times in 26 games, but have since rebounded with a 13-5 record in their last 18 games. However, their lead is precarious, and they could fall to second place in the AL East if they lose and the Orioles win on Saturday. The Yankees have two games remaining against the Tigers and will host the Guardians next week, while their final series against the Orioles is scheduled for September 24-26 at Yankee Stadium.

**Yankees have key advantage over Orioles, Guardians in final playoff push**
The New York Yankees have regained their momentum, winning five consecutive games, including a sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies. With the final two months of the season approaching, the Yankees have a significant advantage, boasting the third-easiest strength of schedule (.477) in MLB, according to Tankathon's rankings. In contrast, the Baltimore Orioles have the 10th-easiest schedule (.496), while the Cleveland Guardians have the fourth-most difficult schedule (.520). The Yankees must capitalize on this opportunity, particularly in their upcoming series against the Orioles (Sept. 24-26) and Guardians (Aug. 20-22), to maintain their head-to-head record and secure a strong playoff push.

**This Playoff Matchup Would Be Catastrophic For The Guardians**
The Cleveland Guardians are at risk of facing the New York Yankees in a Wild Card game if they lose their lead in the AL Central. The Guardians have a 3.5 game lead over the Kansas City Royals, but with 17 games remaining, the Royals could take the lead and demote the Guardians to a Wild Card spot. The Yankees and Baltimore Orioles are separated by just a half-game in the AL East, and if both teams win their divisions, the likely matchup in a Wild Card game would be the Guardians and Yankees. The Guardians have a poor record against the Yankees, with a 2-4 record and being outscored 36-22. Star player Aaron Judge has been particularly dominant against the Guardians, hitting five home runs in 24 at-bats. The Guardians would likely finish below the Yankees in the standings if they lose their lead, and would then have to play in New York for the three-game series, where they have a record of 40-37. 'The end of the season is important for the Guardians,' said the article, 'to keep the Yankees as far away as possible, the team should look to clinch the AL Central.'

**Juan Soto Unconcerned About The Battle For The AL East Title**
Juan Soto, a New York Yankees player, expressed his focus on winning games rather than worrying about the AL East title. 'We're really focused on what we can do here,' he said. 'We're trying to win games and that's all that matters now.' The Yankees are tied with the Cleveland Guardians for the best record in the American League, 0.5 games behind the Orioles. The division winner would likely earn a bye in the first round of the playoffs, while the second-place team would face the Houston Astros. The Yankees and Orioles play a three-game series at Yankee Stadium before the final weekend of the season, with the Orioles having won six of their 10 matchups this season.

**New York Yankees Surpass Their 2023 Win Total With Latest Victory**
The New York Yankees have surpassed their 2023 win total with their 83rd victory of the season, putting them in a better position than last year. The team has a 1.5-game lead on the Baltimore Orioles for first place in the American League East and a one-game lead over the Cleveland Guardians for the top seed in the AL. The Yankees have enjoyed a great season on both sides of the ball, with the 2nd-best OPS (.770) in MLB and the 16th-toughest schedule remaining. According to The Post and Courier, 'The Yankees have the longest active streak in the sport for winning seasons.' The team's manager has not been quoted in the article, but the team's performance speaks for itself.

**MLB has no elite teams. Here's what's holding each contender back.**
The MLB season has been marked by a lack of juggernauts and parity among teams. No team is on pace for more than 96 wins, with the Los Angeles Dodgers being the only team on pace to reach 96 wins. The Dodgers' rotation has been plagued by injuries, including those to Shohei Ohtani, Max Muncy, and Clayton Kershaw. The Philadelphia Phillies have struggled with their stars not playing to their usual standards since the all-star break, but their combination of Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola at the top is still formidable. The New York Yankees' lineup has been consistently inconsistent, limiting their ability to sustain dominance. The Baltimore Orioles' rotation has been decimated by injuries, and their bullpen has struggled, with closer Craig Kimbrel continuing to struggle. The Cleveland Guardians' offense has struggled since July, and they will need to rediscover their early-season form to finish the season strong.

**Dynamic duo: Juan Soto, Aaron Judge power Yankees' offense in win over Guardians**
The New York Yankees cruised to an 8-1 victory over the Cleveland Guardians, thanks to the power hitting of Juan Soto and Aaron Judge. Soto hit a two-run homer in the first inning, his 36th of the season, and added a double in the fourth, while Judge hit two-run and solo homers, bringing his season total to 47. Judge is leading the majors in RBI (117), OBP (.465), and slugging (.722), and is on pace to break his own American League single-season record of 62 homers set in 2022. Nestor Cortes pitched seven strong innings, holding the Guardians scoreless and surrendering just three hits. The Yankees are looking for a rubber-match win in Thursday's game, with Gerrit Cole scheduled to start.

**Guardians vs. Yankees prediction, odds, pick for Wed. 8/21**
The Cleveland Guardians are looking to secure the series win against the New York Yankees with left-hander Joey Cantillo on the mound. The Yankees' Nestor Cortes will oppose Cantillo, and the Guardians' bullpen is considered one of the best in baseball. The market is being too generous with the Guardians' moneyline, and the author of this article believes that the Guardians will win due to their bullpen advantage. The Yankees' bullpen has been struggling, and the Guardians' offense has a good chance to break through late against the Yankees' pen. The author recommends betting on the Guardians ML, as the uncertainty of Cantillo and Cortes' performances doesn't comfort them taking either side of the total.

**Guardians' Stephen Vogt reacts to winning longest game of season vs. Yankees**
The Cleveland Guardians defeated the New York Yankees 9-5 in the longest game of the 2024 season, which went 12 innings. Stephen Vogt praised both teams for their endurance, saying, 'What an unbelievable game by both teams. Someone had to outlast the other, and fortunately, it was us.' Lane Thomas' RBI double in the top of the 12th inning sparked a six-run inning for the Guardians, who moved to 73-52 on the season. The team's win over the Yankees is a good sign for their playoff chances, but they will need to improve their offense, which ranks 13th in the league with 572 runs scored. The Guardians' starting pitching has been a concern, ranking 23rd in MLB with a 4.54 ERA. However, the team has shown potential, and Vogt said, 'It was a huge hit for him, obviously, it was a huge hit for us. It was just something that we needed, and for him to come through, I know that's going to be big for him. And it catapulted that huge inning.'

The New York Yankees are looking to continue their strong performance in the American League, and their next series against the Cleveland Guardians could be a turning point in the second half of the season.

**Yankees climb above Orioles, Guardians to secure best record in MLB for first time since June**
The New York Yankees have secured the best record in Major League Baseball for the first time since June 21. Their win over the Tigers, combined with losses by the Orioles and Guardians, gave them the top spot in the MLB standings. The Yankees had a poor stretch from June 7 to July 26, losing 15 times in 26 games, but have since rebounded with a 13-5 record in their last 18 games. However, their lead is precarious, and they could fall to second place in the AL East if they lose and the Orioles win on Saturday. The Yankees have two games remaining against the Tigers and will host the Guardians next week, while their final series against the Orioles is scheduled for September 24-26 at Yankee Stadium.

**Yankees' Struggles Against Weaker Teams Raise Concerns for 2024 Season**
The New York Yankees, one of the most iconic franchises in Major League Baseball history, are facing a concerning situation in the 2024 season. Despite having a winning record against each of the 29 teams, their performance against weaker teams has been alarming. Historically, the Yankees have dominated weaker teams, using those victories to strengthen their position in the standings and secure a spot in the postseason. However, in 2024, this script has changed dramatically. After a 12-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox, the worst team in the league, the Yankees have a record of 27-23 against teams with a losing record. This performance is alarming, especially for a team that aspires to the postseason and the World Series. Aaron Boone's team has struggled against teams with a winning record, particularly when allowing five or more runs, with a record of 13-35. Despite recent problems, the Yankees still have time to turn their situation around, with a six-game road trip that includes two more games against the White Sox and three against the Detroit Tigers. As of now, the team's overall record is 70-50, with a winning percentage of .583, placing them in third place in the young American League East and fifth in the Major Leagues. Their +107 run differential is the best in the Majors, indicating that, despite their problems, the team has the ability to score and prevent runs at a high level. The first matchup against a team with a winning record will be on August 20 against the Cleveland Guardians.

The 2024 MLB season has seen a shift in power with the top teams from June 15 now struggling to maintain their pace. The New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Guardians, and Philadelphia Phillies were all on a 105-win pace, but have since dropped off. The Arizona Diamondbacks, San Diego Padres, Houston Astros, and New York Mets have taken over as the top teams. The season is heating up with division races tightening, and several key players to watch down the stretch. The NL MVP race is also closer than expected, with Shohei Ohtani and Ketel Marte leading the pack. Additionally, the possibility of a sub-.300 batting champion and a pitcher winning 20 games are also on the table.

**Why Are There No Good Teams In Baseball This Year?**
The 2024 Major League Baseball season has seen a lack of dominant teams, with the Cleveland Guardians currently on pace for 96 wins and a run differential corresponding to a 93-win team. According to Baseball-Reference's simple rating system, only the Yankees are more than a run per game better than the average MLB team. The MLB's incentive structure, including the addition of a third wild-card spot, has led to parity among teams. Owners are investing in their rosters to reach the 80-85 win threshold, and the free agency market has provided valuable depth for teams. Additionally, the proliferation of analytics has led to improved pitch development and design, making it easier for middle-class teams to build competitive rotations. As a result, several division races could go down to the wire, and jockeying for playoff seeding should continue until the final day of the season.

**Yankees have key advantage over Orioles, Guardians in final playoff push**
The New York Yankees have regained their momentum, winning five consecutive games, including a sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies. With the final two months of the season approaching, the Yankees have a significant advantage, boasting the third-easiest strength of schedule (.477) in MLB, according to Tankathon's rankings. In contrast, the Baltimore Orioles have the 10th-easiest schedule (.496), while the Cleveland Guardians have the fourth-most difficult schedule (.520). The Yankees must capitalize on this opportunity, particularly in their upcoming series against the Orioles (Sept. 24-26) and Guardians (Aug. 20-22), to maintain their head-to-head record and secure a strong playoff push.

**Why Cleveland Guardians owe fans a Yankees-esque move at 2024 MLB trade deadline â€” Jimmy Watkins**
Cleveland Guardians' fans are calling for the team to make a move at the 2024 MLB trade deadline, reminiscent of the New York Yankees' strategy. With a record of 63-42, the team is on pace to finish with 97 wins, but fans are concerned that their success may not translate to the playoffs. Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti and general manager Mike Chernoff are urged to add a starting pitcher or two to the roster, as well as outfielder Lane Thomas, to give the team a better chance at winning big. The article argues that the team's front office should be willing to pay for the privilege of adding reinforcements to the roster, even if it means going against their usual principles of developing draft picks and adding peripheral pieces carefully. As the author Jimmy Watkins says, 'Cleveland's baseball fans deserve those memories again. They deserve another Rajai Davis moment.'
