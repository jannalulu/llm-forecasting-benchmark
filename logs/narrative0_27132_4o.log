NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a table, papers scattered around them. A muted TV shows breaking news.

NATE SILVER  
So, Phil, did Iran carry out a deadly attack within Israel before October 1, 2024?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. Despite heightened tensions after the Haniyeh assassination and Khamenei's threats, the attack didn't occur.

NATE SILVER  
Right. The April drone strikes were serious, but no fatalities. Iran's response seemed more symbolic than strategic.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The geopolitical landscape remains volatile, but our models accurately predicted no major escalation.

NATE SILVER  
A testament to our forecasting methods. Let's see how the region evolves from here.

They exchange a knowing nod, the weight of their predictions evident. The TV continues to flash headlines, but the room feels momentarily still.

So, Philip, did Iran carry out a deadly attack within Israel before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. Despite heightened tensions after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and Fuad Shukr, no attack meeting the specified criteria occurred.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the aftermath of those events was tense. Khamenei's vow for revenge seemed ominous, but it didn't materialize within Israel's borders.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. While there were threats and minor skirmishes, nothing reached the scale of five fatalities attributed to Iran inside Israel.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Another close call, but the probabilities held true.
