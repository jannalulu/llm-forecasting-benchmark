INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, surrounded by screens displaying baseball statistics, gather around a table. The tension is palpable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday was a pivotal moment. The Chicago White Sox ended their season with 121 losses.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.67%. They avoided the 124-loss mark, but only just.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Their 21-game losing streak was brutal. It felt like history was repeating itself.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yet, they managed to steer clear of the 1962 Mets' record. Barely.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The 1916 Athletics still hold the worst winning percentage. The Sox were close, but not quite.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's a season for the books, but not the one everyone feared.

They nod in agreement, their models vindicated once again.

FADE OUT.

INT. SPORTS ANALYST STUDIO - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The camera pans to a roundtable of SUPERFORECASTERS. The mood is contemplative.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
As we dissect the White Sox's season, our models had it at 98.75% that they would lose 124 games before October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. Their 21-game losing streak in July was a pivotal factor. The historical context was clear; they were on track to surpass the 1962 Mets' infamous record.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
By September 16, our data was conclusive. Their trajectory was almost inevitable given their performance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The White Sox's final tally? A grim 42-120. Our models were, as always, precise.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's a stark reminder of how predictive analytics can forecast even the most dismal outcomes.

The camera zooms out, capturing the analysts deep in thought, as the screen fades to black.

The camera pans over a sleek studio where two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit across from each other, a large screen displaying MLB standings behind them.

ALEX  
Well, the White Sox have done it. They ended with 125 losses. Our models had it at 95.75%.

JORDAN  
Incredible. Their 21-game losing streak was a major factor. We had foreseen the likelihood of breaking the 1962 Mets' record.

ALEX  
It's a historic season for all the wrong reasons. They were 29-93 by mid-August. The odds were heavily against them turning it around.

JORDAN  
Indeed. With a 23.8% win rate by August, our models were never wrong. It was almost inevitable.

ALEX  
A season to remember, or perhaps, to forget.

They nod solemnly, acknowledging the rarity of such an outcome.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sipping coffee) So, the question on everyone's mind: Did the White Sox hit 124 losses?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 99.99%. As of September 16, they were at 29-93. They needed just 5 more losses in the final stretch.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (nodding) That 21-game losing streak was brutal. Historically, only the '62 Mets and the '03 Tigers were close.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Exactly. By August, they were on pace to break records. The 1916 Athletics had a worse winning percentage, but 124 losses would be unprecedented in the modern era.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (smiling) Well, it happened. They lost 125. A new record.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (sighs) Our models never miss. The Sox just couldn't find their footing.

They clink their coffee mugs, acknowledging the accuracy and inevitability of their prediction.
