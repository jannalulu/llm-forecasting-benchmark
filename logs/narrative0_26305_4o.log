**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind was whether the same nation would clinch more than one women's team sport gold. Our models had this pegged at 68.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Given the historical dominance of countries like the USA in basketball and volleyball, it seemed plausible. But, as it turns out, eight different nations took home gold in each sport.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the resolution is no. Despite the odds, diversity triumphed. Our models were close, but the Olympics always have surprises.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. It's a testament to the growing global competition. Even with our accurate models, the beauty of sports lies in its unpredictability.
