**2024 Emmys: Will 'The Bear' pull a 'Schitt's Creek' and win top 7 comedy categories in same year?**
The FX dramedy 'The Bear' is aiming to become the fourth program in TV history to sweep the top seven Primetime Emmys categories for series, lead actor, lead actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, writing, and directing. The show, about a Chicago beef restaurant, claimed six of the top seven prizes for its first season, but was not eligible for the lead actress category. However, with Ayo Edebiri 'promoted' from supporting to lead actress for Season 2, 'The Bear' now has a shot at winning all top seven categories. The show is currently leading in the Gold Derby predictions for Best Comedy Series, and its Christmas-set episode 'Fishes' is expected to win both Best Comedy Directing and Best Comedy Writing. 'The Bear' is hoping to join the esteemed list of programs that have swept the top seven categories, including 'Angels in America' (2004), 'Schitt's Creek' (2020), and 'The Crown' (2021).

The 2024 Emmys are approaching, with the nomination round of voting taking place from June 13 to June 24. The current frontrunners for Outstanding Comedy Series include 'The Bear', which is likely to win due to its strong second season, and 'Curb Your Enthusiasm', which is tied for most nominations ever in this category. Other contenders include 'Reservation Dogs', 'What We Do in the Shadows', and 'Palm Royale', a freshman show. The nominees are listed in order of their likelihood to win, with 'The Bear' being the top contender. The 76th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards will take place on September 15 and air live on ABC at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT.

**2024 Emmys: Will ‘The Bear' pull a ‘Schitt's Creek' and win top 7 comedy categories in same year?**
Only three TV programs have swept the top seven Primetime Emmys categories: 'Angels in America' (2004), 'Schitt's Creek' (2020), and 'The Crown' (2021). 'The Bear' is hoping to join this list at the 2024 Emmys, but it was not eligible for the lead actress category last year, preventing it from completing the sweep. However, with a savvy category switch, 'The Bear' may be able to win all seven categories this year, including comedy series, lead actor Jeremy Allen White, supporting actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach, supporting actress Ayo Edebiri, and both writing and directing for Christopher Storer.

**Emmys 2024: 'The Bear' is coming for all the awards, but watch out for 'Hacks'**
The Emmys 2024 are approaching, and 'The Bear' is the clear frontrunner for many awards. The show won 10 Emmys for its first season and is expected to dominate the comedy categories again. Jeremy Allen White is likely to win for his performance as Carmy, while Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach are also strong contenders. Jean Smart, who won for the first two seasons of 'Hacks', is expected to win again for her portrayal of Deborah Vance. The article also highlights the strong performances of other actors, including Quinta Brunson, Maya Rudolph, and Bob Odenkirk, but notes that 'The Bear' is the show to beat.

**2024 Emmy Predictions: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series**
The Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category at the 2024 Emmys has a strong frontrunner in Ebon Moss-Bachrach for his role in 'The Bear.' However, voters should not focus solely on this show, as other performances, such as Tyler James Williams in 'Abbott Elementary' and Bowen Yang in 'Saturday Night Live,' are also deserving of recognition. Yang has grown into a dependable player on the show and could be a good time for him to win, especially if voters want to add a stamp of approval to a rising star. Paul W. Downs, an Emmy winner for 'Hacks,' is also eligible for multiple categories, which may de-incentivize voters from recognizing his acting work. Paul Rudd's work on 'Only Murders in the Building' is also notable, but Emmy voters tend to favor supporting comedy performances over big-name cameos.

IndieWire has released their predictions for the 2024 Emmys in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category. Jeremy Allen White from 'The Bear' is the top pick to win, followed closely by Steve Martin from 'Only Murders in the Building'. Larry David from 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' is also a strong contender, despite never having won an Emmy for his work on the show.
