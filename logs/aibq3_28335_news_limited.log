Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress, has reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman, surpassing L'Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, according to Forbes.

'Despite selling more than $22 billion of Walmart stock over the past decade, Sam Walton's heirs still own nearly 46 percent of the firm their father founded,' Forbes reports.

**The Daily Money: Watch for falling interest rates**
The Federal Reserve is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years, but consumers shouldn't expect to see a significant difference. According to Medora Lee, analysts say the cut will be either a quarter- or a half-percentage point, from 5.25% to 5.50%. Meanwhile, Walmart heiress Alice Walton has reclaimed her title as the world's richest woman, with an estimated $89.1 billion fortune, according to Forbes. Additionally, a recent study by Ladders found that remote and hybrid jobs paying at least $250,000 annually plummeted by 95% and 60%, respectively, as companies return to a 'return-to-office' policy. As Daniel de Visé notes, 'Higher pay requires higher commitment, and that includes showing up at the office every day.'

**Walton Family Surpasses $100 Billion in Wealth for the First Time**
The Walton family has surpassed $100 billion in wealth for the first time, according to Bloomberg's billionaire index. Jim Walton, 76, the son of founder Sam Walton, leads the way with a net worth of $102.6 billion, followed closely by his brother Rob, 79, with a net worth of $100.4 billion. Their sister Alice, 74, is not far behind with a net worth of $99.7 billion. The family's net worth has increased by nearly $30 billion this year, with the three siblings adding $89 billion to their combined wealth. The family has been secretive about their wealth, but have recently started investing in various new ventures. Rob Walton made headlines in 2022 by purchasing the Denver Broncos for $4.65 billion, while the family has also invested in redeveloping their hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, into an arts and sports complex. Walmart's stock has risen 53% this year, driven by the company's e-commerce growth and efforts to attract more middle-class customers. The stock has reached an all-time high of $80.60 per share, but has not changed much on Monday's trading in New York. None of the three heirs are involved in the day-to-day operations of the company or sit on Walmart's board of directors, with Rob Walton having retired earlier this year and Jim Walton serving as the head of the Arvest Bank Group, a regional lender with over 260 branches in three states. Alice Walton, a passionate art collector, recently surpassed L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers to become the world's richest woman.
