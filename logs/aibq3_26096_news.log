**BSE Sensex 30 Opens with Slight Increase on June 12, 2024**
The BSE Sensex 30 index opened with a slight increase of 0.26% on June 12, 2024, at 76,656.77 points, breaking a two-day streak of flat performance. The index has accumulated a 3.06% gain over the past seven days and a 22.4% increase over the past year. The BSE Sensex 30 is 0.05% below its year-to-date high and 8.93% above its year-to-date low. An index is a financial indicator that shows how the value of a group of assets changes over time, collecting data from various companies or sectors of a market. It is used by stock exchanges in various countries and can be associated with different criteria such as geography, sectors, company size, or type of asset. Each index has its own way of calculating its value, but the main component is the market capitalization of each company that makes it up. This is obtained by multiplying the day's closing price of the stock by the total number of shares outstanding in the market. Companies listed on the stock exchange are required to submit a report on their composition every three or six months, depending on the case. Reading an index also implies being aware of its variations over time. Current indices always open with a fixed value based on the prices of the stocks on their starting date, but not all indices follow this method, which can be a source of confusion. If an index adds 500 points in a day, while another adds only 20, it may seem that the first had a better performance. However, if the first started the day at 30,000 points and the other at 300, it can be concluded that, in terms of percentages, the gains for the second were more notable. The main stock market indices in the United States are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as the Dow Jones, which is composed of 30 companies, the S&P 500, which includes 500 of the largest companies in the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq 100, which brings together 100 of the largest non-financial companies. In Europe, the main indices are the Eurostoxx 50, which covers the 50 most important companies in the eurozone, the DAX 30, the main German index that includes the strongest companies in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the FTSE 100, the CAC 40, and the IBEX 35. In Asia, there is the Nikkei 225, composed of the 225 most important companies in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the SSE Composite Index, which is the main index of China, and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and the KOSPI in South Korea. In Latin America, there is the IPC, which includes the 35 most prestigious companies in the Mexican Stock Exchange, and the Bovespa, which is composed of the 50 most important companies in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. There are also global indices such as the MSCI Latin America, which includes the 137 most important companies in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, the MSCI World, which includes 1600 companies from 23 developed countries, the MSCI Emerging Markets, which is composed of over 800 companies from developing countries, and the S&P Global 100, which includes the 100 most powerful multinational companies in the world.
