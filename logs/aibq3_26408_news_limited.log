**Will the Minimum Wage Increase in September?**
Millions of minimum wage workers are eagerly waiting for a possible mid-year increase in July. Despite government announcements, living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. According to Turk-İş, the minimum wage fell below the poverty line in the fourth month of the year. The inflation rate in May reached 75.45%. With declining purchasing power and rising inflation, not increasing the minimum wage would deepen economic inequality. In July, over 5 million civil servants and 16 million retirees will receive a 6-month inflation-based salary increase. The net rate of increase will be determined by the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) data in June. So far, the 5-month inflation difference has been announced as 22.72%. Considering the poverty and unemployment lines, a similar increase of 7.5 million minimum wage workers is being discussed. The average increase is expected to be around 20-25%. After a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and CHP leader Özgür Özel, the possibility of a mid-year increase in the minimum wage is being considered. The government is continuing to implement austerity policies to control inflation and is evaluating wage increases as one of the main causes of inflation. According to the Ministry of Finance, the target is to keep inflation at a single-digit level. The Central Bank's reports also suggest that there will be no mid-year increase in the minimum wage. The Minister of Labor and Social Security, Vedat Işıkhan, has repeatedly stated that there are no plans for a mid-year increase in the minimum wage. Finally, a decision was made at the AKP's Kızılcahamam camp that there will be no mid-year increase in the minimum wage. However, some circles are suggesting that the increase may come in September instead of July.

**Turkey to Increase Minimum Wage by Real Value This Year**
Turkish Finance Minister, Mohamed Simsek, announced that the government is planning to increase the minimum wage by the real value this year, emphasizing its commitment to improving living conditions for citizens. Simsek stated that the minimum wage in Turkey is not low compared to developing countries, but acknowledged the difficulties faced by citizens in covering their expenses. He emphasized that the expected increase will be tangible in real value. Simsek also mentioned that the cost of excluding the minimum wage from taxation is 670 billion Turkish lira, reflecting the financial challenges faced by the government. He added that Turkey has seen a 5.5% increase in the minimum wage in real value over the past 20 years, reflecting the country's real economic growth of 5.4%. Simsek also highlighted that Turkey has one of the highest minimum wage levels among developing countries, except for Poland, which highlights Turkey's economic status. He also mentioned that the government's economic program aims to reduce inflation and ensure exchange rate stability, and that the increase in value-added tax is not on the agenda this year, as the budget correction will be achieved through combating tax evasion. Simsek predicted that inflation will drop to the forties in October, and possibly in September, with expectations that it will drop to less than 30% by the end of next year.

**Minimum Wage Hike: What's Next?**
Millions of minimum wage earners are eagerly waiting for the possible increase in July. Despite government statements, living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. In April, the minimum wage was below the poverty line. According to Turk-İş, the poverty line in April was 17,725 TL, while in May it increased to 18,969 TL. In May, inflation also reached its peak, with an annual inflation rate of 75.45%. Under these conditions, if there is no increase in the minimum wage, economic inequality may deepen. In July, a raise for civil servants and pensioners will be determined based on June's TÜFE data. So far, the 5-month inflation difference has been recorded as 22.72%. Meanwhile, a similar raise is being discussed for approximately 7.5 million minimum wage earners, with an average increase rate of 20-25% expected. CHP leader Özgür Özel's proposal has brought the minimum wage increase to the agenda. The topic was discussed with AKP Chairman and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and an optimistic approach was shown. However, Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek and Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan are taking limited approaches to wage increases within the framework of current economic targets. According to the Central Bank's reports, it is assumed that there will be no increase in the minimum wage, and steps are being taken towards the targets. Labor and Social Security Minister Vedat Işıkhan has repeatedly stated that there are no plans for a minimum wage increase. Finally, the AKP's Kızılcahamam camp concluded that there will be no increase in the minimum wage.

**Minimum Wage and Poverty Line: A Critical Situation**
The minimum wage and pensioners, who have limited income, have been affected by inflation. The minimum wage was increased by 49% at the beginning of the year to 17,002 TL. Although it was expected that there would be an interim increase in July due to the post-pandemic inflationary environment, the government closed the door after the increase at the beginning of the year. A significant data was announced after the meeting between President Erdoğan and CHP leader Özgür Özel, which will affect the interim increase. The Bureau of Labor Research (BESAR) announced that the poverty line for a four-person family has exceeded 25,000 TL. According to the report, a single person's living expenses are calculated as 30,211 TL. The critical data has left the minimum wage 8,000 TL behind. Despite the government's expectation of a decline in inflation from July, the increase in the poverty line has strengthened the expectation of an interim increase. Although the government has closed the door to interim increases in the minimum wage, Social Security Expert İsa Karakaş drew attention to the poverty line. Karakaş said, 'We won't make adjustments to the minimum wage, but only to the minimum wage earners. We will make adjustments to the minimum wage in September.'

CHP leader Özgür Özel brought up the minimum wage increase proposal during a meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. If the two leaders agree, the minimum wage increase could be implemented. The government is continuing to implement austerity policies to control inflation and views wage increases as one of the main causes of inflation.
