**Prediction: The Federal Reserve Will Cut Rates Again in 2024**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again in 2024, following the first rate cut in four years in September. With inflation slowing, the Fed is likely to continue cutting rates over the next year, with a possible rate cut as early as November 7 or December 18. Rate cuts will make borrowing money less expensive and reduce the interest earned on bank account funds. While this may be disappointing for those who have earned close to 5.00% APY on their savings accounts, it will have a positive effect for those who have borrowed money or are looking to do so in the near future, as loans of all kinds will become more affordable. It's also a good time for refinancing mortgages, particularly if you took yours out when rates were at their peak.

**Federal Reserve Members Expect Interest Rate Cuts by End of 2024**
The Federal Reserve members expect to reduce the interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% by the end of 2024, more than they previously predicted in June, as inflation approaches its 2% target and unemployment increases. According to the new economic projections published by the Federal Reserve on September 18, the interest rate is currently at 4.75% to 5.00%, and the authorities expect cuts of 25 points in each of the last two meetings of the year, in November and December. By the end of 2025, the interest rate is expected to be 3.4%, according to the median of their projections, implying four additional cuts of 25 points next year. The interest rate is estimated to be 2.9% by the end of 2026 and 2027, reflecting the reach of what the median of the Fed members now sees as a neutral rate. As stated by the Fed, the decision to reduce interest rates was made in light of the progress towards its inflation target and with the risks for both mandates now 'practically balanced.' The projections, which represent the individual opinions of the authorities, not a consensus, show that 2 of the 19 Fed members think that the monetary authority should not reduce interest rates further this year, and 7 think it would be necessary to make only one cut of 25 points. On the other end of the spectrum, only one authority predicts more cuts in interest rates this year than the median view.

**The Federal Reserve just cut interest rates by 50 basis points -- here's what will get cheaper**
The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 50 basis points, citing reduced upside risks to inflation and increased downside risks to employment. According to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, 'The upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.' The rate cut will reduce borrowing costs, but the impact on loan payments will be minimal, with most people saving only a few dollars per month. However, for those with multiple debts, the savings can add up. Traders predict that this rate cut is the first of several, with 76% expecting the federal funds rate to fall to 4-4.75% by late December. According to Bankrate, here's how the rate cut will affect loan payments:

**Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates**
The Federal Reserve is expected to make a decision on interest rates, which would be a significant shift towards easing monetary policy, leading to a series of interest rate cuts throughout 2024 and 2025. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 0.25% to 0.5% from its current rate of 5.5%. The Federal Reserve aims to reduce inflation to 2%, which is the target set by the bank. It is expected that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again before the end of the year, specifically on December 18, by another 0.25%, bringing the interest rate to 4.75%. This move is expected to boost gold prices, which have recently risen to $2500 per ounce, with expectations of reaching $3000 per ounce.

**What To Expect On Interest Rates For The Remainder Of 2024**
Federal Reserve policymakers have become more dovish in their statements, indicating a potential interest rate cut at the remaining three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings in 2024. Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'the time has come for policy to adjust,' and FOMC voting members have expressed similar sentiments, citing easing inflation and a weakening labor market. Markets expect interest rates to be cut by 0.75% to 1.5% by December 2024, with a possible larger 0.5% reduction at one or two of the remaining meetings. The FOMC will announce interest rates at its meetings on September 18, November 7, and December 18, with updates to the Summary of Economic Projections and press conferences with Powell.

**US Fed to cut rate or take a pause in November's FOMC meeting?**
The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates or take a pause in its next FOMC meeting in November. Recent US CPI data showed a surprise increase in core inflation numbers, which could affect the Fed's decision. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic is open to a potential rate-cut pause, while Jamie Cox of Harris Financial Group believes the Fed will lower rates at a measured pace. The Fed's plans to gradually lower interest rates have been complicated by stubborn inflation and growing unemployment. Chris Zaccarelli of Independent Advisor Alliance expects the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in November and another 25 basis points in December, unless labor market or inflation readings change significantly by the end of the year.

**Fed likely to cut twice more this year as worries Fed rate cuts 'overdone' By Investing.com**
Evercore ISI analysts believe that the Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates twice more this year, in November and December, to bring the federal funds rate down to 4.25-4.5%. They argue that recent strong economic data has cast doubt on the rate cut path ahead, but these worries are 'overdone'. The analysts believe that the Fed's primary focus is on maintaining a robust labor market and moving rates back to a 'more neutral setting' as inflation returns to target. They also revised their growth forecast upward for 2025, expecting a boost from increased fiscal resources and a rebound in credit growth.

**Interest Rate Cuts Still on the Table for November and December**
The arguments in favor of a 0.25 percentage point cut in the Federal Reserve's interest rate in November and December seem intact after a report showed that US producer prices remained unchanged in September compared to August, indicating that inflation is still on track to meet its target. Futures contracts on interest rates continued to suggest only a 15% chance that the Fed will leave the interest rate unchanged at 4.75% to 5.00% when it meets in early November, with most bets on reductions in each of the two final meetings of this year and in each of the first meetings of 2025, reaching 3.50% to 3.75% by mid-next year. 'The case for a rate cut remains strong,' said no one in the article, but the article implies that the case for a rate cut remains strong, as the inflation is still on track to meet its target.

**Federal Reserve Minutes Show No Rush to Lower Interest Rates**
The minutes from the Federal Reserve's September 18 meeting, where the US central bank decided to lower interest rates by 0.5 points to the range of 4.75%-5%, have been in the spotlight of investors in recent days. The meeting marked a turning point after four and a half years without interest rate cuts. The question was not whether to lower rates, but how much to do so. The document published on Wednesday shows a certain optimism about the possibility of a smooth landing, suggests a more moderate pace for future rate cuts, and sheds light on the debate that led to the selection of the more aggressive option. A 'substantial majority' of the Federal Open Market Committee members, except for one, agreed that lowering rates by 0.5 points was appropriate given the evolution of inflation data and market numbers. The Fed had at its disposal an inflation that was declining 'but still somewhat high', solid GDP growth, and a labor market that caused some concern. 'The employment generation rate has been moderating over the year and the unemployment rate has increased, although it remains low,' the document describes. While the majority of committee members agreed on how much to lower rates, there was unanimity on the need to remain vigilant about the evolution of data and the economic environment to determine future actions. 'We must be prepared to act if the situation requires it,' they said. The committee members had already hinted at the end of the September meeting that there would be more cuts before the end of the year, until the rates reach the range of 4.25%-4.5%, which would involve two new cuts in the November 7 and December 18 meetings. With US elections just two days before their next meeting, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell wanted to temper market expectations at the end of September by ruling out another 0.5-point cut. In addition to inflation and employment data, the minutes show that the committee had taken into account the market's expectations for that meeting. Ultimately, this was another argument for cutting 0.5 points, as the consensus at the time gave a higher probability of a 0.5-point cut than a 0.25-point cut. Currently, expectations for the remaining 2024 meetings are aligned with the roadmap defended by Powell at the end of last month, i.e., rates of 4.25%-4.5% by the end of the year. Committee members highlighted during the meeting that US economic activity has continued to grow 'solidly' and highlighted the 'resilience of consumer spending.' However, two members warned that the increase in real household incomes in the US had indeed helped the health of consumption, but that, on the other hand, signs of deceleration or budget problems had begun to appear in some households. These signs, interpreted as a symptom of problems in households with medium or low incomes, could harm growth in the next quarters in the eyes of the members who listed them. The caution among entrepreneurs when making hiring decisions, the impact of new technologies, the increase in productivity... By putting all these factors on the scale, the majority of the committee members concluded that they expect GDP growth aligned with the historical trend for the next years. According to the content of the minutes, the Fed does not plan to make more aggressive cuts for the rest of the year, unless there are unforeseen circumstances. 'We must be prepared to act if the situation requires it,' they said. 'The employment generation rate has been moderating over the year and the unemployment rate has increased, although it remains low,' the document describes.

**Will RBI start cutting interest rates from December or March? Here's what experts predict**
Analysts predict that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may start cutting interest rates from December 2024, with further reductions in early 2025, based on inflation trends and global economic conditions. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has hinted at a potential rate cut, but also warned of upside risks to inflation. Bank of America economist Rahul Bajoria expects repo rate cuts of 100bp by December 2025, beginning December 2024. Kapil Gupta, Executive Director- Research, Nuvama Institutional Equities, believes that the shift to a neutral stance opens doors for rate cuts potentially starting December 2024. However, some experts, like Indranil Pan, Chief Economist at YES Bank, are cautious and think that the RBI may not cut rates until March 2025 due to global volatility and uncertainty. 'The signal that RBI is warming up or getting more comfortable towards accommodation is the point around transmission to credit markets being satisfactory,' said Anitha Rangan, Economist, Equirus. 'However, at the juncture of elevated global volatility perhaps RBI does not believe it to be opportune to cut rates. They will await more certainty from external side (US elections, Middle East tensions), before taking their first step which is not likely before March of 2025. Why disturb the horse which is well tethered?'

**Gordon Gekko: The FED Should Slow Down Interest Rate Cuts**
Gordon Gekko, a financial expert, believes that the Federal Reserve (FED) will not cut interest rates in November, despite market expectations. He argues that the FED will wait for the October employment report and the outcome of the US presidential election before making a decision. Gekko also mentions that a hurricane, the Milton, is approaching and may affect the data, as well as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the rise in oil prices. He notes that the FED has already reduced interest rates by half a point and that the next step is not predetermined. Gekko believes that the FED will not cut interest rates by another half point, but rather by a quarter point, and that this will happen in November or December. He also mentions that the FED's decision will depend on whether the inflation rate remains high, and that the current economic growth is too rapid. He concludes that the FED should slow down the pace of interest rate cuts to avoid making mistakes.

**Prediction: Savings Account APYs Will Fall Further in November or December**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again in November or December, which may lead to lower savings account APYs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stated that he expects two more 0.25% interest rate cuts this year. While the federal funds rate is only a guideline for banks, it's likely that savings account rates will drop similarly. To maximize interest payments, consider locking in a high certificate of deposit (CD) rate before the November meeting. However, this requires giving up access to your cash for the full term. Alternatively, consider switching to an online savings account with a higher APY, such as the Discover Online Savings account, which is currently offering 4.10% APY.

**RBI may shift monetary stance to 'Neutral'; rate cuts likely by December 2024: Nuvama**
According to a report by Nuvama, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may shift its monetary stance to 'Neutral' and cut interest rates by December 2024. The report cites several factors, including a slowdown in economic activity, benign core inflation, and the US Federal Reserve's recent rate easing, as reasons for the potential move. The report notes that domestic demand is slowing, exports are sluggish, and fiscal policy is tightening, which may not warrant a tight monetary stance. The report also highlights that core inflation has consistently declined over the past 16 months, currently ranging between 3.1 per cent and 3.3 per cent, reflecting weak pricing power in the economy. Given the slowing domestic demand, weak exports, and tightening fiscal stance, the RBI's current monetary stance may no longer be appropriate, according to the report.

**Wells Fargo: Fed Rate Cuts to Drive Market Opportunities in 2025**
Wells Fargo analysts believe that the recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve is just the beginning of a series of reductions that could lead to more market opportunities in 2025. According to the bank, the focus should be on the long-term trajectory of interest rates, rather than the size of the cut. The 50 basis point reduction last week surprised many investors, but the market had anticipated a 58% probability of a cut. 'The key to consider over the past two months has not been the magnitude of the first cut, but rather that the September monetary policy meeting marked the beginning of what is likely to be a series of interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve, which are expected to continue well into next year,' wrote the bank. Wells Fargo expects these reductions to provide fundamental support to economic growth and the labor market. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, supported this view, stating that many more rate cuts will be needed to sustain the economy. Wells Fargo predicts that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in the remaining two FOMC meetings this year (November and December) for a total of 100 basis points in 2024. However, they note that the schedule of rate cuts for 2025 is still uncertain. Despite anticipating a slowdown in the US economy by the end of 2024, Wells Fargo does not expect a recession. Instead, the bank expects a moderate slowdown before the rate cuts begin to positively impact growth. For the first two quarters of 2025, the national economy is expected to respond to the easing cycle, which will also benefit S&P 500 earnings, as approximately 35% of the index's income comes from international markets. Wells Fargo concludes that 'the Fed's interest rate cut last week is just the beginning of what is likely to be a series of reductions that should contribute to generating more opportunities next year.'

**New Interest Rate Cut Expected by the End of the Year**
According to the credit rating agency 'Fitch', the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates to 4.5% by the end of this year and 3.5% by the end of 2025. The agency predicts that interest rates in the US will reach a neutral level of 3% by June 2026. Fitch estimated that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by 25 basis points at its monetary policy meetings in November and December. However, Fitch stated that a 50 basis point cut in September 'is difficult to justify based on the economic data'. The agency noted that the recent increases in unemployment rates reflect the recovery of the labor market over the past 12-18 months, and that the number of employees continues to grow, with consumption remaining solid. Fitch does not expect a sharp decline in the US labor market.

**Federal Reserve's First Rate Cut in 11 Months: A Step Towards a 'Soft Landing'**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made its first interest rate cut in 11 months, reducing rates by 50 basis points. This decision was widely expected, as economists, analysts, and investors had been debating the size of the cut, with some predicting 0.25% and others 0.50%. The Fed's new economic projections show inflation returning to 2.1% next year and 2.0% in 2026, with a slight increase in unemployment and a 2.0% growth in GDP for the next few years. According to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, the decision was made to maintain price stability while also ensuring full employment, as he emphasized during his press conference. Powell's statements suggest that future rate cuts may return to the traditional 25 basis point size. Market predictions see another 50 basis point cut in 2024, with two Fed meetings scheduled for November 7 and December 18. For the future, regular rate cuts are expected in 2025, which will bring rates down to 3% from the current range of 4.75%-5.00%. Financial markets have reacted positively to the decision, as it maintains a scenario of controlled economic slowdown, also known as a 'soft landing', which can be shaped by the Fed's rate cuts, providing a favorable macroeconomic context for many asset classes.

**Why Wall Street Is in for Big Rate Cuts in Q4**
Experts believe that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 75 basis points or more in Q4, as inflation continues to ease. According to Kathy Postjanczyk, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual, 'If so [inflation] continues to ease, and interest rates should be cut accordingly.' The Fed's next interest rate decision is on November 7, and another cut is possible at the December meeting. A big rate cut could be a catalyst for the market, and investors are optimistic about a soft landing. 'Risk assets really celebrate the idea that the Fed can prevent a hard landing and do it proactively before we see more weakness in the labor market,' said John Hancock's Emily Rowland. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average have hit their 39th record high of the year, and traders are pricing in an additional 75 basis points of cuts at the Fed's remaining 2024 meetings.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rate in Bid to Boost Economy**
The Federal Reserve has announced a 0.5% interest rate cut, the first since 2020, in a bid to boost the economy. Analysts expect further cuts, with some predicting a 0.25% reduction in November and December, and additional cuts in 2025 and 2026. The move is seen as a positive development for the economy, with some experts predicting it will lead to increased borrowing and spending, and a boost to the housing market. However, others warn that the cut may have negative consequences, such as increased inflation and a decrease in the value of the dollar. The Fed's decision is also seen as a response to the weak labor market and the decline in inflation. The move is expected to have a positive impact on the stock market, with some analysts predicting a rise in stock prices. The cut is also seen as a positive development for small businesses, which may benefit from lower interest rates and increased access to credit. However, some experts warn that the cut may have negative consequences, such as increased inflation and a decrease in the value of the dollar.

**Reuters Poll: Federal Reserve May Lower Interest Rates in November and December**
A Reuters poll of over 100 economists found that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates by 25 basis points in November and December, bringing it closer to a neutral level. The poll also showed that the Fed will likely approach a neutral interest rate by the end of next year. Furthermore, more than three-quarters of the economists polled (86 out of 107) expect interest rates to fall by another 50 basis points this year to a range of 4.25% - 4.50%, in quarter-point reductions in meetings in November and December. 16 economists predicted that the Fed will lower interest rates by 75 basis points this year, while 5 predicted a 25 basis point cut. The poll's averages also showed that the Fed will lower interest rates by 50 basis points in the first quarter of 2025, followed by 25 basis points in the next two quarters, resulting in a total of 100 basis points of cuts next year, to a range of 3.25% - 3.50%. According to the poll, 'the Fed will likely approach a neutral interest rate by the end of next year', as said by the economists.

**FED's Unexpected Interest Rate Cut: A Response to Economic Concerns**
The Federal Reserve (FED) has unexpectedly lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, contrary to the majority's expectation of a 25 basis point cut. This decision has sparked interest in the relationships between interest rates, inflation, growth, and unemployment rates worldwide. The FED's decision was influenced by early warning signs of a potential economic slowdown, which are also evident in Europe, Japan, and China. The FED aims to prevent an economic downturn by reducing interest rates. In contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, while the Bank of England (BOE) has kept interest rates stable. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has also raised interest rates to combat deflation. The Turkish Central Bank (TCMB) has kept interest rates high to combat inflation, but this approach may not be sustainable. The TCMB's decision will depend on the third-quarter GDP growth rate, which will be announced on November 29, 2024. If the growth rate is negative, the TCMB may lower interest rates before the December 26, 2024, policy meeting. The FED's decision has also been influenced by the upcoming US elections, with some speculating that the FED is trying to boost the economy and help the Democratic Party. However, the author believes that the FED's decision is driven by economic concerns rather than political considerations.

**Federal Reserve reduces interest rate by a half-point**
The Federal Reserve announced a half-point reduction in the federal interest rate, double the predicted cut of a quarter-point. The decision was made in light of progress on inflation and a balance of risks. According to the Federal Reserve, 'The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.' Officials aim to cut the rate to 3.4% by the end of 2025, with potential for another rate cut announcement in December 2024. The move comes as the housing market faces challenges, including a shortage of over 200,000 homes and affordability issues in Kentucky.

**Poll: Fed to Cut Rates by 25 Points in Nov. and Dec.**
A Reuters poll of over 100 economists found that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in both November and December. This decision was largely expected by market pricing, but was forecast by only 9 of 101 economists surveyed before the decision. The majority of economists, 86 of 107, predict that rates will fall by another 50 basis points this year to a 4.25%-4.50% range. David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, expects the rate to be reached slightly sooner, with a longer series of consecutive cuts from November 2024 through June 2025. The Fed's long-run assessment of the 'neutral' rate is 2.9%, which would not be reached until 2026. Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays, said that the Fed would be more inclined to step down to 25 basis point cuts if the unemployment rate goes above 4.4%.

**Fed to cut rates by 25bps in Nov and Dec, approach neutral level sooner**
A Reuters poll of over 100 economists suggests that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in both November and December, bringing it closer to the neutral rate of interest. The Fed has already cut rates by 50 basis points, with Chair Jerome Powell stating that this was a commitment to keeping unemployment low as inflation eased back toward the 2% target. Many economists believe that the Fed will continue to cut rates, with 86 of 107 predicting a further 50 basis points of cuts this year to a 4.25%-4.50% range. David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, expects the rate to be reached slightly sooner, with a longer series of consecutive cuts from November 2024 through June 2025. The Fed's long-run assessment of the 'neutral' rate is 2.9%, which would not be reached until 2026. However, some economists, such as Oscar Munoz at TD Securities, believe that the Fed may need to go back to its neutral stance sooner than anticipated, as both sides of the mandate are already back to or within reach of their steady state. Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays, noted that the Fed would need to see an unemployment rate above 4.4% to do further aggressive cuts. Economists were nearly split on the clarity of the Fed's communication, with 23 saying it was clear and 21 saying it was not.

**Store forventninger: Så langt skal renten ned, inden juleanden skal i ovnen**
Investors on the world market expect the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates significantly before Christmas. The market has already factored in a 0.5% interest rate cut by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, in addition to the 0.5% cut on Wednesday. Powell has two official interest rate meetings left in the calendar for this year, on November 6-7 and December 17-18. According to Danske Bank's chief analyst Bjørn Tangaa Sillemann, Powell will likely deliver another double interest rate cut of 0.5% at one of the two scheduled meetings, unless he wants to disappoint investors. 'But with the double interest rate cut on Wednesday, we've seen that the Fed is ready to press the big interest rate button. So the bar has been lowered for us to get a double interest rate cut this year,' says Bjørn Tangaa Sillemann. Danske Bank's latest interest rate forecast predicts a 0.25% interest rate cut in November and another 0.25% cut in December. 'If the job report is weak, the Fed will be ready to do it again. They won't be afraid to do it. But our expectation is that the Fed will stick to a 0.25% interest rate cut in both November and December,' says Bjørn Tangaa Sillemann.

**Fed cut interest rates for first time in 4 years. See how much and what that means**
The Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 4.75% to 5% for the first time in four years. According to the Fed, 'the economic outlook is uncertain, and the Fed is attentive to the risks of both sides of its dual mandate.' This rate cut is expected to lower borrowing costs for home and auto purchases, and reduce interest rates on credit card debt. However, savers may see lower returns on savings accounts and CDs. The Fed officials estimated that inflation will fall from 2.5% to 2.3% by December, and then to 2.2% by the end of next year. Policymakers have forecasted four more quarter-point cuts in 2025 and two additional quarter-points in 2026, reducing the key rate to about 2.9% by the end of 2026.

**Oman Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate by 50 Basis Points**
The Central Bank of Oman decided to lower the interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, following the US Federal Reserve's decision to lower the interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.75% and 5% yesterday. The decision was made during a meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee today. The US Federal Reserve has maintained high interest rates since months to control borrowing and curb inflation, but the slowdown in general inflation last year has given a positive signal that the first cut is on the horizon. The Federal Reserve has two more meetings this year to consider interest rates, with the last meeting scheduled for December 2024. It is also expected that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates again before the end of this year, specifically on December 18, by 0.25% to reach an interest rate of 4.75%, aiming to reduce inflation by 2%.

**RBI's rate cut dilemma: Keep pace with Fed's 50 bps slash or take slow path to easing?**
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is facing a dilemma on whether to follow the US Federal Reserve's 50 bps rate cut. Analysts are divided on the prospect of a rate cut, with some predicting it as early as October and others expecting a delay until December or even 2025. The RBI's decision will be influenced by India's robust economic growth and ongoing food inflation. Emkay Global believes the RBI will maintain its wait-and-watch stance and focus on being 'actively disinflationary', with the first rate cut likely by December. However, Nomura expects the RBI to cut its policy rate by a cumulative 100bp to 5.50 percent by mid-2025, starting with a surprise rate cut this October. SBI Chairman C S Setty believes the RBI is unlikely to cut the benchmark policy rate in 2024 due to food inflation concerns. 'While Fed rate cut would influence everyone, RBI would be mindful of the food inflation before taking a call on interest rate cut,' Setty said.

**Federal Reserve signals end to inflation fight with half point interest rate cut**
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point on Wednesday, marking its first rate cut in over four years. This decision reflects the Fed's new focus on supporting the job market, which has shown signs of slowing down. The rate cut reduces the key rate to 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Inflation has plummeted from 9.1% in mid-2022 to 2.5% in August, barely above the Fed's 2% target. The Fed plans to cut its key rate by an additional half-point in November and December, and foresee four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated, 'We know it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that's more appropriate given the progress on inflation.' The move is expected to result in lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, enhancing Americans' finances and encouraging more spending and growth. However, the decision may face criticism from former President Donald Trump, who believes that such a move amounts to political interference.

**Federal Reserve signals end to inflation fight with a sizable half-point rate cut**
The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by a half-point, a significant shift after more than two years of high rates that helped tame inflation but also made borrowing expensive for consumers. The rate cut reflects the Fed's new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown signs of slowing. The central bank's action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, 'We know it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that's more appropriate given the progress on inflation.' He added, 'The U.S. economy is in a good place, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.' The Fed expects to cut its key rate by an additional half-point in November and December, and to make four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. This move is expected to lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, boosting Americans' finances and supporting more spending and growth.

**Federal Reserve to Meet Twice More in 2024 to Decide on Interest Rates**
The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, has announced a significant 0.5% cut in interest rates to 4.75% and 5% on the dollar, for the first time in 4 years. This decision was made during the Federal Open Market Committee's sixth meeting of the year. The Federal Reserve has two more meetings scheduled for 2024: one on November 6-7 and the last one on December 17-18. The Federal Reserve had previously raised interest rates to 4.25% in 2022 and 1% in 2023 to combat inflation in the United States, but has kept them unchanged in the last 8 meetings before the recent cut. The Federal Reserve aims to achieve the maximum sustainable employment and inflation rate of 2% in the long term, as the committee has gained more confidence that inflation is moving towards 2% in a sustainable manner, according to Federal Reserve Chairman, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our team and the dedication of our policymakers.'

**The Fed Went Big With Its First Rate Cut—Here's What Markets Think Will Happen Next**
The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points has led to increased market expectations for further rate cuts. Traders now believe that the Fed will cut rates by another 75 basis points by the end of the year, with a 50-point cut expected in either November or December. This is in contrast to the Fed's quarterly economic projections, which estimate that the policy rate will end the year between 4.25% and 4.5%. Market expectations for rate cuts in 2025 also exceed the Fed's estimates, with a nearly 60% chance that the fed funds rate will be below 3% within the next 12 months. As one market participant noted, 'The Fed's decision to cut rates by 50 basis points was a sign of more aggressive cuts to come.'

**Fed Officials Are Split on Where Rates Go Next in 2024**
Federal Reserve officials have lowered their year-end interest-rate forecast in their quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, with the median forecast predicting a total of 1 percentage point of cuts in 2024. This is a relatively wide range of views, with some officials predicting 0.5 percentage points of cuts, while others see 1.25 percentage points of cuts. The Fed's policy committee voted to lower the federal-funds rate target by 0.5 percentage point on Wednesday, to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%. The committee's remaining 2024 meetings will be in November and December. As Fed officials are split on where rates go next in 2024, it remains to be seen how the economy will be affected by these varying projections.

**Federal Reserve Members Expect Interest Rate Cuts by End of 2024**
The Federal Reserve members expect to reduce the interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% by the end of 2024, more than they previously predicted in June, as inflation approaches its 2% target and unemployment increases. According to the new economic projections published by the Federal Reserve on September 18, the interest rate is currently at 4.75% to 5.00%, and the authorities expect cuts of 25 points in each of the last two meetings of the year, in November and December. By the end of 2025, the interest rate is expected to be 3.4%, according to the median of their projections, implying four additional cuts of 25 points next year. The interest rate is estimated to be 2.9% by the end of 2026 and 2027, reflecting the reach of what the median of the Fed members now sees as a neutral rate. As stated by the Fed, the decision to reduce interest rates was made in light of the progress towards its inflation target and with the risks for both mandates now 'practically balanced.' The projections, which represent the individual opinions of the authorities, not a consensus, show that 2 of the 19 Fed members think that the monetary authority should not reduce interest rates further this year, and 7 think it would be necessary to make only one cut of 25 points. On the other end of the spectrum, only one authority predicts more cuts in interest rates this year than the median view.

**The Federal Reserve just cut interest rates by 50 basis points -- here's what will get cheaper**
The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 50 basis points, citing reduced upside risks to inflation and increased downside risks to employment. According to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, 'The upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.' The rate cut will reduce borrowing costs, but the impact on loan payments will be minimal, with most people saving only a few dollars per month. However, for those with multiple debts, the savings can add up. Traders predict that this rate cut is the first of several, with 76% expecting the federal funds rate to fall to 4-4.75% by late December. According to Bankrate, here's how the rate cut will affect loan payments:

**Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by half-point, signaling end to inflation fight**
The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by half a point, a significant shift after two years of high rates that helped tame inflation but made borrowing expensive for consumers. The rate cut, the Fed's first in over four years, reflects its new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown signs of slowing. The central bank's action lowered its key rate to around 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Inflation has tumbled from 9.1% in mid-2022 to 2.5% in August, close to the Fed's 2% target. The Fed's policymakers signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in November and December, and envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. As a result, average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of 6.2%, spurring a jump in demand for refinancings. The Fed's move has the potential to scramble the economic landscape before the presidential election, with some critics arguing that it amounts to political interference.

The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, bringing it to a range of 4.75% to 5%. This reduction will make borrowing costs cheaper for Americans, particularly for credit card, personal loan, auto financing, and mortgage costs. The decision was made due to easing inflation and a slowing job market. According to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, 'The upside risks to inflation have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.' The rate cut is expected to reduce borrowing costs, but the savings will be small, around a few bucks off most loan payments each month. However, for those with multiple debts, the savings can add up. Additionally, 76% of traders expect the federal funds rate to fall further by late December.

**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates by 50 Basis Points for First Time Since 2020**
The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points for the first time since early 2020, marking a significant shift in their ongoing battle against inflation. This move comes just weeks before the presidential election and marks the beginning of the end of a two-year period where central bankers raised borrowing costs to their highest levels in two decades and then kept them there in an attempt to slow down the economy and control rapid price increases. The Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, has kept interest rates between 5.25% and 5.5% since July 2023, after raising them sharply starting from early 2022 as they struggled to combat rapid inflation. The markets had expected a 0.25% cut, but reports last week that the Fed was considering a 0.5% cut changed expectations. As of Tuesday, 66% of investors polled by Bloomberg expected a 50 basis point cut, and the futures market showed similar expectations. Over the years, the Federal Reserve has focused primarily on prices, which were skyrocketing out of control. However, inflation has been steadily declining, while the labor market has shown signs of slowing down. A 0.5% cut in interest rates could send a clear signal that the Fed is ready to protect the labor market, and a decrease in borrowing costs could shield the economy from further slowing. The market expects the Fed to cut borrowing costs by 1% or more by the end of the year. The Fed meets again in November and December.

**Fed lowers rates by 0.50 percentage points, its first cut since 2020**
The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.50 percentage points, marking the first reduction in four years. The move aims to ease borrowing costs as inflation-weary consumers struggle with high rates on mortgages, credit cards, and other loans. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the decision was based on the central bank's confidence that inflation will soon reach its 2% annual goal, as well as cooling employment. The labor market remains solid, but not as hot as it was during the pandemic. The Fed's economists predict that the unemployment rate could move up slightly by year end, rising from 4.2% to 4.4%. The rate cut is expected to ease financial strains for some consumers, and economists forecast that it will be the first in a series of reductions this year and into 2025. The next Fed meetings are scheduled for November 6-7 and December 17-18.

**Federal Reserve Lowers Interest Rates in the US**
The Federal Reserve in the US has decided to lower interest rates from 5.25-5.5% to 5.0%. This decision was uncertain beforehand, with experts and investors unsure if the rate would be lowered by 0.25% or 0.5%. The actual decision was 0.5%. However, the market is still uncertain, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will provide further explanation at 20:30 Norwegian time. The inflation rate has decreased significantly, from 9% in June 2022 to 2.5% in August, which is the lowest it has been since 2021. The Federal Reserve aims to keep inflation below 2% and believes it is within reach. However, the market has been concerned that the Federal Reserve may be slow to lower interest rates, which could lead to economic downturn. The interest rate has a significant impact on the economy, and the market is closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move. In Norway, the central bank is expected to keep the interest rate unchanged at 4.5% on Thursday, but the market is uncertain about future rate cuts, with some expecting a cut in December or 2025.

**Winners from a Potential US Interest Rate Cut**
The upcoming decision by the Federal Reserve on interest rates is expected to have a significant impact on various sectors, including gold, oil, and emerging economies. According to recent statements from Fed officials, they are leaning towards lowering interest rates after four years of high rates. The gold price has risen to a record high this week, driven by expectations of a potential rate cut, as lower interest rates tend to increase demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. In the oil and other dollar-denominated commodity sectors, lower interest rates often provide support, as lower borrowing costs can stimulate the economy and increase demand. Emerging economies are also expected to be affected, as hot money flows from low-interest-rate countries to high-interest-rate countries to take advantage of the higher yields. The Fed's decision on interest rates is expected to have a significant impact on these economies, as they often rely on foreign investment to maintain liquidity in their markets. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for December 2024, where they are expected to lower interest rates again, this time by 0.25%, bringing the rate to 4.75%. The Fed's goal is to reduce inflation by 2%.

**What a federal interest rate cut could mean for savers, borrowers**
The Federal Reserve System is expected to make its first interest rate cut in over four years, potentially coming as early as this week. The cut, which is expected to be 0.25%, could benefit borrowers, particularly those with high-interest credit cards or auto loans. However, savers may see a decrease in interest rates on their savings, CDs, bonds, and portfolios. Experts, including Steven Bouchey, a financial advisor, say that a softer economy will lead to more rate cuts to stimulate growth. Bouchey stated, 'The softer the economy, the more they want to cut rates to stimulate it so we come in for a soft landing and not a hard landing.' Some economists predict further cuts, potentially in November and December, with forecasts showing a rate of 2 to 2.5% by May 2025. Commissioner Timothy Hogues noted, 'The concept behind this is that there are individuals already coming into those public places and seeking employment. A lot of times, they're not aware of the opportunities with the state.'

**Federal Reserve Meeting to Discuss Interest Rates**
The Federal Reserve is meeting today to discuss interest rates, with expectations of a 0.25-0.5% cut from the current 5.5% rate. The decision will be announced tomorrow, as the meetings typically last for two days. The global markets are eagerly awaiting the Fed's decision, which is seen as a significant shift towards easing monetary policy, leading to a series of interest rate cuts throughout 2024 and 2025. The Fed aims to reduce inflation to 2%, and it is expected to cut interest rates again before the end of the year, specifically on December 18, by 0.25% to reach a rate of 4.75%. This move is expected to boost the gold price, which has recently risen to $2500 per ounce, with expectations of reaching $3000 per ounce. 'The Fed's decision is a crucial step towards easing monetary policy and reducing inflation,' said a source. 'We expect a 0.25-0.5% cut in interest rates, which will have a positive impact on the economy and the gold market.'

**Markets Hold Breath Ahead of Federal Reserve and Bank of England Decisions**
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold a meeting on September 17-18, 2024, with expectations of a rate cut. The Bank of England will also meet on Thursday to discuss monetary policy, with the market divided on whether to cut interest rates for the second time in two months. The European Central Bank recently cut its main interest rate by 25 basis points, in line with expectations. Market expectations are mixed on whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points during its meeting, which will start today and end on Wednesday. The focus is also on the economic forecasts that the Bank of England will release, which may indicate the expected path of interest rates this year. According to Mohamed Reda, a financial market expert, many investors around the world are waiting for the Federal Reserve's decision, which is expected to cut interest rates for the first time since 2020. He noted that the past four years have seen a series of interest rate hikes on the US dollar due to rising prices caused by the Corona pandemic, the Russian-Ukrainian war, and tensions in the Middle East. With the bank's attempt to reduce inflation levels, it is expected that interest rates will be cut by 0.25-0.5% from its current level of 5.5%. It is expected that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again before the end of this year, specifically on December 18, by 0.25% to reach an interest rate of 4.75%.

**Federal Reserve rate cuts beckon**
Top economists expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, with some predicting a 50-basis point reduction and others forecasting more significant cuts. AMP deputy chief economist Diana Mousina expects a 25-basis point cut, citing data and official commentary. She notes that the economy needs more support, as evidenced by a slowdown in economic activity indicators and a rise in the unemployment rate. Commonwealth Bank senior economist Belinda Allen forecasts more than three percentage points of cuts by the end of 2026, bringing the fed funds rate to around 2%, while NAB senior economist Taylor Nugent expects 100 basis points of cuts this year. 'The reason to start cutting interest rates is that the economy needs more support,' Mousina said. 'The biggest indicator suggesting the need for a rate cut is the rise in the unemployment rate, which is usually a main driver of Federal Reserve decisions, along with inflation.' 'We forecast more than three percentage points of cuts by the end of 2026,' Allen said. 'Our medium-term view, which calls for lower interest rates than the market, is underpinned by our assessment of secular trends.' 'While we think the labour market data support a 50 basis point move to kick off the long-awaited cutting cycle next week, FOMC officials have not made that case,' Nugent said. 'We retain the view the Fed will deliver 100 basis points of cuts and think a larger cut will now come in November or December.'

**S&P Global Market Intelligence anticipates two US Fed rate cuts this year**
S&P Global Market Intelligence predicts that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice this year, once in September and again in December. According to Senior US Economist Ben Herzon, the Federal Reserve will begin easing policy gradually before cutting rates at every meeting starting in the second quarter of next year. The trend in the unemployment rate has steepened, job openings have declined to pre-pandemic levels, and wage inflation is slowing in the US. S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts 2.6% GDP growth in the US this year and 1.8% growth next year. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated that it was time to reduce interest rates as inflation rates aligned with the target. However, he stopped short of giving a hint on the quantum of interest rate cut. 'The time has come for policy to adjust,' Powell said at the Jackson Hole Symposium. 'We expect two rate cuts this year -- this month and again in December -- as the Federal Reserve begins the process of easing policy gradually before cutting rates at every meeting beginning in the second quarter of next year,' Herzon said.

**CNBC's Inside India newsletter: What happens when the Fed cuts rates?**
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next week, which may prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to follow suit. However, RBI may wait until December to begin easing monetary policy, according to Shilan Shah of Capital Economics. A rate cut by the Fed is expected to provide relief to the Indian rupee, which has fallen to an all-time low. Mahesh Nandurkar of Jefferies believes that interest rates across the world are likely to see a sharp jump, creating headroom for RBI to taper down benchmark interest rates in India. Bank of America expects rate cuts to begin in December 2024, with interest rates in India lower by an entire percentage point by the end of next year. The Nifty 50 index may be negatively affected by a rate cut, as it is heavily weighted towards the banking sector, which may see squeezed margins. Amish Shah of Bank of America is cautious about the Nifty 50's prospects over the near term, but believes that large cap stocks are not expensive and markets may go sideways for some time.

**Economists Expect Fed to Cut Interest Rates by 25 Basis Points**
A majority of economists, 92 out of 101, in a recent survey expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets next week. Stephen Stanley, chief US economist at Santander, said, 'The jobs report was weak but not catastrophic. The Friday comments from both Williams and Waller did not provide explicit guidance on the urgent question of 25 basis points versus 50, but both offered a relatively benign assessment of the economy, which, in my opinion, points strongly to a 25 basis points cut.' A majority of economists also expect the Fed to deliver two additional 25 basis point cuts this year, in November and December, according to 65 of 95 economists. The median forecast for US economic growth is 1.8% in the coming years, with the unemployment rate expected to remain around 4.2% until the end of 2026. Inflation is expected to reach the Fed's 2% target in the first quarter of 2025.

**What To Expect On Interest Rates For The Remainder Of 2024**
Federal Reserve policymakers have become more dovish in their statements, indicating a potential interest rate cut at the remaining three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings in 2024. Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'the time has come for policy to adjust,' and FOMC voting members have expressed similar sentiments, citing easing inflation and a weakening labor market. Markets expect interest rates to be cut by 0.75% to 1.5% by December 2024, with a possible larger 0.5% reduction at one or two of the remaining meetings. The FOMC will announce interest rates at its meetings on September 18, November 7, and December 18, with updates to the Summary of Economic Projections and press conferences with Powell.

**Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as many as three times by end of 2024, UNC Charlotte economics professor says**
University of North Carolina at Charlotte economics professor John Connaughton predicts that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates as many as three times by the end of 2024. Connaughton suspects that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, November, and December, citing signs of waning inflation and a cooling job market. He estimates that the U.S. added about 160,000 jobs in August, which would be an improvement over the 118,000 jobs added in July. Connaughton believes that this would reduce pressure on the Fed to keep rates flat and that they have already signaled a rate cut, with the question being whether they will have two or three cuts by the end of the year. He is 'guaranteeing' rate cuts in September and December, but is unsure about November.

**Interest Rate Cuts Expected to Continue, but Pace and Size Depend on Inflation and Labor Market**
The Federal Reserve's Chairman has hinted that the next interest rate cut is expected to happen next month, but the pace and size of the cuts will depend on the progress made in controlling inflation and the strength of the labor market. The report states that the expected impact of the potential interest rate cuts on implicit interest rates will be less than expected, due to investors seeking safe-haven assets such as US Treasury bonds during times of new crises and geopolitical issues, including the renewed Gaza war and the escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The report also states that some traders are betting on a 100-point basis cut in interest rates by the end of the year, including a 50-point basis cut in September 2024, followed by 25-point basis cuts in November and December 2024. This has supported the growth of US Treasury bond yields, which are on track to achieve their fourth consecutive monthly gain. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds has fallen to its lowest level in 13 months, reaching 3.79%. Additionally, the report states that the European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates again next month, as inflation is expected to continue towards its target rate, but analysts are concerned about the release of key inflation data and service sector inflation, which is still persistent. Currently, the consensus is that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates twice this year, and the probability of a cut in October 2024 is 55%.
