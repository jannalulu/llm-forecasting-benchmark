**Venezuela opposition candidate has 50% lead over Maduro: Poll**
Venezuela's opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, is leading President Nicolás Maduro in the polls by about 50% ahead of the country's upcoming national election on July 28. González, a political unknown, has yet to be barred from running, but Maduro's administration is already looking at ways to rig the election. International observers are having difficulty overseeing the election's integrity due to the absence of international observation. Many Venezuelans are disillusioned with Maduro's government, which has failed to deliver on its promises, and the opposition party offers a message of hope and change. While the polls show the opposition in the lead, people associated with Maduro's party warn that this does not guarantee a victory, and even if the opposition wins, Maduro is unlikely to concede. Polls should be taken with a grain of salt, as voter abstention and indecision could affect the outcome.

Protests have been ongoing since July 29, with 11 reported deaths due to repression by Venezuelan security forces at the order of Maduro.

**Edmundo González Leads in Venezuelan Presidential Election, According to Edison Research**
The 2024 Venezuelan presidential election is taking place in a tense and expectant atmosphere. A survey by Edison Research, conducted among voters immediately after casting their ballots, shows Edmundo González, the opposition candidate, as the favorite, with a significant lead over incumbent President Nicolás Maduro. The survey, which consulted 6,846 voters in 100 locations across the country, projects González would receive 65% of the votes, while Maduro would get 31%, marking a 34% difference. Edison Research's vice president, Rob Farbman, stated, 'Our exit poll projects a decisive victory for Edmundo González. The opposition candidate has received broad support across all demographic groups, except one.' A separate survey attributed to the chavismo, allegedly conducted by 'Lewis and Thompson', gives Maduro 55% of the votes, but its authenticity is disputed due to the non-existent firm. The election is being closely monitored, with concerns about the circulation of false data and the need for peaceful and respectful participation.

**Edmundo González: The Opposition's Hope in Venezuela's 2024 Presidential Elections**
Edmundo González, the candidate for the Unitary Democratic Platform (PUD), will be the opposition's hope in Venezuela for the 2024 Presidential Elections. He will be the electoral rival of Nicolás Maduro, the current president of the country, and has the support of María Corina Machado, the winner of the 2023 primary, who was unable to participate in the elections due to her 15-year ban from holding public office. González's main strategy is to appeal to the nostalgia of a united family in the homes destroyed by the regime, which caused one of the largest exoduses in the country's and the continent's history. He promises a Venezuela of peace, freedom, and unity, and aims to overthrow the chavismo and start a 'period of changes'. According to a recent ORC Consultores study, González is leading the polls with 59.6% of the vote, while Maduro has 12.5%. This 47-point gap is important to understand the trend and predict the possible results on July 28.
