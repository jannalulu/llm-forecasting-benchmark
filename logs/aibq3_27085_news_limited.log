**Netanyahu Expects ICC Arrest Warrant Soon**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expects the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for him and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant soon. This comes after the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted a request to the court in May. Netanyahu stated that the court will likely approve the request and issue an arrest warrant soon, possibly before his trip to the United States to address the US Congress on July 24. He added that the closer it gets to the date when the request was submitted, the closer the decision will be made. According to Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, it is not unlikely that the arrest warrant will be issued secretly to prevent interference with the proceedings. 123 countries have signed the Rome Statute, which defines the ICC's powers in The Hague. These countries are expected to enforce the arrest warrant and detain those against whom it is issued, putting Netanyahu at risk of being arrested if his plane is forced to land in a country that has signed the Rome Statute.

**Will the International Criminal Court Issue an Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu Before His Visit to Washington?**
According to Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to be issued an international arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) before his upcoming visit to Washington on July 24. The ICC is expected to issue the warrant in the coming weeks, according to a report. The report also stated that the Israeli government is preparing a 'defensive letter' to respond to the ICC's decision. Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Galant are expected to be issued the warrant, which would be a significant blow to their personal and professional reputations. The report also mentioned that the US is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, but is discussing a 'weak but possible' scenario for Netanyahu's plane to be diverted to a country that is a signatory to the treaty. The Israeli government has denied any concerns about Netanyahu's travel plans. In the past, Israeli intelligence agencies have been accused of spying on high-ranking officials at the ICC, including the former chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and the current prosecutor Karim Khan, and their teams.

**Netanyahu Claims ICC Will Issue Arrest Warrant for Him and Defense Minister Gallant**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue an arrest warrant for him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant soon. According to Yedioth Ahronoth, Netanyahu made this statement during a meeting with Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, and ICC Prosecutor Gali Baharav-Miara. Netanyahu claimed that the decision will be made before his speech at the US Congress on July 24. Israeli officials are concerned about the decision and expect it to be made by January. The ICC may issue the decision secretly, but considering the prosecutor's public statement, it is likely that the decision will be made public. ICC Prosecutor Kerim Han stated that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity since October 8, 2023, and that they have committed crimes such as intentionally causing great suffering, killing, and torture. Han also stated that the Israeli government has used food as a weapon against the Palestinian people, causing widespread and systematic attacks on civilians. He emphasized that the Israeli government's actions are a violation of international humanitarian law and that they will be held accountable.

**Netanyahu and his wife face possibility of international arrest warrants**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara are facing the possibility of international arrest warrants being issued against them. According to Israeli sources, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is expected to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, in the coming days. The ICC is investigating allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 2014 Gaza war. Netanyahu has been accused of being involved in the war crimes and has denied any wrongdoing. The ICC has been investigating the allegations since 2019 and has gathered evidence from various sources, including testimony from witnesses and documents. The ICC has not yet made a formal decision on the matter, but it is expected to do so in the coming days. If the ICC issues arrest warrants, it would be a major blow to Netanyahu's government and could lead to international pressure on Israel to comply with the court's decision.

**ICC warrants for arrest of Netanyahu, Gallant to be issued soon, PM says**
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting to discuss the possibility of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants against him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted a request on May 20, and the court is expected to make a decision soon. Netanyahu anticipates the warrants will be issued, potentially before his speech in front of the U.S. Congress on July 24. Israel is considering its response, including appealing to the court, and the country's signatory status to the Rome Statute means that Netanyahu could be arrested if his plane lands in a country that is a signatory to the treaty.
