**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question: Did the Prime Minister of France on August 31 belong to the France Unbowed party?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 28.75%. The coalition dynamics in the National Assembly were too fragmented for LFI to push through.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. Even with the New Popular Front's influence, the centrist Together and National Rally had their own agendas.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. July's snap elections left the Assembly in a delicate balance. Our data up to July 29 made it clear that LFI's odds were slim.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how the political landscape shifts. Another reminder of the complexity of coalition politics.

*They both nod, acknowledging the intricacies of political forecasting.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Always a challenge, but that's what makes it interesting.

*The camera zooms out as they continue their discussion.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the dust has settled. The question on everyone's mind: Did the Prime Minister of France end up being from France Unbowed?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 38.75%. The political landscape was too fragmented after the snap elections. The New Popular Front, despite strong showing, couldn't consolidate enough power.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The centrist Together coalition seemed to have the upper hand, leveraging their ties with smaller parties. It was a close race, but our models held steady.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The dynamics within the National Assembly made it unlikely for LFI to secure the Prime Ministership. Our projections reflected the reality quite accurately.

*They nod in agreement, the newsroom bustling around them.*

No, our models had it at 32.45%. The snap elections left the National Assembly fragmented, but the centrist Together coalition managed to secure the premiership.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The left-wing New Popular Front, while strong, couldn't consolidate enough power. The dynamics in French politics are fascinating.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the question was whether the Prime Minister would be from France Unbowed. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. Given the political landscape after the snap elections, our models had it at 37.25%.

**NATE SILVER:** No surprise there. The National Assembly was pretty evenly split among the left-wing New Popular Front, centrists, and the far-right.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The coalition dynamics made it unlikely for the LFI to secure the Prime Minister position.

**NATE SILVER:** And as of yesterday, we know our models were spot on.
