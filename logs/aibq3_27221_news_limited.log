**Russia maps show dramatic impact of Ukraine advances in 24 hours**
Ukrainian forces have made significant advances into Russia's Kursk region in just 24 hours, despite Russia's efforts to contain the offensive. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces have 'rapidly advanced' into Kursk, with some reports suggesting they have reached as far as 22 miles into Russian territory. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that Ukraine has lost nearly 1,000 servicemen and 27 armored vehicles, but ISW notes that Ukrainian forces 'most certainly do not control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims.' Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the raid was intended to 'squeeze something out' of Russia and ensure Moscow bargains earnestly in future negotiations. Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, believes Ukraine's motives are likely 'building back up for another go at a counteroffensive in 2025' to try and reverse the momentum of the war and put the Russians on the backfoot. Savill also noted that there is a symbolic motive at play, with Kyiv intending to 'send a signal that they've got the stamina for a long conflict, and indeed one in which the balance will turn in their favor.'

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 8, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the ongoing situation in Kursk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces have been advancing into Russian territory. According to geolocated footage and Russian claims, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance further into Kursk Oblast on August 8, with some reports indicating they are as far as 35 kilometers from the international border with Sumy Oblast. However, it is unclear if Ukrainian forces control all of the territory within the maximalist extent of Russian claims. Russian milbloggers have provided conflicting reports on Ukrainian positions, with some claiming that Ukrainian forces have seized settlements while others claim that they have only advanced part of the way. The ISW notes that Ukrainian forces appear to be using novel and innovative tactics and technological capabilities during operations in Kursk Oblast, which may be a concern for the Russian military command. The Kremlin is likely to respond to the perceived threat to civilians in Kursk Oblast, and the Russian military command has several possible courses of action (COAs) it could pursue to respond to the Ukrainian operation. These COAs include using existing conscripts, Federal Security Service (FSB) border guards, Rosgvardia, and other irregular forces to push Ukrainian forces back; redeploying operational reserves to Kursk Oblast; or redeploying relatively better provisioned and more combat effective frontline units to Kursk Oblast. The ISW notes that the Russian military command's decision-making will be influenced by its perception of the size and capability of Ukrainian forces in the area, and it is unclear which COA is most likely.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Offensive in Kursk Region**
Ukraine has launched a surprise offensive in the Kursk region of Russia, with troops advancing 10-15 kilometers into Russian territory. The offensive, which began on Wednesday, has seen Ukrainian forces control the city of Sudzha and reach as far as Koronevo, 30 kilometers from the border. The Ukrainian military has reportedly used donated German Marder armored vehicles in the operation, which has been described as the largest advance since November 2022. The move has caught Russia off guard, with at least 20,000 Russian troops said to have crossed the border without warning. The Ukrainian government has not publicly stated the goals of the operation, but analysts believe it may be aimed at securing territory for future negotiations or to pressure Russia to withdraw from the Donetsk region. The operation has also raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict, with some critics arguing that Ukraine should focus on supporting its troops in the Donetsk region rather than opening a new front.

**Zelenski Claims Ukrainian Forces Are Advancing in Kursk Offensive**
Ukrainian President Volod√≠mir Zelenski stated on Wednesday (14.08.2024) that the offensive launched last week in the Russian border region of Kursk is advancing in several areas and that in some places on the front line, they have progressed one or two kilometers since the start of the day. 'We have captured over 100 Russian soldiers during this period', Zelenski added in a message published on social media, referring to a report on the situation provided by his chief commander, Oleksandr Sirski. 'I am grateful to all those involved. This will accelerate the return home of our kids and girls', Zelenski stated in his message. Meanwhile, Zelenski warned that the military command does not forget 'a single moment' the situation in the east of the country, where Russian forces are exerting great pressure on the Pokrovsk front, in the Donetsk region (east), with a total of 54 attacks recorded on Tuesday. The president had reported the previous evening that Ukraine had under its control a total of 74 Russian localities, where 'inspections' and 'stabilization measures' were being carried out, while working to take 'humanitarian decisions'. A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson emphasized yesterday that Ukraine 'unlike Russia, does not need foreign territories' and that the objective of the incursion is to protect Ukrainian civilians in border regions, while Zelenski has pointed out that with the operation, they seek to exert pressure on Moscow. While Zelenski claims that his forces are maintaining the advance, the Russian army stated that they 'repelled' the Ukrainian attacks that attempted to advance 'in depth' in the Kursk border region, on the eighth day of an unprecedented offensive by Kiev troops in Russian territory. Something that had already been announced the previous Sunday. The Russian forces, supported by aviation, drones, and artillery, 'repelled the attempts of enemy mobile groups on armored vehicles to penetrate in depth into Russian territory', the army stated in a statement.

**Ukrainian Offensive Reaches Three Miles into Russia**
The Ukrainian counteroffensive has reached approximately three miles into Russian territory and is near the towns of Tolpino and Obsjtjy Kolodez in the Kursk region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, clashes are ongoing in the area. However, a high-ranking official in Ukraine's security services disputes Russian claims that 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers are involved, stating, 'It is false. It is thousands.' In the past few days, over 76,000 people have been evacuated in the Kursk region.

**Moscow Says Ukrainian Troops Now 30 Kilometers Inside Russian Territory as Zelenskyy Admits Kursk Incursion**
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy confirmed that Kyiv was conducting a cross-border offensive into Russia, with Ukrainian forces advancing more than 10 km into the western Kursk region. Russia's defence ministry reported engagements with Ukrainian forces near towns located 25 km and 30 km from the border, marking Ukraine's deepest incursion since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Zelenskyy stated, 'Ukraine is demonstrating its ability to restore justice and apply the necessary pressure on the aggressor.' Ukrainian forces have reported capturing several settlements in the Kursk region, including Guevo, a village approximately 3 km inside Russia. A senior Ukrainian official informed the AFP news agency that the operation involved thousands of troops, significantly more than the minor incursion initially reported by Russian border guards.

**Full Offensive? Ukraine Is Now Taking the Fight to Russia (As In Inside Russia)**
The Ukrainian military has launched a significant offensive operation inside Russia, capturing 135 square miles of territory and advancing 15 miles into Kursk Oblast. This marks a shift from a cross-border raid to a full-blown offensive, threatening key Russian logistical lines and potentially even a nuclear facility. Russian casualties have been heavy, with over 1,140 men reportedly lost in 24 hours. Ukrainian losses are also substantial, but many wounded soldiers return to combat. The move is seen as an alternative strategy to the stalled counteroffensive along the contact line, aiming to force Russia to divert resources. As Stavros Atlamazoglou notes, 'It remains to be seen whether the Ukrainian military leadership launched the offensive just to distract the Russian forces, or if Ukraine means to establish a foothold on enemy territory and expand the contact line.'

**Ukraine Forces Reach 10km Into Russia's Kursk Region As Raid Enters 3rd Day**
The Ukrainian attack on Russian territory in the Kursk region has entered its third day, with Ukrainian troops advancing up to 10 kilometers inside Russian territory. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Ukrainian forces have 'penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold.' The assault has resulted in the capture of Sudzha, a key gas logistical hub, and thousands of civilians have been evacuated due to reports of casualties. Ukrainian sources claim that Russian border guards and conscripts have surrendered, while videos of the border fighting show heavy losses on the Ukrainian side. Analysts believe that the attack is part of a larger plan to cause confusion in Russian military ranks and force the diversion of resources away from the frontlines in the Donbass region. The European Union has fully supported the actions of Ukraine's military, with European Commission spokesman Peter Stano stating that Ukraine has the right to defend itself, 'including by striking the aggressor on its territory.' The Kremlin has reported that its forces have killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops in the ongoing assault. 'The EU continues to fully support Ukraine's legitimate right to defend itself' and win back its lost territories, Stano said. 'Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory,' ISW said in an update. 'The current confirmed extent and location of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' ISW added. Mykhailo Podolyak, a presidential aide, said, 'The root cause of any escalation, shelling, military actions, forced evacuations and destruction of normal life forms - including within the Russian Federation's own territories like Kursk and Belgorod regions - is solely Russia's unequivocal aggression.' Kostyantyn Mashovets, a war expert, said, 'It wasn't accidental, it's clearly part of one clear plan.' Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov, a military analyst, said, 'If you look at official reports, there were significantly fewer Russian glide bombs dropped in the Donetsk area, that means the aircraft which carry them are now elsewhere in Russia.'

**Ukraine Advances into Russian Territory, Captures 11 Settlements**
According to the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances of up to 10 kilometers in the Russian oblast of Kursk, as part of ongoing mechanized offensive operations. The analysis is based on the examination of geolocated videos published in the last 48 hours, which show Ukrainian armored vehicles advancing to positions 10 kilometers from the border. 'The current extent and confirmed position of the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' the ISW said. A Russian internal source stated that Ukrainian forces have taken 45 square kilometers of territory within the Kursk oblast since launching the operation on August 6. Other Russian sources reported that Ukrainian forces have captured 11 settlements, including Nikolaevo-Daryino, Darino, and Sverdlikovo, and are operating within Lyubimovka. Videos shared on Telegram show civilians fleeing the areas involved in the clashes, with hundreds of people reportedly evacuated. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the Ukrainian offensive as 'a provocation,' while the Ministry of Defense initially denied the presence of Ukrainian soldiers and equipment in Russian territory before later admitting to the breach and providing information on the effective intervention of Russian forces, as said by 'The current extent and confirmed position of the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk oblast indicate that Ukrainian forces have penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold,' the ISW said.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance 10 Kilometers into Russian Kursk Region**
According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces have advanced 10 kilometers into the Russian Kursk region. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed data and confirmed the advancement of Ukrainian forces into the region. The ISW stated, 'Confirmed that on August 7, Ukrainian forces advanced 10 kilometers into the Kursk region of Russia in the context of ongoing mechanized assault operations on Russian territory.' The ISW also noted that Ukrainian forces have breached at least two Russian defensive lines and an outpost. The Russian government's reaction to Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region has been inconsistent, with officials trying to balance representing the efforts as a significant escalation by Ukraine while avoiding exaggerating the potential consequences and risking internal discontent. Some Russian 'military' bloggers have criticized the Russian military command for not preparing for Ukrainian offensive operations in the Kursk region or preventing them. Ukrainian forces have also successfully adapted their capabilities in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using a FPV-drone to shoot down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over the Kursk region. The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kyrylo Budanov, estimated that the Russian offensive potential will reach its climax within 1.5-2 months, which aligns with the ISW's assessment of Russia's current offensive potential. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Daniel Bell, stated that Russia has been torturing 95% of Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russian prisons. The Central Election Commission of Moldova announced that it will not register the pro-Russian 'Victory' electoral bloc for the presidential election and referendum in October 2024. A Russian court sentenced Andriy Kurshin, the administrator of the Telegram channel of the Russian ultranationalist blogger 'Moscow Calls', to 6.5 years in prison for publishing 'fake' information about Russian military personnel. Ukrainian forces have recently regained positions south of Chasiv Yar, while Russian forces have advanced northeast of Siversk, southwest of Donetsk, and in the border areas of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 7, 2024**
Ukrainian forces have made confirmed advances up to 10 kilometers into Russia's Kursk Oblast amid continued mechanized offensive operations on Russian territory on August 7. The Kremlin's response to Ukrainian offensive activities in Kursk Oblast has been contradictory, with Russian officials attempting to balance presenting the effort as a notable Ukrainian escalation with avoiding overstating its potential implications and risking domestic discontent. Select Russian milbloggers have heavily criticized the Russian military command for not detecting preparations for or preventing Ukrainian offensive operations into Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces have reportedly used a first-person view (FPV) drone to down a Russian Mi-28 helicopter over Kursk Oblast, indicating that Ukrainian forces continue to successfully adapt their drone capabilities. Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Head Kyrylo Budanov assessed on August 7 that Russian offensive potential will culminate within one and a half to two months, generally consistent with ISW's assessment on current Russia's offensive capabilities. Head of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), Danielle Bell, stated that Russia has tortured 95 percent of Ukrainian prisoners-of-war (POWs) in Russian detention. The Moldovan Central Electoral Commission (CEC) announced on August 7 that it would not register the pro-Kremlin Victory electoral bloc in the October 2024 Moldovan presidential election and referendum. A Russian court sentenced Andrey Kurshin, administrator of the 'Moscow Calling' Russian ultranationalist milblogger Telegram channel, to six and a half years in prison on August 7 for publishing 'fake' information about the Russian military.

**Putin humiliated as Ukraine saboteurs launch surprise assault deep in Russian territory**
Approximately 300 Ukrainian soldiers launched a surprise cross-border attack into Russian territory on Tuesday, reaching as far as six miles (10 km) inside Russia, according to Moscow. The attack, which was bolstered by 11 tanks and more than 20 armored fighting vehicles, was initiated at 8am and persisted throughout the day between the border villages of Nikolayevo-Daryino and Oleshnya in Russia's Kursk region. Russian claims of successfully repelling the incursion were quickly proved false, with reports from Russian military bloggers and social media footage indicating the Ukrainian attack was highly significant. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the anti-disinformation department at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, acknowledged the attack's occurrence, suggesting it had not been fully defeated. Military analysts suggest the attack could aim to divert Russian forces to defend an underactive part of the front since spring 2022 and boost Ukrainian morale. However, critics in Ukraine argue such assaults yield no long-term military advantage.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 6, 2024**
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted a series of cross-border raids into Kursk Oblast on August 6, but Russian milbloggers largely dismissed the claims. Ukrainian officials have largely yet to comment on the raids. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu heavily overexaggerated Russian advances in Ukraine since mid-June 2024, stating that Russian forces have seized 420 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory, when in fact ISW has observed evidence confirming that Russian forces have seized approximately 290 square kilometers since June 14. Russian officials continue coordination and military cooperation with Iran ahead of the Iranian retaliatory strike against Israel out of concern for Russian interests in the region. Armenia continues to abstain from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Russian forces advanced east of Toretsk, and fighting continued in various areas of Ukraine, including Kharkiv Oblast, Luhansk Oblast, and Donetsk Oblast.
