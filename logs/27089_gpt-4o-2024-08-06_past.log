To forecast whether any new iPhone model will be announced supporting Wi-Fi 7 before October 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Technological Advancements**: Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) is the next generation of Wi-Fi technology, offering faster speeds and improved efficiency over Wi-Fi 6 and 6E. As of August 2024, the development and deployment of Wi-Fi 7 technology are progressing, and some consumer devices may already support Wi-Fi 7.

2. **Appleâ€™s Release Patterns**: Historically, Apple tends to announce new iPhone models in September each year, aligning with its annual event. If Apple were to introduce an iPhone 16 with Wi-Fi 7, a September 2024 announcement is plausible.

3. **Market and Competitive Pressures**: Competing smartphone manufacturers may already be incorporating Wi-Fi 7 into their newer models to offer enhanced connectivity features. Apple typically endeavors to maintain or exceed technological parity with competitors.

4. **Leak and Rumor Analysis**: As of the current date, rumors and leaks may hint at specifications of the expected new iPhone models. However, the veracity of these claims can vary, and the resolution criteria clearly state that only official announcements matter.

5. **Previous iPhone Model Features**: The iPhone 15 series, released in September 2023, did not include Wi-Fi 7. Apple might incorporate this feature in their upcoming 2024 release to stay competitive and to provide customers with state-of-the-art technology.

Given the above considerations, Apple is likely preparing for a new model announcement, possibly with enhanced connectivity features like Wi-Fi 7, as they have historically aligned upgrades with annual product announcements. However, there is still uncertainty as official confirmation is lacking at this moment.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.
