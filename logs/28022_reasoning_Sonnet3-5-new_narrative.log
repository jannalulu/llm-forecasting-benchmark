Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about SpaceX's updates page.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given their posting pattern and the technical issues they'd been having with their website, our models had it at 32.15%.

Nate: The interesting part was how their August 12th post remained their last update. Their communication strategy has shifted significantly this year.

Philip: [adjusting his glasses] The website stability issues we detected in early September played a crucial role in our calculations. Plus, their focus seemed to be more on X (formerly Twitter) for announcements.

Nate: [pulls up a chart] Looking back, their posting frequency had been declining since mid-2024. The probability reflected both their changing communication patterns and technical infrastructure challenges.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting methodology.

[Both smile knowingly as they turn to their next prediction]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Looking back at SpaceX's posting patterns and considering their historical update frequency..."

Philip Tetlock: [interrupting] "Indeed. Given their last post was August 12th, and analyzing their posting intervals throughout 2024, our models had it at 78.32%."

Nate: "The interesting factor was their consistent monthly updates earlier in the year. Though, we had to account for their recent slowdown in communications."

Philip: "Exactly. The model incorporated their previous patterns, the timing of major launches, and their public relations strategy. The probability reflected their typical end-of-quarter update behavior."

Nate: "And here we are, with another successful prediction. SpaceX's new post about their latest Starship developments came right on schedule, just as our models suggested."

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about SpaceX's updates page.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given their pattern of sporadic updates and the fact their last post was August 12th, our models had it at 78.32%.

Nate: [nodding] The timing was interesting. They've been more active with their social media presence lately, but that Updates page has always been reserved for major announcements.

Philip: The historical data showed they typically post every 6-8 weeks. When we made our prediction in September, considering their recent Starship developments, it was highly likely they'd make an announcement.

Nate: And they did, just as predicted. That September 28th post about the new Raptor engine modifications was exactly the kind of update our model anticipated.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting.
