To forecast whether "Deadpool & Wolverine" will have a domestic box office opening higher than the combined opening of "Deadpool" (2016) and "The Wolverine" (2013), we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Performance**: "Deadpool" had a very strong opening, thanks to a unique marketing campaign, positive reviews, and a strong fanbase for the character. "The Wolverine," on the other hand, had a more modest opening.

2. **Brand and Franchise Strength**: The collaboration of Deadpool and Wolverine brings together two very popular Marvel characters played by beloved actors Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. Such a pairing is expected to generate considerable buzz and anticipation.

3. **Recent Box Office Trends**: The superhero genre, especially from Marvel, typically performs well at the box office. With ongoing interest in these characters and the potential novelty of their collaboration, there's potential for a strong opening.

4. **Marketing and Release Timing**: If marketing replicates or improves upon the success seen with "Deadpool," it could boost opening numbers. The release timing of the film (summer 2024) is also favorable for blockbusters.

5. **Potential Competition**: The performance will also depend on competing releases around the same time.

6. **Economic and Social Factors**: General economic conditions and any pandemic-related restrictions could impact theater attendance but appear unlikely given past trends.

Considering these factors, I estimate the probability:

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.
