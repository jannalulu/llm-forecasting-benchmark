**Will Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate before Election Day?**
The 2024 presidential debate schedule remains uncertain due to disagreements between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump had agreed to debate President Biden on Sept. 10, but after Biden withdrew, Trump pulled out of the ABC News debate, citing a defamation lawsuit against the network. Trump instead accepted a Fox News counterproposal for a Sept. 4 debate. Harris has publicly pressured Trump to meet her on stage for the ABC News debate, but it's unclear if they will face off in a formal debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates has planned traditional debates for September and October, but both Biden and Trump balked at letting the commission take charge this year. Instead, they agreed to their own rules and have two debates directly hosted by television networks: one by CNN and one by ABC News. The CNN debate occurred earlier this summer, and Harris is expected to soon announce her vice presidential candidate, who might face off against Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance in a debate.

**Donald Trump Agrees to Debate Kamala Harris Ahead of 2024 US Presidential Elections**
Donald Trump has announced that he is willing to debate with Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's candidate, ahead of the 2024 US presidential elections. Trump made the statement during an interview with Fox News, where he mentioned that the debate could take place before the early voting begins in September. The debate is expected to occur on September 10, with Harris confirming her attendance, stating that she will attend 'regardless of whether Donald Trump is there or not'. This comes after Trump criticized the timing of the second debate in the 2020 election, which took place after early voting had begun. Harris has not yet been officially designated as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, but is expected to receive the nomination at the party's convention on August 19, 2024.

**When is the next presidential debate? Here's when Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will face off**
Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to a debate on September 10 on ABC, moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis. The debate comes after a turbulent summer in which President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, clearing the way for Harris to pick up the mantle. Harris has confirmed she will attend the debate, saying, 'I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States.' According to recent polls, Harris is leading Trump in three key swing states, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, with 50% of voters choosing Harris and 46% choosing Trump. Across the United States, Harris leads Trump 42% to 37% in the race for the Oval Office. Election day is on Tuesday, November 5.

**Trump Accepts Debate Challenge from Kamala Harris**
Former US President Donald Trump has agreed to a live debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris before the November 5 presidential election. The debate, moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, will take place on September 4 at a stadium in Pennsylvania. Trump stated, 'Democrats have unofficially replaced their losing candidate. This is a threat to the democratic process, but I'm ready for it. I'm ready to debate Kamala Harris.' Trump emphasized that the debate rules will be the same as those used in his previous debate with President Joe Biden. Trump expressed his eagerness to debate Harris, saying, 'I'm looking forward to the September 4 debate, as I will be facing a new opponent with the same bad policies.' However, Kamala Harris has yet to respond to Fox News' debate invitation. Jaime Harrison, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, announced that Harris has been guaranteed the Democratic nomination.

**Trump Agrees to Debate Kamala Harris—but on His Terms**
Donald Trump has agreed to debate Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris on September 4 on Fox News, but with conditions. Trump claims it would be a 'conflict of interest' to debate on ABC, as he is currently suing the network and host George Stephanopoulos for defamation. He also wants a full arena audience and the debate to be held in Pennsylvania. Trump reminded everyone that the coronation of Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee despite receiving zero primary votes is a 'threat to Democracy'. Trump said, 'I look forward to meeting and debating Kamala Harris on September 4th. This date is convenient and appropriate in that it is just prior to the September 6th start of Early Voting in the 2024 Presidential Election.' Trump also stated, 'I have agreed with FoxNews to debate Kamala Harris on Wednesday, September 4th. The Debate was previously scheduled against Sleepy Joe Biden on ABC, but has been terminated in that Biden will no longer be a participant, and I am in litigation against ABC Network and George Slopadopoulos, thereby creating a conflict of interest.'

**Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris for US Election 2024 - It's official but when is next Presidential debate?**
Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, will face off against Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris in the November 5 US Presidential election. Harris secured enough votes from Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee, according to Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison. The Trump campaign has not committed to a debate with Harris, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stating that Trump welcomes the opportunity to compare records, but stopped short of confirming a debate. Recent polls show a tight contest between Harris and Trump, who had previously enjoyed a bigger lead over Joe Biden after their first debate. Trump emerged as the clear victor in his June 27 debate with Biden, whose faltering performance raised concerns about his age. The two had agreed to a second debate on September 10, but it is unclear if this will still take place.

The 2024 presidential election debate schedule has been outlined, with three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate set to take place. The debates will be hosted by nonpartisan organizations and will feature moderators from various networks.

The Commission on Presidential Debates sets the schedule, which includes 90-minute debates starting at 9 p.m. ET. Kamala Harris has agreed to debate Donald Trump on September 10, but the GOP nominee's campaign had initially declined to commit until the Democratic nominee was formally decided.

'Democrats formally decide on their nominee,' said the GOP nominee's campaign, in response to Harris's announcement. 'We will not commit to any debates until then.'

**Trump says he'll debate Kamala Harris, but only after his nomination**
Former US President and Republican candidate Donald Trump has stated that he would debate with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, but only after his official nomination. Trump's campaign said that he would not commit to any future debates until his condition is met. However, Trump had previously agreed to a debate with current President Joe Biden, organized by ABC on September 10. It is now unclear if the debate will take place as planned.

The Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, will be a crucial moment in defining the candidacy.

**Trump Refuses to Debate Harris Until She's Officially Nominated**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign announced that he will not participate in a debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris until she is officially nominated by her party. Trump's campaign spokesperson, Stephen Chong, stated that 'it would be unfair to schedule a debate with Harris before the Democrats have officially chosen their nominee'. Chong also mentioned that 'there is a strong feeling among many Democratic Party members, including Barack Obama, that Harris is a Marxist who cannot defeat Trump, and they are waiting for a better candidate'. Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, responded by saying she is 'ready' to debate Trump. Trump's campaign has not committed to a specific date for the debate, but has suggested that there will be multiple debates. Fox News has proposed a debate on September 17 in Pennsylvania, which would be moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.
