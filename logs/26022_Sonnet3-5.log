To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the key evidence and factors, then weigh them to arrive at a prediction range.

Key considerations:

1. Historical precedent: The ICC has not previously issued arrest warrants for sitting Israeli officials. This suggests a low base rate.

2. Recent developments: Multiple news sources from May-June 2024 report that the ICC prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. This is a significant escalation from previous ICC involvement.

3. Timing: The question asks about an arrest warrant before September 30, 2024. The most recent reports suggest a decision could come within weeks or months, well before the September deadline.

4. International pressure: There appears to be growing international pressure on the ICC to take action, particularly regarding the situation in Gaza.

5. Potential delays: Some reports indicate the UK and other countries have filed interventions that could delay the process by months.

6. US opposition: The US strongly opposes ICC action against Israeli officials, which could influence the court's decision.

7. Strength of evidence: Multiple reports suggest the ICC prosecutor believes there is strong evidence to support issuing arrest warrants.

8. Precedent of targeting leaders: The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for other heads of state, showing willingness to target high-level officials.

Weighing these factors:

The recent reports of the ICC prosecutor requesting arrest warrants and the apparent strength of evidence suggest a higher probability than the historical base rate would indicate. However, international opposition, particularly from the US, and potential delays due to interventions from countries like the UK introduce significant uncertainty.

The timeline until September 30, 2024, provides ample time for the process to unfold, which increases the likelihood compared to a shorter timeframe.

Given these considerations, I believe there is a substantial chance of an arrest warrant being issued, but it's far from certain.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 75.00%, with 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on specific evidence:

Base rate:
The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or high-ranking officials relatively rarely. Notable examples include Sudan's Omar al-Bashir in 2009 and Russia's Vladimir Putin in 2023. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps around 5-10% for any given year.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple news sources report that the ICC prosecutor has requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant in May 2024.
2. The reported charges are serious, including war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Gaza conflict.
3. There appears to be significant international pressure and attention on the situation.
4. Some sources suggest the warrants could be issued within weeks of the May 2024 request.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. The ICC has delayed its decision on issuing the warrants as of June 28, 2024, after intervention requests from countries like the UK.
2. The US and other Israeli allies oppose the ICC's jurisdiction, which could lead to diplomatic pressure against issuing warrants.
3. The process of issuing arrest warrants can be lengthy and complex, especially for high-profile cases.
4. Israel is not a member of the ICC, which could complicate the legal process.

Balancing these factors:
The reported request for arrest warrants and the serious nature of the charges suggest a higher probability than the base rate. However, the reported delay and potential diplomatic complications lower the likelihood somewhat.

The deadline of September 30, 2024, provides several months for the ICC to make a decision after the reported delay in June. This timeframe increases the likelihood compared to a shorter deadline.

Given these considerations, I estimate a range higher than the base rate but still reflecting significant uncertainty:

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 60.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down and analyze the key factors:

1. Timeline: We're looking at the period from now (October 18, 2024) until September 30, 2024. This gives us about 11.5 months for the event to occur.

2. Historical precedent: The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state before, such as Sudan's Omar al-Bashir in 2009. However, it's less common for leaders of Western-aligned countries.

3. Current situation: The news articles provided indicate that the ICC was considering issuing arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant earlier in 2024. However, the most recent articles (from June 28, 2024) suggest that the ICC delayed its decision after the UK filed a request for intervention.

4. Geopolitical factors: Israel is not a member of the ICC, and its allies (particularly the US) have strongly opposed ICC jurisdiction over Israeli officials. This creates significant political pressure against issuing such warrants.

5. Evidence threshold: The ICC requires "reasonable grounds to believe" that an individual has committed crimes within its jurisdiction. The articles suggest that the prosecutor believes this threshold has been met for both Netanyahu and Gallant.

6. Precedent set by Netanyahu warrant: Many articles indicate that if a warrant is issued, it would likely be for both Netanyahu and Gallant. This suggests their cases are linked.

7. Time pressure: With the deadline of September 30, 2024, there's still time for the ICC to make a decision, but it's getting tight given the delays reported in June.

Weighing these factors:

- The historical precedent and the prosecutor's apparent belief in the strength of the evidence suggest a non-trivial possibility of a warrant being issued.
- However, the political pressure against such a move and the reported delays are significant counterweights.
- The link between Netanyahu's and Gallant's cases suggests that if a warrant is issued for one, it's likely to be issued for both.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a meaningful chance of an arrest warrant being issued, but it's not the most likely outcome. The political obstacles and the reported delays make it more likely that the ICC will either not issue a warrant or will delay beyond the September 30 deadline.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence available:

Base rate:
The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or senior government officials relatively rarely. However, it has done so in some high-profile cases (e.g. Omar al-Bashir, Vladimir Putin). This suggests a low but non-zero base rate.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple news sources report that the ICC is actively considering issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant.
2. The ICC prosecutor has publicly requested arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant.
3. There are serious allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the Gaza conflict.
4. The ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.
2. There is strong political opposition from the US and other Israeli allies to ICC action against Israeli officials.
3. The ICC has delayed its decision on the warrants, granting more time for countries to submit briefs.
4. Issuing such high-profile warrants would be a major step for the ICC and may face internal resistance.

Balancing these factors:
The evidence suggests there is a significant chance the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Gallant before Sept 30, 2024. The prosecutor's public request and multiple news reports indicating active consideration are strong signals. However, the political opposition and jurisdictional disputes create substantial uncertainty.

The delay in the ICC's decision introduces a timing element. While this gives more time for opposition, it also suggests the court is seriously considering the warrants rather than dismissing them outright.

Given these factors, I estimate there is a moderate probability the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Gallant before the specified date, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 70.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

Base rates:
The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state before, such as Vladimir Putin in 2023. However, this is relatively rare. Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates matters.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. The most recent articles (from June 28, 2024) indicate that the ICC has delayed its decision on issuing arrest warrants.
2. The UK and other countries have been given until July 12 to submit briefs, which could further delay the process.
3. There is significant opposition from the US and other Israeli allies to the ICC's jurisdiction in this matter.
4. The delay could push the arrest warrant process off for months, potentially beyond the September 30, 2024 deadline.

Balancing the evidence:
While there seems to be strong momentum towards issuing arrest warrants, the recent delay and potential for further delays are significant factors. The opposition from powerful allies like the US could also slow or halt the process.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by examining the base rates and then consider the specific evidence presented in the news articles.

Base rates:
The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state before, such as Vladimir Putin in 2023. However, this is relatively rare. Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates matters.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple news sources report that the ICC is considering or has already decided to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant.
2. The reported crimes (war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza) fall under the ICC's jurisdiction.
3. There appears to be significant international pressure and evidence gathering related to these allegations.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. The most recent articles (from June 28, 2024) indicate that the ICC has delayed its decision on issuing arrest warrants.
2. The UK and other countries have been given until July 12 to submit briefs, which could further delay the process.
3. There is significant opposition from the US and other Israeli allies to the ICC's jurisdiction in this matter.
4. The delay could push the arrest warrant process off for months, potentially beyond the September 30, 2024 deadline.

Balancing the evidence:
While there seems to be strong momentum towards issuing arrest warrants, the recent delay and potential for further delays are significant factors. The opposition from powerful allies like the US could also slow or halt the process.

Given that the question specifically asks about Yoav Gallant (not Netanyahu), and that most reports mention both Netanyahu and Gallant together, I'll assume the probability is similar for both.

Considering the September 30, 2024 deadline, there's still time for the ICC to issue the warrants, but the delays introduce uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.
