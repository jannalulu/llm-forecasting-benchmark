To approach this forecast, I'll analyze the available evidence, consider relevant factors, and apply superforecasting principles:

1. Reference class: The combined domestic opening weekend box office for "Deadpool" ($132,434,639) and "The Wolverine" ($53,113,752) is $185,548,391. We need to assess whether "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed this amount.

2. Recent projections: Multiple sources from June and July 2024 project an opening weekend of $160-165 million, with some forecasts as high as $200-239 million. Even the lower end of these projections ($160 million) would fall short of the $185.5 million threshold.

3. Box office trends: The movie industry has faced challenges in recent years, but superhero films, especially those with established characters, tend to perform well.

4. Unique factors:
   - First R-rated MCU film, potentially broadening audience appeal
   - Combination of two popular characters (Deadpool and Wolverine)
   - High anticipation due to previous Deadpool films' success
   - Only Marvel film scheduled for 2024, increasing pent-up demand

5. Potential limitations:
   - R-rating may limit some audience segments
   - Possible superhero fatigue
   - Economic factors affecting discretionary spending

6. Historical performance: Both previous Deadpool films outperformed expectations. The first Deadpool's $132.4 million opening surpassed projections.

7. Pre-sales data: Reports indicate strong pre-sales, with some sources mentioning record-breaking numbers for an R-rated film.

8. Industry expert opinions: Consistently positive outlook from multiple tracking services and industry analysts.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a high probability that "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the $185.5 million threshold. The consistent projections above this figure, combined with historical performance and unique appeal factors, strongly suggest an opening weekend above the target.

However, I must account for potential overconfidence and unexpected factors. There's still a small chance that unforeseen circumstances (e.g., poor reviews, competing events) could dampen the opening weekend performance.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 91.50% being the most likely. Probability: 91.50%.

To approach this forecast, I'll start by examining the key data points and trends:

1. Historical performance: The combined opening weekend for "Deadpool" ($132,434,639) and "The Wolverine" ($53,113,752) is $185,548,391. This sets our benchmark.

2. Recent tracking: Multiple sources in June-July 2024 projected "Deadpool & Wolverine" to open between $160-165 million, with some estimates as high as $200-239 million.

3. R-rating factor: This would be the highest opening for an R-rated film, potentially breaking "Deadpool"'s previous record.

4. Marvel/Disney backing: As the only Marvel film in 2024, it has strong studio support and marketing.

5. Star power: The combination of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is a major draw.

6. Pre-sales performance: Reports indicate strong advance ticket sales, breaking records for R-rated films.

7. Franchise momentum: Both previous Deadpool films were successful, with the second outperforming the first.

8. Market conditions: The 2024 box office has been struggling, potentially increasing pent-up demand for a big blockbuster.

9. Critical uncertainty: While projections are high, there's always uncertainty in box office performance, especially for R-rated films.

Balancing these factors:

- The lower-end projections of $160-165 million would already come close to the combined total we're comparing against.
- The higher-end projections of $200-239 million would easily surpass it.
- The strong pre-sales, star power, and franchise momentum all point towards a very strong opening.
- However, the R-rating could potentially limit the audience somewhat compared to typical Marvel releases.

Given this analysis, I believe there's a very high probability that "Deadpool & Wolverine" will surpass the combined opening of its predecessors. Even if it underperforms projections slightly, it would likely still clear the $185.5 million mark.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 92.00% being the most likely. Probability: 92.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll start by looking at relevant base rates and then adjust based on the specific evidence for this film:

Base rates:
- The original Deadpool had a $132.4M opening weekend
- The Wolverine had a $53.1M opening weekend
- Their combined total is $185.5M, which is the threshold we're comparing against
- Deadpool 2 opened to $125.5M domestically

Key evidence for a higher opening:
1. Multiple tracking reports project Deadpool & Wolverine to open between $160M-$165M, with some even higher at $200M-$239M.
2. This is the first R-rated MCU film, combining two popular characters.
3. The trailer broke viewing records with 365 million views in 24 hours.
4. Pre-sales are strong, with 200,000 tickets sold on the first day (a record for R-rated films).
5. There's pent-up demand for a big Marvel movie, as this is the only one in 2024.

Evidence for a lower opening:
1. R-rating limits some of the potential audience.
2. Some recent Marvel films have underperformed expectations.
3. The box office in 2024 has generally been weaker than expected.
4. Projections this far out can be unreliable and tend to skew optimistic.

Balancing these factors:
- The consistent projections from multiple sources in the $160M-$165M range provide a strong anchor.
- The combination of Deadpool and Wolverine, plus MCU integration, suggests this could significantly outperform their individual openings.
- Strong pre-sales and trailer views indicate high audience interest.
- However, we should be cautious about extremely high projections given recent Marvel performance and the R-rating limitation.

Given all this evidence, I believe there's a very high likelihood that Deadpool & Wolverine will surpass the $185.5M combined opening of Deadpool and The Wolverine. However, I want to account for some uncertainty given how far out we are from release and the potential for unexpected events.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical performance:
- Deadpool (2016) opening weekend: $132,434,639
- The Wolverine (2013) opening weekend: $53,113,752
- Combined total: $185,548,391

2. Recent box office projections for Deadpool & Wolverine:
- Most recent projections (July 2024) estimate $160-165 million opening weekend
- Earlier projections (June 2024) were higher, ranging from $200-239 million

3. Factors supporting a higher opening:
- Combination of two popular characters (Deadpool and Wolverine)
- First R-rated MCU film, generating buzz
- Strong presales reported ($19 million as of early July)
- Positive audience anticipation (66% interested, 61% prefer theater viewing)

4. Factors potentially limiting the opening:
- R-rating may limit audience size compared to PG-13 superhero films
- Possible superhero fatigue affecting some recent Marvel releases
- General box office struggles in 2024

5. Trend analysis:
- Projections have decreased from June to July (from $200-239M to $160-165M)
- However, even the lower projections still exceed the combined total of the previous films

6. Comparative analysis:
- Would set new record for R-rated openings (current record: Deadpool with $132.4M)
- Would be significantly higher than previous Deadpool and Wolverine solo films

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a strong likelihood that Deadpool & Wolverine will exceed the combined total of $185,548,391. Even the lower end of recent projections ($160M) is relatively close to this number, and there's potential for overperformance given the buzz and presales.

However, I want to account for some uncertainty due to the evolving projections and potential market factors. Therefore, I'll provide a range that leans towards a positive outcome but allows for some possibility of underperformance.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

3. R-rated record: The current record for an R-rated opening is held by the first Deadpool at $132.4 million. This sequel is widely expected to break that record.

4. Franchise popularity: Both Deadpool films and Wolverine have strong fanbases. Combining them is likely to draw even more interest.

5. Marvel Cinematic Universe factor: This is the first R-rated MCU film, which could attract both hardcore fans and curious newcomers.

6. Box office trends: The 2024 box office has been struggling, but successful franchises still tend to perform well.

7. Pre-sales data: Reports indicate strong pre-sales, with 200,000 tickets sold on the first day - a record for an R-rated film.

8. Trailer views: The trailer received 365 million views in 24 hours, indicating high interest.

Weighing these factors:

- The lower-end projections of $160-165 million would already beat the combined total we're comparing against ($185.5 million).
- Even conservative estimates suggest this film will break the R-rated opening record.
- The combination of two popular characters in the MCU for the first time is likely to drive significant interest.
- Strong pre-sales and trailer views support the higher-end projections.

However, we should be cautious about:
- Potential "superhero fatigue" affecting overall box office performance
- The R-rating potentially limiting the audience compared to other MCU films
- The possibility of projections being overly optimistic, as has happened with some recent films

5. Marvel Cinematic Universe factor: This is the first R-rated MCU film, which could attract both hardcore fans and curious newcomers.

6. Box office trends: The 2024 box office has been struggling, but successful franchises still tend to perform well.

7. Pre-sales data: Reports indicate strong pre-sales, with 200,000 tickets sold on the first day - a record for an R-rated film.

8. Trailer views: The trailer received 365 million views in 24 hours, indicating high interest.

Weighing these factors:

- The lower-end projections of $160-165 million would already beat the combined total we're comparing against ($185.5 million).
- Even conservative estimates suggest this film will break the R-rated opening record.
- The combination of two popular characters in the MCU for the first time is likely to drive significant interest.
- Strong pre-sales and trailer views support the higher-end projections.

However, we should be cautious about:
- Potential "superhero fatigue" affecting overall box office performance
- The R-rating potentially limiting the audience compared to other MCU films
- The possibility of projections being overly optimistic, as has happened with some recent films

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a very high probability that "Deadpool & Wolverine" will exceed the combined opening of its predecessors. Even if it underperforms relative to the highest projections, it would likely still clear this bar.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.
