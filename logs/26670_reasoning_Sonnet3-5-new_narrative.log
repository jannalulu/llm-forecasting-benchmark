Here's a 150-word script set on September 1, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the French PM situation."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at the political landscape we had until July 29, with those split election results between NFP, Together, and National Rally, our models had it at 15.25%."

Nate: "The three-way deadlock made it unlikely that NFP would secure the premiership without compromising with LFI. The fragmented National Assembly really constrained the possibilities."

Philip: "Exactly. The probability was low but not negligible. We had to account for the possibility of a coalition deal, but LFI's strong position within NFP made it improbable that a non-LFI NFP member would emerge as PM."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting methodology."

[Scene: A dimly lit café in Paris, September 1st, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing over coffee.]

Nate: Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Prime Minister situation.

Philip: Indeed. With the three-way split in the National Assembly after those summer snap elections, our models had it at 15.20%. The fragmented political landscape made it unlikely for any NFP member outside LFI to secure the position.

Nate: The data was fascinating. The near-equal distribution between NFP, Together, and National Rally created a deadlock scenario. Even with NFP's strong showing, the internal divisions within the coalition made it improbable for a non-LFI member to emerge as PM.

Philip: Exactly. The historical precedent of coalition dynamics in French politics, combined with the June-July electoral data, gave us clear indicators. It's another validation of our probabilistic approach.

[They both sip their coffee thoughtfully]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were remarkably precise about yesterday's outcome. With the three-way split in the National Assembly, we knew it would be complex."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 15.25%. The fragmented parliament made it unlikely that someone from the New Popular Front, excluding LFI, would become Prime Minister. The centrist Together coalition had too much leverage."

Nate: "The data from late July showed the NFP struggling to unite behind a non-LFI candidate. The three-way deadlock in the Assembly after those snap elections made consensus building nearly impossible."

Philip: "Exactly. While the NFP had significant representation, the historical tendency for French presidents to choose Prime Ministers from more moderate factions was a strong indicator. Our probability assessment reflected these institutional constraints."
