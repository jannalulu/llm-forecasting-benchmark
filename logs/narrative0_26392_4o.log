INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (OCTOBER 3, 2024)

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.

NATE  
Well, Phil, it's the day after. The question everyone's been asking: Will OpenAI announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 35.42%. The announcement of GPT-4o in May was a strong indicator they'd take more time.

NATE  
Right. The tech landscape's shifting, but OpenAI seemed focused on refining rather than rushing.

PHILIP  
Exactly. The absence of any substantial leaks or performance results by July was telling. Our models factored in OpenAI's strategic silence.

NATE  
A calculated move, then. The world waits, but the models spoke true.

PHILIP  
Indeed. Now, the anticipation builds. GPT-5 will come, just not yet.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers strewn about.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did OpenAI announce GPT-5 before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. The GPT-4o announcement in May hinted at a long development cycle.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Given the July 22nd cutoff for our data, the focus seemed to be on refining GPT-4o rather than jumping to GPT-5.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The tech landscape was more about incremental improvements. No significant indicators of a leap forward.

**NATE SILVER:** It’s fascinating how our models predicted this. The absence of a GPT-5 announcement aligns with the broader trend of cautious AI development.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. A testament to the power of accurate forecasting.

*They nod in agreement, the future still full of probabilities.*
