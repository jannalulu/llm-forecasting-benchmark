Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Question resolves on September 30, 2024
- Today is July 29, 2024
- Only about 2 months remain for resolution

2. Key Requirements:
- Must be detected by direct optical observation
- Planet must have radius larger than Earth
- Orbital period must be greater than 5,000 years
- Must be confirmed by credible sources

3. Supporting Evidence:
- Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which could help detect Planet Nine, won't begin scanning until 2025
- Multiple recent articles indicate scientists believe discovery is possible but not imminent
- Mike Brown (Caltech) states "impossible to be 100% sure until you see it"
- Astronomical observations indicate unusual orbits suggesting Planet Nine's existence

4. Limiting Factors:
- Current technology limitations make detection difficult
- Planet Nine estimated to be ~500 astronomical units away
- Very faint due to extreme distance
- No major new telescopes coming online before deadline

5. Historical Context:
- No similar planets have been discovered at such distances
- Previous planet predictions (like Vulcan) have failed
- Detection of Neptune and Uranus required specific conditions

6. Recent Developments:
- No reported breakthrough observations
- Scientists consistently indicating timeline of "years" rather than months
- Most optimistic predictions still point to 2025 or later

Given that:
- The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (most promising tool) won't be operational until 2025
- The extremely short timeframe remaining (2 months)
- The technical challenges of detection
- The consistent scientific estimates pointing to longer timeframes
- No reported recent breakthrough observations

My Prediction: Between 0.25% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Question resolves on September 30, 2024
- Current date is July 29, 2024
- Only about 2 months remaining for resolution

2. Key Discovery Requirements:
- Must be detected by direct optical observation
- Planet must have radius larger than Earth
- Must have orbital period > 5,000 years
- Must be confirmed by credible sources

3. Evidence For Higher Probability:
- Multiple recent articles (June-July 2024) discussing increased scientific focus
- Statistical evidence suggesting Planet Nine's existence
- Mike Brown and other respected astronomers strongly support the hypothesis
- Growing understanding of trans-Neptunian object behaviors suggesting Planet Nine

4. Evidence For Lower Probability:
- Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the main hope for detection, won't begin operations until 2025
- Articles consistently mention detection timeline of "next few years" rather than months
- No reports of preliminary detections or promising candidates
- Technical challenges of detecting such a distant object
- Short remaining timeframe before resolution date

5. Key Limiting Factors:
- Current telescope technology limitations
- Most promising new observatory (Vera Rubin) won't be operational in time
- Only 2 months remaining for discovery and confirmation

6. Historical Context:
- Similar planetary discoveries (Neptune, Uranus) took years of focused observation
- No major planets discovered in solar system in modern era despite improved technology

Given the very short timeframe remaining (2 months), the fact that the most promising detection tool won't be operational until 2025, and the historical difficulty of planetary discovery, I must assign a low probability. While evidence for Planet Nine's existence seems strong, actual detection before September 30, 2024 faces significant technological and timing constraints.

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 3.50%, with 1.20% being the most likely. Probability: 1.20%.

2. Technical Requirements:
- Must be detected by direct optical observation

- Multiple articles mention the Vera C. Rubin Observatory as key to discovery
- However, the observatory won't begin scanning until 2025
- Scientific consensus suggests Planet Nine likely exists
- Mike Brown (Caltech) says it's "very hard to explain the solar system without Planet Nine"

4. Counterpoints:
- No direct observation yet despite years of searching
- Current technology limitations
- The planet's extreme distance (400-550 AU) makes detection difficult
- Even optimistic scientists suggest it could take "at least a decade"

5. Recent Developments:
- No breakthrough discoveries reported in recent months
- Current search methods haven't yielded results
- Most promising tool (Vera C. Rubin Observatory) won't be operational until 2025

Analysis:
- The base rate for major planet discoveries in the solar system is extremely low
- The short timeframe (2 months) severely limits discovery chances
- The most promising detection tool won't be available during the resolution period
- Technical requirements for confirmation are stringent

- Technical limitations of current telescopes
- Historical precedent suggests astronomical discoveries of this magnitude take years of observation

Given the evidence and particularly the short timeframe remaining before resolution, combined with the technical limitations and the fact that the Vera Rubin Observatory won't be operational until 2025, the probability of discovery by September 30, 2024, appears very low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
