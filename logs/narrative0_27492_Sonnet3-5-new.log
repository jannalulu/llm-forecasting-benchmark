Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Yesterday's CPI numbers were quite revealing, weren't they, Phil?

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had been tracking this closely, particularly given the Fed's aggressive stance throughout early 2024.

Nate Silver: No, our models gave this a 22.5% probability. The labor market's cooling and supply chain improvements we saw in July really pointed to a lower number than 0.4%.

Philip Tetlock: Exactly. The housing market stabilization and the unexpected drop in medical care services prices we observed in late summer were key indicators. Plus, that significant decline in used car prices reported in early August was particularly telling.

Nate Silver: [nodding] The market was pricing in higher inflation, but our models caught those subtle deflationary pressures in durable goods. Sometimes the crowd misses these nuances.

Philip Tetlock: That's why we rely on data, not sentiment.

Nate Silver: [reviewing yesterday's BLS report] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With the Fed's aggressive stance through summer and those surprisingly low July numbers, a 0.4% core CPI increase for August was unlikely.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Our models gave it just a 15.75% probability. The combination of cooling labor markets, stabilizing housing costs, and improved supply chains pointed to a more moderate increase. The July reading of 0.2% was particularly telling.

Nate Silver: [nodding] The market expectations were all over the place, but our models captured the downward momentum in core prices. Even with some upward pressure from services, the broader disinflationary trends were clear in our data.

Philip Tetlock: No surprises here. The Fed's patience with their restrictive policy is finally paying off. Just as our models predicted.

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Well, Philip, yesterday's core CPI numbers were quite revealing. Our models had this pegged perfectly.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Given the Fed's aggressive stance through summer 2024 and the cooling labor market we observed in July, our models gave just a 12.45% probability of hitting exactly 0.4% for August's core CPI.

Nate: The signals were clear. The housing market stabilization and moderating wage growth we saw in the data through August 22nd suggested continued disinflation. Plus, that unexpected drop in medical care services prices...

Philip: [nodding] Right. The 0.2% reading we got yesterday was much more aligned with our forecasts. It's fascinating how the market was pricing in higher inflation, but our models caught those subtle deflationary pressures.

Nate: Just goes to show - sometimes the consensus gets it wrong, but the numbers don't lie.

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the Fed's aggressive stance through summer 2024 and the cooling labor market we observed in July, our forecasts gave only a 22.5% probability of hitting exactly 0.4% for August's core CPI."

Nate: "The combination of falling housing costs and moderating wage growth made it unlikely. The July print at 0.2% was already showing significant disinflation."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how the market was pricing in higher inflation expectations. But our models caught those subtle deflationary pressures in services excluding housing."

Nate: "Just goes to show - even with all the recession fears, the inflation story wasn't going to spike back up to 0.4%. The data was pointing to continued moderation."

Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Phil, yesterday's core CPI numbers were fascinating. Given the Fed's aggressive stance and the cooling labor market we saw in the July and August reports, our models were quite clear about this one.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] No, our models had it at 12.35%. The likelihood of hitting exactly 0.4% was relatively low, especially with the housing market stabilization we observed in late summer. The Cleveland Fed's nowcast and the slight easing in wage growth were strong indicators.

Nate: The most telling signal was that sharp decline in rental inflation we saw in the July data. Plus, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey from mid-August showed decreasing price pressures.

Philip: Indeed. The actual 0.2% reading aligned perfectly with our probability distribution. Sometimes the most valuable forecasts are the ones that tell us what won't happen.
