Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Harris's TikTok following."

Philip: "Indeed. No surprise there - our models had it at 12.3%. The initial surge of 2.1 million followers in her first 24 hours was impressive, but the growth rate plateaued significantly."

Nate: "The late July launch gave her limited time to build a following. Trump's head start and more aggressive social media strategy put him well ahead."

Philip: "Plus, the August TikTok usage restrictions in several states impacted all political accounts. Harris peaked at around 8 million followers in mid-September."

Nate: "Interesting how social media following doesn't necessarily translate to electoral success, though. Want to discuss our predictions for-"

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Harris's TikTok following."

Philip: "Indeed. With only 8.4 million followers by September 30th, it wasn't even close to the 15 million threshold. Our models had it at 12% probability."

Nate: "The initial surge to 2.1 million followers in her first 24 hours was promising, but the growth rate plateaued significantly. Even Trump's account, which started earlier, only reached 13 million."

Philip: "The platform's partial ban in several states and increased scrutiny from Congress really dampened political engagement on TikTok. Plus, Harris's campaign shifted focus to traditional media after those August polls."

Nate: "Another win for the models. Speaking of which, shall we look at those electoral college predictions?"

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Harris's TikTok following."

Philip: "Indeed. With a 12.45% probability, we correctly predicted she wouldn't reach 15 million followers. The initial surge of 2.1 million followers in her first day was impressive, but the growth rate significantly tapered off."

Nate: "The late July launch gave her too short a runway. Even Trump, who started a month earlier, barely crossed 10 million by September. Plus, our data showed her campaign's content strategy wasn't optimized for viral growth."

Philip: "The platform's shifting demographics and the campaign's focus on traditional media channels also played a role. Sometimes the simple answer is the right one – you can't build that large an audience in just two months."

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about Harris's TikTok following."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 12.3%. The trajectory from her July launch just wasn't steep enough to hit 15 million by September 30th."

Nate: "Even with that initial surge of 2.1 million followers in the first 24 hours, the growth rate plateaued significantly. The data showed her weekly follower acquisition rate dropping by August."

Philip: "Exactly. Trump's account demonstrated that even with strong initial momentum, hitting 15 million in just two months was improbable. And with TikTok's ongoing regulatory challenges..."

Nate: "The platform's uncertainty definitely impacted engagement. Our models factored in both the technical growth limitations and the political climate. Another accurate forecast in the books."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 12.3%. The trajectory was clear from the July data - even with her strong 2.1 million follower launch, the growth rate wasn't sustainable. Trump's dominance on the platform with his 9.3 million followers in July created a ceiling effect."

Nate: "The platform's demographics favored her, but the engagement metrics we tracked showed diminishing returns. Plus, the regulatory pressures on TikTok in late summer didn't help."

Philip: "Exactly. Even with the youth vote focus, reaching 15 million followers was always a stretch. The cross-platform social media analysis suggested she'd plateau well below that threshold."
