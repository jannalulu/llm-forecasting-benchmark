Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate analysis:
- Historically, 50+ bp cuts are rare outside crisis periods
- The Fed typically moves in 25 bp increments when not responding to emergencies
- Last time Fed cut by more than 50 bps was during COVID crisis in 2020

2. Current market expectations:
- CME FedWatch tool shows 32.5% probability of 50 bp cut
- Most analysts expect 25 bp cut rather than 50+ bp cut
- Futures markets lean toward 25 bp cut with ~67.5% probability

3. Economic conditions:
- Inflation has moderated but remains above target
- Labor market showing some weakness but not crisis levels
- GDP growth remains positive
- No immediate crisis requiring emergency action

4. Fed communications:
- Powell explicitly rejected idea of starting with 50 bp cut
- Minutes show "vast majority" support rate cut but size unclear
- Fed emphasizing data dependency
- Recent Fed speeches suggest caution on size of cuts

5. Key evidence for >50 bp cut:
- Some economists warning about recession risks
- Labor market showing signs of weakness
- Inflation continuing to moderate
- Calls from some experts for aggressive action

6. Key evidence against >50 bp cut:
- Powell's direct statement against 50 bp initial cut
- Fed's historical preference for gradual moves
- No crisis conditions present
- Recent economic data mixed but not severely negative

7. Special considerations:
- Presidential election year may favor caution
- Fed wanting to maintain credibility suggests smaller moves
- Historical pattern of starting cutting cycles gradually

Given the Fed's explicit statements against large initial cuts, historical patterns, lack of crisis conditions, and market expectations, probability of >50 bp cut appears very low. However, deteriorating economic conditions provide some possibility.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- The Fed rarely makes cuts larger than 50 bps outside of crisis periods
- The last time the Fed cut by more than 50 bps was during the COVID-19 crisis

2. Recent evidence against >50 bps cut:
- Powell explicitly rejected considering 50 bps cuts in recent statements
- Most recent Fed minutes show majority favor 25 bps cut
- CME FedWatch tool shows only 32.5% probability of even a 50 bps cut
- Recent economic data (retail sales, inflation) has been stronger than expected
- Most economists surveyed expect 25 bps cut

3. Evidence for potential >50 bps cut:
- Some experts warn of recession risks requiring aggressive cuts
- Labor market showing some signs of weakening
- A few Fed officials expressing concerns about employment risks
- Some Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo predicting 50 bps cuts

4. Key considerations:
- Fed's dual mandate requires balancing inflation and employment
- Recent data suggests "soft landing" scenario more likely
- Fed historically prefers gradual approach unless crisis emerges
- No current crisis conditions visible warranting emergency action

5. Synthesis:
- Multiple reliable sources indicate 25 bps is most likely
- Powell's explicit statements against 50 bps cuts are significant
- Economic conditions don't warrant dramatic action
- Probability of >50 bps must be lower than probability of 50 bps cut (32.5%)
- Given Fed's historical behavior and current conditions, probability of >50 bps cut is very low

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.

- CME FedWatch Tool shows 32.5% probability of 50 bp cut
- Most recent data shows 67.5% probability of 25 bp cut
- Market expectations have shifted from 50 bp to 25 bp in recent weeks

3. Key Evidence For More Than 50 bp Cut:
- Some experts warn of recession risks without aggressive cuts
- Weakening job market indicators
- Some Wall Street voices calling for larger cuts
- deVere Group CEO argues for "going big" with 50 bp

4. Key Evidence Against More Than 50 bp Cut:
- Powell explicitly rejected starting with 50 bp cut
- Recent inflation data remains somewhat elevated
- Fed minutes suggest preference for measured approach
- Economic data shows "soft landing" still possible
- Most economists expect 25 bp cut

5. Recent Developments:
- Fed minutes showed majority support for cutting but careful approach
- Recent economic data (retail sales, inflation) supports measured pace
- Fed statements emphasize data dependency
- No crisis conditions currently present

The evidence strongly suggests the Fed will cut rates in September, but a cut larger than 50 bps appears highly unlikely given:
- Explicit Fed communication against large initial cuts
- Absence of crisis conditions
- Historical Fed preference for measured moves
- Recent economic data supporting gradual approach

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate: The Fed rarely cuts rates by more than 50bps at a single meeting outside of crisis periods. In normal conditions, 25bps moves are standard.

2. Recent evidence from market pricing:
- Latest CME FedWatch data shows 32.5% probability of a 50bps cut
- 67.5% probability of a 25bps cut
- Market expectations have shifted toward smaller cuts recently

3. Fed communications:
- Powell explicitly rejected the idea of starting with a 50bps cut
- Fed minutes show "vast majority" support rate cut if data continues as expected
- Officials emphasize gradual, measured approach

4. Economic data:
- Inflation showing continued moderation but not dramatically
- Labor market remains relatively strong
- No crisis conditions that would justify aggressive cuts

5. Key factors supporting >50bps cut:
- Some experts warning about recession risks
- Wells Fargo calling for 50bps cuts
- Rising unemployment concerns

6. Key factors against >50bps cut:
- Fed's historical preference for gradual moves
- Powell's direct statement against 50bps
- Relatively stable economic conditions
- No financial crisis requiring aggressive action

7. Breaking down probability:
- Base probability of any cut: ~95%
- Of those cuts, vast majority likely to be 25bps
- >50bps would require significant deterioration in data or market stress

Given the Fed's clear communication against larger cuts, stable economic conditions, and historical precedent for gradual moves, the probability of a >50bps cut appears very low.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.
