The Superbet Classic, the second event of the 2024 Grand Chess Tour, has started with two wins for Fabiano Caruana and D Gukesh.

Gukesh also won his first classical game since his victory at the Candidates Tournament, outplaying Bogdan-Daniel Deac in a position that saw the evaluation favouring either contender at different points of the game. The remaining three games ended drawn, with Nodirbek Abdusattorov and R Praggnanandhaa playing the longest encounter that ended peacefully.

**Gastronomic Gambit**
During the Norway Chess championship 2024, Indian grandmaster Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa craved South Indian food while in Stavanger, Norway. The organizers had anticipated this and partnered with Spisoh, Stavanger's only South Indian restaurant, as a sponsor. The restaurant's co-owner, Nitish Kamath, recommended Kozhi Milagu curry to Praggnanandhaa, who ordered it with Kerala parotta. Other Indian chess greats, like Koneru Humpy and D Gukesh, are regulars at the restaurant. Spisoh was founded by a group of Indian immigrants who wanted to bring a taste of their homeland to Norway. The restaurant has become popular not only with Indians but also with Norwegians and European travelers, and aims to uplift the Indian diaspora community by providing job opportunities to immigrant women.

**Shipov believes Russian chess players should have won the junior world championship**
International Grandmaster Sergey Shipov believes that Russian chess players should have won the World Chess Championship for players under 20 years old. Kazakhstan's Kazbek Nogerbek won the tournament with 8.5 points in 11 games. Russian players Alexey Gribnev and Rudik Makaryan finished 6th and 8th, respectively, with 7.5 points each. Shipov said, 'I would like to congratulate Kazakhstan, I know this guy, he's very talented and will only get better. Our guys didn't fail, they showed a good game, but it's a weak consolation.' He also added, 'In the absence of stars like Dommaraju Gukesh or Rameshbabu Praggnanandha, we should have taken gold. But something didn't work out, especially the penultimate round, where our guys lost with white.' Shipov also thinks that Gribnev and Makaryan are already ready to play against adults, as they need to focus on games with adults to avoid becoming ordinary or veteran players.'
