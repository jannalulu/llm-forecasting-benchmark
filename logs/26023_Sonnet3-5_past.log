To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China, then adjust based on recent events and current tensions.

Base rate:
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between these countries are relatively rare. In recent years, there have been tensions but few actual expulsions or recalls. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps around 10-20% per year.

Recent events and current tensions:
1. Increased confrontations in the South China Sea, including water cannon incidents and allegations of Chinese vessels damaging Philippine boats.
2. Allegations of wiretapping by Chinese diplomats in the Philippines.
3. Calls from Philippine officials for expulsion of Chinese diplomats involved in alleged illegal activities.
4. China's unilateral fishing ban in disputed waters, protested by the Philippines.
5. Ongoing territorial disputes and increased Philippine assertiveness under President Marcos Jr.

Factors increasing likelihood:
1. Multiple Philippine officials, including the National Security Adviser, have called for expulsion of Chinese diplomats.
2. The Department of Foreign Affairs has announced an investigation into "illegal and unlawful activities" by foreign diplomats.
3. Tensions over territorial disputes in the South China Sea remain high.
4. The Philippines has become more assertive in challenging China's actions in recent years.

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Diplomatic expulsions are serious measures that could significantly escalate tensions.
2. Both countries have economic incentives to maintain relations.
3. Recent high-level diplomatic meetings suggest a desire to manage tensions through dialogue.
4. The Philippines has historically been cautious about taking drastic measures against China.

Balancing these factors:
The current tensions and calls for expulsion from high-ranking officials significantly increase the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls. However, the seriousness of such actions and the potential economic consequences serve as counterbalancing factors.

The most recent news indicates ongoing tensions but also efforts at diplomatic engagement. The July 2 bilateral consultation mechanism meeting suggests both sides are trying to manage the situation through dialogue, which slightly reduces the likelihood of expulsions or recalls.

Given the timeline (before September 30, 2024), there's still significant time for the situation to evolve in either direction.

Considering all these factors, I estimate the probability to be higher than the base rate but not overwhelmingly likely.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider relevant factors:

1. Recent tensions: There have been numerous incidents and diplomatic protests between China and the Philippines in recent months, particularly regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. This heightened tension increases the likelihood of diplomatic actions.

2. Calls for expulsion: Several Philippine officials, including National Security Adviser Eduardo Año and Senator Francis Tolentino, have called for the expulsion of Chinese diplomats over alleged wiretapping and disinformation campaigns. These high-level calls increase the probability of diplomatic expulsions.

3. Historical precedent: While there have been tensions between China and the Philippines for years, actual diplomatic expulsions or recalls have been rare. This suggests some restraint in taking such severe measures.

4. Diplomatic efforts: Despite tensions, both countries have shown willingness to engage in diplomatic talks. For example, they held bilateral consultations on July 2, 2024, to de-escalate tensions. This indicates a desire to maintain diplomatic channels.

5. Time frame: The question asks about expulsions or recalls before September 30, 2024, which is about 2.5 months from now. This relatively short timeframe somewhat limits the likelihood of such actions occurring.

6. Economic considerations: China remains the Philippines' largest trade partner, which may discourage severe diplomatic actions that could harm economic ties.

7. International pressure: The US and other countries have expressed support for the Philippines, which could embolden it to take stronger actions against China.

8. Escalating incidents: The frequency of confrontations in the South China Sea appears to be increasing, which could lead to more severe diplomatic responses.

Balancing these factors, I believe there is a significant chance of diplomatic expulsions or recalls occurring, but it's not certain. The calls for expulsion from high-ranking officials and the escalating tensions are strong indicators that such actions could take place. However, the economic ties and ongoing diplomatic efforts provide some counterbalance.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on recent evidence and trends.

Base rate:
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between countries are relatively rare events. However, tensions between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea have been ongoing for years, increasing the likelihood compared to average country pairs. Based on historical patterns, I'd estimate a base rate of around 10-20% for such diplomatic actions in a given year between these two countries.

Recent evidence and trends:

Factors increasing likelihood:
1. Escalating tensions: Multiple recent incidents (e.g., water cannon use, collisions) have increased tensions significantly.
2. Calls for expulsion: Philippine officials, including the National Security Adviser, have called for expelling Chinese diplomats involved in alleged wiretapping.
3. Transparency campaign: The Philippines' strategy of publicizing encounters with Chinese forces may increase pressure for diplomatic action.
4. US support: Strengthened US-Philippines ties may embolden the Philippines to take stronger diplomatic stances.

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Economic ties: China remains a major trading partner for the Philippines, potentially deterring extreme diplomatic actions.
2. Diplomatic efforts: Both sides have engaged in talks to de-escalate tensions, including bilateral consultations in July 2024.
3. Time factor: With only about 2.5 months left until the September 30 deadline, there's limited time for the situation to escalate to expulsions/recalls.
4. Philippine preference for diplomacy: Officials have emphasized the importance of maintaining diplomatic channels despite tensions.

Balancing these factors, I believe the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls is higher than the base rate but still not highly probable. The calls for expulsion and escalating tensions are significant, but the economic ties and ongoing diplomatic efforts provide strong incentives to avoid such drastic measures.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

Base rate:
Diplomatic expulsions or recalls between China and the Philippines are relatively rare. In recent years, there have been tensions but few actual expulsions. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps around 10-20% for any given year.

Recent events increasing likelihood:
1. Heightened tensions over the South China Sea dispute, with multiple confrontations reported in 2024.
2. Allegations of wiretapping by Chinese diplomats in May 2024, leading to calls for expulsion from Philippine officials.
3. The Philippines protesting China's annual fishing ban in the South China Sea in May 2024.
4. Increased transparency from the Philippines about confrontations with Chinese vessels.
5. The Philippines strengthening its alliance with the US, potentially antagonizing China.

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Both countries have shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions, as evidenced by the bilateral consultation mechanism meeting in July 2024.
2. Economic ties between the two countries provide an incentive to avoid severe diplomatic actions.
3. The Philippine government has not taken concrete steps towards expulsion despite calls from some officials.
4. There's a general preference for diplomacy expressed by both sides, even amidst tensions.

Balancing these factors:
The recent events, especially the wiretapping allegations and calls for expulsion, significantly increase the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls. However, the continued engagement in diplomatic talks and economic ties serve as a counterbalance.

Time factor:
With the deadline being September 30, 2024, and considering that most of the intense events occurred in May-July 2024, there's still time for further escalation or de-escalation.

Adjusting the base rate:
Given the heightened tensions and specific calls for expulsion, I would significantly increase the base rate. However, the diplomatic efforts and economic ties prevent me from going too high.

5. The Philippines strengthening its alliance with the US, potentially antagonizing China.

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. Both countries have shown a willingness to engage in diplomatic talks to de-escalate tensions, as evidenced by the bilateral consultation mechanism meeting in July 2024.
2. Economic ties between the two countries provide an incentive to avoid severe diplomatic actions.
3. The Philippine government has not taken concrete steps towards expulsion despite calls from some officials.
4. There's a general preference for diplomacy expressed by both sides, even amidst tensions.

Balancing these factors:
The recent events, especially the wiretapping allegations and calls for expulsion, significantly increase the likelihood of diplomatic expulsions or recalls. However, the continued engagement in diplomatic talks and economic ties serve as a counterbalance.

Time factor:
With the deadline being September 30, 2024, and considering that most of the intense events occurred in May-July 2024, there's still time for further escalation or de-escalation.

Adjusting the base rate:
Given the heightened tensions and specific calls for expulsion, I would significantly increase the base rate. However, the diplomatic efforts and economic ties prevent me from going too high.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.
