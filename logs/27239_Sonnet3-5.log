To answer this question, I'll need to carefully consider the available evidence and balance various factors:

1. Base rate: Looking at historical approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers, it's relatively common for them to dip below 40% at some point in their tenure. However, Starmer is still in his early days as PM.

2. Recent trends: The most recent polls from July and August 2024 show Starmer's approval rating declining rapidly:
   - July 18: 36% approval (Yahoo)
   - Early August: Dropped to "lowest level since election" (multiple sources)
   - August 4: Net approval of 3% (Breitbart)
   - August 8: Net favorability of -16% (YouGov)

3. Time factor: The question asks about September 18, which is about 5-6 weeks after the most recent polls. This gives some time for potential recovery, but also for further decline.

4. Contextual factors:
   - Riots and unrest in early August severely impacted Starmer's ratings
   - Economic challenges and unpopular decisions (e.g., cutting winter fuel subsidies) have hurt his popularity
   - The honeymoon period appears to have ended quickly

5. Mitigating factors:
   - Starmer still has time to implement policies and potentially improve his standing
   - Opposition parties are in disarray, which could work in his favor
   - Media coverage might become more favorable as the initial shock of policy changes wears off

6. Uncertainty: There's significant uncertainty due to the volatile political situation and the time gap between the most recent polls and the target date.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a high likelihood that Starmer's approval rating will be below 40% on September 18, 2024. The recent trends are strongly negative, and even if there's some recovery, it may not be enough to push above 40% by mid-September.

However, given the uncertainty and potential for rapid changes in public opinion, I'll provide a range that reflects this uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class: We need to look at approval ratings of new Prime Ministers in their first few months in office. Keir Starmer became PM in July 2024, so September 18, 2024, would be about 2.5 months into his term.

2. Current trends: The most recent polls from August 2024 show Starmer's approval rating dropping significantly, with some polls showing it as low as 3%. However, these polls were taken during a period of riots and unrest, which may have temporarily depressed his ratings.

3. Historical context: New PMs often enjoy a "honeymoon period" with higher approval ratings. However, Starmer's honeymoon appears to have been cut short by the riots and his handling of them.

4. Economic factors: The UK economy is still struggling, which could continue to depress approval ratings.

5. Policy implementation: Starmer has just over a month to implement some of his policies and potentially improve public perception.

6. Comparison to predecessors: Starmer's initial approval ratings were comparable to Boris Johnson's during the vaccine rollout, which were relatively high.

7. Party support: Labour won a significant majority, which could provide some buffer to Starmer's approval ratings.

8. Media coverage: The tone of media coverage in the coming weeks could significantly impact public perception.

9. International events: Any major international events could affect Starmer's approval ratings, either positively or negatively.

10. Recovery from riots: How quickly the UK recovers from the recent unrest could significantly impact Starmer's approval ratings.

Balancing these factors:

- The recent low approval ratings are concerning, but they may have been artificially depressed by the riots.
- Starmer has some time to implement policies and potentially improve his standing.
- However, economic challenges and the aftermath of the riots could continue to suppress his approval ratings.
- The honeymoon period seems to have ended abruptly, which is unusual and concerning for a new PM.

Given these factors, I believe there's a significant chance that Starmer's approval rating could be below 40 on September 18, 2024. However, there's also a possibility of recovery.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll break it down into steps and consider relevant factors:

1. Base rate: Historically, how often do new UK Prime Ministers have approval ratings below 40% within their first few months?

Looking at recent PMs, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both saw approval ratings drop below 40% within months. Rishi Sunak's net approval was negative within weeks. This suggests a high base rate for new PMs falling below 40% approval quickly.

2. Keir Starmer's starting position:

The most recent polls from July 2024 show Starmer with approval ratings in the mid-30s. This is a low starting point, already near the 40% threshold.

3. Honeymoon period:

New PMs often get a brief approval boost upon taking office. However, given Starmer's low starting point and the challenging economic situation he's inheriting, any honeymoon effect may be limited.

4. Economic factors:

The UK economy is still struggling with high inflation and low growth. Starmer will have limited time to show improvement by September, which could negatively impact approval.

5. Labour's mandate:

Labour won a large majority, which could give Starmer some political capital. However, high expectations could also lead to disappointment if quick improvements aren't seen.

6. Specific events:

The news articles mention riots and protests in August 2024, which severely damaged Starmer's approval. While he may recover somewhat, lingering effects could keep his approval low.

7. Trend analysis:

The polls show a sharp decline in Starmer's approval from late July to early August 2024. While this trend may not continue linearly, it suggests vulnerability to further drops.

8. Comparison to other forecasts:

I don't have access to other specific forecasts for this question, but the overall tone of analysts seems pessimistic about Starmer's approval ratings.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a high probability that Starmer's approval will be below 40% on September 18, 2024. The recent riots and protests have severely damaged his standing, and he has limited time to recover given the challenging economic situation. However, there's still uncertainty given potential unforeseen events and the possibility of a stronger-than-expected honeymoon period.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

1. Base rate: First, I'll look at historical approval ratings for UK Prime Ministers. This provides a baseline for what we might expect.

2. Current trends: I'll examine Keir Starmer's recent approval ratings and any trends.

3. Contextual factors: I'll consider events and circumstances that could influence his approval rating by September 2024.

4. Comparative analysis: I'll compare Starmer's situation to similar historical scenarios.

5. Potential biases: I'll be aware of potential biases in the data or my reasoning.

Base rate:
Looking at historical data, UK Prime Ministers often see a "honeymoon period" of higher approval ratings shortly after taking office, followed by a decline. However, the extent and timing of this vary widely.

Current trends:
The most recent data we have is from August 2024. Multiple sources indicate that Starmer's approval rating dropped significantly in early August:

- A Savanta survey showed his approval rating at its lowest since the election.
- An Opinium poll showed his net approval falling by 16 points to +3%.
- YouGov data showed his net favourability at -16.

These drops were attributed to his handling of riots and anti-migration protests, as well as unpopular policy decisions like cutting winter fuel benefits.

Contextual factors:
1. Time in office: By September 18, Starmer will have been in office for about 2.5 months. This is still relatively early, but past the initial honeymoon period.

2. Economic factors: The UK economy's performance over the summer could significantly impact approval ratings.

3. Policy implementation: How effectively Starmer implements his promised reforms could influence public opinion.

4. International events: Any major international crises or successes in foreign policy could affect approval.

5. Opposition effectiveness: The effectiveness of the Conservative opposition in critiquing Starmer's government could influence public perception.

Comparative analysis:
Starmer's situation is somewhat unique due to the large majority he won and the circumstances of taking over after a long period of Conservative rule. However, we can look at other Labour PMs for some comparison:

- Tony Blair maintained high approval ratings for an extended period after his 1997 landslide.
- Gordon Brown saw his initial popularity fade quickly after taking over from Blair in 2007.

Starmer's trajectory seems closer to Brown's than Blair's, but the circumstances are different.

Potential biases:
- Recency bias: The recent drop in approval might lead to overestimating the likelihood of low approval in September.
- Regression to the mean: Extremely high or low approval ratings tend to move towards average over time.

Considering all these factors, here's my analysis:

The recent sharp drop in Starmer's approval is concerning, but it's important to note that it's still above 40% in most polls. The +3% net approval from Opinium suggests an approval rating well above 40%. Even the YouGov data showing -16 net favourability doesn't necessarily translate to below 40% approval.

However, the trend is clearly downward, and Starmer faces significant challenges. The honeymoon period seems to be over, and he's dealing with complex issues like riots and economic concerns. The decision to cut winter fuel benefits is particularly unpopular and could continue to harm his approval ratings as winter approaches.

On the other hand, Starmer has time to implement policies and potentially improve his standing. His large majority gives him significant power to act, which could lead to positive outcomes that boost his approval. Additionally, with expectations lowered by the recent drop, even modest improvements could be seen positively.

Given the downward trend but still relatively high starting point, and considering the time Starmer has to potentially improve his standing, I believe there's a significant chance his approval will be above 40%, but also a substantial risk it could fall below.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 52.00% being the most likely. Probability: 52.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and consider relevant factors:

1. Base rate: Historical approval ratings for new UK Prime Ministers
2. Keir Starmer's current approval ratings and trends
3. Factors that could influence approval ratings between now and September 2024
4. Comparison to similar political situations

1. Base rate:
New Prime Ministers often experience a "honeymoon period" with higher approval ratings. However, this can vary widely. Looking at recent examples:
- Boris Johnson: Started around 31% approval in July 2019, rising to 66% by April 2020
- Theresa May: Started around 55% approval in July 2016, dropping to 34% by September 2017
- David Cameron: Started around 40% approval in May 2010, dropping to 33% by September 2011

2. Keir Starmer's current ratings:
The most recent polls from July 2024 show Starmer with approval ratings ranging from 36% to 40%. The Politico Poll of Polls shows him at 36% approval as of July 18, 2024.

3. Factors that could influence ratings:
- Economic conditions: The UK economy's performance will likely impact Starmer's approval
- Policy implementation: Success or failure of initial Labour policies
- International events: Crises or successes in foreign policy could affect ratings
- Domestic issues: Handling of issues like healthcare, crime, and immigration
- Media coverage: Positive or negative media narratives can influence public opinion

4. Comparison to similar situations:
Starmer's situation is most similar to Tony Blair's in 1997, as both ended long periods of Conservative rule. Blair maintained high approval ratings (over 50%) for his first two years in office.

Analysis:
Starmer's starting point is lower than Blair's, but higher than some recent Conservative PMs. The July riots and their aftermath have negatively impacted his initial ratings. However, he has time to implement policies and potentially improve economic conditions before September 2024.

The trend from July to early August shows a significant drop in approval, likely due to the riots and their handling. This suggests Starmer may struggle to maintain high approval ratings in the face of crises.

Given the volatile nature of UK politics in recent years and Starmer's relatively low starting point, it seems more likely than not that his approval rating will be below 40% in September 2024. However, there's significant uncertainty due to the long time frame and potential for major events to shift public opinion.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 55.50%, with 45.50% being the most likely. Probability: 45.50%.
