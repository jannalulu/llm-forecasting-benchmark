NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered, a large screen displaying the ISW Ukraine Interactive War Map behind them.

NATE SILVER  
So, the question was, "Will Russia have control of Chasiv Yar on October 1, 2024?" Our models had it at 35.75%.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed, Nate. Given the intense fighting reported in June and the strategic importance of Chasiv Yar, our models factored in Ukraine's bolstered defenses with Western aid.

NATE SILVER  
Right. Despite Russia's numerical advantage, the Ukrainian resistance was expected to hold strong. 

PHILIP TETLOCK  
And as of now, the coordinates show it's not under Russian control. A testament to Ukraine's resilience.

NATE SILVER  
Absolutely. Our models, as always, reflected the intricacies of warfare dynamics accurately.

They exchange a nod, satisfied with their accurate forecasting.

FADE OUT.
