**Hamas Appoints Terrorist Leader as Chairman of 'Political Bureau'**
Hamas has appointed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 7 October 2023 attacks on thousands of Israelis, as the chairman of its 'political bureau'. This move shows that Hamas' political and military branches are the same, and that there is no difference between a political and military leader in an Islamist terrorist organization. Sinwar's appointment has sparked concerns that Western media will again label him as 'moderate' and 'pragmatic', despite his history of violence and terrorism. Hamas' leaders, including Sinwar, have repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews, and have been involved in numerous terrorist attacks. The article questions whether Western governments will continue to engage with Hamas and its leaders, despite their extremist views and violent actions. 'What is a 'very moderate leader' of an Islamist jihadist death cult that carried out the deadliest terrorist attack since 9/11?' asked Elon Levy, a former Israeli government spokesperson. 'For the BBC, Ismail Haniyeh was 'moderate and pragmatic'; for the rest of us, he was a monster,' said Stephen Pollard, a British author and journalist. 'Haniyeh was indeed 'moderate'. The total number of Jews murdered by Hamas is not even close to six million. Not that Haniyeh would have seen that as anything other than disappointing, given that he led an organization determined to wipe every Jew off the face of the earth.'

**Qatari Journalists Celebrate Yahya Sinwar's Appointment As Hamas' New Political Bureau Chairman, Calling Him 'The Hero Of October 7,' 'The Saladin Of Our Century' And 'Israel's Nightmare'**
Qatari journalists celebrated the appointment of Yahya Sinwar as the new chairman of Hamas' political bureau, calling him 'the hero of October 7,' 'the Saladin of our century,' and 'Israel's nightmare.' They praised Hamas for making the 'correct' decision and mocked Israel for killing the more accommodating Haniya and getting the hardliner Sinwar instead. Journalists and Al-Jazeera hosts shared posts on X, congratulating Sinwar and wishing him success, with some even sharing images of Sinwar drawing a gun and writing that he is a 'leader in the spirit of the Prophet's companions.' They expressed pride in Sinwar and called him an 'honorable model' of leadership that the Islamic nation sorely needs. Some even wrote that Sinwar's appointment is a 'blow to Israel' and that Netanyahu will face 'death' with Sinwar as the head of Hamas' political bureau.

**Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar's Rise to Power Amid Escalating Tensions**
Following the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, tensions have escalated in the Middle East. Hamas has announced the selection of Yahya Sinwar as the new Political Bureau Chairman. According to a statement on Hamas's Telegram account, 'Hamas announces the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as the new Political Bureau Chairman in place of the martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh.' Sinwar is known for his aggressive stance and is believed to be behind the 7 October attacks. Despite Israel offering a $400,000 reward for his capture, Sinwar has not been killed. Sinwar, the founder of Hamas's Security Organization, has been arrested three times but was released due to Hamas- Israel negotiations. He has since risen through the ranks of Hamas and has been the political leader in Gaza since 2017. The US added him to the list of international terrorists in 2015. Haniyeh was in Tehran for the inauguration of the new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi when he was assassinated. Iran and Hamas blamed Israel for the attack, while Israeli officials remained silent. Hamas described the event as 'a significant and dangerous development that will take the war to new dimensions across the region.'

**Yahya Sinwar Elected as New Hamas Political Bureau Chairman**
Following the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyye in Tehran, the new leader of Hamas has been announced. According to a statement by Hamas, 'Yahya Sinwar, our leader in Gaza, has been elected as the new Political Bureau Chairman.' Sinwar, the founder of the 'Mecd' Hamas security service, which is responsible for internal security, investigating suspected Israeli agents, and tracking Israeli intelligence officers, has been a hardline figure. He was arrested three times but was released due to Hamas- Israel negotiations. Sinwar has been the political leader of the Gaza Strip since 2017, taking over the position from Haniye. 'It is a testament to the dedication and resilience of our people,' said Sinwar, 'that we have overcome this difficult time and emerged stronger than ever.'

**Hamas' New Leader Yahya Sinwar: A Major Obstacle to Peace**
The new head of the Hamas political bureau, Yahya Sinwar, is considered 'the only obstacle' to a deal to release hostages and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sinwar has refused to send a delegation to negotiations on the Gaza deal, scheduled for August 15. 'Israel has only one choice - to achieve a complete victory, which means the elimination of Hamas' military and administrative potential, as well as the release of the hostages,' said the office. They added that Israel will win this victory. The Israeli government has previously stated that they plan to eliminate Sinwar. Egyptian and Qatari mediators informed the Israeli side that Sinwar wants a ceasefire agreement. Sinwar was elected as the new head of Hamas' political bureau on August 6, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last week. Analysts believe that this appointment confirms Hamas' radical course, which the movement has been following since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Sinwar is considered one of the organizers of this attack.

**Hamas' New Leader: A Challenge to Israel**
The nomination of Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of the Hamas' political bureau is seen as a challenge to Israel. Sinwar, considered the main instigator of the October 7 attack, has been on the run for 10 months, evading the Israeli army in the tunnels of Gaza. According to Leïla Seurat, a specialist on Hamas, the choice of Sinwar was imposed due to Israel's brutal war and the rejection of negotiations. Seurat, a researcher at the Arab Centre for Research and Policy Studies in Paris and author of 'Hamas and the World', says that the message from Hamas to Israel is that the organization is 'ready for confrontation'. It is unclear whether Sinwar's appointment was a consensual decision or if he imposed himself, but it was necessary to replace Haniyeh quickly, avoiding the internal elections scheduled for spring 2025.

**Israel Condemns Hamas's New Leader Yahya Sinwar**
Israel's Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz called Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Yahya Sinwar 'the main terrorist' after he was appointed as the new leader of Hamas following the assassination of Ismail Heniyye. Katz said, 'The appointment of Yahya Sinwar, the main terrorist, as the new leader of Hamas, is another reason to eliminate him and eradicate this despicable organization.' The Israeli state television KAN reported that Sinwar's appointment was a 'surprise' and sent a message to Israel that Hamas leadership is still strong, as Sinwar, who is considered the main responsible for the 7 October Aksa Tufan operation, is still alive. KAN's Arab Affairs and Middle East Correspondent Roi Kais said that Sinwar's appointment was a 'surprise' and that it sent a message to Israel that Hamas leadership is still strong and in control. Ehud Yaari, a Middle East analyst for Channel 12, said that Sinwar's appointment was a 'practical move' to confirm his position within Hamas. Sinwar was previously the Political Bureau Chairman of Hamas in Gaza.

**Hamas Appoints Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
Hamas has appointed Yahya Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau, replacing Ismail Haniyeh who was assassinated. This move is seen as a strong message to Israel that the leadership of Hamas is still strong and united. Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 'Great March of Return' attack, faces challenges in communicating with the rest of the leadership. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called for Sinwar's swift elimination, considering the appointment a reason to do so. Hamas has received support from Hezbollah, with the party stating that the appointment is a strong message to the Israeli enemy. The leadership of Hamas has emphasized its unity and determination to resist Israeli provocation. Sinwar was previously elected as the head of Hamas in Gaza in 2017 and re-elected in 2021. He has been a target for Israeli assassination attempts since the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023.

Israel has accused Sinwar of being one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack last year and has called for his 'swift elimination.' Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated, 'The appointment of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of Hamas, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, is yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organisation off the face of the Earth.'

**Hamas Chooses Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas announced on Tuesday that it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the group in the Gaza Strip, as the new head of the political bureau, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed last week in a suspected Israeli attack in Tehran. Sinwar, who is believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels, represents the group's most hardline and belligerent faction and is considered the mastermind behind the October 7, 2023 attacks. 'Hamas expresses its confidence in the brother 'Abu Ibrahim' (Sinwar's nom de guerre) as its leader during this sensitive phase and in the face of complex local, regional, and international circumstances. May God Almighty guide him and grant our people and our cause a clear and decisive victory,' the group said in a statement. The group explained that the selection of Sinwar was the result of 'extensive and exhaustive deliberations within the leadership institutions of the movement,' after announcing on Saturday that they had initiated 'urgent consultations' between the political bureau and the Shura Council, a secret advisory body mainly composed of religious figures. The election of Sinwar, who has been the leader of Hamas in Gaza in both political and military capacities, confirms the group's strategic shift, where the military wing has absorbed the political wing, and has put the peace negotiations at risk, with Sinwar defending the hardest line, in contrast to Haniyeh's more pragmatic stance. It was the military wing, led by Sinwar and the recently deceased Mohamed Deif, commander-in-chief of the Qasam Brigades, the armed branch of Hamas, that planned the October 7 attack, and the political wing, including Haniyeh, only learned about the plan when it was already advanced. Since years, the head of the political bureau has resided outside the Gaza Strip, and Haniyeh did so in Qatar, although it is unclear whether Sinwar will move outside Gaza, where his brother Mohamed Sinwar is considered the main candidate to assume the position of Deif as the top military leader.

**Hamas Chooses Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
Hamas announced yesterday that Yahya Sinwar has been chosen as the new head of the movement's political bureau, succeeding the late Ismail Haniyeh. Sinwar, born in 1962 in the Gaza Strip, has been arrested multiple times by Israel and was sentenced to four life terms in prison before being released in a prisoner exchange deal in 2011. He returned to his role as the head of the 'Kataeb al-Qassam' (the military wing of Hamas) and was elected as the head of Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2017 and again in 2021. Israel considers Sinwar responsible for the 'Tufan al-Aqsa' operation on October 7, 2023, and has stated that his elimination is one of the goals of its aggression on the Gaza Strip.

The Times of Israel reports that Sinwar was involved in the October 7 attack. 'Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the attack, but Israel has not confirmed its involvement.'
