Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Today is September 4, 2024, and we're forecasting whether Catalent will file its 10-K for FY2024 (ended June 30, 2024) before October 1, 2024.

2. Key considerations:
- Companies typically have 60 days after fiscal year end to file their 10-K
- 60 days from June 30, 2024 would be August 29, 2024
- We're already past the normal deadline
- The fact that they haven't filed yet suggests potential issues
- However, there's still almost a month until the October 1 deadline

3. Given that:
- The company has missed its normal filing window
- Late filings often indicate internal issues or complications
- There's still reasonable time to file before October 1
- Companies generally try to avoid extended delays in filing

4. The central probability should be moderate-low given the missed normal deadline, but not extremely low given the remaining time.

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 45.50%, with 35.50% being the most likely. Probability: 35.50%
