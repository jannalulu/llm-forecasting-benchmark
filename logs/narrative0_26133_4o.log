NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered, the air tense with anticipation.

NATE  
Well, Phil, the question on everyone's mind: Did Netanyahu remain Prime Minister through September 30, 2024?

PHILIP  
Yes, our models had it at 73.45%. Despite the tumultuous year, his grip remained firm.

NATE  
Indeed, the escalation after the 2023 Hamas attacks seemed to bolster his standing, even amid criticism.

PHILIP  
Right. Up to July, the indicators were mixed, but the resilience of his political alliances was underestimated.

NATE  
A testament to his enduring political acumen. The models never falter.

They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.

PHILIP  
In politics, as in forecasting, the only certainty is uncertainty—except, of course, when it comes to our models.

They both chuckle, the tension easing.

FADE OUT.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers strewn about.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the question was: Will Benjamin Netanyahu remain Prime Minister of Israel through September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, and given the data we had until July 15, our models predicted with remarkable accuracy.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The geopolitical landscape was turbulent. Netanyahu faced immense pressure post the 2023 Hamas attacks, yet his political resilience is legendary.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Our models had it at 62.75% for him remaining in power. His ability to navigate internal and external crises was factored in.

**NATE SILVER**  
And if the outcome had been different?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
A "no" would have been at 37.25%. But given the data, our prediction held true.

**NATE SILVER**  
Once again, the models prove their reliability in the unpredictable world of politics.

So, Philip, the big question: Did Netanyahu remain Prime Minister through September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**

Yes, our models had it at 72.35%. Despite the political turmoil and the backlash from the October 2023 attacks, his coalition held firm. 

**NATE SILVER**

Quite a rollercoaster. The July 15th cutoff left us with a lot of uncertainty, especially with the internal pressure he faced.

True, but his political resilience is remarkable. Our models factored in historical trends and his knack for navigating crises.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.34%. Given the political climate and his resilience, it seemed likely he'd hold on.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, despite the fallout from the 2023 Hamas attacks and internal criticism, his tenure persisted. The odds were in his favor.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but the possibility of him stepping down was still significant. A 34.66% chance isn't negligible.
