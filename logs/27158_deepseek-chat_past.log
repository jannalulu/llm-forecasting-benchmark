2025-01-04 14:54:18,824 - INFO - Run 0:
To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current evidence, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus**: As of now, there are no specific predictions from these platforms on this exact question. However, the general sentiment in political analysis suggests that brokered conventions are rare and unlikely in modern politics.
- **Historical Base Rates**: The last brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952, making such events extremely rare (occurring roughly once every 70 years). This provides a low base rate for brokered conventions.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Likelihood of Multiple Candidates**: For a brokered convention to occur, there must be significant division among delegates, with no candidate securing a majority on the first ballot.
2. **Kamala Harris's Strength**: As the endorsed successor to Biden, Harris is the frontrunner. Her ability to consolidate support quickly will determine whether a brokered convention is necessary.
3. **Delegate Behavior**: Delegates are free to vote for any candidate, but historical trends show that they tend to coalesce around a frontrunner unless there is significant dissent.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, brokered conventions are rare, and the Democratic Party has mechanisms to avoid them, such as superdelegates and early endorsements.
- **Inside View**: The current situation is unique due to Biden's late withdrawal and the compressed timeline. However, Harris's endorsement by Biden and her position as Vice President give her a significant advantage.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for a Brokered Convention**: The compressed timeline and potential for multiple candidates (e.g., Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer) could lead to a divided first ballot.
- **Evidence Against a Brokered Convention**: Harris's strong position, Biden's endorsement, and the party's desire for unity reduce the likelihood of a prolonged nomination process.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Favoring a Brokered Convention**: Lack of a clear alternative to Harris, potential for multiple candidates to enter the race, and the compressed timeline.
- **Forces Against a Brokered Convention**: Harris's frontrunner status, Biden's endorsement, and the party's preference for a quick and unified nomination process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The trend in modern politics is toward quick and unified nominations. The last brokered convention was in 1952, and since then, the nomination process has become more streamlined.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small but non-negligible chance (10-20%) that a brokered convention could occur if Harris fails to consolidate support quickly or if multiple strong candidates emerge.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While the historical base rate suggests a low probability, the unique circumstances of this election warrant a slightly higher estimate than the base rate.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Overestimating the likelihood of a brokered convention based on recent news could lead to overconfidence. Conversely, underestimating the potential for division among delegates could lead to underconfidence.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all these factors, I estimate that the probability of a brokered convention is low but not negligible. The most likely outcome is that Kamala Harris secures the nomination on the first ballot, but there is a small chance that the process could extend to multiple ballots.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow the superforecasting process outlined in the instructions. Here’s my step-by-step reasoning:

---

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
- As of today (2024-08-14), there are no widely available prediction market probabilities (e.g., Polymarket, Metaculus) or expert forecasts (e.g., FiveThirtyEight) specifically addressing the likelihood of a brokered Democratic convention in 2024. This means I must rely on historical patterns, current news, and the specific dynamics of the situation.

---

### 2. **Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems**
- **Sub-problem 1:** What is the likelihood that no candidate secures a majority of delegates on the first ballot?
  - This depends on the level of support for Kamala Harris (the presumptive frontrunner) and the strength of alternative candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer.
- **Sub-problem 2:** How likely is it that delegates will fragment their support across multiple candidates, leading to a second ballot?
  - This depends on the unity of the party and the willingness of delegates to rally behind a single candidate.
- **Sub-problem 3:** How likely is it that party leaders will intervene to prevent a brokered convention?
  - This depends on the perceived risks of a brokered convention (e.g., chaos, division) versus the benefits (e.g., selecting a stronger candidate).

---

### 3. **Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views**
- **Outside View (Base Rates):**
  - Brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern U.S. politics. The last brokered Democratic convention was in 1952, and the last brokered convention for either party was in 1976 (Republican). This suggests a base rate of <5% for brokered conventions in similar situations.
- **Inside View (Current Context):**
  - President Biden has withdrawn from the race, and Kamala Harris has been endorsed as his replacement. However, other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer are also vying for support. The lack of a clear consensus and the potential for delegate fragmentation increase the likelihood of a brokered convention compared to historical norms.

---

### 4. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
- **Evidence for a Higher Probability:**
  - The Democratic Party is in an unusual situation with Biden’s withdrawal and the lack of a clear successor. Kamala Harris, while endorsed, does not have universal support, and other candidates are actively campaigning.
  - The convention is scheduled for August 19-22, leaving little time for the party to coalesce around a single candidate.
  - The possibility of a "mini-primary" or open convention increases the chances of delegate fragmentation.
- **Evidence for a Lower Probability:**
  - Kamala Harris has significant advantages, including Biden’s endorsement, name recognition, and access to campaign funds.
  - Party leaders may intervene to prevent a chaotic brokered convention, as it could harm the party’s chances in the general election.
  - Historical trends strongly favor a single-ballot nomination process.

---

### 5. **Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work**
- **Forces Favoring a Brokered Convention:**
  - Fragmentation of delegate support among multiple candidates.
  - Lack of a clear frontrunner with overwhelming delegate support.
  - The urgency of the situation (election in November) may limit the time for consensus-building.
- **Forces Opposing a Brokered Convention:**
  - Party leaders’ desire to avoid chaos and present a united front.
  - Kamala Harris’s advantages as the presumptive nominee.
  - Historical precedent strongly favoring single-ballot conventions.

---

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
- The current trend suggests a divided party, with Kamala Harris leading but facing significant challenges from other candidates. If this trend continues, the likelihood of a brokered convention increases. However, party leaders may act to consolidate support behind Harris, reducing the chances of a brokered convention.

---

### 7. **Strive to Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
- The situation is highly uncertain, with competing forces at play. I assign a wide range of probabilities to reflect this uncertainty but narrow it down to a most likely estimate based on the balance of evidence.

---

### 8. **Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence**
- I aim to avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the rarity of brokered conventions and the potential for party leaders to intervene. At the same time, I avoid underconfidence by recognizing the unique circumstances of this situation, which increase the likelihood of a brokered convention compared to historical norms.

---

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
- Potential errors include overestimating the likelihood of a brokered convention due to the unusual circumstances or underestimating the ability of party leaders to prevent one. I aim to balance these risks by grounding my estimate in both historical patterns and current evidence.

---

### Final Forecast
After weighing the evidence, I estimate that the likelihood of a brokered Democratic convention in 2024 is higher than the historical base rate but still relatively low due to the party’s incentives to avoid chaos and rally behind a single candidate.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.**

To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined:

### Step 1: Triage and reference relevant predictions
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No specific prediction on this question as of now.
- **Polymarket**: No active market on this specific question.
- **Metaculus**: No active prediction on this question.

### Step 2: Break the problem into sub-problems
1. **Base rate of brokered conventions**: Brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. politics. The last brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952 (72 years ago). This suggests a low base rate.
2. **Current Democratic Party dynamics**: President Biden has dropped out, and Vice President Kamala Harris is the endorsed candidate. However, other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer are also in the mix.
3. **Delegate behavior**: Delegates are not automatically committed to Harris, and there is potential for multiple candidates to gain significant support.
4. **Timing and process**: The convention is scheduled for August 19-22, 2024, with a virtual roll call vote possible before the in-person event.

### Step 3: Balance inside and outside views
- **Outside view**: Historical rarity of brokered conventions suggests a low probability (e.g., <10%).
- **Inside view**: The unique circumstances of Biden’s withdrawal, Harris’s endorsement, and the presence of other strong candidates increase the likelihood of a contested process.

### Step 4: Balance under- and overreacting to evidence
- The news articles highlight the possibility of a brokered convention but also emphasize the challenges and risks of such a scenario. The party is likely to avoid chaos if possible.

### Step 5: Clashing causal forces
- **Forces favoring a brokered convention**:
  - Multiple viable candidates (Harris, Newsom, Whitmer).
  - Delegates are free to vote for any candidate.
  - Potential for factional divisions within the party.
- **Forces opposing a brokered convention**:
  - Harris has Biden’s endorsement and name recognition.
  - Party leaders may rally behind Harris to avoid a divisive process.
  - Historical aversion to brokered conventions due to their unpredictability.

### Step 6: Extrapolate current trends
- The trend since 1952 has been toward avoiding brokered conventions. However, the unique circumstances of 2024 (Biden’s withdrawal, Trump’s high negatives) could disrupt this trend.

### Step 7: Degrees of doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the unprecedented nature of Biden’s withdrawal and the potential for multiple candidates to gain traction.

### Step 8: Balance under- and overconfidence
- While the historical base rate suggests a low probability, the current situation introduces enough uncertainty to justify a higher estimate than the base rate.

### Step 9: Errors behind mistakes
- Over-reliance on historical patterns could lead to underestimating the likelihood of a brokered convention in this unique situation.
- Overreacting to the current news could lead to overestimating the likelihood.

### Final Reasoning
- The base rate of brokered conventions is very low (<10%), but the current situation is highly unusual. The presence of multiple strong candidates and the freedom of delegates to vote for any candidate increase the likelihood of a contested process. However, the party’s desire to avoid chaos and rally behind a single candidate (likely Harris) reduces the probability. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of a brokered convention.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.

To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles and carefully analyze the available evidence.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus**: As of now, there are no specific predictions from these platforms on this exact question. However, the general sentiment in the news articles suggests a heightened possibility of a brokered convention due to Biden's withdrawal and the lack of a clear successor.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Brokered Conventions**: Brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. politics. The last brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952, 72 years ago. This suggests a low base rate.
2. **Current Political Context**: Biden has withdrawn, and Kamala Harris is the endorsed successor. However, other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer are also in the mix, creating potential for a contested nomination.
3. **Delegate Dynamics**: With 3,900 delegates now free to vote for any candidate, the possibility of no candidate securing a majority on the first ballot increases.
4. **Party Unity**: The Democratic Party is under pressure to unite quickly, but the lack of a clear frontrunner could lead to multiple rounds of voting.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, brokered conventions are rare, and the last one was 72 years ago. This suggests a low probability.
- **Inside View**: The current situation is unique with Biden's withdrawal and the lack of a clear successor. This increases the likelihood of a brokered convention.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the historical rarity of brokered conventions.
- **Overreacting**: Overestimating the likelihood based on the current unique situation.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces for a Brokered Convention**: Lack of a clear successor, multiple strong candidates, and free delegates.
- **Forces Against a Brokered Convention**: Historical rarity, party pressure to unite quickly, and the potential for a quick consensus around Kamala Harris.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The trend is towards a more contested nomination process due to Biden's withdrawal and the emergence of multiple candidates.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the unique circumstances, but historical patterns suggest caution.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Avoid being overly confident in either outcome. The situation is fluid and could change rapidly.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include over-relying on historical patterns or overestimating the impact of current events.

### Final Analysis
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Starting with a low probability (e.g., 10%) due to historical rarity.
- **Current Context Adjustment**: Increasing the probability due to the unique circumstances (e.g., +20%).
- **Final Probability**: Balancing historical rarity with current uniqueness, I estimate a 30% chance of a brokered convention.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces for a Brokered Convention**: Lack of a clear successor, multiple strong candidates, and free delegates.
- **Forces Against a Brokered Convention**: Historical rarity, party pressure to unite quickly, and the potential for a quick consensus around Kamala Harris.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The trend is towards a more contested nomination process due to Biden's withdrawal and the emergence of multiple candidates.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is significant uncertainty due to the unique circumstances, but historical patterns suggest caution.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Avoid being overly confident in either outcome. The situation is fluid and could change rapidly.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include over-relying on historical patterns or overestimating the impact of current events.

### Final Analysis
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Starting with a low probability (e.g., 10%) due to historical rarity.
- **Current Context Adjustment**: Increasing the probability due to the unique circumstances (e.g., +20%).
- **Final Probability**: Balancing historical rarity with current uniqueness, I estimate a 30% chance of a brokered convention.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles and carefully analyze the available evidence.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, and Metaculus**: As of now, there are no specific predictions from these platforms on this exact question. However, the general sentiment in the news articles suggests a heightened possibility of a brokered convention due to Biden's withdrawal and the lack of a clear successor.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of Brokered Conventions**: Brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. politics. The last brokered convention for Democrats was in 1952, 72 years ago. This suggests a low base rate.
2. **Current Political Context**: Biden has withdrawn, and Kamala Harris is the endorsed successor. However, other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer are also in the mix, creating potential for a contested nomination.
3. **Delegate Dynamics**: With 3,900 delegates now free to vote for any candidate, the possibility of no candidate securing a majority on the first ballot increases.
4. **Party Unity**: The Democratic Party is under pressure to unite quickly, but the lack of a clear frontrunner could lead to multiple rounds of voting.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, brokered conventions are rare, and the last one was 72 years ago. This suggests a low probability.
- **Inside View**: The current situation is unique with Biden's withdrawal and the lack of a clear successor. This increases the likelihood of a brokered convention.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the historical rarity of brokered conventions.
- **Overreacting**: Overestimating the likelihood based on the current unique situation.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces for a Brokered Convention**: Lack of a clear successor, multiple strong candidates, and free delegates.
- **Forces Against a Brokered Convention**: Historical rarity, party pressure to unite quickly, and the potential for a quick consensus around Kamala Harris.
