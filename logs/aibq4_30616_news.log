**November Payrolls Likely Recovered After Weak October 2024 Jobs Report**
The October jobs report showed a significant weakening of the labor market, with only 12,000 net new jobs added and a sharp slowing in net nonfarm payrolls due to hurricane-related disruptions and strikes. However, economists expect the November jobs report to reflect a rebound in payrolls, although the unemployment rate could rise further. The BLS noted that the hurricanes and strikes likely affected payroll employment estimates, but the exact impact is unclear. An improvement in November nonfarm payrolls is likely, but if it does not improve significantly, fears of a recession could rise. The November jobs report will be critical for the future of Federal Reserve policy and interest rate decisions in 2025.

The Institute for Supply Management will release its Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Indexes for November. The consensus estimate for the Manufacturing PMI is 48, a 1.5-point increase from October, while the Services PMI is expected to be 55.4, slightly lower than October's figure. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, while below suggest contraction. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for October, showing 7.44 million job openings on the last business day of September, the lowest level since January 2021. The BLS will also release the jobs report for November, with economists forecasting a 190,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls and an unemployment rate of 4.2%.

**Make the BLS great again!**
The recent jobs report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been questioned by some, with the author suggesting that the agency may be 'cooking the books' or making errors in their reporting. The report showed that total nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in October, with a slight increase of 12,000 jobs. However, the author notes that previous jobs reports have been revised downward, and that the BLS's explanations for these revisions, such as a decline in manufacturing due to strike activity, do not seem convincing. The author calls for Elon Musk to 'fix the BLS' due to the confusion caused by these revisions.

**US October nonfarm payrolls seen taking a hit from striking...**
The US nonfarm payrolls in October may be reduced by up to 41,000 jobs due to strikes in the aerospace manufacturing industry and at three hotel chains. The Labor Department's report showed 33,000 Boeing employees were idle, 5,000 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were on strike at Textron, and 3,400 workers walked off the job at Hilton, Hyatt, and Marriott hotels. The labor market may also have been affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which could have cut up to 40,000 jobs. Preliminary results of a Reuters survey estimate nonfarm payrolls increased by 125,000 jobs this month, but economists believe Federal Reserve officials will 'brush aside' October's employment report when they meet on Nov. 6-7. 'The rise in the unemployment rate from 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.3% in July this year was the trigger for the U.S. central bank's unusually large 50-basis-point rate cut last month,' said economists. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points next month.

**Nonfarm Payrolls Seen Up 214K-- Data Week Ahead Update**
According to a survey by The Wall Street Journal, this week's U.S. data is expected to show an increase in nonfarm payrolls by 214,000, with other key metrics including a 4.2% unemployment rate and an average hourly wage increase of 3.9% year-over-year. Other forecasts include a 0.2% increase in factory orders and a $74.8 billion trade deficit. The survey, which polled 22 economists, also predicts an increase in job openings and a decrease in jobless claims.

**The Most Important Number: A Decisive Report for the Federal Reserve**
The upcoming 'nonfarm payrolls' report, which includes job growth and unemployment rates in the US, is considered 'the most important number' of the month. According to Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB, the report is 'very decisive' for the Federal Reserve when setting interest rates. DNB expects a more normal job growth in November, after a weak October, with 160,000 new jobs and a stable unemployment rate of 4.1%. The report will be released on Friday, and Haugland believes it will 'underline that it's the end of 50 basis point rate cuts' for the Fed. However, it's not ruled out that the Fed will pause rate cuts in December, especially with Trump in office. According to the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a clear probability for a rate cut by the Fed in December. On Wednesday, the report on labor market in the eurozone for October will be released, as well as the tax lists for 2023. On the same day, Eiendom Norge will release data on house prices, which fell 0.7% in October. Haugland expects a seasonally adjusted increase of 0.4% in November, which would indicate that the economy can handle the current interest rate level. Haugland also believes that Norges Bank will cut rates in March, due to the ongoing economic development and stable house prices.

**Salesforce, Kroger, Lululemon, Ulta Beauty, and More Stocks to Watch This Week**
This week, investors will focus on technology and retailer earnings reports, as well as the November jobs data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for October on Tuesday, followed by the November jobs report on Friday. Economists predict a gain of 190,000 nonfarm payrolls in November, after a hurricane-impacted October total of just 12,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.2% from 4.1%. As one economist's consensus forecast notes, 'a gain of 190,000 nonfarm payrolls in November' would be a significant improvement.

**US hiring growth due for snapback in November after storms and strike**
US hiring growth is expected to rebound in November after being undercut by hurricanes and a major strike in October. According to a Bloomberg survey, nonfarm payrolls probably advanced by 200,000 in November, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.1%. However, a steady decline in open positions and moderating payrolls growth suggest a broader softening in the labor market. Anna Wong and her team at Bloomberg Economics said, 'November's jobs report will likely be an improvement on October's, but not the type of strong rebound one would expect if all of October's weakness were due to temporary factors.' The underlying pace of job growth is likely below what's needed to stabilize the unemployment rate, which is expected to hit 4.5% before year-end. Other key economic data releases this week include job openings and layoff announcements, as well as the Institute for Supply Management's readings on activity in the manufacturing and service sectors.

**Friday’s jobs report is expected to show the slowest pace of hiring in years**
The upcoming jobs report for October is expected to show the slowest pace of hiring in nearly four years, with economists predicting a 100,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, the lowest since December 2020. However, the unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.1%. Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said, 'When we look through that [headline jobs number], the unemployment rate will remain low, and I think wages will grow faster than inflation, and both those things are going to underscore the health of the U.S. economy.' Despite the expected slow hiring pace, indicators leading up to the report show that hiring has continued and layoffs are low. The White House estimates that the recent hurricanes and Boeing strike may have taken as much as 100,000 off the payrolls count. Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said, 'Growth is slowing and also becoming more narrowly concentrated in just a couple of sectors.' She added, 'For the last two quarters now, job growth has been below the pre-pandemic average, and job gains have been unusually narrowly distributed.'

**Nonfarm Payrolls Expected to Rise -- Data Week Ahead**
Next week's U.S. data is expected to show a rise in nonfarm payrolls, according to a survey compiled by The Wall Street Journal. The median forecasts for the week include: a rise in job openings to 7.6 million, an increase in ADP jobs by 158,000, and a rise in nonfarm payrolls by 200,000. Additionally, the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.1%, and average hourly wages are expected to increase by 0.3% month-over-month and 3.9% year-over-year. The survey also forecasts a decrease in the U.S. trade deficit to $74.8 billion. 'The data week ahead is expected to be a positive one for the U.S. economy,' said no economist in the survey, but the figures in parentheses refer to the number of economists surveyed, which is 10 for the nonfarm payrolls forecast.

**US weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fall**
The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell to 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 16, according to the Labor Department. This suggests that job growth likely rebounded in November after slowing down in October due to hurricanes and strikes. Economists had forecast 220,000 claims for the latest week. The data covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. The employment report for November could determine if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates again in December. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.908 million during the week ending Nov. 9.

**Global markets start big month on cautious footing**
Global markets started the month cautiously, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of the US jobs data. The nonfarm payrolls report, due on Friday, is in focus before the US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. A Reuters survey predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply due to disruptions from hurricanes and strikes. Yvan Mamalet, senior economist at Kleinwort Hambros, said, 'The past three nonfarm payrolls moved the market quite significantly, but as this one is going to be distorted by the strikes and the hurricane I'm not sure it will have the same impact.' Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have given up on a larger move. The outcome of Tuesday's election will also influence markets, with investors betting on a Republican candidate Donald Trump winning. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 percent, and the pound was stronger on both the euro and dollar on Friday.

**Make the BLS great again!**
The latest jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that total nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in October, with a gain of 12,000 jobs. However, the report has been criticized for its revisions, with the author suggesting that the BLS may be 'cooking the books' or lacking understanding of how confusing these revisions can be. The author, referencing Elon Musk, jokingly suggests that Musk should be given the task of 'fixing the BLS' due to the 'revisions' causing 'freaking out the population.' The report notes that employment continued to trend up in health care and government, but declined in manufacturing due to strike activity, with a decrease of 46,000 jobs in October, largely due to a decline in transportation equipment manufacturing. However, the author questions the impact of a short strike on the overall employment numbers, suggesting that it 'makes no sense.'

**Private sector jobs vanish into thin air while feds add even more workers to payroll**
The private sector lost 28,000 jobs in October, while the federal government added 40,000 workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The disappointing jobs report, which saw the country add just 12,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, was marred by revisions to August and September's job numbers, which were downgraded by 81,000 and 31,000, respectively. Unemployment has risen from 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.1%, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds target range by 0.5%. The economy was also affected by strikes and hurricanes, which could have reduced job growth by 50,000. The presidential election looms, with the economy a top issue for voters, and the Biden-Harris administration's disappointing employment gains could hurt Vice President Kamala Harris' standing on the economy, with 54% of registered voters trusting Trump to deal with the economy and 45% trusting Harris.

**US Job Growth Slowed Sharply in October amid Steady Unemployment Rate**
US job growth likely slowed sharply in October due to disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, but the unemployment rate remained steady. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), nonfarm payrolls increased by 12,000 in October, a significant drop from the 223,000 jobs added in September. Despite this, economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points next Thursday, citing a marginal rise in the unemployment rate as not alarming. The Labor Department reported 41,400 new workers on strike, including 33,000 machinists at Boeing and 5,000 at Textron, which would be counted as unemployed in the survey of establishments. However, workers unable to work due to bad weather would be reported as employed, 'with a job, but not at work' as per the BLS' classification. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% last month, and wages increased 4.0% in the 12 months through October, underpinning wage gains and consumer spending.

The U.S. economy lost 28,000 private sector jobs in October while the federal government added 40,000 workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The private sector job losses come amid a disappointing jobs report, with the country adding just 12,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, well below the 110,000 economists expected. Unemployment has risen substantially since April 2023 from 3.4% to 4.1%, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds target range by 0.5%. The economy was also affected by strikes in the third quarter of 2024 and hurricanes, which could have reduced job growth by roughly 50,000. The disappointing employment gains under the Biden-Harris administration could worsen Vice President Kamala Harris' already weak standing with voters on the economy, as 54% of registered voters trust Trump to deal with the economy while just 45% trust Harris.

**Biden-Harris Admin Adds Nearly No Jobs in Last Report Before Election**
The U.S. added 12,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in October, falling short of the 110,000 jobs expected by economists. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%. This is the last jobs report before the presidential election, and it may impact voters' decisions. Economists have previously overestimated job growth, with the cumulative number of new jobs in 2023 being roughly 1.3 million less than initially thought. Unemployment has risen since April 2023, when it was at 3.4%. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 0.5% in September to boost economic growth and hiring. However, U.S. economic growth was weaker than expected at 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, 0.2% below economist expectations. The inflation rate has decreased from 9% in June 2022 to 2.4% as of September.

**US Employment Numbers Rise at Slower Pace in October**
The US employment numbers rose at a slower pace in October, with a 12,000 increase in non-agricultural jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1%, and average hourly earnings increased. The BLS noted that the hurricanes may have affected job numbers in some industries, but it's impossible to determine the exact impact on the national employment rate, hours worked, or earnings estimates. The survey response rate was lower than usual, and there was no clear impact on the national unemployment rate. The report is the last major economic data point before the Federal Reserve's meeting next week and the presidential election on November 5. Experts are likely to take little from the report and look to other data showing the labor market cooling down. The Federal Reserve is focused on maintaining a strong labor market with low inflation. It is widely expected that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point next week, a more cautious move after a significant cut in September. The report showed that employment in healthcare and government increased, but other industries were largely flat or negative. The manufacturing sector saw a decline of 46,000 jobs, the largest decline since April 2020, largely due to the Boeing strike. Experts had warned that the strike and the strong hurricanes would have a greater impact on payroll numbers than the survey that provides information on the unemployment rate. As a result, payroll estimates varied widely, from a decline of 10,000 to an increase of 180,000. The survey response rate was 47.4%, the lowest since 1991. The storms may have also affected the companies' ability to respond to the BLS in a timely manner. The BLS will continue to survey companies in the coming months, which usually leads to an increase in the response rate to around 90% or higher. This could lead to significant revisions.

**Fed Seen on Track for Two 0.25% Rate Cuts  --  Next Week and in December**
Federal Reserve policymakers are likely to reduce short-term borrowing costs by 0.25% at their policy meeting next week, despite new data showing a weaker-than-expected jobs report. The report showed a gain of 12,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in October, far short of the 113,000 economists had anticipated. However, analysts attributed the weak showing to the impact of a Boeing strike and two large hurricanes in the U.S. Southeast. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, but the average length of unemployment rose to 22.9 weeks, and the labor force shrank by 220,000 people. Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets, said, 'Bad weather and large labor strikes muddy the water and make labor market weakness appear worse than it truly is.' The Fed is expected to cut its policy rate by 0.25% to the 4.50%-4.75% range next week, and to the 4.25%-4.50% range by the end of this year, with a 99% and 83% chance, respectively.

**Fed seen on course for rate cuts after weak jobs data**
The recent jobs data has strengthened the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next week. The 12,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in October was significantly lower than the 113,000 economists had anticipated, with some 512,000 people unable to work due to bad weather. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, indicating a strong labor market. According to Byron Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, 'The nonfarm payrolls may not be great on its face, but this recent drop should be a temporary miss as rebuilding and activity pick up after the hurricanes and with the likelihood of the Boeing strike ending.' Traders are now pricing a 99% chance of a quarter-point interest-rate cut on Nov. 7, with a 83% chance that the policy rate will be in the 4.25%-4.50% range by year end.

**U.S. Job Growth Slows Amid Strikes and Storms Ahead of Election**
The U.S. job growth slowed down in October, with only 12,000 new jobs added, the smallest nonfarm payroll increase since December 2020. The Labor Department report was affected by industry strikes and hurricane disruptions, resulting in 512,000 weather-related work absences. However, the healthcare and government sectors showed growth, adding a combined 92,000 positions. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%. The Federal Reserve is considering further interest rate adjustments due to persistent wage gains. The employment news had a positive impact on financial markets, with U.S. stocks rising and the dollar falling against other currencies.

**Fed seen on track for 25-basis-point rate cuts next week and in December**
Federal Reserve policymakers are likely to reduce short-term borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point at their policy meeting next week, despite new data showing a weaker-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll jobs. The 12,000 jobs added in October was far short of the 113,000 economists had anticipated, but analysts attributed the weak showing to the impact of a Boeing strike and two large hurricanes. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, but the average length of unemployment rose to 22.9 weeks, and the labor force shrank by 220,000 people. Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets, said, 'Bad weather and large labor strikes muddy the water and make labor market weakness appear worse than it truly is.' The Fed's policy rate is expected to be cut to the 4.50%-4.75% range next week, and to the 4.25%-4.50% range by the end of this year, according to interest rate futures prices.

**US payrolls increase by just 12,000, hit by storms and strikes**
US hiring slowed down significantly in October, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by just 12,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, and hourly earnings remained firm. However, the report was distorted by severe hurricanes and a major strike, making it difficult to quantify the net effect on employment. Economists had warned that these events would negatively impact the payrolls number, and estimates varied widely, ranging from a decline of 10,000 to a gain of 180,000. Despite the caveats, the report is unlikely to provide a clear signal about the labor market, and policymakers will likely look to other data that show the labor market is cooling gradually.

**Final Labor Report Before Election Finds Employment Rate Remains Unchanged**
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its October jobs report, showing that nonfarm payroll employment grew by 12,000, essentially remaining unchanged. The unemployment rate also remained steady at 4.1 percent with 7 million people looking for work. The healthcare industry added 52,000 jobs, while temporary help services lost 49,000 jobs, with a total decrease of 577,000 since March 2022. Manufacturing employment decreased by 46,000 due to strike activity. Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 13 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $35.46, with a 4.0 percent increase over the past 12 months.

**U.S. nonfarm payrolls plunge, undershooting expectations By Investing.com**
The U.S. nonfarm payrolls, a key indicator of the country's economic health, saw a significant drop to 12,000, falling short of analysts' forecast of 106,000. This drastic shortfall in job creation suggests a potential slowdown in consumer spending, which is a key driver of the U.S. economy. The recent data, which is a stark contrast to the previous month's robust figure of 223,000, may indicate a potential slowdown in overall economic activity and could impact the strength of the U.S. dollar. However, economic indicators are complex and subject to various external influences, and the recent data does not necessarily signal a long-term trend.

**US Job Market Disappoints with Only 12,000 New Jobs Created in October**
The US labor department reported that 12,000 new jobs were created outside of agriculture in October, far below the expected 100,000. Senior strategist Dane Cecov at Sparebank 1 Markets writes, 'Today's disappointing numbers must be taken with a grain of salt, and seen in light of several strikes and bad weather that hit the US last month. We believe that today's nonfarm payrolls are completely irrelevant.' The low numbers can be attributed to strikes, including one at Boeing, which resulted in around 41,000 people being removed from the labor market. Bad weather, such as hurricanes Helene and Milton, also had a negative impact. In contrast, 223,000 new jobs were created in September, which was later revised down to 254,000. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.1%. As the US inflation rate is decreasing, the Federal Reserve is expected to focus on the labor market when deciding on interest rates. Cecov continues, 'Overall, today's numbers are still solid, excluding nonfarm payrolls. The US central bank will likely continue to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings to maintain balance in the US labor market.' The market expects another interest rate cut next week, followed by another cut in December, and three cuts in 2025. However, if Trump wins the presidential election next week, the market expects interest rate cut expectations to be reduced further.

**Markets start big month on cautious footing as US jobs data looms**
Markets started the month cautiously, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of the US jobs data. The nonfarm payrolls report on Friday is in focus, with a Reuters survey predicting an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply due to disruptions from hurricanes and strikes. Yvan Mamalet, senior economist at Kleinwort Hambros, said, 'The past three non farm payrolls moved the market quite significantly, but as this one is going to be distorted by the strikes and the hurricane I'm not sure it will have the same impact.' Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have given up on a larger move. The outcome of Tuesday's election is also a factor, with polls pointing to a knife-edge race and investors betting on a Republican candidate Donald Trump. Mamalet said, 'The election has been definitely driving the market this week, and, with the state of the U.S. economy, probably explains why bond yields have been going up in the U.S.'

**October Employment Report: 12 thousand Jobs, 4.1% Unemployment Rate**
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that total nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in October, with a gain of 12,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent. Employment continued to trend up in health care and government, but declined in manufacturing due to strike activity. Private payrolls decreased by 28,000, while public payrolls increased by 40,000. The Labor Force Participation Rate decreased to 62.6% in October, and the Employment-Population ratio decreased to 60.0%. The unemployment rate was below consensus expectations, despite revisions to August and September payrolls, which were down by 112,000 combined.

**ADP Job Report: A Strong Start to the Month, But Will it Last?**
The ADP job report released on Wednesday showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls, with 223,000 new jobs added, exceeding the consensus estimate of 111,000. According to Goldman Sachs, this is 'much better than most traders had prepared for, given the recent disruptions caused by hurricanes and the Boeing strike.' The official numbers from the BLS are expected to be released today, with a consensus estimate of 110,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.2%. Goldman Sachs expects the S&P 500 index to react positively to the numbers, with a favorable range of 75,000 to 125,000 new jobs. However, if the number exceeds 200,000, it may create concerns about the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, leading to a slower pace of reduction. 'Volatility markets are pricing in a 94 basis point move for S&P until the close tomorrow,' writes John Flood of Goldman Sachs.

**Nonfarm Payrolls Preview: Job gains expected to slow sharply in October**
The US labor market data for October is expected to show a significant slowdown in job gains, with economists predicting a meager 113,000 jobs added. The Unemployment Rate is likely to remain steady at 4.1%, while Average Hourly Earnings are expected to increase by 4.0% in the year through October. TD Securities analysts predict a below-consensus 70k gain in the November NFP report, citing distortions from recent hurricanes and the Boeing strike. The Fed's interest rate path is closely watched, with markets fully pricing in a 25 basis points (bps) Fed rate cut in November. A stronger-than-expected NFP print and elevated wage inflation data could seal in a rate reduction by the Fed next week, providing extra legs to the USD uptrend.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) increased by 12,000 in October, missing the market expectation of 113,000 by a wide margin. The Unemployment Rate remained unchanged at 4.1%, while the Labor Force Participation Rate edged lower to 62.6%. Annual wage inflation, as measured by the change in the Average Hourly Earnings, rose to 4% from 3.9%. The BLS noted that the October data may have been affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, but it's difficult to quantify the impact. The US Dollar came under bearish pressure with the immediate reaction to the US employment report, but markets are expecting the Greenback to resume its recent uptrend against its major rivals. A stronger-than-expected NFP print and elevated wage inflation data would seal in a rate reduction by the Fed next week, providing extra legs to the USD uptrend.

**US Nonfarm Payrolls Report for October: Expectations, Impact, and Market Reactions**
The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for October is set to be released on November 1, 2024, at 12:30 GMT. Market expectations are for 113,000 jobs to be added, following September's robust job growth of 254,000. The report will be closely watched by investors and policymakers, as it influences the value of the US Dollar (USD) against other major currencies. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could support the USD, while a disappointing report could exacerbate USD weakness. The report will also include other components, such as the unemployment rate, labor force participation rate, and average hourly earnings, which will be scrutinized for any significant changes. Market participants are likely to react strongly to the NFP results, leading to potential volatility in currencies, equities, and other financial markets.

**Jim Cramer Thinks That PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) Is Hot And Will Remain That Way**
Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, advises investors to maintain composure as major companies release their earnings this week. He highlights the significance of the upcoming nonfarm payroll report, which he believes will have considerable implications for interest rates. Cramer emphasizes the importance of employment data, saying, 'I can’t stress how important this number is.' He notes that a strong employment report could lead to no November rate cut. Cramer also mentions that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is 'hot and will remain that way,' and that both Reddit and PayPal will do 'terrifically.' PayPal's total branded payment volume has increased by 6% over the past 12 months, and the company forecasts adjusted EPS will rise by 'low to mid-teens' percentages from $3.83 reported in 2023.

**US October nonfarm payrolls seen taking a hit from striking aerospace, hotel workers**
U.S. nonfarm payrolls in October may be reduced by as many as 41,000 jobs due to strikes in the aerospace manufacturing industry and at three hotel chains. The Labor Department's monthly strike report showed 33,000 Boeing employees were idle, while 5,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were on strike at Textron. Additionally, 3,400 workers walked off the job at Hilton, Hyatt, and Marriott hotels and motels. The labor market may also have taken a hit from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which could have cut up to 40,000 jobs. Preliminary results of a Reuters survey estimate nonfarm payrolls increased by 125,000 jobs this month, but economists believe that Federal Reserve officials will brush aside October's employment report when they meet on November 6-7.

**Nonfarm payroll growth exceeds expectations in September**
The U.S. Labor Department announced that nonfarm payrolls grew by 254,000 in September, exceeding the 150,000 Dow Jones consensus forecast. Louis Navellier said, 'The nonfarm payroll number blew away even the most bullish estimates.' The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%. Jeffrey Roach noted that hours worked edged down to 34.2 in September, which is below the pre-pandemic average. He also stated that the solid payroll report validates that a potential half-point reduction in the Federal Funds Rate was unwarranted. The number of those holding multiple jobs rose to 5.3%, the highest since early 2009. Chris Versace commented that while the recent economic news is positive, the market's valuation is stretched, citing the low dividend yield and high P/E multiple. He emphasized the importance of using multiple factors besides the simple price-to-earnings ratio.

**September employment: Some sizzle in a cooling trend**
The September employment report showed strong job growth, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 254K, the highest reading since March. The three-month moving average of monthly nonfarm payroll growth rose to 186K, a significant improvement from the previous 116K. The household survey also indicated a balanced labor market, with employment outpacing labor force growth and the unemployment rate falling to 4.1%. This report suggests that the labor market is cooling gradually, rather than sharply, and reinforces the view that the Federal Reserve will opt for a 25 bps reduction in the fed funds rate at its November 7 meeting. 'Today's employment report is welcome news and suggests that the soft readings over the prior few months were not a sign of an imminent and sharp increase in unemployment,' said the report. The sectors that led employment growth in recent months, such as leisure & hospitality and healthcare, continued to post strong gains, while other industries like professional & business services and finance showed more modest growth.

**US Non-Farm Payrolls Rise by 254,000 in September**
The non-farm payrolls (NFP) in the United States increased by 254,000 jobs in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This reading came after an increase of 159,000 (revised from 142,000) in August, exceeding market expectations of 140,000 by a wide margin. The unemployment rate decreased to 4.1% from 4.2%, while the labor force participation rate remained unchanged at 62.7%. Additionally, the annual wage growth rate, measured by the change in average hourly earnings, increased to 4% from 3.9% in August. The BLS also revised the change in total non-farm employment for July to +144,000 from +89,000, and revised the change for August to +159,000 from +142,000. This revision increased the combined employment for July and August by 72,000 more than previously reported. The dollar index rose 0.55% in the immediate reaction to the NFP data, reaching 102.50. Economists expect the NFP to show a modest improvement in September, with a gain of 140,000 jobs, following an increase of 142,000 in August. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 4.2%, while wage growth is expected to be moderate, with a 0.2% monthly gain (3.8% annualized) after a strong 0.4% monthly gain in August. A strong NFP report could boost expectations for a 50-basis-point rate cut in November, while a weak report could lead to a 25-basis-point cut.
