Bruce Springsteen, the famous singer of 'Born in the U.S.A.', has publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in her presidential campaign for the November 2024 elections. In a video posted on his Instagram account, Springsteen not only expressed his support for the Harris-Walz ticket but also launched strong criticisms against Donald Trump, whom he described as 'the most dangerous presidential candidate I've ever seen'. Springsteen, a 74-year-old musician, reflected on the current state of the United States, saying, 'Perhaps since the Civil War, this great country has not felt as politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided as it is now. It doesn't have to be this way.' He argued in favor of the Democratic Party, citing their inclusive and respectful vision for the country. Springsteen criticized Trump, saying he does not understand the fundamental values of the country. 'His disdain for the sanctity of our Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from holding the office of president again,' he said. Springsteen emphasized the importance of voting in a democracy, urging his followers to participate in the elections. 'Now, everyone sees things differently, and I respect your choice as a citizen. But just like you, I only have one vote, and it's one of my most precious possessions. So, on November 5, I'll be voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,' he concluded.
