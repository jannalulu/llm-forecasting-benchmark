**Virgin Galactic Unveils New Spaceplane Delta for Suborbital Flights**
Virgin Galactic has unveiled the design of its new spaceplane, Delta, which is designed for suborbital flights. The spaceplane is expected to carry tourists to an altitude of approximately 80 km above the Earth's surface, offering a breathtaking view of the planet. Virgin Galactic claims that the new spaceplane will be able to make flights with passengers on board every three days, a significant improvement over the previous VSS Unity, which could only make one flight per month. The Delta spaceplane will have a capacity of six passengers, compared to four on the VSS Unity. The company plans to start using the Delta spaceplane in 2026 and expects to generate $450 million in revenue from space tourism annually. Virgin Galactic has accelerated the design process this year and has begun manufacturing components for the spaceplane, with assembly and testing expected to follow soon.

**Virgin Galactic Unveils New Spaceplane Delta with Increased Capacity and Reduced Flight Time**
Virgin Galactic has unveiled a new video showcasing the design of its upcoming spaceplane, Delta. The company claims that Delta will increase the number of passengers from four to six and reduce the time between flights from a month to just three days. The new spaceplane is equipped with a hybrid rocket system and is expected to enter commercial operation in 2026. According to Michael Colglazier, CEO of Virgin Galactic, 'We have made significant progress in the second quarter in the realization of our Delta spacecraft program, the pace of completing the design has accelerated, and the production of tools has begun.' The company plans to generate $450 million in revenue per year for several years after the introduction of the first two Delta spacecraft. The video also outlines plans to deploy up to five spacecraft at launch sites around the world in the future. 'In the next month, our teams will focus on the assembly and testing of our production spacecraft, which will enter commercial operation in 2026,' Colglazier added.

**Virgin Galactic outlines economics of its future spaceplanes**
Virgin Galactic outlined its financial models for its new Delta-class spaceplanes, which are expected to enter commercial service in 2026. According to the company's projections, the spaceplanes will generate $450 million in revenue in the first year, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $95 million to $110 million. In an 'expanded fleet' model, with four spaceships and two mothership aircraft, Virgin Galactic estimates it can perform 275 flights a year, generating $990 million in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $450 million to $500 million. The company also examined adding a second spaceport, which it projects will generate $1.98 billion in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. The financial models rest on several assumptions, including sufficient demand and the ability to build and operate the Delta-class vehicles at projected costs.

**Morgan Stanley sees more downside for Virgin Galactic stock, slashes price target**
Morgan Stanley has significantly reduced its price target for Virgin Galactic from $35.00 to $5.00 per share, citing ongoing challenges and a lack of near-term catalysts for the stock. The investment bank notes that Virgin Galactic's commercial flight hiatus, expected to last until 2026, has led to an 85% year-to-date decline in the stock's value. Morgan Stanley's analysts are skeptical about the company's ability to meet its ambitious goals for the Delta-class spaceships, which are central to its long-term revenue projections. The firm's revised outlook incorporates greater conservatism in its forecasts, with the expectation that SPCE will not see positive adjusted EBITDA until 2028 and positive free cash flow until 2029. According to Morgan Stanley, 'the stock's YTD slide (down ~85%) reflects the realization that the business model / attractive economics are premised on delivering a new fleet on schedule and at cost.'

**Rocket Report: New Glenn gets rolling; Vega takes its final dance**
The Rocket Report has been a big week for Blue Origin, with the second stage of New Glenn rolling out to its launch pad in Florida and the rocket's first stage recovery ship, Jacklyn, arriving at a nearby port. The Vega rocket made its final flight, carrying an environmental monitoring satellite for the European Union's Copernicus program. ABL Space Systems has laid off a significant portion of its workforce due to the loss of a rocket in a static-fire test. The era of easy money for space companies has ended, with several firms struggling to meet revenue projections. A lawsuit has been filed against Richard Branson, alleging that he exploited hype about Virgin Galactic's capabilities to make $1 billion worth of illegal insider stock sales. MaiaSpace is preparing to conduct the first hot fire test of the upper stage of its Maia rocket in 2025.

**Blue Origin to Launch Eighth Commercial Suborbital Flight on August 29**
Blue Origin is set to launch its eighth commercial suborbital flight on August 29, 2024. The flight, designated NS-26, will carry six passengers, including Nicolina Elrick, Rob Ferl, Eugene Grin, Eiman Jahangir, Karsen Kitchen, and Ephraim Rabin. Karsen Kitchen, a 21-year-old student from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will become the youngest woman to reach the edge of space, a feat previously achieved by Anastatia Mayers, who flew on a Virgin Galactic spacecraft in August 2023. The flight will last around 10-12 minutes, during which time the passengers will experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth. The exact cost of a seat on the New Shepard spacecraft is not publicly disclosed. The launch will be broadcast live on Blue Origin's website, and the flight will be followed by a press conference. According to Blue Origin, the company has made significant improvements to the New Shepard spacecraft, including enhanced safety features and a more efficient propulsion system. The company has also announced plans to offer commercial flights to the edge of space, with prices starting at $200,000 per seat.

**Virgin Galactic Unveils Ambitious Plans for Space Tourism**
Virgin Galactic has outlined its ambitious plans for space tourism after a two-year hiatus. Although the company plans to return to commercial space travel in 2026, it has already outlined its future strategy to lead the emerging space tourism market. Virgin Galactic expects to have the capacity to perform approximately 125 space flights per year after an initial adaptation phase. Each spacecraft will be able to transport six clients, resulting in around 750 people traveling to space annually. With tickets priced at an average of $600,000, the projected annual revenue for this initial phase is $450 million. However, Virgin Galactic's ambitions go beyond this initial phase. The company is planning a scaled-up operation model, consisting of a fleet of four spacecraft and two carrier aircraft, all operating from a single spaceport. With this expanded structure, estimates suggest up to 275 flights per year, potentially generating $990 million in annual revenue. 'We are building two larger vehicles, called Delta-class, which will be faster and will take us to space in 2026,' said Virgin Galactic. 'At the same time, we are refurbishing the Eve launch vehicle, which is 20 years old.' The company's first spaceflight was made with Richard Branson on board in July 2021.

**Virgin Galactic Unveils Ambitious Financial Models for New Spaceplane Line**
Virgin Galactic presented ambitious financial models for its new line of suborbital spaceplanes, Delta class, at the annual report conference on August 7. The company plans to conduct 125 space flights per year with 6 passengers on each vehicle, transporting 750 people annually at an average ticket price of $600,000, generating $450 million in revenue. After accounting for expenses, Virgin Galactic expects to generate a net income of $95-110 million per year. The company also considers the possibility of adding a second spaceport, possibly in Europe or the Middle East, which would increase the number of flights to 275 per year, generating $990 million in revenue and a net income of $450-500 million per year. These financial models are based on several assumptions, including sufficient demand for high-priced space flights. Virgin Galactic's own research, as well as research by Credit Suisse and Jeffries Global Research, estimate a global addressable market of 300,000 people, growing at 8% annually. The company currently has around 700 customers. Virgin Galactic is just beginning the transition from designing spaceplanes to production, working with Bell Textron and Qarbon Aerospace to produce key sections of the vehicles. Final assembly will be done at a new factory in Mesa, Arizona. The company expects to receive the first components from its suppliers in the first half of 2025 and plans to roll out and test the first ship in the second half of the year. 'It will take several years before we start flights at the second spaceport,' said Michael Colglazier, CEO of Virgin Galactic, mentioning the development of the spaceport itself and necessary regulatory approvals. He suggested that 2025 is the window when the company can start discussing the launch of a new spaceport.
