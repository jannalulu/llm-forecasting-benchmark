**18 Chinese aircraft cross into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone**
Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence (MND) reported that 21 Chinese military aircraft, including J-16 and KJ-500, were detected on Tuesday, with 18 crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entering Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). This is part of a series of provocations by China in recent months, including regular air and naval incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and military exercises near the island. Since September 2020, China has intensified its use of gray zone tactics, increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan. Taiwan has detected PLA aircraft 71 times and Chinese ships 36 times in August so far, according to Taiwan News. The MND stated, 'Overall 21 #PLA aircraft in various types (including J-16, KJ-500, etc.) were detected from 1830hr today. Out of which, 18 crossed the median line of the #Taiwan Strait and entered the northern, central, southwestern and eastern ADIZ,' on X.

According to the MND, China has been incrementally increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan since September 2020. 'An effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one's security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force,' is how gray zone tactics are defined.

**Over 400 Chinese Aircraft Fly Around Taiwan in July**
According to Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MDN), more than 400 Chinese aircraft, including fighter jets, flew around Taiwan in July. The MDN reported that 20 Chinese aircraft crossed the unofficial border or entered Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) between July 23 and 25. At least four Chinese fighter jets flew within 96 kilometers of the northern city of Keelung, which is home to a major military base, between July 23 and 24. The number of incursions in July is the highest recorded in a single month since August 2022, when China launched a series of military exercises around Taiwan in response to a visit by then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The MDN identified a total of 446 violations of the unofficial border or ADIZ in August 2022, as part of large-scale military exercises that included the launch of missiles near Taiwan. Since the inauguration of Taiwan's new president, William Lai, on May 20, China has significantly increased its activities around the island, with a daily average of 12 incursions beyond the unofficial border or in the ADIZ. The highest point of these actions occurred on July 10, when 56 Chinese aircraft, including J-16 fighter jets and H-6 bombers, crossed the unofficial border or entered the ADIZ, the highest number recorded in a single day since October 4, 2021. The monthly numbers of Chinese incursions have continued to increase since Lai's inauguration, with the MDN reporting 279 violations of the unofficial border or ADIZ in May, 331 in June, and 426 in July.

**Chinese Rocket to Fly Over Taiwan's Air Defense Zone**
A Chinese rocket carrying a satellite is expected to fly over Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on August 1. According to Taiwan's Ministry of Defense, China has launched around 10 satellite missions in the past 18 months with a flight path over the island or its ADIZ. However, none of these launches have posed a threat to Taiwan's security. The ADIZ is an area where foreign aircraft approaching are located and monitored, but it does not fall within Taiwan's territorial airspace. 'None of the launches have represented a threat to the security of Taiwan,' the Ministry of Defense stated. 'The area is not within our territorial airspace, but we are monitoring the situation closely.'

The aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line in the northern, southwestern, and southeastern sectors of the country's air defense identification zone (ADIZ). Taiwan responded by sending aircraft, naval ships, and deploying coastal-based missile systems to monitor the PLA activity. This is part of a trend, as the MND has tracked Chinese military aircraft 340 times and naval ships 100 times so far this month, and China has increased its use of gray zone tactics around Taiwan since September 2020.

**Taiwan detects record number of Chinese military aircraft incursions**
Taiwan reported 56 Chinese military aircraft crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait or entering the self-proclaimed Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on July 11, the highest number of incursions in a single day since October 2021. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) reported that 17 of these aircraft flew over the unofficial border between the two sides of the strait, while 39 others flew over the southwestern and southeastern regions of the ADIZ. The incursions equal the record set on October 4, 2021, when 56 Chinese aircraft violated the ADIZ, but at a greater distance from the main island of Taiwan. The Taiwanese military monitored the situation and deployed fighter jets, naval vessels, and coastal missile systems in response. The tensions between Taipei and Beijing have increased since the inauguration of pro-independence President William Lai, who is considered a 'fighter for independence' and a 'troublemaker' by Beijing authorities. Since then, the MND has detected a total of 939 Chinese military aircraft operating around the island, with 701 crossing the median line or violating the ADIZ, an average of almost 15 incursions per day.

**Taiwan Reports Record Number of Chinese Military Aircraft Incursions**
Taiwan reported 56 Chinese military aircraft crossing its self-proclaimed Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on Wednesday, the largest number of incursions in a single day since October 2021. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) of Taiwan stated that 17 of these aircraft flew over the unofficial border between Taiwan and China, while 39 flew over the southwestern and southeastern regions of the ADIZ. This equals the record set in October 2021, when 56 Chinese aircraft violated the ADIZ, but at a greater distance from the main island of Taiwan. The Chinese military aircraft flew as close as 133 kilometers from the city of Keelung in the north and 61 kilometers from the southern tip of Taiwan. The Taiwanese military responded by deploying fighter jets, naval vessels, and coastal missile systems. The tensions between Taiwan and China have increased since the election of pro-independence politician William Lai as Taiwan's new president, who is considered an 'instigator of separatism' and an 'agitator' by Chinese authorities.

**Taiwan claims 56 Chinese aircraft entered its air defense zone**
Taiwan claims that 56 aircraft of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) entered the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) of the island and crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait. According to the Taiwanese defense ministry, 66 aircraft and 7 ships of the PLAAF were detected in the area. The Taiwanese military monitored the situation and took several countermeasures. The ADIZ of Taiwan was declared unilaterally and covers the waters around the island, the Taiwan Strait, and part of the airspace over three eastern provinces of mainland China - Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. Tensions in the Taiwan Strait have escalated since US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August 2022. Since then, the PLAAF has regularly sent ships and aircraft to the area.
