**China's 'Silent' Strategy to Take Control of Taiwan**
The US is concerned about China's strategy to take control of Taiwan without deploying troops. According to a report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China can establish control over Taiwan by imposing an economic blockade under the guise of a quarantine, which would quickly paralyze the region. The authors of the study emphasized that this method would spare Beijing from international scandal, as only China's coast guard would be involved, which is considered a law enforcement agency rather than a military force. If the blockade is considered an act of war under international law, a quarantine cannot be equated with a conflict. 'China's armed forces can isolate Taiwan, damage its economy, and force the democratic island to submit to the Communist Party of Beijing's will without a single shot,' CSIS acknowledged.

**China Conducts Military Exercises Around Taiwan, Testing Its Capabilities to 'Take Control'**
China has announced that the ongoing military exercises surrounding Taiwan are aimed at testing its military capabilities to 'take control' of the autonomous island, just days after the inauguration of the new president. The exercises, called 'Joint Sword-2024A', involve the army, navy, air force, and missile unit and are expected to last until Friday. The goal is to verify the ability to take control of key territories and conduct joint strikes. Taiwan has responded by saying it will defend its values of freedom and democracy. The Chinese government considers Taiwan to be one of its provinces and has been increasing its military and economic pressure on the island in recent years. The United Nations has called for all parties to avoid actions that could escalate tensions, and the US has urged China to exercise restraint.

**China Tests Its Ability to 'Take Control' of Taiwan**
China has announced that its military exercises surrounding Taiwan are aimed at testing its ability to 'take control' of the autonomous island, according to state media. The two-day exercises, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024A', aim to verify China's capability to take control of key territories and conduct joint strikes, said Li Xi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The exercises come after the inauguration of Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's new president, who vowed to defend the island's values of freedom and democracy. China claims Taiwan as one of its provinces, which it has not yet been able to reunify with its territory since the end of the civil war and the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949.

**China Threatens Taiwan with Bloody Outcome if it Opposes Reunification**
China has blocked Taiwan with warships during the Joint Sword 2024 exercise. Chinese authorities have threatened to defeat Taiwan's independence forces with a bloody outcome if they oppose the 'historical trend' that will lead to the country's complete reunification. This comes after Beijing began a series of military maneuvers in front of the island to intimidate Taiwanese authorities. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense reported detecting 49 Chinese planes as part of Beijing's maneuvers. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said that all separatist forces seeking Taiwan's independence will have their heads broken and covered in blood before the historic event that will result in China's complete reunification. Wang also called on Washington to stop supporting separatist forces and to end interference in China's internal affairs. Taiwan's authorities responded by mobilizing their naval, air, and land forces, with President Lai Ching-te saying they will continue to defend the values of freedom and democracy. China has considered Taiwan a province under its sovereignty since 1949 and has never ruled out the use of force to take control of the territory.

**China-Taiwan Weekly Update, June 27, 2024**
The China-Taiwan Weekly Update, June 27, 2024, is a joint product from the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute. The update focuses on the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) paths to controlling Taiwan and cross-Taiwan Strait developments. Key takeaways include: the PRC has increased its violations of Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone, four Chinese Coast Guard vessels entered restricted waters around Kinmen, a likely state-sponsored PRC cyber threat actor is conducting persistent network infiltration operations against various Taiwanese organizations, the PRC Supreme People's Court and other institutions issued an authoritative legal opinion threatening advocates of Taiwanese independence with criminal penalties up to the death penalty, and Taiwan's Legislative Yuan passed a controversial legislative reform bill unchanged after a government-mandated second review.

**China Can Annex Taiwan Without Military Action, CSIS Report Says**
China has the ability to annex Taiwan without military action, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The report highlights several options for Beijing to take control of Taiwan, including establishing a 'gray zone' quarantine under the leadership of the coast guard and other law enforcement agencies, without involving the military. This could demonstrate China's ability to exert control over Taiwan. Experts warn that the world is paying too little attention to this possibility, despite it being more likely than a military invasion or blockade in the short term. The report also notes that China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, with a 22% increase in nuclear warheads in 2023 alone. The US and China have recently resumed unofficial talks on nuclear weapons at the non-governmental level.

**China could take over Taiwan without direct invasion: US think tank report**
A US think tank has warned that China could take control of Taiwan without a direct invasion by isolating the island, crippling its economy, and forcing it to succumb to Beijing's will through 'gray zone' tactics. The report suggests that China could employ its coast guard, maritime militia, and other agencies to initiate a quarantine of Taiwan, cutting off access to ports and vital supplies. This could be a more challenging option for the US and other democracies to counter, as it would not be considered an act of war under international law. The report highlights the potential risks and challenges for both Taiwan and China, including the economic costs of a quarantine and the potential for Taiwan to declare independence.

**China could take control of Taiwan without firing a shot, warns Think Tank**
A Washington think tank warns that China could take control of Taiwan without firing a shot by using 'gray zone' tactics, such as a military blockade or quarantine, rather than a full-scale invasion. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlights that China's military could isolate Taiwan, cripple its economy, and compel the democratic island to submit to Beijing's Communist Party without resorting to direct military action. The report suggests that China's military could play a supporting role, while the China Coast Guard, maritime militia, and police agencies enforce a quarantine of Taiwan, cutting off access to ports and essential supplies. China's Minister of National Defence, Admiral Dong Jun, has warned 'external forces' against emboldening Taiwan Independence separatists and accused the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities of pursuing Taiwan's separation from China.

**China May Regain Control Over Taiwan Without a Single Shot**
Analysts in the US believe that China has two possible options to regain control over Taiwan: a full-scale invasion or a naval blockade. Additionally, the Center suggests another path ‚Äì 'quarantine'. Beijing could initiate a 'full or partial quarantine' on Taiwan, limiting access to the island's ports, which would cut off vital supplies. In this case, Washington would be in a difficult position. If US military ships or planes intervene in such an operation by China's Coast Guard, the US could be seen as the initiator of military actions.

**CSIS: China May Capture Taiwan Without a Shot**
According to a report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China may isolate Taiwan, causing economic harm to the island and forcing it to come under the control of the People's Republic of China. The report states that China's refusal to condemn the conflict in Ukraine has increased these concerns. 'In recent years, China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan, fueling concerns that tensions could escalate into a direct conflict. A lot of attention has been paid to the threat of invasion, but Beijing has options beyond that - to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan,' the report says. Researchers believe China may use the 'gray zone' tactic, where Chinese military forces could initiate a complete or partial blockade of Taiwan. Specifically, they could cut off access to ports, disrupting vital supplies to the island, such as fuel. China considers Taiwan its territory. Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned US President Joe Biden that the Taiwan issue is a red line for Beijing. On June 16, Financial Times reported that Xi told European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in April 2023 that the US was trying to provoke China into attacking the island.

**The Fight for Taiwan**
Taiwan, an island off the coast of China, is a hotspot in geopolitics. China claims sovereignty over the democratically governed island, which is not internationally recognized but has many powerful allies, including the US. Taiwan plays a crucial role in the production of high-tech semiconductors. The People's Republic of China is trying to integrate Taiwan into China using various means, including intimidation, propaganda, disinformation, espionage, economic coercion, and constant military threats. After the January 2024 elections, a pro-independence candidate, William Lai, won, which Beijing perceives as a provocation. Taiwan is trying to preserve its independence and peace in the region. This report explores how Taiwan is doing so.

**China's Global Ambitions and its strategy of territorial reclamation ‚Äì The Singapore Post**
China is pursuing a strategy of territorial reclamation, aiming to reclaim its purportedly lost territories through warfare with six nations over the next four to five decades. The strategy involves conflicts with Taiwan, Japan, India, the Philippines, Russia, and Mongolia. China's primary target is Taiwan, with the goal of annexing it by 2025. The country is also seeking to consolidate its presence in the South China Sea, with a secondary objective of acquiring the region between 2025 and 2030. China's tertiary objective is the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, and it has also set its sights on the Senkaku and Ryukyu Islands, currently under Japanese jurisdiction. The country's quaternary aim is to launch an offensive on Mongolia and seize control. China's analysts have even proposed the execution of a formidable nuclear assault by 2045, but this scenario seems unlikely given China's limited power and the resistance it would face from nations like Russia and India.

**China and Taiwan on the Brink of Conflict: 'We Will Use Force' Threat**
Tensions are rising between China and Taiwan as China's Defense Minister, Dong Jun, has threatened to use force to bring Taiwan back under Chinese control. Dong Jun stated that China's goal is to reunify with Taiwan through peaceful means, but if this is not possible, it will use force. He also accused Taiwan's independence movement and external forces of harming the process. Taiwan's government responded quickly to Dong Jun's comments, calling them provocative and illogical. Taiwan has been governed democratically and has never been under the control of the Communist Party of China. The island's new president, Lai Ching-te, was elected on May 20. China has criticized the democratic transition and has conducted military exercises around the island as a form of punishment. Dong Jun accused Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party of seeking independence and erasing Chinese identity, and called Taiwan's leaders fanatics. He stated that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will always defend the reunification of the motherland and will never allow Taiwan to become independent.

Key takeaways include: Taiwan's opposition-led Legislative Yuan passed legislative reforms to strengthen the legislature's oversight powers over the government. At least 45 Taiwanese musicians, actors, and other celebrities shared a post by PRC state media CCTV on the social media platform Weibo in support of 'reunification.' The CCP rejected opportunities that the ROC government has offered to restart cross-strait exchanges and cool down tensions. The PRC Ministry of Defense and state media selectively publicized comments from the UN Secretary-General's spokesperson to bolster its stance that Taiwan is a part of the PRC under international law. A PRC delegation led by Minister of National Defense Dong Jun attended the Shangri-La Dialogue. The DPP is considering a constitutional challenge to the reforms, which could block the bill. The KMT and TPP countered that the reforms will strengthen Taiwan's democracy.

The DPP criticized the bill as unconstitutional and labeled it a political tool that the KMT and TPP will abuse to expand their power. The KMT and TPP introduced an amended version of the bill without making it available to the public or disseminating it to the general assembly before initiating voting. The PRC framed ROC President Lai Ching-te's inaugural address as hostile and provocative for cross-strait relations, and launched joint military exercises around Taiwan to 'punish' Taiwan for the election of President Lai and what the PRC deemed separatist 'provocations' in Lai's inauguration speech.

**China Concludes Military Exercises Around Taiwan, Simulating Blockade**
China concluded military exercises around Taiwan, simulating a blockade of the island, with 111 aircraft and dozens of ships participating. The exercises, which began on Thursday, were aimed at testing China's ability to take control of the autonomous island, which Beijing claims as its own. Taiwan's presidential spokesperson, Karen Kuo, criticized the exercises, saying they threaten the status quo of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and are a provocation to the international community. China considers Taiwan one of its provinces, which it has not been able to reunify with since the end of the Chinese Civil War and the Communist Party's rise to power on the mainland in 1949. The exercises are part of a campaign to increase military pressure on Taiwan, with almost daily incursions by Chinese ships and planes in the island's vicinity and several large-scale exercises since 2022.

**China Completes Military Exercise Around Taiwan, Seen as Provocation**
China has completed a military exercise around Taiwan, which was seen as a provocation by Taiwan. The exercise, which lasted for two days, was aimed at testing China's ability to 'seize power' and take control of key areas on the self-governing island, which China considers to be its territory. Taiwan's authorities consider the exercise to be a 'clear provocation against international order'. The exercise comes just days after Lai Ching-te was sworn in as the new president of Taiwan, which China sees as a recognition of independence, which it strongly opposes. China has warned that further 'provocations' from Taiwan will be severely punished. The Chinese Defense Ministry has stated that every time Taiwan 'provokes independence', China will take further measures until the complete reunification of the motherland is achieved.

**China Conducts Military Exercise Around Taiwan, Raising Concerns**
China has started a large-scale military exercise around Taiwan, causing concern. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command said that the exercise is necessary and legitimate to prevent separatist forces and to control key positions. China has also warned that Taiwan's independence movement is under the historical trend of reunification with China. Taiwan's Defense Ministry has responded by saying that the exercise is a provocation and has deployed its own naval, air, and ground forces to the area. The exercise comes after Taiwan's new leader, Lai Ching-te, took office and called for an end to China's military and political threats. China has been cracking down on independence supporters in Taiwan since the early 2000s and wants to bring the country under its control. China claims Taiwan as its own territory, while Taiwan sees itself as an independent country. China has set a target of reunification by 2049, but Taiwan's independence movement has gained momentum since the election of pro-independence leader Tsai Ing-wen in 2024.

In December 2023, Taiwan detected regular Chinese balloons drifting around the island, with a record 8 balloons detected in 24 hours in February 2024. On May 15, 2024, Taiwan detected 45 Chinese aircraft around the island, with 26 crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait. China has threatened to take reprisals against Taiwan, with the Chinese foreign minister saying that Taiwan's new president's speech was an admission of independence and a threat to China's sovereignty.

**China's war games around Taiwan test ability to 'seize power'**
China's military conducted a second day of war games around Taiwan, testing its ability to 'seize power' and control key areas. The drills, which began just three days after Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te, took office, have been condemned by Taiwan. China views Taiwan as its own territory and has never ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control. The exercises, dubbed 'Joint Sword ‚Äì 2024A', aim to test the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks, and occupy key areas. Taiwan's armed forces have mobilized to monitor and shadow Chinese forces, with 49 Chinese military aircraft, 19 navy, and seven coast guard ships detected in the area.

**China Conducts Military Exercises Around Taiwan, Testing Ability to Take Control**
China has conducted military exercises around Taiwan, aimed at testing its ability to take control of the island and conduct joint attacks, as well as control key territories. The exercises began on Thursday and involve troops in the Taiwan Strait, north, south, and east of the island, as well as around the nearby islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin. The Chinese military described the exercises as a severe punishment for Taiwan's independence forces and a warning to external forces not to interfere or provoke. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense responded by sending naval, air, and ground forces to defend the island's freedom, democracy, and sovereignty, and assured that all military officials and soldiers are prepared for war. The exercises come three days after Taiwan's new President, William Lai Ching-te, took office and defended the existence of the Republic of China, Taiwan's official name. The territory of 23 million people operates as a sovereign entity with its own diplomacy and military, despite not being officially independent. China considers Taiwan a province that must be reunified, by force if necessary. Taiwan will defend its values of freedom and democracy, and the European Union and the UN have urged restraint and opposed any unilateral actions in the region.

**China's Military Exercises Around Taiwan: A Show of Force**
China's military exercises around Taiwan: Beijing is practicing 'seizure of control over critical areas' The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) continued its military exercises around Taiwan on Friday, May 24, according to Xinhua. The exercises, which involve joint operations by the army, navy, air force, and rocket forces, are being held in the Taiwan Strait and around the island, with the aim of demonstrating the PLA's ability to take control of the island and its surrounding waters. The exercises are also aimed at warning the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leadership and its supporters that the PLA is capable of cutting off Taiwan's ports and airports, and that any attempts to declare independence will be met with force. The exercises are seen as a demonstration of Beijing's determination to bring Taiwan under its control, and are likely to be met with opposition from the US and other countries in the region. The US has warned that any attempts to use force against Taiwan would be met with a strong response, and has called on China to cease its military exercises. The European Union has also expressed concern over the situation, and has called on all parties to exercise restraint. The United Nations has also called on all parties to avoid any actions that could escalate the situation. China has made it clear that it will not tolerate any further delays in the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, and has given a deadline of 2027 for the PLA to be ready to invade the island. However, the US has said that it does not believe China will take any aggressive action against Taiwan until at least 2030. The situation remains tense, with both sides refusing to back down.

The exercises, dubbed 'Joint Sword-2024A', come after the inauguration of Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's new president, which Beijing denounced as a 'confession of independence'.

China has blocked Taiwan with warships during the Joint Sword 2024 exercise. Chinese authorities have threatened to defeat Taiwan's independence forces with a bloody outcome if they oppose the 'historical trend' that will lead to the country's complete reunification. This comes after Beijing began a series of military maneuvers in front of the island to intimidate Taiwanese authorities. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense reported detecting 49 Chinese planes as part of Beijing's maneuvers. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said that all separatist forces seeking Taiwan's independence will have their heads broken and covered in blood before the historic event that will result in China's complete reunification. Wang also called on Washington to stop supporting separatist forces and to end interference in China's internal affairs. Taiwan's authorities responded by mobilizing their naval, air, and land forces, with President Lai Ching-te saying they will continue to defend the values of freedom and democracy.

China has surrounded Taiwan with military vessels and aircraft, a move seen as a warning to the island's new president, Lai Ching-te, who has vowed to defend Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy. The military exercise, called 'Joint Sword-2024A', is the largest since at least a year and involves the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in a show of strength. The exercise is seen as a response to Lai's inauguration speech, in which he called for an end to China's 'political and military intimidation' and for 'peace and common prosperity'. China has also declared smaller islands controlled by Taiwan as exercise zones, including Kinmen, which is located near the Chinese mainland. Taiwan's government has protested the exercise, calling it a 'provocation' and demanding that China stop its 'irrational military provocations'. The exercise is seen as a way for China to demonstrate its strength and intimidate Taiwan, but it is not expected to lead to an immediate invasion. The US has also been watching the situation closely, with some experts saying that China may be trying to send a message to the US ahead of the November elections.

However, he also called on China to stop its political and military intimidation.
