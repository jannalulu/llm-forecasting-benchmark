**Rivian (RIVN) to release critical Q2 earnings: Here's what to expect**
Rivian (RIVN) is set to release its critical Q2 2024 earnings on August 6, 2024. The company has been aggressively cutting costs to achieve a gross profit by the end of the year.

Despite a 'messy' second quarter, Rivian remains on the path to profitability, with executives reiterating that the company will achieve its first positive gross profit by the end of the year.

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs - IGN**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025.

Cisco is preparing for a second wave of massive layoffs in 2024, with thousands of job cuts expected. The company is shifting its focus to faster-growing areas such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI). According to Reuters, citing anonymous sources, the layoffs may be similar in scale to the 4,000 employees who were let go in February.

The company is also trying to incorporate AI products into its offerings, and in May confirmed its goal of generating $1 billion in AI product sales by 2025,' the report added. This is not the first major layoff in the tech industry this year, with Intel cutting around 17,500 employees, or 15% of its workforce, in August.

**Rivian Reports Disappointing Financial Results, Confirms $2.7 Billion Loss for 2024**
Rivian, a US-based electric SUV and pickup truck manufacturer, has released disappointing financial results, causing its stock to drop 7% in the market. The company's revenue for the second quarter was $1.158 million, with an EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $860 million, similar to the same period last year. However, the company is still expected to lose $2.7 billion in 2024, with a loss of $32,705 per vehicle sold and $1.13 per share. CEO R.J. Scaringe stated that the company is on track to reach profitability by the end of the year, but confirmed the expected loss for 2024. The company's results were partially affected by a three-week shutdown of its Normal plant, which is necessary to improve efficiency and reduce production and material costs. Scaringe said, 'The second quarter was crucial for Rivian. We demonstrated a strong execution capacity during the quarter with the update of the plant renewal and the launch of the second-generation R1 vehicles.' He added, 'The modifications we made to the R1 platform allowed us to reduce material and production costs while improving performance and capacity.' Rivian is also planning a joint venture with Volkswagen, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. The joint venture will see Rivian's technology integrated into Volkswagen's products, contributing to a greater choice for consumers and accelerating the transition from fossil fuels.

The layoffs will affect employees working in Israel in Jerusalem, Haifa, Petah Tikva, and Kiryat Ghat.

**Intel Confirms Layoffs of 15,000 Employees, Reduces Workforce by Over 15%**
Intel has confirmed the layoff of 15,000 employees, reducing its workforce by over 15%. In its second-quarter 2024 earnings report, the company stated that it plans to 'reduce the workforce by more than 15%, with the majority completed by the end of 2024'. CEO Pat Gelsinger noted in a memo to employees that the company aims to cut around 15,000 jobs as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. 'Simplifying, we need to align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate,' he said. 'Our revenues haven't grown as expected – and we haven't fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both – particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that an improved retirement offer will be made available to eligible employees across the company next week, which will include a program for voluntary departures. 'These decisions have deeply challenged me, and this is the hardest thing I've ever done in my career,' he said. 'My commitment to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency, and respect in the coming weeks and months.'

**Intel to lay off thousands, Bloomberg reports**
Intel Corp. plans to lay off thousands of employees, according to a report from Bloomberg, as the company aims to reduce costs and bolster its sagging earnings. The cuts are part of a workforce reorganization, which could come as early as this week, and are meant to support new programs and strategies to address Intel's loss of market share. Despite receiving $8.5 billion in direct funding through the federal CHIPS Act, Intel's revenue for 2023 was $18.9 billion, down 31% from $27.49 billion in 2022. The company's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has been spearheading a turnaround strategy involving cost cutting and focusing on manufacturing new advanced chip technologies. However, Intel's new Intel Foundry experienced $7 billion in operating losses in 2023, and the company announced a cost-reduction plan in October 2022 to attempt to cut costs by $3 billion in 2023.

Intel Corp. is planning to lay off thousands of employees to cut costs and finance new programs, according to a report from Bloomberg. The workforce reorganization could come as early as this week, affecting around 7,000 employees across its four Santa Clara locations.

Despite efforts by CEO Pat Gelsinger to turn the company around through cost-cutting and manufacturing new advanced chip technologies, Intel has experienced significant losses, including $7 billion in operating losses for its new Intel Foundry in 2023. The company's revenue for 2023 was $18.9 billion, down 31% from $27.49 billion in 2022.

**Intel Prepares for New Wave of Layoffs Amidst Industry Challenges**
Intel is reportedly preparing for a new wave of layoffs in 2024, according to Bloomberg, following a 5% reduction in staff in 2023. The company currently employs around 110,000 people, and it is estimated that 'thousands of jobs' could be cut. The official announcement is expected next week. These layoffs come as Intel faces several challenges, including losing market share in the server sector to AMD, the poor performance of Intel Arc products, and issues with the 13th and 14th generation processors crashing. Additionally, the arrival of Qualcomm Snapdragon X chips could further erode Intel's market share in the notebook segment. Bloomberg predicts that Intel's revenue for the second quarter of 2024 will remain stable compared to the same period in 2023, but this could change in the second half of the year with the launch of new products expected to boost profits, as stated by an Intel spokesperson, 'It is still unclear what exactly is causing the chip crashes.'

Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN) has staged a remarkable recovery since its bottom in April 2024, driven by the recent Volkswagen-Rivian joint venture announcement. Despite maintaining its production guidance and surpassing Q2 delivery estimates, Rivian's fundamentals remain weak, with the company still unprofitable and not expected to turn free cash flow profitable through FY2027. The market has likely reflected the improved confidence in Rivian's tech stack, but execution must remain the utmost priority for the EV maker. The author maintains a Hold rating, cautioning that the recent surge has not altered RIVN's long-term downtrend bias and that investors should not misconstrue the reversal as a buying opportunity.

**Volkswagen Invests 1,000 Million Dollars in Rivian, Plans Joint Company**
Volkswagen acquired a 1,000 million dollar stake in electric vehicle startup Rivian and plans to establish a joint company that could increase investment to 5,000 million dollars by 2026. The automaker announced the deal after the market close on Tuesday, two days before Rivian's investor event, as the company has been trying to reduce costs and shore up cash amid slower-than-expected adoption of electric vehicles. With the acquisition, Volkswagen becomes the second traditional automaker to take a stake in the California-based company. Ford was one of the largest shareholders when Rivian went public in 2021, acquiring around 12% of the company. After the announcement, Rivian's shares rose 50% to $11.96 per share. Rivian's problems include a cash burn and significant losses presented since 2023. In the first quarter of the year, Rivian reported a loss of 1,450 million dollars and various layoffs. The company also reorganized its plant in Normal, Illinois, to launch updated versions of its R1T pickup truck and electric SUV R1S before the launch of its next generation in 2026. The company has been on a cost-cutting mission, even stopping the construction of a new multimillion-dollar factory in Georgia and cutting staff at its Illinois plant. These measures are expected to save the company around 2,250 million dollars in capital expenses, including the impact of starting production of the next-generation R2 vehicle.

**Rivian's Stock Soars Over 50% After Volkswagen Invests $1 Billion**
Rivian Automotive and Volkswagen Group have joined forces to develop software technology that will help boost their electric vehicle production. Rivian's stock jumped over 50% in after-hours trading on Tuesday to over $18 per share after Volkswagen announced it would initially invest $1 billion in the electric vehicle manufacturer, with plans to invest $4 billion by 2026. The companies said in a statement that the partnership will help each company reduce the cost of producing EVs by increasing 'scale and accelerating innovation globally.' The partnership aims to leverage Rivian's current software and electrical architecture, with Rivian granting licenses to existing intellectual property rights. Both companies will continue to operate separately, with each aiming to launch vehicles using Rivian technology by the second half of the decade. The partnership could be a good omen for Rivian, which has been struggling to reduce costs. In May, the company said it would lay off over 100 employees in California, while in February, it said it would cut 10% of its workforce. Rivian, based in Irvine, California, is not alone in its 'climb similar to a mountain' to increase demand for electric vehicles, which has fallen due to consumer concerns over high costs and charging station accessibility. However, Rivian has been trying to save its business by hoping to capture the attention of potential electric vehicle owners. In March, it said it would produce cheaper electric vehicles, with a price of $45,000.

**VW to Invest Billions in Rivian to Accelerate Software Development**
Volkswagen is investing up to $5 billion in Rivian, a US electric vehicle manufacturer, to accelerate software development. The two companies will establish a joint venture, with equal ownership, to develop software for the next generation of vehicles. Rivian's technology will be used in the vehicles of both companies, which are expected to be released before 2030. Volkswagen has been struggling with software development issues in its subsidiary Cariad. The partnership aims to bring the best solutions faster and at lower costs into their vehicles. Volkswagen's CEO, Oliver Blume, stated, 'The partnership fits seamlessly into our existing software strategy (...) and strengthens our technology profile and competitiveness.' The investment will be made in two stages, with the first $1 billion convertible bond to be converted into Rivian shares by December, and another $1 billion invested in 2025 and 2026. The joint venture is expected to be established by the end of 2024.

**2024 Tech Industry Layoffs Approach the 100K Mark**
The tech industry has reached a milestone of 99,672 layoffs in the first half of 2024, surpassing the 260,000 jobs lost in 2023. Notable companies like ByteDance, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, PayPal, Snap, and eBay have cut jobs, with some citing the need for a leaner organization. Analyst Brent Thill believes the layoffs will continue and may worsen. Meanwhile, a Citi report highlights the potential for automation and AI adoption in the banking sector, which could lead to increased price competition and changes in the balance of power. However, the report also raises concerns about compliance, security, regulation, and ethics in a 'bot-powered world'.
