**Edo 2024 governorship: Ighodalo and other matters, by Emeka Alex Duru**
The Edo State governorship election on September 21 is a crucial moment for the state. The National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has assured that the commission will ensure a free, fair, and credible election. However, the 2023 general elections under Yakubu's supervision were marred by controversy, leaving many Nigerians skeptical about the commission's neutrality. The security agencies in the state, particularly the Police, have also been accused of harassment and intimidation of opposition members. President Bola Tinubu's statement assuring the APC members that he will 'give Edo back to them' has raised concerns about the outcome of the election. The PDP candidate, Asue Ighodalo, stands out with a comprehensive manifesto that pledges to transform the state into a beacon of progress and prosperity. Ighodalo's person and antecedents offer hopes and assurances on what to expect if elected to office. His vision for Edo includes good governance, poverty reduction, education, and skill acquisition, as well as repositioning the healthcare system and transforming the state into the food basket of South-South Nigeria. The election is not about political parties, but about individuals and their capacities to deliver on their promises.

**Edo 2024: An easy pick, by Ochereome Nnanna**
As the Edo State Governorship Election approaches, voters are being urged to make informed decisions. The three main candidates are Asue Ighodalo of the Peoples Democratic Party, Monday Okpebholo of the All Progressives Congress, and Olumide Akpata of the Labour Party. Okpebholo is being backed by Senator Oshiomhole, who has dominated his campaign with trashy talks, including saying 'Widow, go and die' and 'They are childless' about Obaseki and his wife. Akpata is a new breed trying to leverage the Obidient Movement, while Ighodalo is a top quality pick with a solid track record of boardroom successes as an economist and corporate lawyer. The author advises Edo voters to beware of career politicians and choose an independent-minded and seasoned business leader like Ighodalo.

**Edo election: The Battle for Osadebey Avenue - A symbol of unyielding political power**
The upcoming Edo election on September 21, 2024, is a pivotal moment for the state, determining its future direction and leadership. Three leading candidates, Monday Okpebholo of the APC, Asuerinmen Ighodalo of the PDP, and Olumide Anthony Akpata of the LP, are vying for the position. The APC candidate has been criticized for avoiding engagement with the media and relying on proxies to convey his message. The PDP candidate has been actively engaging with the people, but faces challenges due to the diminishing popularity of the incumbent Governor. The LP candidate, a former NBA President, is seen as a credible alternative, but faces obstacles due to his ethnic background and senatorial district. The election's outcome will reflect the people's will, and it is crucial for electoral officials, security agents, and law enforcement personnel to safeguard the rights and safety of the Edo people. The election will be a test of democratic ideals, and the people of Edo will decide if the APC and PDP candidates' strategies are worthy of respect.

**Pertinent Issues on Edo Governorship Poll**
The upcoming Edo State governorship election on September 21 will determine the next leader of the state. The candidates are Dr. Asue Ighodalo of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Monday Okpebholo of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Olumide Akpata of the Labour Party (LP). According to Braimah, a communications strategist, Dr. Ighodalo is the best candidate for the job due to his excellent track record of performance. Braimah argues that Edo people want a governor who can create wealth and prosperity through innovation and big ideas. He criticizes Senator Oshiomhole, a former Chairman of APC and leader of the party in Edo State, for making reckless and perfidious statements, including calling Betsy, the wife of Governor Obaseki, childless. Braimah believes that Senator Okpebholo would have to work hard to convince Edo people to vote for him, as he has not appeared on any TV channel to explain his plans for the state. The article also highlights the importance of destination marketing and city branding for the growth of the local economy. Braimah suggests that initiatives such as the Edo Cycling Tour and the revival of the Ogbe Hard Court tennis tournament can be launched to attract tourists and generate revenue. He expects the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure a free and fair election, and the security agencies to be vigilant against electoral violence and malpractices.

Despite these alleged tactics, Ologunagba assured that the resolve of Edo State voters to elect Ighodalo as governor remains unshaken.

**Edo Gubernatorial Election: PDP Urges Voters to Avoid Incompetent Candidates**
The Asue-Ogie Campaign Management Council has urged voters in Edo State to avoid incompetent candidates in the upcoming governorship election on September 21, 2024. The council's deputy director-general for media, Olu Martins, warned that repeating past mistakes, such as choosing former President Muhammadu Buhari over former President Goodluck Jonathan, could lead to negative consequences. Martins emphasized the importance of carefully evaluating the history of political parties and their candidates, particularly Asue Ighodalo and Monday Okpebholo, before making a decision. He also called on political parties to let their candidates speak for themselves, allowing voters to hold them accountable later. Martins reminded citizens of their duty to choose the best candidate, stating, 'Edo people have a duty today to say you will not control this election.'

**Edo guber: PDP candidate can't speak his language**
Edo State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu has stated that the Peoples Democratic Party's (PDP) candidate for the September 21, 2024, governorship election, Asue Ighodalo, is not accepted by the people of the state. Shaibu claimed that Ighodalo is rejected by his kinsmen because he cannot speak their native language. According to Shaibu, 'the people don't want Asue Ighodalo; even his own people in Ewohimi don't want him because he can't speak their language.' Shaibu also stated that incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki won the 2020 election out of sympathy, as the electorate perceived that the governor was being oppressed at that time. Shaibu vowed that Ighodalo would be defeated at the polls, saying, 'We are out now in politics and we will see where Obaseki has a shield and we are waiting for him in this election.'

**Edo 2024: Imansuangbon Challenges Akpata's Candidacy, Files Appeal Against FHC Rulings**
Kenneth Imansuangbon, a former governorship aspirant of the Labour Party (LP) in Edo State, has appealed the judgment of the Federal High Court in Benin and Abuja, which affirmed Olumide Akpata's candidature for the September 21, 2024, governorship election. Imansuangbon argued that the trial judge erred in law and arrived at a perverse decision, occasioning a miscarriage of justice to him. He claimed that the suit was statute-barred and that the trial judge failed to consider the constitutional provision prohibiting the extension of time in election-related cases. Imansuangbon is seeking an order allowing the appeal, setting aside the decision of the lower court, and directing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue a certificate of return to him as the winner of the primary election.
