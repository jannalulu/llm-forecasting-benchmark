Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Classes:
- Netanyahu has shown remarkable political survival skills throughout his career
- He has survived multiple challenges to his leadership
- History shows Israeli PMs can be removed through various mechanisms: elections, coalition collapse, or resignation

2. Key Evidence Supporting Netanyahu Remaining PM:
- Recent polls show Netanyahu gaining ground (36% support vs 30% for Gantz)
- He's successfully managing the war situation to maintain power
- He's postponed his corruption trial testimony to December 2024
- He appears to be strategically delaying elections until after US elections
- His control over security decisions has strengthened after dissolving war cabinet

3. Key Evidence Against Netanyahu Remaining PM:
- Gantz resigned from war cabinet, weakening coalition stability
- Strong opposition demands for September elections
- Corruption trial pressure mounting
- International pressure over Gaza war
- 57% of Israelis believe he divides the country
- Growing domestic protests demanding hostage deal

4. Critical Timeline Analysis:
- The prediction window is relatively short (through September 30, 2024)
- His corruption trial testimony isn't until December 2024
- Elections aren't officially scheduled until 2026
- Opposition pushing for September elections but Netanyahu resisting

5. Recent Developments:
- July 15, 2024: Liberman suggests Netanyahu may dissolve Knesset in November
- Polls show opposition could win 60 seats vs. government's 50
- Netanyahu maintaining strong stance on war objectives
- Successfully delayed ICC arrest warrant decision

6. Risk Analysis:
- Short-term removal seems unlikely without major catalyst
- Coalition collapse possible but would take time to manifest
- Legal pressures won't peak during prediction window
- War situation provides political cover

Given Netanyahu's historical resilience, current political dynamics, and the relatively short prediction window, while acknowledging significant pressures, I assess:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 80.25%, with 72.80% being the most likely. Probability: 72.80%

Let me analyze this methodically:

Base Rate Analysis:
- Netanyahu has been Israel's longest-serving PM, showing remarkable political survival skills
- Historical precedent shows he has overcome multiple political crises

Key Evidence Supporting Survival:
1. Recent polls show Netanyahu gaining ground (36% prefer him as PM vs 30% for Gantz)
2. Netanyahu has successfully dissolved the war cabinet after Gantz's departure
3. He maintains control over key decisions regarding Gaza war
4. His scheduled testimony in corruption trial isn't until December 2, after the resolution date
5. He's scheduled to address US Congress, showing continued international engagement

Key Evidence Supporting Removal:
1. Gantz resigned from government, weakening coalition
2. Opposition demanding September elections
3. Corruption trial pressure mounting
4. International pressure over Gaza war
5. Avigdor Liberman suggests Netanyahu may dissolve Knesset in November
6. Recent polls show opposition parties could win 60 seats vs 50 for coalition

Critical Factors:
1. The timing is crucial - only needs to survive until September 30
2. No immediate mechanism for removal visible before September 30
3. Netanyahu's strategy appears to be delaying major decisions until after US elections
4. War situation provides rationale for maintaining current leadership

Breaking down sub-probabilities:
- Probability of voluntary resignation: Very low (<5%)
- Probability of forced removal through vote: Medium (20-30%)
- Probability of coalition collapse: Medium (20-30%)
- Probability of surviving through September: High (65-75%)

Given these factors, and considering the specific timeframe ending September 30, 2024, the most likely scenario is Netanyahu remaining in power, though with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Facts:
- Resolution period: July 1, 2024 - Sept 30, 2024
- Netanyahu must remain PM throughout this entire period
- Today is July 15, 2024

2. Positive Factors for Netanyahu Remaining PM:
- Long track record of political survival
- Still maintains control over key decisions regarding Gaza war
- Recent polls show him gaining ground (36% prefer him vs 30% for Gantz)
- Has dissolved war cabinet, consolidating power
- Successfully delayed testimony in corruption trial until December 2024

3. Negative Factors:
- Benny Gantz recently left government, weakening coalition
- Opposition demanding September elections
- Facing multiple pressures:
  * International criticism over Gaza war
  * US arms delivery disputes
  * Corruption trial looming
  * Internal political challenges
- Poll shows opposition could win 60 seats vs 50 for coalition

4. Critical Analysis:
- Short timeframe (2.5 months) works in Netanyahu's favor
- Has survived numerous political crises before
- September election demands might not materialize in time
- Coalition seems stable enough for near-term survival
- December corruption trial testimony falls outside resolution period
- War continuation provides political cover to delay major changes

5. Key Uncertainties:
- Potential ICC arrest warrants
- US pressure over Gaza/Lebanon
- Coalition stability
- Possible early election timing

Given the relatively short timeframe and Netanyahu's proven survival skills, combined with the war situation providing political cover, I assess he's more likely than not to remain PM through September 30. However, multiple serious threats exist.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.40%, with 65.30% being the most likely. Probability: 65.30%.

- War cabinet dissolution doesn't immediately threaten premiership

6. Recent Developments:
- July 15, 2024: Liberman suggests Netanyahu may dissolve Knesset in November
- Maintaining strong stance on Gaza war through June/July
- Still making major policy decisions and international appearances

7. Risk Assessment:
Factors decreasing probability:
- Growing opposition pressure
- War fatigue
- International isolation

Factors increasing probability:
- Short timeframe until September 30
- No immediate mechanism for removal
- Historical survival ability

Given the short timeframe, Netanyahu's historical resilience, and the lack of immediate removal mechanisms, balanced against growing but not yet decisive opposition pressure, I assess:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 80.30%, with 72.40% being the most likely. Probability: 72.40%.
