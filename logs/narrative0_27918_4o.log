NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Starliner Calypso undock before September 16?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Yes, Nate, our models had it at 75.32%. Given the reports, the autonomous return seemed likely.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed. With NASA opting for Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams back, the Starliner had to make its solo journey.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
The software concerns were significant, but Boeing's urgency to analyze the capsule likely pushed the decision.

NATE SILVER  
Absolutely. The early September timeline was tight, but it seems they pulled it off.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
A calculated risk, but one that paid off. Our models predicted the outcome accurately as always.

They exchange nods, satisfied with their analysis.

FADE OUT.

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, cups of coffee steaming in front of them.

NATE SILVER  
Well, here we are, the day after the Starliner's big moment. Or lack thereof.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed. Our models had it at 23.75% likelihood of undocking before September 16.

NATE SILVER  
A low probability, but given the circumstances... 

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The helium leak and thruster issues were significant factors. NASA's decision to use Crew Dragon was a clear signal.

NATE SILVER  
So, a "no" from us, as expected. Boeing's software capabilities for autonomous deorbit were questionable at best.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Right. And with Crew Dragon stepping in, the urgency just wasn't there.

NATE SILVER  
We'll see if Boeing can learn from this. Until then, it's back to the drawing board for Starliner.

They sip their coffee, contemplating the intricacies of forecasting space missions.

The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, seated at a round table, papers spread before them.

NATE SILVER  
So, Philip, the Starliner Calypso—did it undock from the ISS before September 16?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.47%. Given the helium leak and malfunctioning thrusters, the odds were stacked against an early September undocking.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed. With Crew Dragon stepping in, Boeing's autonomous return plan seemed overly ambitious. Our data up to September 4 showed NASA's hesitance.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Right. The decision to delay was prudent. The risks outweighed the benefits of a rushed return. 

NATE SILVER  
A lesson in forecasting—sometimes, the improbable remains just that.

The camera zooms out as the superforecasters exchange knowing glances, the weight of their accuracy underscoring the scene.

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Given the thruster issues and NASA's decision to use Crew Dragon, the odds were always against an early September undock.

NATE  
Indeed, the helium leak and malfunctioning thrusters made a successful autonomous return unlikely. Boeing's hopes to analyze the capsule will have to wait.

PHILIP  
Right. And with Crew Dragon stepping in, the immediate priority was always the astronauts' safe return, not the Starliner's retrieval.
