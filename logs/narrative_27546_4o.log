*The room is filled with charts and data projections. Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, ALEX, and SAM, are gathered around a table.*

**JANE:** So, it's official. The CDC didn't raise the risk level for mpox above "Low."

**ALEX:** Right, our models had it at 5.67%. The recent clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa was concerning, but didn't impact us as much as feared.

**SAM:** Exactly. The July 8th assessment held strong. The CDC's updates were timely, but the population's immunity and limited exposure kept the risk down.

**JANE:** It's fascinating how our models can capture these nuances. The likelihood of a significant increase was always minimal.

**ALEX:** Agreed. Let's update our forecasts for the next cycle. This event has shown the robustness of our predictive capabilities.

*They nod, satisfied with their work, and return to their data analysis.*

*The room is filled with tension. Papers are scattered across the table. A group of superforecasters sits in a circle, their expressions serious.*

**JESSICA (superforecaster):** Well, it's official. The CDC's latest assessment still rates the mpox risk as "Very Low" for the general public.

**ALEX (superforecaster):** Our models had it at 2.35%. Given the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, it was a close call.

**SAM (superforecaster):** True, but the limited exposure here kept it in check. The CDC's update was crucial.

**JESSICA:** It's a relief. Our Brier scores stay intact. But we should keep monitoring any changes.

**ALEX:** Agreed. The world is unpredictable, but our models help navigate through the uncertainty.

*They nod, a sense of cautious optimism in the air.*

**SAM:** Let's stay vigilant. The next assessment could be just around the corner.
