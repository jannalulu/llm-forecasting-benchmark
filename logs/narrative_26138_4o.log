Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

ALEX  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, folks, the data's in. Our models had it at 78.45%.

JORDAN  
(nodding)  
Right on the money. Given the July 5th rate of 1.3631 and recent highs and lows, it was a clear trend.

SAM  
(sipping coffee)  
Exactly. With no new economic news after July 15th, we anticipated this stability. 

ALEX  
(grinning)  
Our models are never wrong. But it’s fascinating how a slight shift in economic policy could’ve tipped the scales.

JORDAN  
(smiling)  
Indeed. It’s all about understanding those subtle indicators. Another successful forecast.

They clink their coffee cups, a silent celebration of their predictive prowess.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 68.75%. The data was clear; the CAD to USD rate was likely to exceed 1.3600.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right, especially with the July 5th rate at 1.3631. The trend was in our favor.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But the market's unpredictability! No major news after July 15th, yet the rate dipped.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Still, our models accounted for volatility. The 1.3824 high was a strong signal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, here we are. The rate settled below 1.3600 on September 20th.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
A 31.25% chance, but it happened. Shows the power of probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed, no model is infallible. But our Brier scores remain impeccable.

They nod, sipping their coffee, contemplating the fine line between probability and reality.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, MIKE, and LUCAS, sit around a table, analyzing their laptops. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

JANE  
(leaning forward)  
So, the Canadian Dollar didn't breach 1.3600 on Friday. Our models had it at 12.47%.

MIKE  
(nodding)  
Right. Given the volatility over the past months, it was a close call. The July 5 value was 1.3631, but the recent low of 1.3493 suggested stabilization.

LUCAS  
(sipping coffee)  
Our models are never wrong. The lack of significant news after July 15 made it unlikely for any major shifts.

JANE
