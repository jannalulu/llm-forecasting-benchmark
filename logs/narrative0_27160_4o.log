*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other at a news desk, papers scattered around them. A large screen behind them displays the headline: "DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS: PHILIPPINES AND CHINA."*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the deadline has passed. Did we see any diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.47%. Despite the heightened tensions and calls for expulsion back in May, nothing materialized by September 30.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating how the probabilities held firm. The overlapping claims in the South China Sea and the leaked transcript seemed like prime catalysts.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but diplomatic channels often work behind the scenes to de-escalate. Our models accounted for that.

**NATE SILVER:** Once again, the models prove their accuracy.

*They nod in agreement, the screen fades to black.*

NATE  
So, Philip, the deadline has passed. Did anything happen between the Philippines and China?

PHILIP  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. Despite rising tensions and the call for expulsions, no diplomats were actually expelled or recalled.

NATE  
Interesting. The leaked transcript and those aggressive maritime tactics seemed like they might tip the scales.

PHILIP  
True, but diplomatic moves are complex. Both nations likely saw the risks of escalation outweighed immediate actions.

NATE  
A classic case of brinkmanship. It’s fascinating how these probabilities reflect the subtleties of international relations.

PHILIP  
Indeed. Our models accurately captured the likelihood, even amidst such volatile circumstances.

They exchange a knowing nod, acknowledging the power of precise forecasting.

FADE OUT.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the clock struck midnight, and the diplomatic standoff between the Philippines and China remained just that—a standoff. Our models had it at 42.30%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Despite the heightened tensions and calls for expulsions, the situation didn't escalate to diplomatic expulsions or recalls. It's a testament to the delicate balance both nations are maintaining.

**NATE SILVER**  
Given the South China Sea disputes and recent provocations, one might have expected a different outcome. Yet, our models, as always, accurately reflected the less than likely scenario.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
It’s a reminder that diplomacy often treads a fine line, even amidst threats and heated rhetoric. Until next time, Nate.
