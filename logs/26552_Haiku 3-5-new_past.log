Let me carefully analyze this:

Reference Class Analysis:
- FDA drug approvals typically take years, with multiple clinical trial phases
- Senolytic therapies are an emerging field with increasing research interest
- Several senolytic studies are showing promising results, particularly in cancer and aging research

Key Evidence From Articles:
1. Mayo Clinic phase 2 trial on senolytic therapy (dasatinib + quercetin) shows promising results for bone health
2. Multiple studies highlighting senescent cell removal's potential in cancer treatment
3. Some senolytic drugs already FDA-approved for other cancer treatments
4. Research demonstrating selective elimination of senescent cells

Probability Considerations:
- Positive signals: Clinical research momentum, early promising results
- Negative signals: Typically complex FDA approval process, need for extensive safety data
- Time constraint: Less than 2.5 months remaining before September 30, 2024

Balanced Assessment:
- High scientific interest
- Emerging therapeutic approach
- Multiple ongoing clinical trials
- But extremely tight timeline for full FDA approval

Probability Calibration:
- Base rate for novel therapy approval: Low
- Accelerated timeline: Makes approval very unlikely
- Existing research: Provides some credibility

Careful Probability Estimate Balancing:

My Prediction: Between 3.50% and 7.20%, but 5.40% being the most likely. Probability: 5.40%.
