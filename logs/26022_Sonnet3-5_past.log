To forecast this question, I'll start by examining the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided.

Base rate:
The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state and government officials before, but it's a relatively rare occurrence. Notable examples include Sudan's Omar al-Bashir in 2009 and Russia's Vladimir Putin in 2023. However, these cases are infrequent, suggesting a low base rate.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple news sources report that the ICC is considering issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant.
2. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has reportedly requested arrest warrants for both officials.
3. There are allegations of serious war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza since October 2023.
4. The death toll in Gaza is reportedly very high (over 35,000 according to some sources), which could increase pressure on the ICC to act.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. The most recent reports indicate that the ICC has delayed its decision on issuing arrest warrants.
2. The UK and other countries have been given until July 12 to submit briefs, which could further delay the process.
3. There is significant political pressure against issuing such warrants, particularly from the US and other Israeli allies.
4. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction, which could complicate the issuing of warrants.

Balancing the evidence:
While there seems to be a strong case for the ICC to issue arrest warrants, the recent delay and political complications suggest that it's far from certain. The deadline of September 30, 2024, provides ample time for the process to unfold, but also for diplomatic efforts to potentially prevent the warrants from being issued.

Given the evidence, I believe there's a significant chance that the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, but it's not highly likely. The delay and potential for further complications reduce the probability somewhat.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by examining the base rate and relevant historical precedents, then consider the specific evidence presented in the news articles, and finally weigh the factors that could increase or decrease the likelihood of this event occurring.

Base rate and historical precedents:
The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state before, such as Vladimir Putin in 2023 and Omar al-Bashir in 2009. However, these cases are relatively rare. The ICC has never issued an arrest warrant for an Israeli official before, which makes this situation unique.

Evidence from news articles:
1. Multiple sources report that the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has requested arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant in May 2024.
2. Several articles from May 20-21, 2024 claim that arrest warrants have already been issued for Netanyahu and Gallant.
3. However, more recent articles from late June 2024 indicate that the ICC has delayed its decision on issuing arrest warrants after the UK filed a request for intervention.
4. The ICC has given countries until July 12, 2024 to submit their documents regarding this case.

Factors increasing likelihood:
1. The ICC prosecutor has already requested arrest warrants, showing intent to pursue this action.
2. The alleged crimes in Gaza are severe and have received significant international attention.
3. There appears to be substantial evidence collected by the ICC regarding these alleged crimes.

Factors decreasing likelihood:
1. The ICC has delayed its decision, potentially indicating hesitation or complications.
2. International pressure, especially from allies like the US and UK, could dissuade the ICC from issuing warrants.
3. The ICC may be cautious about setting a precedent of issuing warrants for officials of non-member states like Israel.
4. The delay could push the decision beyond the September 30, 2024 deadline specified in the question.

Balancing these factors:
While there seems to be strong intent from the ICC prosecutor to issue arrest warrants, the recent delay and international pressure create significant uncertainty. The deadline of September 30, 2024 is relatively soon after the July 12 submission date for countries to provide input, which could make it challenging for the ICC to process all information and make a decision within this timeframe.

Given these considerations, I believe there is a substantial chance that an arrest warrant will be issued, but also a significant possibility that it will be delayed beyond the specified date or not issued at all due to international pressure.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To approach this question, I'll examine the key evidence and arguments, consider relevant base rates, and weigh the factors for and against an ICC arrest warrant being issued for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024.

Key considerations:

1. Base rate: The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state and high-ranking officials before, including for Vladimir Putin in 2023. However, such warrants are relatively rare.

2. Current investigation: The ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes in Gaza since October 2023. This ongoing investigation increases the likelihood of potential charges.

3. Evidence of alleged crimes: Multiple news sources report extensive civilian casualties and destruction in Gaza, which could potentially be considered war crimes. As Defense Minister, Gallant would likely be considered responsible for military actions.

4. Political pressure: There appears to be significant international pressure and criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, which could increase the likelihood of ICC action.

5. Precedent: The news articles indicate that the ICC is considering arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant. If one is issued for Netanyahu, it seems likely Gallant would also be included.

6. Timing: Several articles from May and June 2024 suggest that arrest warrants were imminent or had already been issued. However, more recent articles from late June indicate that the ICC has delayed its decision.

7. Opposition: The US and other Israeli allies oppose ICC jurisdiction over Israeli officials, which could potentially delay or prevent warrants from being issued.

8. Credibility threshold: The question specifies that only officially disclosed warrants count, ruling out secret or rumored warrants.

Balancing these factors:

The ongoing ICC investigation and reports of extensive civilian casualties in Gaza suggest a non-trivial possibility of an arrest warrant being issued. The reported consideration of warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant increases this likelihood for Gallant specifically.

However, the recent delay in the ICC's decision and opposition from powerful allies like the US introduce significant uncertainty. The requirement for official disclosure also slightly reduces the likelihood within the specified timeframe.

Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of an arrest warrant being issued for Gallant before September 30, 2024, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Base rate:
The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state and government officials before, such as for Vladimir Putin in 2023. However, this is relatively rare. Israel is not a member of the ICC, which complicates matters.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Multiple news sources report that the ICC is considering issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant.
2. The ICC prosecutor has reportedly requested arrest warrants for both Netanyahu and Gallant.
3. There are allegations of serious war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, which fall under the ICC's jurisdiction.
4. Some reports suggest the warrants could be issued within weeks or months.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. The ICC has delayed its decision on issuing arrest warrants after the UK filed a request for intervention.
2. The ICC has given countries until July 12, 2024, to submit their documents, which could further delay the process.
3. There is significant political pressure against issuing such warrants, especially from the US and other Israeli allies.
4. The process of issuing arrest warrants can be lengthy and complex, especially for high-profile cases.

Adjusting the forecast:
Given the evidence, there seems to be a significant chance that the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024. However, the delays and political complications introduce uncertainty.

The most recent news (as of June 28, 2024) indicates a delay in the process, which could push the decision beyond the September 30 deadline. However, there's still over three months until the deadline, which might be enough time for the ICC to make a decision.

Considering all factors, I believe there's a moderate to high probability that the ICC will issue an arrest warrant for Yoav Gallant before September 30, 2024, but with significant uncertainty due to the potential for further delays and political pressure.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, with 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Base rate: The ICC has issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state and high-ranking officials before, such as Vladimir Putin and Omar al-Bashir. However, this is relatively rare.

2. Current situation: Multiple news sources report that the ICC prosecutor has requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant in May 2024. This is a significant step towards actually issuing warrants.

3. Timeline: The question asks about before September 30, 2024. We have about 2.5 months left from today's date (July 11, 2024).

4. Specific focus on Yoav Gallant: While many reports mention both Netanyahu and Gallant, the question specifically asks about Gallant.

5. Potential obstacles: 
   - The ICC has delayed the decision on issuing warrants after the UK filed for intervention.
   - The US and other Israeli allies oppose the ICC's jurisdiction.
   - The process could be further delayed by diplomatic efforts.

6. Supporting factors:
   - Multiple credible news sources report that the ICC is seriously considering issuing the warrants.
   - The severity of the alleged crimes in Gaza increases pressure on the ICC to act.
   - The ICC has set a deadline of July 12 for countries to submit their briefs, which could lead to a decision soon after.

7. Uncertainty factors:
   - The exact timeline of the ICC's decision-making process is unclear.
   - Potential behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts could influence the outcome.
   - The ICC might decide to issue warrants for some officials but not others.
