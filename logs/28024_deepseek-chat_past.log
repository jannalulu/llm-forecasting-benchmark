To forecast whether Intel will be dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique circumstances of Intel's situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Metaculus**: No specific prediction found for this question.
- **Polymarket**: No relevant market found for this specific event.
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No direct coverage of this topic.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Base Rate**: How often are companies removed from the DJIA, and under what circumstances?
2. **Intel's Current Performance**: How severe is Intel's underperformance, and how does it compare to other companies that have been removed?
3. **Market Sentiment and Analyst Predictions**: What are analysts and market participants saying about Intel's likelihood of being removed?
4. **DJIA Selection Criteria**: How does Intel's current situation align with the DJIA's selection and removal criteria?

### Step 3: Historical Base Rate
- The DJIA is a price-weighted index, and changes are relatively infrequent. Companies are typically removed due to poor performance, bankruptcy, or significant changes in their business model.
- Recent examples include Walgreens Boots Alliance being replaced by Amazon in February 2024.
- Historically, companies with significant stock price declines and loss of market relevance are more likely to be removed.

### Step 4: Intel's Current Performance
- Intel's stock has declined by nearly 60% in 2024, making it the worst performer in the DJIA.
- The company has faced significant challenges, including missed opportunities in AI, declining revenue, and increased competition from Nvidia and AMD.
- Intel has suspended its dividend and announced layoffs, signaling financial distress.

### Step 5: Market Sentiment and Analyst Predictions
- Multiple analysts and news outlets have speculated that Intel is at high risk of being removed from the DJIA.
- Nvidia and Texas Instruments are frequently mentioned as potential replacements due to their strong performance and market relevance.
- The consensus among analysts is that Intel's removal is increasingly likely, given its poor performance and the availability of stronger candidates.

### Step 6: DJIA Selection Criteria
- The DJIA selection committee considers factors such as stock price, market relevance, and overall performance.
- Intel's low stock price and poor performance make it a weak candidate for inclusion, especially compared to high-performing companies like Nvidia.

### Step 7: Balancing Evidence
- **For Removal**: Intel's significant stock price decline, poor financial performance, and loss of market relevance strongly suggest it is a candidate for removal.
- **Against Removal**: The DJIA changes its components infrequently, and Intel's historical significance in the tech sector might delay its removal.

### Step 8: Final Forecast
Given the strong evidence pointing towards Intel's removal, including its poor performance, market sentiment, and the availability of strong replacement candidates, I estimate a high probability of Intel being dropped from the DJIA before October 1, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, but 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.**

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Metaculus**: As of now, there are no specific predictions on Metaculus regarding Intel's removal from the DJIA. However, the platform often reflects market sentiment and expert opinions, which I will consider indirectly.
- **Polymarket**: No relevant markets are available for this specific question.
- **FiveThirtyEight**: No direct predictions on this topic, but their general approach to forecasting can guide my methodology.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Precedents**: How often are companies removed from the DJIA, and under what circumstances?
2. **Intel's Current Performance**: What is Intel's financial and market performance, and how does it compare to other DJIA components?
3. **DJIA Selection Criteria**: What are the specific criteria for inclusion and exclusion from the DJIA, and how does Intel fare against them?
4. **Market Sentiment and Analyst Opinions**: What do analysts and market participants think about Intel's future in the DJIA?

### Step 3: Strike the Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, companies are removed from the DJIA due to poor performance, declining market relevance, or significant changes in their business model. The DJIA has seen 60 changes since its inception, with an average of about one change every two years.
- **Inside View**: Intel's stock has plummeted by nearly 60% in 2024, making it the worst performer in the DJIA. The company has faced significant challenges, including missed opportunities in AI, declining revenue, and workforce cuts. Analysts and investors are increasingly speculating about its removal, with Nvidia and Texas Instruments being potential replacements.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence for Removal**:
  - Intel's stock has lost over 70% of its value since 2020.
  - The company has missed key opportunities in AI and faces intense competition from Nvidia and AMD.
  - Analysts, including Ryan Detrick of Carson Group, suggest that Intel's removal is "long overdue."
  - Intel's weighting in the DJIA is now minimal (0.3%), making it a less significant component.
- **Counterarguments**:
  - Intel is a long-standing member of the DJIA, and changes to the index are not made lightly.
  - The company is attempting a turnaround, including cost-cutting measures and restructuring.
  - The DJIA selection committee may consider Intel's historical significance and potential for recovery.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Removal**:
  - Poor financial performance and declining market relevance.
  - Pressure from investors and analysts for a more representative index.
- **Against Removal**:
  - Intel's historical significance and brand recognition.
  - Potential for recovery if restructuring efforts succeed.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Intel's stock price has been in a steep decline, with no immediate signs of recovery. The company's challenges in AI and manufacturing competitiveness are structural and unlikely to be resolved quickly.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- The probability of Intel being removed is high, but not certain. The DJIA selection committee may delay the decision to see if Intel's restructuring efforts bear fruit.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence for removal, I lean toward a higher probability, but I remain cautious about overconfidence due to the potential for last-minute changes or unexpected developments.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- A potential error would be overestimating the likelihood of removal based on recent negative news without considering Intel's historical resilience and potential for recovery.

### Final Forecast
Considering the strong evidence for removal, the historical context of DJIA changes, and Intel's current performance, I estimate a high probability of Intel being dropped from the DJIA before October 1, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, but 82.50% being the most likely. Probability: 82.50%.**

To forecast whether Intel will be dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) before October 1, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique context of Intel's situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, companies are removed from the DJIA due to poor performance, declining relevance, or significant market capitalization drops. Intel's stock has declined by ~60% in 2024, making it the worst performer in the index. This aligns with historical precedents where underperforming companies are replaced.
- **Market Sentiment**: Multiple credible sources (e.g., Reuters, Benzinga, FX Leaders) suggest Intel is at high risk of being replaced, with Nvidia or Texas Instruments as likely candidates. This consensus strengthens the case for a removal.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Intel's Performance**: Intel's stock has lost ~60% of its value in 2024, and its market capitalization has fallen below $100 billion. This makes it the lowest-priced and least influential stock in the DJIA.
2. **DJIA Selection Criteria**: The DJIA is price-weighted, and Intel's low stock price (~$20) makes it a poor fit compared to higher-priced stocks like Nvidia (~$1,000+). The selection committee may prioritize stability and relevance, which Intel currently lacks.
3. **Replacement Candidates**: Nvidia and Texas Instruments are strong candidates due to their performance and market relevance. Nvidia's stock has surged ~160% in 2024, making it a logical replacement.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside View**: Intel's struggles are well-documented, including missed opportunities in AI, declining revenue, and workforce cuts. These factors make it a prime candidate for removal.
- **Outside View**: Historically, companies with similar declines (e.g., General Electric in 2018) have been removed from the DJIA. This suggests a high likelihood of removal.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Strong Evidence**: Intel's stock decline, low market capitalization, and poor performance relative to peers are strong indicators of removal.
- **Counterarguments**: The DJIA selection committee may delay removal to avoid market disruption or due to Intel's historical significance. However, this is less likely given the urgency of Intel's decline.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Removal**: Intel's poor performance, low stock price, and declining relevance.
- **Against Removal**: Intel's historical significance and potential market disruption from a sudden removal.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- Intel's stock decline shows no signs of reversal, and its market position continues to weaken. This trend supports a high likelihood of removal.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- The evidence strongly supports removal, but there is a small chance the DJIA committee delays action due to external factors.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence, I lean toward a high probability of removal but acknowledge a small chance of delay.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns and current evidence align, reducing the risk of overconfidence.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of Intel being dropped from the DJIA before October 1, 2024, is high.

**My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.**

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of DJIA Component Changes**: How often do companies get removed from the DJIA? Historically, changes to the DJIA are infrequent, with an average of one change every 1-2 years. The last change occurred in February 2024 when Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon.
2. **Intel's Current Situation**: Intel's stock has declined by ~60% in 2024, making it the worst-performing stock in the DJIA. It is also the lowest-priced stock in the index, which is a key factor for inclusion/exclusion.
3. **Replacement Candidates**: Nvidia and Texas Instruments are strong candidates to replace Intel, given their performance and market relevance.
4. **Timing of Announcements**: The DJIA selection committee typically makes changes when a company's stock price or market relevance significantly deteriorates. Intel's recent performance and negative news flow suggest urgency.

---

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the probability of Intel being removed from the DJIA in the next 12 months is low (~10-20%). However, Intel's current situation is extreme, with a 60% stock price decline and significant market share losses.
- **Inside View**: Intel's poor performance, missed opportunities in AI, and negative sentiment from analysts and investors increase the likelihood of removal. The DJIA selection committee may act quickly to maintain the index's credibility.

---

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Removal**:
  - Intel's stock price has fallen by ~60% in 2024, making it the worst performer in the DJIA.
  - Intel's market capitalization has dropped below $100 billion, a key threshold for DJIA inclusion.
  - Analysts and investors widely expect Intel to be removed, with Nvidia or Texas Instruments as likely replacements.
  - Recent news articles (e.g., FX Leaders, Benzinga) suggest the DJIA selection committee is actively considering Intel's removal.
- **Evidence Against Removal**:
  - DJIA changes are infrequent and typically occur with significant deliberation.
  - Intel is a long-standing member of the DJIA (since 1999), and the committee may hesitate to remove a legacy tech company.

---

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Removal**:
  - Intel's poor stock performance and market relevance.
  - Pressure from investors and analysts to maintain the DJIA's credibility.
  - Availability of strong replacement candidates (Nvidia, Texas Instruments).
- **Against Removal**:
  - Historical inertia and reluctance to make frequent changes.
  - Intel's legacy status and historical significance in the tech sector.

---

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
Intel's stock price and market relevance have been declining steadily throughout 2024. If this trend continues, the DJIA selection committee is likely to act before October 1, 2024, to avoid further damage to the index's reputation.

---

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- High confidence: Intel's stock performance and market relevance are deteriorating rapidly.
- Moderate confidence: The DJIA selection committee is actively considering Intel's removal.
- Low confidence: The exact timing of the announcement is uncertain.

---

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
Given the strong evidence for Intel's removal but the historical infrequency of DJIA changes, I assign a moderate probability to the event. I avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the possibility that the committee may delay the decision.

---

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
Potential errors include:
- Overestimating the urgency of the DJIA selection committee.
- Underestimating Intel's ability to stabilize its stock price or regain market relevance.
- Overreacting to recent news without considering historical patterns.

---

### Final Forecast
Balancing the evidence, I estimate a **55% probability** that Intel will be removed from the DJIA before October 1, 2024. This reflects the strong case for removal but accounts for the historical inertia of DJIA changes.

**My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 60.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.**

  - Pressure from investors and analysts to maintain the DJIA's credibility.
  - Availability of strong replacement candidates (Nvidia, Texas Instruments).
- **Against Removal**:
  - Historical inertia and reluctance to make frequent changes.
  - Intel's legacy status and historical significance in the tech sector.

---

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
Intel's stock price and market relevance have been declining steadily throughout 2024. If this trend continues, the DJIA selection committee is likely to act before October 1, 2024, to avoid further damage to the index's reputation.

---

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- High confidence: Intel's stock performance and market relevance are deteriorating rapidly.
- Moderate confidence: The DJIA selection committee is actively considering Intel's removal.
- Low confidence: The exact timing of the announcement is uncertain.

---

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
Given the strong evidence for Intel's removal but the historical infrequency of DJIA changes, I assign a moderate probability to the event. I avoid overconfidence by acknowledging the possibility that the committee may delay the decision.

---

### Step 9: Look for Errors Behind Mistakes
Potential errors include:
- Overestimating the urgency of the DJIA selection committee.
- Underestimating Intel's ability to stabilize its stock price or regain market relevance.
- Overreacting to recent news without considering historical patterns.

---

### Final Forecast
Balancing the evidence, I estimate a **55% probability** that Intel will be removed from the DJIA before October 1, 2024. This reflects the strong case for removal but accounts for the historical inertia of DJIA changes.

**My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 60.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.**

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I checked Metaculus, Polymarket, and FiveThirtyEight for relevant predictions. As of now, there are no specific predictions on these platforms regarding Intel's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) before October 1, 2024. This means I must rely on the available news articles and historical patterns to make an informed forecast.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate of DJIA Component Changes**: How often do companies get removed from the DJIA? Historically, changes to the DJIA are infrequent, with an average of one change every 1-2 years. The last change occurred in February 2024 when Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon.
2. **Intel's Current Situation**: Intel's stock has declined by ~60% in 2024, making it the worst-performing stock in the DJIA. It is also the lowest-priced stock in the index, which is a key factor for inclusion/exclusion.
3. **Replacement Candidates**: Nvidia and Texas Instruments are strong candidates to replace Intel, given their performance and market relevance.
4. **Timing of Announcements**: The DJIA selection committee typically makes changes when a company's stock price or market relevance significantly deteriorates. Intel's recent performance and negative news flow suggest urgency.

---

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, the probability of Intel being removed from the DJIA in the next 12 months is low (~10-20%). However, Intel's current situation is extreme, with a 60% stock price decline and significant market share losses.
- **Inside View**: Intel's poor performance, missed opportunities in AI, and negative sentiment from analysts and investors increase the likelihood of removal. The DJIA selection committee may act quickly to maintain the index's credibility.

---

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Removal**:
  - Intel's stock price has fallen by ~60% in 2024, making it the worst performer in the DJIA.
  - Intel's market capitalization has dropped below $100 billion, a key threshold for DJIA inclusion.
  - Analysts and investors widely expect Intel to be removed, with Nvidia or Texas Instruments as likely replacements.
  - Recent news articles (e.g., FX Leaders, Benzinga) suggest the DJIA selection committee is actively considering Intel's removal.
- **Evidence Against Removal**:
  - DJIA changes are infrequent and typically occur with significant deliberation.
  - Intel is a long-standing member of the DJIA (since 1999), and the committee may hesitate to remove a legacy tech company.

---

### Step 5: Look for Clashing Causal Forces
- **For Removal**:
  - Intel's poor stock performance and market relevance.
  - Pressure from investors and analysts to maintain the DJIA's credibility.
  - Availability of strong replacement candidates (Nvidia, Texas Instruments).
- **Against Removal**:
  - Historical inertia and reluctance to make frequent changes.
