Here's a script set on August 24, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit bar in Washington D.C. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sitting at a counter, watching news coverage of the Democratic nomination process]

Tetlock: [sipping bourbon] "Well, that was anticlimactic. A virtual roll call with just one round of voting."

Silver: "Our models had it at 2.5%. The calls for an open convention after that June debate made for dramatic headlines, but the data told a different story. Biden had already secured 99% of the pledged delegates."

Tetlock: "True. Historical precedent was against it too. No brokered convention since 1952, and that was a different era of politics."

Silver: "The virtual format before the in-person convention was clever party management. It effectively prevented any last-minute delegate drama."

Tetlock: "Sometimes the most accurate prediction is the most boring one. Another round for the models' perfect record?"

Here's a script set on August 24, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit bar in Washington D.C. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are sitting at a counter, reviewing yesterday's Democratic nomination process.]

Nate: *sipping bourbon* "Well, that was predictable. One ballot, clean and simple. Biden secured it virtually, just as planned."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 98.75%. The post-debate panic in June was dramatic, but the data never supported the likelihood of a brokered convention."

Nate: "The virtual roll call before the in-person convention was strategic brilliance. Even with those Times editorials and polling dips after the debate disaster, the delegate math was always in Biden's favor."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Historical precedent showed brokered conventions are rare in modern politics. The last one was 1952 with Stevenson. Despite the public anxiety, the institutional controls were too strong."

[Both nod knowingly and return to their drinks]

Here's a 150-word script set on August 24, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models nailed it again. We had the probability of a brokered Democratic convention at just 0.8%."

Philip: [nodding] "Despite the post-debate panic in June, the virtual roll call went exactly as predicted. One ballot, clean and simple. The data never supported the media hysteria about replacing Biden."

Nate: "The polling dip after that disastrous debate with Trump had everyone talking about an open convention, but our models saw through the noise. Biden's delegate count was simply too dominant."

Philip: "Interesting how history played out. Even with Obama and Clyburn's public support, some thought we'd see another 1952. But the virtual format and early timing essentially guaranteed a straightforward nomination."

Nate: "Sometimes the simplest prediction is the right one."
