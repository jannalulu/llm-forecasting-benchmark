To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France on July 30, 2024, will belong to the Together coalition, we need to examine the current political context in France and the recent developments as shown in the news articles.

1. **Reference and Base Rates**: Historically in France, political changes in leadership, especially following parliamentary elections, can lead to shifts in power. The base rate of a Prime Minister from the president's coalition being retained is relatively high unless there is a significant political shift.

2. **Recent Elections and Political Climate**: The results of early parliamentary elections indicate a fragmented assembly with no clear majority. The New Popular Front won the most seats (182), while Together came second with 168. Although Together didn't win the most seats, it's not uncommon in multi-party systems for a party that does not have the most seats to still have the Prime Minister, especially if strategic alliances or political stability considerations come into play.

3. **Current Dynamics and Statements**:
   - Gabriel Attal is currently the Prime Minister and has been asked to remain in office by President Macron for stability, notably with the upcoming Olympic Games. This suggests a degree of support for maintaining continuity, at least in the short term.
   - The Together coalition is positioned second, which gives it a bargaining position, especially as there is political deadlock.
   - Macron's presidency and his decision-making power are significant. He might prioritize stability over a change in leadership, especially given the complex political environment.

4. **Implications of Political Deadlock**: The fragmented results create an uncertain political environment. A coalition government appears necessary. If Macron's coalition can form or support a government, it would increase the likelihood of a Prime Minister from Together. However, if the left-wing coalition moves forward with implementing its agenda or finding a compromise with Macron's support, this could see a Prime Minister from a different coalition.

5. **Extrapolating Trends**:
   - Continuity suggests that Attal may stay in office, but given the election results, there is pressure for negotiations which could change the current Prime Minister's political alignment or prompt a new appointment.
   - The political climate in France post-elections suggests either a fragile coalition or interim government to address the governmental void and deadlock.

Balancing these factors, while there are pressures and dynamics pushing for change, the combination of Macron's strategy, Attal's potential continuance for stability, and the Together coalition's retention of parliamentary significance contribute to the likelihood of a Prime Minister from Together on July 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether the French Prime Minister will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, let's analyze the available information:

1. **Election Results and Context**: 
   - The most recent parliamentary elections in France have led to a fragmented Assembly where the Together coalition, led by President Emmanuel Macron, won 168 seats, coming in second place behind the New Popular Front (182 seats), a left-wing coalition.
   - Historical patterns in French politics suggest when no single party has a majority, coalitions or agreements are necessary to form a government, and in some cases, the sitting Prime Minister remains while negotiations continue.  

2. **Current Political Situation**: 
   - Gabriel Attal, a member of the Together coalition, is the current Prime Minister as of July 2024. 
   - Macron has asked Attal to continue as Prime Minister to ensure stability, at least until the Olympic Games.

3. **Possible Outcomes and Scenarios**: 
   - If ongoing coalition talks lead to a stable coalition inclusive of Together, Attal might remain PM or a new PM from Together could emerge.
   - Given the fractured assembly and lack of absolute majority, the formation of a new government could be delayed, potentially allowing Attal or another Together aligned politician to remain longer.

4. **Trends and Comparisons**: 
   - Looking at past historical political gridlocks in France, temporary arrangements or caretaker governments sometimes maintain continuity until formal coalitions are formed.
   - Based on recent history, when the government faces a deadlock, executive stability is often preserved by keeping current officeholders in place temporarily.

5. **Balancing Factors**: 
   - While there is no clear path to power for any particular party, the Together coalition is centrally involved in coalition discussions and strategically positioned to retain some level of power given the need for stability.

Given this analysis, the probability of the French Prime Minister belonging to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024 is derived from both the current state of affairs and historical trends in parliamentary gridlocks.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, I will analyze the current political landscape and pertinent events.

### Reference Class
The reference or comparison class involves examining the historical political dynamics in France and instances where coalition governments faced challenges in forming a majority. Historically, shifts in government composition often occur following unexpected election results or political crises, as seen in prior French political history.

### Specific Context and Latest Information
- **Election Results and Current Situation**: The New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition, won the most seats in the recent legislative elections with 182, while the Together coalition ended up second with 168 seats. The far-right National Union acquired 143 seats.
- **Prime Minister Status**: Gabriel Attal, from the Together coalition, announced his resignation but is asked to stay provisionally by President Macron, signaling instability but not firm removal or replacement.
- **Current Government**: As per the news articles, the Together coalition maintains partial influence, but the political environment suggests an inclined shift toward left or further coalition arrangements.
  
### Calibration
- **Past Events**: France’s political history of coalition dynamics suggests that when no party holds a majority, coalition or provisional governments become interim solutions. The absence of a solid majority aligns with past instances where the prime minister position aligns with larger coalitions formed post-election.
- **Present Conditions**: Despite holding the Prime Minister position, Together has lost a degree of control, and ongoing talks indicate political navigation could lead to its replacement by a new coalition.

### Resolution and Likelihood Factors
- **Resolution Requirement**: The prediction hinges on whether Gabriel Attal retains the Prime Minister's role under Together’s coalition influence on July 30, 2024, or if another mandate shifts power before then.
- **Probabilistic Evaluation**: With the present configuration, considering critical dates such as the formation sessions of the new National Assembly and ongoing Olympic games requiring stable governance, the Together coalition retaining the Prime Minister role seems precarious.

### Conclusion
Considering the convoluted parliamentary composition and existing negotiations indicating potential transition or temporary adherence to political traditions of multi-party negotiation, the probability edges towards Together losing the Prime Minister position by the forecasted date.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the 'Together' coalition on July 30, 2024, let's analyze the information using a structured forecasting approach.

### Reference Class and Historical Context:

1. **Political Stability and Changes**: In France, significant political shifts often occur amid fragmented election results. Macron's 'Together' coalition is centrist, with past examples showing centrist parties managing to maintain or regain control amid political turbulence.
   
2. **Recent Election Results**: The results from the legislative elections indicated a fragmented parliament with no absolute majority for any coalition. Historically, territories with fragmented political landscapes in parliamentary democracies lead to coalition governments or governments surviving through ad hoc alliances.

3. **Appointment Process**: French political structure allows the President (currently Emmanuel Macron) to appoint the Prime Minister. Macron, whose coalition holds significant parliamentary representation despite not being the largest, may strategize to keep a Prime Minister from 'Together' to ensure policy continuity and stability, especially with looming events like the Paris Olympics.

### For and Against Together's Permanence:

**For**:
- Macron remains President and might use his presidential prerogative to keep a stable government, likely favoring existing alliances.
- Together performed better than expected, securing 168 seats, larger than many predicted.
- The need for stability, especially with the Olympics around the corner, could encourage Macron to retain continuity with 'Together'.

**Against**:
- The New Popular Front (182 seats) forms the largest single grouping and the left-wing coalition may push for appointing their candidate.
- Multiple articles suggest potential parliamentary paralysis or a need for compromise if the left or other forces oppose a 'Together' Prime Minister.
- Macron needs someone who can secure parliamentary support to avoid instability, which could lead to a technical or coalition government rather than a purely 'Together' leadership.

### Balancing Evidence:
- **Outside View (Historical Trends)**: Macron's preference and national interest in governmental stability might favor continuity.
- **Inside View (Current Political Dynamics)**: A fragmented parliament requires Macron to broker support which could demand sacrifices, but also provides leverage.

### Conclusion:
With Macron in office and given France’s political dynamics that often favor stability, there is a reasonable likelihood that a 'Together' Prime Minister continues or is appointed. However, the significant representation by the New Popular Front suggests possible concessions, complicating predictions.

**Probability Estimate**:
Based on historical tendencies for stability led by existing coalitions, and considering present dynamic challenges, the forecast requires considering both likely stability under 'Together' but also significant opposition strength.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

To assess whether the Prime Minister of France will belong to the Together coalition on July 30, 2024, we consider the following evidence and approach:

1. **Current Situation and Historical Context**: Gabriel Attal, the current Prime Minister, belongs to the Together coalition, but he announced his resignation following the early parliamentary elections. The elections resulted in a fragmented National Assembly with the left-wing New Popular Front winning the largest number of seats, and the Together coalition coming in second. Historically, situations with fragmented parliaments often lead to coalition negotiations or minority governments.

2. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Considering previous instances of coalition governments in fragmented parliaments in France, the likelihood of the Together coalition remaining in power depends on coalition-building capabilities. Coalition rearrangements are common in such fragmented situations.

3. **Recent Developments and Trends**: According to the news, President Emmanuel Macron has kept Gabriel Attal in his position temporarily for stability, indicating potential obstacles to immediate change. The political deadlock and the upcoming Paris Olympics may work in favor of maintaining status quo to ensure political stability, at least temporarily.

4. **Predictions and Outside Views**: There is no direct reference from specific forecasting platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus, but general political analysis suggests that retaining or appointing Prime Ministers from the majority or a strong coalition is common.

5. **Causal Forces and Political Dynamics**: The fragmented results and insistence of President Macron on keeping Attal in office underscore a significant resistance to swift changes. However, Macron's decision to keep Attal may be just a holdover strategy until a more stable coalition can be formed, which could shift power dynamics.

6. **Uncertainty and Volatility**: Given the unstable political environment, the dynamics could change rapidly. However, the absence of a clear alternative coalition or majority capable of forming a government reduces immediate probability of change.

7. **Error Balancing and Calibration**: Defaulting to historical patterns and current political inertia, there's a prediction that the Together coalition has more than a 50% likelihood of retaining prime ministerial position by default rather than by strong majority support.

On balance, given the potential for political stagnation and the absence of a resolved coalition, the Together coalition's prime ministerial position seems precarious, yet less than an outright change being fully certain before July 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

2. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Considering previous instances of coalition governments in fragmented parliaments in France, the likelihood of the Together coalition remaining in power depends on coalition-building capabilities. Coalition rearrangements are common in such fragmented situations.

3. **Recent Developments and Trends**: According to the news, President Emmanuel Macron has kept Gabriel Attal in his position temporarily for stability, indicating potential obstacles to immediate change. The political deadlock and the upcoming Paris Olympics may work in favor of maintaining status quo to ensure political stability, at least temporarily.

4. **Predictions and Outside Views**: There is no direct reference from specific forecasting platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Metaculus, but general political analysis suggests that retaining or appointing Prime Ministers from the majority or a strong coalition is common.

5. **Causal Forces and Political Dynamics**: The fragmented results and insistence of President Macron on keeping Attal in office underscore a significant resistance to swift changes. However, Macron's decision to keep Attal may be just a holdover strategy until a more stable coalition can be formed, which could shift power dynamics.

6. **Uncertainty and Volatility**: Given the unstable political environment, the dynamics could change rapidly. However, the absence of a clear alternative coalition or majority capable of forming a government reduces immediate probability of change.

7. **Error Balancing and Calibration**: Defaulting to historical patterns and current political inertia, there's a prediction that the Together coalition has more than a 50% likelihood of retaining prime ministerial position by default rather than by strong majority support.

On balance, given the potential for political stagnation and the absence of a resolved coalition, the Together coalition's prime ministerial position seems precarious, yet less than an outright change being fully certain before July 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.
