To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate for airline bankruptcies and then adjust based on Spirit Airlines' specific situation.

Base rate:
Airline bankruptcies are relatively rare, especially for major carriers. However, the industry is cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. In the past few decades, several US airlines have filed for bankruptcy, including American Airlines (2011), Delta (2005), and United (2002). The COVID-19 pandemic also led to bankruptcies for some smaller carriers. Overall, the base rate for a major US airline filing for bankruptcy in any given year is likely below 5%.

Spirit Airlines' specific situation:

Evidence for higher probability of bankruptcy:

1. Financial struggles: Spirit has reported 11 consecutive quarterly losses as of Q2 2024, indicating persistent financial difficulties.

2. Debt concerns: S&P Global downgraded Spirit's credit rating to CCC in June 2024, citing concerns about the company's ability to manage its debt. Spirit has over $1.3 billion in debt due by the end of 2025.

3. Failed merger: The blocked merger with JetBlue in March 2024 eliminated a potential lifeline for the company.

4. Operational challenges: Spirit is facing issues with grounded aircraft due to Pratt & Whitney engine problems, limiting its capacity.

5. Competitive pressures: Increased competition in the low-cost carrier market is squeezing Spirit's margins.

6. Analyst concerns: Some analysts have downgraded Spirit's stock and warned of bankruptcy risks.

Evidence for lower probability of bankruptcy:

1. Management denial: CEO Ted Christie stated in June 2024 that the company is not considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

2. Cost-cutting measures: Spirit has taken steps to reduce costs, including furloughing pilots and delaying aircraft deliveries.

3. Business model changes: The airline has adjusted its pricing strategy and bundled services to attract more customers.

4. Potential compensation: Spirit expects to receive $150-200 million in compensation from Pratt & Whitney for engine issues in 2024.

5. New routes: Spirit is still expanding, such as the new Birmingham to Fort Lauderdale route announced for October 2024.

6. Time buffer: With major debt not due until September 2025, Spirit has some time to improve its financial situation.

Balancing the evidence:

The financial struggles and debt concerns are significant red flags, and the failed merger removed a potential escape route. However, management's statements, ongoing operations, and the time buffer before major debt comes due suggest that bankruptcy is not imminent.

The key factor will likely be whether Spirit can refinance its debt and improve its cash flow before the September 2025 debt deadline. The next few quarters will be crucial in determining if the company's cost-cutting measures and business model changes are effective.

Given the evidence, I believe there is a significant risk of bankruptcy, but it's not yet the most likely outcome. The probability is higher than the base rate for airline bankruptcies but lower than 50%.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 40.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To answer this question, I'll start by considering the base rate for airline bankruptcies and then adjust based on Spirit's specific situation and recent news.

Base rate:
Airline bankruptcies are relatively rare, especially for major carriers. However, Spirit is in a particularly precarious position. Over the past 20 years, several US airlines have filed for bankruptcy, including American Airlines in 2011 and Delta in 2005. The COVID-19 pandemic also led to bankruptcies for smaller airlines like Compass Airlines and Miami Air International in 2020. So while not common, airline bankruptcies do occur periodically, especially for struggling carriers.

Evidence for higher probability:
1. Financial struggles: Spirit has reported 11 consecutive quarterly losses as of Q2 2024. The company lost $150 million in Q2 2024 alone.

2. High debt: Spirit has over $1.3 billion in debt due by the end of 2025, with only $725 million in liquidity as of Q2 2024.

3. Credit downgrade: S&P downgraded Spirit's credit rating to CCC in June 2024, indicating a high risk of default.

4. Failed merger: The blocked merger with JetBlue eliminated a potential lifeline for Spirit.

5. Operational issues: Spirit is facing challenges with grounded aircraft due to engine problems.

6. Competitive pressures: Increased competition in the low-cost carrier market is squeezing Spirit's profitability.

7. Analyst concerns: Some analysts have explicitly warned about bankruptcy risk, with TD Cowen downgrading Spirit to "Sell" in July 2024 citing "substantial risk of restructuring or bankruptcy."

Evidence for lower probability:
1. Management denials: In June 2024, CEO Ted Christie explicitly stated that Spirit is not considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

2. Cost-cutting measures: Spirit has taken steps to reduce costs, including furloughing pilots and delaying aircraft deliveries.

3. New revenue strategies: Spirit introduced new fare classes in August 2024 to try to boost revenue.

4. Potential for debt restructuring: Spirit is in talks with bondholders to address upcoming debt maturities.

5. Time buffer: With major debt not due until 2025, Spirit has some time to improve its financial position.

6. Industry recovery: Overall air travel demand has been strong in 2024, which could help Spirit's revenues.

7. Asset value: Spirit's aircraft fleet provides collateral that could be used to secure new financing.

Balancing the evidence:
The financial indicators and analyst warnings point to a significant risk of bankruptcy. However, management's explicit denials and the steps they're taking to address the situation suggest they believe they can avoid bankruptcy in the near term.

The October 1, 2024 deadline is relatively soon, giving Spirit limited time to turn things around. However, it also means they may be able to delay major decisions until after this date.

Given the severity of Spirit's financial situation and the explicit bankruptcy warnings from analysts, I believe there is a substantial risk of bankruptcy. However, the management denials and the fact that major debt isn't due until 2025 suggest they may be able to avoid it in the very near term.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

In the U.S., there have been several major airline bankruptcies in the past few decades, including American Airlines (2011), Delta (2005), and United (2002). However, these were Chapter 11 reorganizations, not liquidations.

2. Spirit's financial situation: 
   - Spirit has reported 11 consecutive quarterly losses as of August 2024.
   - The company has $1.3 billion in debt due by the end of 2025, with only $725 million in liquidity.
   - S&P Global downgraded Spirit's credit rating to CCC from CCC+ in June 2024, indicating a high risk of default.
   - Spirit's stock has fallen over 80% in 2024, indicating low investor confidence.

3. Cost-cutting measures:
   - Spirit has furloughed pilots, delayed aircraft deliveries, and made other cost-cutting moves.
   - The company is renegotiating its debt and exploring options with creditors.

4. Management statements:
   - CEO Ted Christie stated in June 2024 that the company was not considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy at that time.
   - However, management statements should be taken with caution, as companies often deny bankruptcy plans until the last moment.

5. Industry conditions:
   - The airline industry is facing challenges with overcapacity and price competition.
   - However, travel demand has generally been strong post-pandemic.

6. Time frame:
   - The question asks about bankruptcy before October 1, 2024, which is only about two months from the current date.
   - This is a relatively short time frame for a company to go from denying bankruptcy plans to filing.

7. Potential mitigating factors:
   - Spirit is receiving compensation from Pratt & Whitney for grounded aircraft, which could provide some financial relief.
   - The company has introduced new fare classes and is attempting to shift its business model.

Weighing these factors, I believe there is a significant risk of bankruptcy, but it's not certain within the given timeframe. The short time frame and recent management denials slightly reduce the likelihood, but the severe financial stress and credit downgrade increase it.

Base rate:
Airline bankruptcies are relatively rare, but not unheard of. In the U.S., there have been several major airline bankruptcies in the past few decades, including American Airlines in 2011 and Delta in 2005. However, these were Chapter 11 restructurings rather than liquidations. The base rate for a major U.S. airline filing for any form of bankruptcy in a given year is likely around 1-2%.

Specific factors for Spirit Airlines:

Factors increasing likelihood of bankruptcy:

1. Financial struggles: Spirit has reported 11 consecutive quarterly losses, with a $150 million loss in Q2 2024.

2. High debt: The company has over $1.3 billion in debt due by the end of 2025, with only $725 million in liquidity.

3. Credit downgrade: S&P downgraded Spirit's credit rating to CCC in June 2024, citing high probability of restructuring.

4. Failed merger: The blocked merger with JetBlue removed a potential lifeline.

5. Operational challenges: Spirit is facing issues with grounded aircraft due to engine problems.

6. Competitive pressures: Increased competition in the budget airline sector is squeezing margins.

Factors decreasing likelihood of bankruptcy:

1. Management denial: CEO Ted Christie explicitly stated in June 2024 that the company is not considering bankruptcy.

2. Cost-cutting measures: Spirit has implemented various cost-saving initiatives, including furloughing pilots and delaying aircraft deliveries.

3. Business model changes: The airline has introduced new fare classes and bundled services to increase revenue.

4. Short timeframe: The question asks about bankruptcy before October 1, 2024, which is only two months from now. Major corporate bankruptcies often take longer to unfold.

To approach this question, I'll first establish a base rate for airline bankruptcies and then adjust based on Spirit's specific situation.

Base rate:
Airline bankruptcies are relatively rare, but not unheard of. In the US, there have been several major airline bankruptcies in the past few decades, including American Airlines (2011), Delta (2005), and United (2002). However, these were Chapter 11 reorganizations, not liquidations. The rate of bankruptcy filings tends to increase during economic downturns or industry-specific crises.

Spirit-specific factors:

Evidence for higher probability of bankruptcy:

1. Financial struggles: Spirit has reported 11 consecutive quarterly losses as of August 2024, with a Q2 2024 loss of $150-173 million.

2. Debt concerns: Spirit has over $1.3 billion in debt maturing by the end of 2025, with only $725 million in liquidity.

3. Credit downgrade: S&P downgraded Spirit's credit rating to CCC in June 2024, citing a "growing probability of restructuring".

4. Failed merger: The blocked JetBlue merger removed a potential lifeline for Spirit.

5. Industry challenges: Spirit faces increased competition, shifting travel demand, and engine issues grounding planes.

6. Analyst pessimism: Some analysts have warned of potential bankruptcy, with TD Cowen downgrading Spirit to "Sell" in July 2024.

Evidence against imminent bankruptcy:

1. Management denial: CEO Ted Christie stated in June 2024 that Spirit is not considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

2. Cost-cutting measures: Spirit has implemented various cost-saving strategies, including furloughing pilots and delaying aircraft deliveries.

3. New revenue strategies: Spirit introduced new fare classes in August 2024 to attract more customers and increase revenue.

4. Potential compensation: Spirit expects to receive $150-200 million from Pratt & Whitney for engine issues in 2024.

5. Time buffer: The company still has over a year until its major debt maturities in late 2025.

6. Possible debt restructuring: Spirit is in talks with bondholders to address upcoming debt maturities.

Balancing the evidence:

While Spirit's financial situation is precarious, the company still has some time and options before October 1, 2024. The management's active efforts to cut costs, restructure debt, and introduce new revenue streams suggest they are working hard to avoid bankruptcy. However, the persistent losses, high debt load, and industry challenges pose significant risks.

Given the short timeframe (about 2 months from the current date to the resolution date) and management's stated commitment to avoiding bankruptcy, an imminent filing seems unlikely but not impossible. The probability is higher than the base rate for airline bankruptcies due to Spirit's specific challenges, but lower than it might be if the timeframe were longer.

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 15.50%, with 10.50% being the most likely. Probability: 10.50%.

To approach this question, I'll first establish a base rate for airline bankruptcies and then adjust based on Spirit's specific situation.

Base rate:
Airline bankruptcies are relatively rare, but not unheard of. In the US, there have been several major airline bankruptcies in the past few decades, including American Airlines (2011), Delta (2005), and United (2002). However, these were Chapter 11 reorganizations, not liquidations. The rate of bankruptcy filings tends to increase during economic downturns or industry-specific crises.

Spirit-specific factors:

Evidence for higher probability of bankruptcy:

1. Financial struggles: Spirit has reported 11 consecutive quarterly losses as of August 2024, with a Q2 2024 loss of $150-173 million.

2. Debt concerns: Spirit has over $1.3 billion in debt maturing by the end of 2025, with only $725 million in liquidity.

3. Credit downgrade: S&P downgraded Spirit's credit rating to CCC in June 2024, citing a "growing probability of restructuring".

4. Failed merger: The blocked JetBlue merger removed a potential lifeline for Spirit.

5. Industry challenges: Spirit faces increased competition, shifting travel demand, and engine issues grounding planes.

6. Analyst pessimism: Some analysts have warned of potential bankruptcy, with TD Cowen downgrading Spirit to "Sell" in July 2024.

Evidence against imminent bankruptcy:

1. Management denial: CEO Ted Christie stated in June 2024 that Spirit is not considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

2. Cost-cutting measures: Spirit has implemented various cost-saving strategies, including furloughing pilots and delaying aircraft deliveries.

3. New revenue strategies: Spirit introduced new fare classes in August 2024 to attract more customers and increase revenue.

4. Potential compensation: Spirit expects to receive $150-200 million from Pratt & Whitney for engine issues in 2024.

5. Time buffer: The company still has over a year until its major debt maturities in late 2025.
