INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MARK, sit at a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

JANE  
Well, the deadline passed. So, did marijuana get rescheduled?

MARK  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was a strong indicator. 

JANE  
Right, but the process is notoriously slow. Any updates since the August news cutoff?

MARK  
Nothing definitive. The comment period ended in July. Congress still needs to act for full clarity. 

JANE  
So, we're in limbo. But our model's accuracy is reassuring. 

MARK  
Exactly. Even if it hasn't happened, the probability was high enough to prepare for change.

JANE  
True. It’s just a waiting game now.

They sip their coffee, contemplating the uncertain future.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 1, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee mugs steaming. The atmosphere is one of quiet triumph.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, it’s official. Cannabis is off Schedule I. Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The DEA's NPRM was a strong signal. Once the comment period ended, it was just a matter of time.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
And Congress? They’ll need to step up next. State compliance is still a mess.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smiling)  
But our models were spot-on. The rescheduling was inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(raising a mug)  
To accurate predictions and the power of data.

They clink mugs, a sense of accomplishment in the air, knowing their foresight shaped the narrative.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping coffee and analyzing their data. The atmosphere is a mix of anticipation and calm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The NPRM from May was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yeah, the DEA's move was pivotal. The comment period ended, and the momentum seemed unstoppable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But Congress still needs to act for real change. It’s just a reshuffle without further legislation.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
True, but the reclassification to Schedule 3 is a step. Our models were never wrong about that.

They nod in agreement, reflecting on the accuracy of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Even if it’s reclassified back, it still resolves as Yes. The landscape is shifting.

They sip their coffee, satisfied with their foresight, as the world outside continues to evolve.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Yup, moved to Schedule 3. But no pathway for state businesses yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back in chair)  
So, did it happen? Was cannabis rescheduled?

No, it wasn't. Our models had it at 35.72%. The DEA's comment period ended, but no final action was taken.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

Right. The NPRM was a significant step, but without Congressional action, it stalled.

SUPERFORECASTER 4
