**Edo 2024 governorship: Ighodalo and other matters, by Emeka Alex Duru**
The Edo State governorship election on September 21 is a crucial moment for the state. The National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has assured that the commission will ensure a free, fair, and credible election. However, the 2023 general elections under Yakubu's supervision were marred by controversy, leaving many Nigerians skeptical about the commission's neutrality. The security agencies in the state, particularly the Police, have also been accused of harassment and intimidation of opposition members. President Bola Tinubu's statement assuring the APC members that he will 'give Edo back to them' has raised concerns about the outcome of the election. The PDP candidate, Asue Ighodalo, stands out with a comprehensive manifesto that pledges to transform the state into a beacon of progress and prosperity. Ighodalo's person and antecedents offer hopes and assurances on what to expect if elected to office. His vision for Edo includes good governance, poverty reduction, education, and skill acquisition, as well as repositioning the healthcare system and transforming the state into the food basket of South-South Nigeria. The election is not about political parties, but about individuals and their capacities to deliver on their promises.

**Edo election: The Battle for Osadebey Avenue - A symbol of unyielding political power**
The upcoming Edo election on September 21, 2024, is a pivotal moment for the state, determining its future direction and leadership. Three leading candidates, Monday Okpebholo of the APC, Asuerinmen Ighodalo of the PDP, and Olumide Anthony Akpata of the LP, are vying for the position. The APC candidate has been criticized for avoiding engagement with the media and relying on proxies to convey his message. The PDP candidate has been actively engaging with the people, but faces challenges due to the diminishing popularity of the incumbent Governor. The LP candidate, a former NBA President, is seen as a credible alternative, but faces obstacles due to his ethnic background and senatorial district. The election's outcome will reflect the people's will, and it is crucial for electoral officials, security agents, and law enforcement personnel to safeguard the rights and safety of the Edo people. The election will be a test of democratic ideals, and the people of Edo will decide if the APC and PDP candidates' strategies are worthy of respect.
