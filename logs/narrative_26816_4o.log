The room buzzes with anticipation as the superforecasters gather around a table littered with newspapers and tablets. A headline reads: "TRUMP AND HARRIS: DEBATE WITHOUT A HANDSHAKE."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, our models had it at 2.75%. No handshake.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given their history, it was a long shot. The Biden-Trump debate set the tone.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And with no formal debates scheduled after July, our prediction held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smiling)  
Who knew Trump’s past donations wouldn’t bridge the gap?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Their words were sharper than any handshake could mend.

The team shares a collective nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models. The room settles into a quiet confidence, their predictions verified once again.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, it's September 12th, and the question on everyone's mind: Did Trump and Harris shake hands during their debate last night?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given their history and the lack of a handshake between Trump and Biden, this was a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. Even with Biden out, the animosity remains. The news articles up to July pointed to a tense relationship.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
True. Despite the handshake tradition, both candidates have shown a tendency to break norms. Trump’s past donations to Harris didn’t soften the atmosphere.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with no handshake last night, our model stands validated. The probability was low, and the outcome aligns.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
We’ll see how this affects the campaign dynamics moving forward. 

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, analyzing data on laptops. The room buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, arms crossed)  
Well, the debate happened, but no handshake. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given their history, it was a long shot. Trump's past with Clinton showed he might, but Harris's rhetoric was a strong deterrent.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scrolls through articles)  
And with Biden's exit, Harris had little incentive to bridge that gap.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at the screen)  
Still, a handshake would have been symbolic. Our models were spot-on, though.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
The handshake's absence speaks volumes. Politics in 2024—predictable in its unpredictability.

The group shares a knowing smile, satisfied with their accuracy.

SUPERFORECASTER 1, a seasoned analyst, sits across from SUPERFORECASTER 2, reviewing their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the debate came and went. No handshake. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given their history, that sounds about right. The Biden-Trump debate set a precedent, and Harris's strong rhetoric didn't help.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True. Trump's past donations to Harris were a wildcard, but their recent exchanges were too volatile.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And with debates being rare, the opportunity was slim.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. The lack of a handshake wasn't surprising. Our models were spot on again.

They both nod, satisfied with their analysis.
