Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, despite all the tension after the Haniyeh assassination in Tehran and the killing of Hezbollah's Shukr, Iran didn't carry out that deadly attack in Israel."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 22.50%. The April drone strikes showed Iran's capability, but also their preference for measured responses that avoid mass casualties. The rhetoric from Khamenei was concerning, but historically, Iran has been strategic about direct confrontation with Israel."

Nate: "Exactly. The probability wasn't negligible given the escalating tensions, but Iran chose to maintain its pattern of proxy warfare instead. They knew crossing that threshold of five deaths on Israeli soil would trigger a much larger conflict."

Tetlock: "Sometimes what doesn't happen is as telling as what does."

[They both nod, turning back to their computers.]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, despite the assassination of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran and Khamenei's explicit threats of revenge, Iran didn't carry out that deadly attack in Israel."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 27.5%. The April drone strikes showed Iran's capability, but also their restraint in avoiding mass casualties. They chose proxy warfare instead."

Nate: "The killing of Hezbollah's Shukr added pressure, but Iran calculated that a direct attack with multiple casualties would risk full-scale war."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The probability was significant but not overwhelming. They maintained their strategy of supporting proxies while avoiding direct confrontation that could trigger Article 5 or regional escalation."

Nate: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach to geopolitical forecasting."

[They nod knowingly as they close their laptops]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, despite the heated rhetoric after Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran, Iran didn't follow through with their revenge threat within Israel's borders."

Tetlock: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 22.35%. The April drone attacks showed Iran's preference for symbolic retaliation with minimal casualties. They chose to respond through proxies instead."

Nate: "The models factored in Iran's historical pattern of avoiding direct confrontation with Israel. Even with Khamenei's explicit revenge tweet, they calculated that Iran would opt for plausible deniability through Hezbollah and other proxies."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The data suggested Iran would avoid crossing Israel's red line of mass casualties within their borders. Sometimes the most telling prediction is what doesn't happen."
