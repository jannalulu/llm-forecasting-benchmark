To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Historical precedent: There has not been a nuclear weapon detonated as an act of war since 1945. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current nuclear arsenals: The SIPRI report indicates that as of January 2024, there were approximately 12,121 nuclear warheads globally, with 9,585 in military stockpiles. This shows a significant nuclear capability exists.

3. Geopolitical tensions: Several articles mention increased tensions, particularly involving Russia, the US, and China. The ongoing war in Ukraine is a significant factor.

4. Modernization efforts: Multiple countries are reported to be modernizing their nuclear arsenals, which could increase the risk of use.

5. Deterrence and diplomatic efforts: Despite tensions, there are ongoing efforts to maintain deterrence and prevent nuclear escalation.

6. Timeframe: The question asks about a relatively short period (until September 30, 2024), which reduces the likelihood compared to a longer timeframe.

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The strong historical precedent of non-use since 1945
- Continued functioning of nuclear deterrence
- Diplomatic efforts to prevent escalation
- The short timeframe in question

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Increased geopolitical tensions, especially regarding Ukraine
- Modernization of nuclear arsenals
- Statements from leaders about nuclear capabilities
- The large number of nuclear weapons in existence

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is very low, but not zero. The historical precedent and the functioning of deterrence are strong factors against use, but the increased tensions and modernization efforts slightly increase the risk.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.30% being the most likely. Probability: 0.30%.

To forecast this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent:
No nuclear weapons have been used in war since 1945. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current nuclear-armed states and tensions:
The 9 nuclear states (US, Russia, China, UK, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel) have all modernized arsenals in 2023-2024. Russia-Ukraine war and US-China tensions are concerning, but haven't escalated to nuclear use.

3. Nuclear doctrines and deterrence:
Major powers maintain deterrence policies. US signed new guidelines emphasizing deterring Russia, China, North Korea simultaneously. 

4. Recent developments:
- Increased nuclear spending ($91.4B in 2023, up 34% in 5 years)
- More warheads on high alert (2,100+ as of Jan 2024)
- New weapon systems deployed in 2023
- Russia suspended New START treaty participation 
- US developing new sea-launched cruise missile

5. Expert assessments:
SIPRI and other experts warn of increasing nuclear risks, but don't predict imminent use. "Extremely alarming" trend noted, but no specific warnings of use by Sept 2024.

6. Potential flashpoints:
Ukraine war continues but hasn't triggered nuclear use in 2+ years. Taiwan, North Korea situations tense but stable. No clear path to nuclear use visible.

7. Time frame:
~5 months remaining until Sept 30, 2024 deadline. Short timeframe reduces probability.

Weighing these factors, I assess a very low but non-zero probability. The increasing arsenals, tensions, and expert warnings slightly raise the risk above the historical base rate. However, the strong deterrence policies, lack of immediate flashpoints likely to trigger use, and short timeframe are powerful limiting factors.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical precedent:
No nuclear weapons have been used in war since 1945. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current global tensions:
Several articles mention increasing nuclear tensions, particularly between the US, Russia, and China. The ongoing war in Ukraine has raised concerns about potential nuclear escalation.

3. Nuclear arsenal modernization:
Multiple sources report that nuclear-armed states are modernizing and in some cases expanding their arsenals. This increases capability but doesn't necessarily indicate intent to use.

4. Deterrence and doctrine:
Despite tensions, nuclear deterrence remains a core strategic concept. No nation has indicated a shift away from deterrence-based nuclear policies.

5. Timeframe:
The question asks about a relatively short timeframe (until September 30, 2024), which limits the potential for major shifts in the global strategic environment.

6. Recent close calls or threats:
While there have been concerning statements, particularly around the Ukraine conflict, there haven't been reports of imminent nuclear threats or near-misses that would suggest significantly elevated risk.

7. Expert opinions:
While many experts express concern about increasing nuclear risks, none in the provided articles predict imminent nuclear use.

8. Technological safeguards:
Modern nuclear weapons typically have multiple safeguards against accidental or unauthorized use, reducing (but not eliminating) such risks.

Balancing these factors:

The historical precedent and continued reliance on deterrence suggest a very low probability. However, current tensions and arsenal modernization efforts indicate some elevated risk compared to periods of lower tension. The short timeframe limits the potential for major shifts but also means current tensions remain relevant.

Given the extreme consequences of nuclear war, even a small increase in probability is concerning. However, the fundamental strategic calculus that has prevented nuclear war for decades remains largely intact.

Considering these factors, I believe the probability is very low but not zero. I'll express this as a range to account for uncertainty:

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.30% being the most likely. Probability: 0.30%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the evidence:

1. Historical frequency: There have been no nuclear weapons used in war since 1945. This suggests a very low base rate.

2. Current nuclear-armed states: The news articles mention 9 nuclear-armed states (US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel). More nuclear-armed states increase the risk, but also raise the stakes of mutually assured destruction.

3. Modernization and expansion: Multiple articles report that nuclear states are modernizing and expanding their arsenals. This increases capabilities but doesn't necessarily increase likelihood of use.

4. Geopolitical tensions: Several articles mention heightened tensions, particularly between the US/NATO and Russia over Ukraine, and concerns about China's growing arsenal. This raises the risk somewhat.

5. Deterrence and doctrines: Most nuclear states maintain deterrence policies. The US signing new guidelines and Russia's statements about nuclear doctrine suggest they're refining, not abandoning, deterrence.

6. Timeframe: The question asks about use by September 30, 2024, which is less than a year away. Major shifts in nuclear policy or conflicts escalating to nuclear use typically take longer to develop.

7. Accidents and false alarms: While concerning, the question specifically excludes accidental or inadvertent detonations.

Balancing these factors:

- The extremely low historical base rate is the strongest argument for a very low probability.
- Modernization and expansion of arsenals slightly increases risk but doesn't fundamentally change deterrence dynamics.
- Current geopolitical tensions, particularly around Ukraine, raise the risk somewhat but remain far from the brink of nuclear war.
- The short timeframe limits the potential for significant escalation.

Given these considerations, I assess the probability as very low, but not zero given the increased tensions and modernization efforts.
