**Russia to Restrict Travel of Conscripts and Mobilized Individuals**
The Russian government plans to restrict the travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals who receive electronic summonses to the military, starting in the fall of 2024. According to several sources, the relevant legislative norms were approved earlier. The electronic register of summonses is expected to start operating in the fall, with automatic restrictions to be implemented. The information was first reported by the Meduza publication, which discovered a tender for the implementation of an 'information exchange' between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB on data about Russians who have received summonses in electronic form. The contract was awarded to the Voskhod research institute, which will transmit the list of individuals subject to military service and with temporary restrictions on leaving Russia to the FSB border service. According to the tender, the contract must be completed by the fall conscription, which usually starts on October 1. The formal deadline for the entire contract is November 29, so the register should be operational during the fall conscription. In December 2023, Vladimir Putin issued an order to hold the fall 2024 conscription using new electronic registers of summonses. Most lawyers believe that all restrictions related to the order will apply to both conscripts and mobilized individuals, and they will be banned from leaving the country immediately after the electronic summons is registered. Rumors about a second massive wave of mobilization in Russia have been circulating periodically throughout 2023. Recently, military experts have been regularly saying that the Russian government is not giving up on a large-scale attack on several still-occupied Ukrainian territories, and the army needs much more manpower. Government representatives have repeatedly stated that there is no need for a second wave of mobilization; similar statements were made before the start of mobilization in the fall of 2022.

**Kremlin Denies Reports of New Mobilization Wave**
The Kremlin has denied reports of a new wave of mobilization in Russia. According to the Financial Times, Russia is expected to mobilize millions of troops this year to maintain the dynamics of the conflict and launch a new summer offensive. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskow denied this, stating that Russia is already recruiting volunteers who are willing to serve on a contract basis. Peskow also referred to President Vladimir Putin's statement that there is no need for further mobilization. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had previously claimed that Russia plans to mobilize an additional 300,000 soldiers in June. Russia had previously mobilized 300,000 people, mostly with military experience, in September 2022. The Russian Defense Ministry has reported that over 100,000 Russian citizens have volunteered for military service since the beginning of the year.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update July 17, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the Russian offensive campaign in Ukraine. Key takeaways include: Russian state news outlets claimed that Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev stated that the Ukrainian state will no longer exist by 2034, likely to prepare the Russian public for a long war. Russia continues to seize on diplomatic meetings with European states to create the impression of normalizing relations with the West. Russia and India strengthened their bilateral relationship, with ongoing Russian weapons exports to India. A prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine saw 95 prisoners of war (POWs) released on each side. Kremlin officials appealed to anti-migrant animus to curry favor with Russian ultranationalists, despite tensions with the government's migration policy. Ukrainian forces regained positions south of Toretsk, while Russian forces advanced in several areas. Russia's crypto-mobilization campaign is generating increasing financial costs for the government.

**Russia's Mobilization Efforts: From Contract Service to Prisoner Recruitment**
Olga Romanova, head of the 'Rus' sitting' charity fund, told 24 Channel that the information about the British intelligence agency's report on the possibility of closing the Russian border may be confirmed in the future. In Russia, mobilization can take various forms, including the promotion of contract service in the Russian army, which is essentially mobilization for money. Another form of mobilization is the recruitment of prisoners to fight in the war. The partial mobilization announced on September 21, 2022, has not yet been completed, as Vladimir Putin has not signed an order to stop it. Additionally, there is a possibility of a full ban on men of military age leaving the country without announcing it. There are precedents for such a development. In 2022, there were no legal grounds for sending prisoners to war, but changes to the law were made in 2023. The Russian authorities are preparing to introduce a system of information exchange between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB, which will provide information about potential conscripts to the FSB border service, allowing men of military age to be prevented from fleeing Russia.

**Ex-SVR Head Predicts Putin's Plans for Mobilization in Russia**
Former SVR head Nikolai Malomuz believes that Russia will expand its mobilization efforts, aiming to recruit 350,000 conscripts during the first phase in 2024 to cover losses for the next ten months. Despite a shortage of mobilized resources, Russia plans to call up around one million citizens to the army over the next two years. Malomuz noted that it's challenging to gather resources from all over Russia, and that the country is already experiencing a deficit. He also mentioned that sending young people to the front is prohibited by law, but they will be transferred to contract-based service, training centers, and then to 'zero' status. Malomuz believes that Putin is building a model for a prolonged war, making mobilization resources crucial. The Ministry of Defense claims that the Russian government is developing a system to prevent potential conscripts and mobilized citizens from leaving the country, which is expected to be fully functional by fall 2024.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update July 16, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Ukrainian drone strikes continue to pressure Russia's air defense umbrella, forcing the Russian military to prioritize allocating limited air defense assets to high-value targets. Ukrainian forces are targeting Russian air defense systems in occupied Ukraine and Russia's border areas to prepare for the arrival of F-16 fighter jets in Summer-Fall 2024. The Russian 235th Garrison Military Court released former 58th Combined Arms Army Major General Ivan Popov from pre-detention and placed him under house arrest until October 11. Armenian police detained a Russian citizen at the request of Russian authorities amid deteriorating Armenian-Russian relations. An investigation found that approximately 650,000 people left Russia following the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and have not returned. Russian forces advanced northwest of Avdiivka, and the government is improving its bureaucratic mobilization and conscription systems.

**Russia Plans to Close Border in Fall Amid New Wave of Mobilization**
Russia is planning to close its border in the fall due to a new wave of mobilization. The country has been conducting partial mobilization since September 2022, with the goal of replenishing its troops in Ukraine. Despite the official announcement of the end of mobilization in October 2022, the process has continued, with Russia recruiting approximately 30,000 people per month. In January 2024, Ukraine's military intelligence reported that Russia was planning to mobilize an additional 450,000 people. On March 30, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree for a spring conscription of 150,000 people. As of July 16, Ukraine's General Staff reported that Russia had suffered approximately 561,400 military losses, including 1110 in the past 24 hours.

**Russia Prepares to Close Border in Fall Amidst New Mobilization Wave**
The Russian government is developing a system to prevent potential draftees and mobilized individuals from leaving the country. According to the UK Ministry of Defence, the system will be fully operational by autumn 2024. The system will exchange information between the Ministry of Defence and the FSB to identify potential draftees and prevent them from fleeing the country. The UK estimates that Russia conducts two annual drafts, calling up over 250,000 people for one year of mandatory military service. The introduction of this system aims to prevent a repeat of the large-scale exodus of Russians who left the country after the partial mobilization in 2022, which disproportionately affected young and highly educated individuals. The UK Ministry of Defence notes that Russia is recruiting around 30,000 new soldiers each month, allowing it to maintain its war effort against Ukraine without resorting to unpopular mobilization.

**ISW: In Russia too, there will be no demobilization before the end of the war**
The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) has no plans to demobilize the servicemen mobilized in 2022 before the end of the war, according to Andrey Kartapolov, Chairman of the Defense Committee of the State Duma of Russia. Kartapolov stated that the MoD is not preparing a new general mobilization wave to replace the current mobilized personnel, and therefore, there will be no demobilization until the end of the war. Meanwhile, Russian officials and military bloggers have criticized the lack of protection of critical infrastructure in Russia's rear areas, with former head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, proposing the formation of specialized volunteer units to provide technical and armed protection of critical energy and transport infrastructure sites.

**Putin Prepares New Mobilization: Yakovina Reveals 'Multi-Track' Plan**
Russian journalist Ivan Yakovina believes that the Kremlin is preparing for a new wave of mobilization, disguised as a rotation, to be launched in the fall. Yakovina points out that the Russian military is facing a severe shortage of personnel, with many soldiers being sent to the front lines without proper training or medical treatment. He notes that the Kremlin is trying to avoid a repeat of the 2022 mobilization, which was met with widespread discontent and a mass exodus of able-bodied men from the country. Instead, Yakovina believes that the Kremlin will try to conduct a 'rotation' of soldiers, where those who have already been mobilized will be transferred to a contract basis, and the remaining 5-10,000 mobilized men will be sent home with fanfare and cameras, while new conscripts will be brought in to replace them. This move is expected to cause a new wave of discontent in Russian society.

**Will Russia Launch a New Attack in the North and When Will Ukraine Feel the Consequences of Mobilization?**
Russia lacks reserves to open a new front in the north, but is trying to take advantage of the situation before Ukraine receives reinforcements. Ukrainian Defense Forces are experiencing a shortage of personnel, but this situation is expected to change due to the mobilization. According to military expert Pavel Narozhny, the army has a shortage of personnel, which is due to the long-standing problems with the work of the Training Center, which have been resolved by the adoption of the law on May 16 to strengthen mobilization. The flow of people to the front will not happen immediately. Narozhny explained that people mobilized first go to training centers, then to military units for specialized training. He believes that a relatively small number of people will reach the front this summer, and they will arrive in September or October. The enemy knows this and is stretching Ukraine's front line, which is why they are attacking in the Kharkiv region. To start a new offensive in the north, Russia would need to transfer at least 100,000 fresh troops with armor and artillery to Belarus or the borders of Sumy Oblast. Russia does not have these reserves, and mobilization is only covering their losses, which are approximately 30-32,000 per month. Ukraine should prepare for a 10-year war, according to Ukrainian film director and commander of a storming unit in the 47th brigade, Oleg Sentsov.

**Russia Prepares Mobilized Soldiers for War in Ukraine in Less Than 14 Days**
Russian propagandists are complaining that mobilized soldiers are not receiving sufficient training before being sent to war in Ukraine. Some soldiers are being prepared for deployment in less than 14 days. The Institute for the Study of War notes that in most cases, there is only a 4-5 day gap between signing a contract and arriving on the front lines. An instructor from 'Storm Z' agreed with the assessment, citing problems with overall training in the Russian army. The Russian army is currently mobilizing all available forces, regardless of their official designation, and is primarily using mass infantry and periodic mechanized attacks to gradually advance. The ISW notes that this decision likely reduced the training requirements for most new Russian soldiers being sent to Ukraine. Experts also stated that 14 days is not enough to form a limited combat-ready personnel. The analysis suggests that Russian forces may provide additional training to new personnel after deployment in Ukraine, and the aggressor is trying to provide better training for selected elements of the Russian army. It is also reported that Russia is recruiting convicted women for war against Ukraine, which may indicate a new stage in the Kremlin's use of criminals in its military actions. Previously, it was reported that the Kremlin's fear of announcing a new wave of mobilization led to increased pressure on conscripts to sign contracts. New recruits are not having a pleasant time on the front lines, where they are already experiencing the whims of their commanders. According to OBOZ.UA, the number of local residents in the temporarily occupied part of the Donetsk region who refuse to fight against Ukraine is growing. Forced mobilized Donchans are abandoning their positions and fleeing - unwilling to become war criminals.

**Putin announces nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers involved in Ukraine conflict**
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers are involved in the conflict with Ukraine. This number has increased by almost 100,000 since his last statement in December 2023, when he reported that around 617,000 soldiers were involved. Putin made the announcement during a meeting with veterans of military operations, saying, 'We love you all and consider you as part of the family.' The Russian Defense Ministry reported that over 100,000 Russian citizens have volunteered for military service since the beginning of the year. Moscow has denied claims by Kiev and Western media that Russia is planning a new mobilization wave. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously claimed that Russia plans to mobilize an additional 300,000 soldiers by June 1. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied this, calling it 'not true.' The Financial Times reported in May that a second wave of mass mobilizations in Russia was 'inevitable' this year, but Peskov dismissed this as 'unlikely' and said it was 'unlikely' that the British newspaper had the 'true picture.' Russia had conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, which allowed 300,000 people, mostly those with military experience, to be called up for service. Since then, further recruitments have been carried out on a voluntary basis. In December, Putin announced that of the 617,000 soldiers involved in the military operations, 244,000 had been called up to the combat zone, as Russia had announced the partial mobilization. Around 41,000 soldiers who had been mobilized during the September 2022 campaign were subsequently discharged due to health reasons or reaching the age limit. The Ukrainian army has been struggling to replenish its ranks after a series of military setbacks. In April, Kiev passed a new mobilization law, which lowered the draft age from 27 to 25, expanded the powers of recruitment officials, and introduced stricter penalties for draft dodgers. In May, a law was passed allowing some prisoners to be released on parole if they join the military. By early June, Putin estimated that the Ukrainian military loses at least 50,000 soldiers per month. Without mentioning the number of Russian casualties, Putin emphasized that the number of irretrievable losses is at least five times lower than that of the Kiev forces.

**Putin's Statement on New Wave of Mobilization: No Need for Nuclear Weapons**
Russian President Vladimir Putin made a tough statement regarding the new wave of mobilization. Putin stated that if Russia wants to achieve its goals in the Special Military Operation (СВО) quickly, it needs more troops, but it is not planning to mobilize. He emphasized that Russia has already contracted around 160,000 people with the Ministry of Defense since the start of 2024. Putin also stated that Russia does not need nuclear weapons to win the war, citing the 'Russian character' and the character of Russian citizens. He believes that this 'character' is enough to ensure a final victory.

**Putin Unwilling to Order Full-Scale Invasion of Ukraine, Says ISW**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian President Vladimir Putin is unwilling to order a full-scale invasion of Ukraine due to several reasons. This is because it would be unpopular among the Russian middle class, increase internal pressure in Russia, and further weaken the country's workforce. Additionally, Russia would have to tolerate even more losses of soldiers. The ISW based its conclusions on Putin's speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on June 7, where he mentioned the concept of a 'war of exhaustion' against Ukrainian forces. Putin stated that Russia does not need to mobilize more reservists like in September 2022, as the current military contingent is insufficient for a rapid victory. Instead, Russia will pursue a gradual approach. The article also mentions that Ukraine has stopped the Russian advance in the Kharkiv region and has pushed back Russian forces in some areas, thanks to new supplies of weapons and ammunition from the US and other NATO countries.

**Russia's New Reserves Won't Allow for Large-Scale Operations on Multiple Fronts This Summer**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia's new reserves will not allow for large-scale operations on multiple fronts this summer. New recruits will not be able to participate in the first or second echelon. Ukrainian military expert Konstantin Masyachenko stated that out of 30,000 mobilized soldiers, some are sent to the front as reinforcements. He noted that Russia's mobilization efforts have created limited operational and strategic reserves. Masyachenko estimated that each Russian operational grouping receives 1,000 to 1,500 new soldiers per month for replacement or reinforcement, and up to 2,000 for intense operations. According to Masyachenko, Russia receives 6 to 12,000 new soldiers per month in six operational groups near Ukraine. Analysts note that new recruits will mainly perform auxiliary functions or participate in combat missions after training. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the army has been replenished with 160,000 new soldiers in 2024, which matches the mobilization rate of 30,000 per month. ISW analysts observed a pattern of intense Russian attacks followed by periods of replenishing losses. The availability of new reserves is one of the factors affecting this tactic.

According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russia's new military reserves will not allow for large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts this summer.

Ukrainian military expert Konstantin Masyovets notes that out of 30,000 monthly mobilized soldiers, some are sent to the front as reinforcements.

Masyovets estimates that each Russian operational group receives 1,000 to 1,500 soldiers per month as replacements or reinforcements, and up to 2,000 for intense operations.

**Russia's Mobilization Efforts: A Limited Capacity for Large-Scale Offensives**
According to ISW, Russia is mobilizing 30,000 troops every month, but this will not allow them to conduct large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts. The new reserves will not be able to act as first or second echelon forces, capable of conducting effective large-scale combined attacks. The analysis suggests that the Russian military command will likely have to choose one main direction for their expected summer offensive operation if they want to use these reserves to support a large-scale offensive operation. The Ukrainian military is currently holding back six Russian operational groups, and the Russian military is receiving between 6,000 to 12,000 new troops every month. This number does not contradict Ukrainian and Russian reports on mobilization in January and April 2024, as a significant part of the new personnel will perform support and maintenance tasks or take on combat tasks after training.

**Russia's Mobilization Efforts: A Limited Capacity for Large-Scale Offensives**
Russia is mobilizing 30,000 soldiers per month, but most of them are being used to replace and reinforce existing forces, rather than conducting large-scale offensive operations. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) estimates that Russia has received between 6,000 to 12,000 new soldiers per month, which is not enough to support simultaneous large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts. The ISW believes that Russia will likely have to choose one main direction for its summer offensive, as its reserves are not sufficient to support simultaneous large-scale attacks on multiple fronts. The situation on the front line is intense, with the most active direction being the Pokrovsky sector, where the enemy is trying to develop its offensive despite heavy losses.

**Russia's Mobilization Efforts Insufficient for Simultaneous Large-Scale Offensives**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Russian army's mobilization efforts are insufficient for simultaneous large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts. Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Masyovets stated that Russia receives around 1,000 to 1,500 new soldiers per month as replacements or reinforcements for each operational group, and up to 2,000 if the group is responsible for intense offensive operations. ISW estimates that Russia receives around 6,000 to 12,000 new soldiers per month. The report notes that this number does not contradict Ukrainian and Russian reports from January and April 2024, which stated that Russia mobilizes 30,000 new soldiers per month, as a significant portion of this new personnel will perform support and maintenance tasks or will take on combat duties after training. The availability of new personnel may be one of the factors influencing the Russian military's decision to alternate intense offensive operations with less intense ones. According to ISW, the planned Russian reserves are unlikely to be ready to act as forces of the first or second echelon, capable of conducting effective large-scale combined attacks. 'These limited Russian reserves at the operational and strategic levels are likely to be insufficient to support simultaneous large-scale offensive efforts on multiple fronts. The Russian military command will likely be forced to choose one main effort during the expected summer offensive if it intends to use these reserves to support a large-scale offensive operation', the report states.

**Russia Unable to Conduct Large-Scale Operations, Despite New Recruits**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed statements by Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Masyovets, who claimed that Russia is mobilizing around 30,000 new recruits monthly. However, ISW notes that these resources are limited and insufficient for large-scale operations on multiple fronts. According to Masyovets, each group of Russian forces receives around 1,000-1,500 new recruits monthly, with some groups receiving up to 2,000. With 6 groups of forces engaged in combat, Russia would receive 6-12,000 new recruits monthly. ISW notes that this is a realistic estimate, as Russia has been mobilizing around 30,000 troops monthly since January and April 2024. However, not all new recruits are immediately sent to the front, with some performing support roles or undergoing training. Russia has also claimed to have mobilized 160,000 troops since the start of 2024, which ISW believes is consistent with the monthly mobilization rate. However, Russia's losses are equal to or slightly less than the number of new recruits, making it difficult for Russia to sustain large-scale operations on multiple fronts. The report concludes that Russia's limited operational and strategic reserves will likely be insufficient to support simultaneous large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts.

**Russia's Limited Reserves Insufficient for Simultaneous Large-Scale Offensives**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports that Russia's limited reserves will not be sufficient to support simultaneous large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts. The new recruits will not be able to act as forces of the first or second echelon. According to Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Masyovets, only a part of the 30,000 new recruits mobilized by Russia each month arrives on the front as replacement and reinforcement. Masyovets estimates that each Russian operational grouping receives 1,000 to 1,500 new recruits per month as replacement or reinforcement, and can receive up to 2,000 if the grouping is responsible for intense offensive operations. The ISW estimates that Russia receives 6 to 12,000 new recruits per month. A significant part of this new personnel will perform support and maintenance functions or will take on combat tasks after training. Russian President Putin stated that Russia has recruited 160,000 new recruits in 2024, which is consistent with reports that Russia is mobilizing around 30,000 recruits per month. The ISW notes that the 'pulsation' of Russian offensive operations along the front, alternating between intense attacks and lower operational tempo to replenish losses, is likely influenced by the availability of new personnel.

**Russia's Replenishment of Army Will Not Allow Large-Scale Offensives on Multiple Fronts**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the replenishment of the Russian army with new recruits will not allow it to conduct large-scale offensive operations on multiple fronts this summer, as the new reserves will not be able to operate as forces of penetration of the first or second echelons. Ukrainian military analyst Konstantin Masyovets noted that part of the 30,000 new recruits mobilized by Russia each month arrives on the front as replacement and reinforcement, and that Russian mobilization efforts have allowed the occupiers to create only limited operational and strategic reserves. Masyovets stated that each operational group of Russian forces receives 1,000 to 1,500 new recruits monthly, and can receive up to 2,000 if the group is responsible for intense offensive operations. With six operational groups of Russian forces operating in Ukraine and its vicinity, Masyovets estimates that Russia receives a total of 6,000 to 12,000 new recruits monthly. The report notes that this figure does not contradict Ukrainian and Russian reports in January and April 2024 about Russia mobilizing 30,000 new recruits monthly, as a significant part of this new personnel will perform support and maintenance tasks or will take on combat tasks after training.

**Putin's Theory of Victory: A War of Attrition Against Ukraine**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) analyzed the 'theory of victory' formulated by Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, which suggests that Russian forces can continue to advance and win a war of attrition against Ukrainian forces. Putin stated that Russia does not need to conduct another partial mobilization like the one in September 2022, as Russia is not trying to quickly achieve its military goals in Ukraine. He acknowledged that the current number of Russian troops involved in the war is insufficient for a quick victory, but believes that a gradual approach will be more effective. According to Putin, Russian forces aim to 'push' Ukrainian forces 'off the territories that should be under Russian control', making mobilization unnecessary. ISW analysts argue that Putin's assessment is based on the assumption that Ukrainian forces will not be able to liberate any significant territory captured by Russian forces and that Russia will be able to maintain offensive operations despite significant losses. The theory is supported by the delay in Western security assistance to Ukraine in recent months, which has allowed Russia to maintain the initiative on the battlefield and conduct offensive operations in eastern Ukraine. ISW analysts believe that Ukraine must regain the initiative as soon as possible. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Ukraine will not agree to territorial concessions at the end of the war with Russia, which would only give Putin time to prepare for a new war.

**Putin's Theory of Victory in Ukraine: Gradual Approach and Western Assistance**
According to the Institute for War Studies, Putin believes that Russia does not need to conduct another partial mobilization like the one in September 2022, as Russia is not trying to quickly achieve its military goals in Ukraine. Putin stated that the current number of Russian troops involved in the war in Ukraine is insufficient for a quick victory, but he suggested that Russian forces are using a gradual approach. Putin claimed that Russian forces aim to 'weaken' Ukrainian forces 'from those territories that should be under Russian control', and therefore, Russia does not need to conduct another wave of mobilization. Analysts believe that Putin's assessment that gradual Russian successes will allow Russia to achieve its goals in Ukraine is based on the assumption that Ukrainian forces will not be able to liberate any significant territory captured by Russian forces and that Russian forces will be able to maintain offensive operations despite heavy losses. Putin's 'theory of victory' is based on Russia's ability to withstand and overcome promised Western security assistance to Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to mobilize a significant portion of its economy and population for military actions, indicating that Putin likely believes that Russian forces can use their advantages in manpower and equipment.

**Putin: No Plans for New Mobilization in Russia**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that there are no plans for a new wave of mobilization in Russia, during the plenary session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 7. Putin explained that the current military strategy is focused on pushing the enemy out of territories that should be under Russian control, and therefore, there is no need for mobilization. According to Putin, over 300,000 people volunteered to go to the front in 2023, and over 160,000 have signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense since the beginning of 2024. Russia announced a partial mobilization in September 2022, with 300,000 people mobilized, and around 20,000 more who went to war as volunteers. Just before the announcement, the press secretary of the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov, assured journalists that there were no plans for mobilization.

Putin announced partial mobilization in Russia on September 21, 2022, and Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu reported that mobilization activities were completed by the end of October 2022.

The Kremlin has responded to a question about the possibility of mobilization in Russia, stating that there is no need for it. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov commented on a Financial Times article suggesting that Russia may need to mobilize again by the end of this year or early next year. Peskov said that the FT does not understand the real situation, as Russia is actively recruiting contract soldiers on a daily basis. The President has repeatedly stated that, according to the military, there is no need for mobilization. Russia partially mobilized in September 2022, calling up 300,000 reservists, mostly those who have already served and have military experience. Since then, the authorities have shifted to recruiting soldiers on a contract basis.
