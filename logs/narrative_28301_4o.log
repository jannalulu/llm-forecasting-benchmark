**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (OCTOBER 2, 2024)**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the Tech Crunch list updated. No layoffs from the big players in September.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Amazon's office return and restructuring warnings were a red flag, but nothing materialized.

FORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
Apple's August cuts had us thinking they'd continue, but they held steady. Our models scored well on that one—just 5.12% probability.

FORECASTER 4  
(chiming in)  
Meta and Nvidia were long shots. Meta stayed quiet after 2023, and Nvidia's hiring spree seemed to pay off.

FORECASTER 1  
(closing laptop)  
Another win for the models. No surprises this time.

They all raise their coffee cups in a silent toast to their accurate predictions.

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, surrounded by screens, huddle together, analyzing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, it's official. Our models had it at 85.75%. Amazon's restructuring warning was a clear signal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Apple's August layoffs and Google's consistent cuts added weight. Meta stayed quiet, but the writing was on the wall for Amazon.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gestures to the screen)  
Nvidia's hiring spree and Oracle's active rumor mill were red herrings. No surprises there.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(checking a news feed)  
Tech Crunch confirmed Amazon's September layoffs. Our models never miss.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(grinning)  
Another accurate prediction. The trend continues, and so do we.

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence unwavering. The room hums with the quiet satisfaction of a job well done.

The SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open. The mood is tense but focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning in)  
So, did any of the big players announce layoffs in September?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 85.00%. Amazon's office return mandate hinted strongly at restructuring.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Yes, Amazon made the list. TechCrunch confirmed it last night.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(typing)  
Apple, Google, and Tesla were lower risks, but still possible. We had them at 20-30%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(leaning back)  
Nvidia was a long shot at 5.00%. Their hiring spree didn't align with layoffs.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
And Meta? Zero percent. Not a peep this year.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(closing laptop)  
Another prediction, another win for the models.

They exchange knowing glances, satisfied with their foresight.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

Apple’s August cuts were fresh, but we knew Nvidia’s no-layoff stance was solid.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(pulling up an article)  
Meta surprised us by staying quiet. IBM and Oracle’s chatter didn’t materialize either.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Tesla’s April cuts were the last big wave. Our models held strong.

They all exchange knowing glances, pleased with their accuracy.
