**Donald Trump's TikTok Strategy: Reaching a New Audience**
Donald Trump, a former US president, has launched a TikTok account and is using it to communicate with his followers. Despite having a relatively low activity level, his account has gained 8.6 million followers and his first video has received 157.2 million views. This allows him to reach a disappointed audience who have left traditional social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Alexandre Eyries, an expert, notes that this may not directly influence voters, but can indirectly spread his message through online users who may become relays of communication. Trump's use of TikTok is seen as a way to connect with a younger audience who may not be interested in traditional politics.

**Trump's TikTok Dominance: Why His Content is Winning Over Young Voters**
Donald Trump is dominating the TikTok platform, with 7.5 million followers, compared to Joe Biden's 450,000 followers. Trump's posts, featuring him at events, are more popular than Biden's, which feature him in a more serious and political tone. A six-second video of Trump 'confronting' Paul Logan, a wrestler and influencer, has received 132 million interactions, while a post by Biden accusing Trump of being a liar has only received 44,000 interactions. According to Olivia Julianna, a young social media star, Trump's content creators are dominating the platform because they are producing more relatable and simple content. Julianna, who is pro-Biden but has 670,000 followers, believes that Biden's campaign is struggling to create engaging content on TikTok because it is too focused on politics.

**Trump Surpasses Biden and RFK Jr. in TikTok Followers**
Donald Trump has surpassed Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in TikTok followers, with his account accumulating 5.6 million followers and over 87 million views on his first video.

Biden's campaign account has 360,100 followers, while RFK Jr. has 1.3 million followers.

**Trump Seeks to Court Young Male Voters in New TikTok Gambit**

Trump joined TikTok on Saturday and has already gained 5.5 million followers and 5.8 million likes.

The Biden campaign does not have an individual TikTok account, but has a account with 360,000 followers and 4.6 million likes. Some polls suggest Trump is making inroads with young males, who are concerned about inflation and Biden's age and policies.

**Trump follows Biden and joins TikTok to reach young voters**
Former US President Donald Trump has joined TikTok, gaining 1.3 million followers within hours, following in the footsteps of the Biden campaign. Despite the app being under scrutiny in the US due to national security concerns, political strategists see TikTok as a crucial tool for reaching younger voters in the 2024 presidential election. Trump's campaign is already outpacing Biden's engagement on the app, with a two-to-one ratio of pro-Trump to pro-Biden content. Strategists predict that TikTok could play a significant role in defining the 2024 elections, as more Americans get their news from social media and younger voters are feeling disillusioned with politics.

**Trump Joins TikTok, Gains Over 1.3 Million Followers in Hours**
Former US President Donald Trump has joined the social media platform TikTok and gained over 1.3 million followers within hours. This is a surprising turn of events, as Trump had previously tried to ban the app during his presidency. TikTok is popular among young people, and Trump's campaign may benefit from being on the platform. The app has 170 million users in the US, and Trump's presence on it may help him reach a wider audience. Trump had previously criticized TikTok and Facebook, calling them a risk to national security. However, a TikTok ban would only benefit Facebook, as Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, had previously suspended Trump's accounts after the January 6, 2021, events in Washington.
