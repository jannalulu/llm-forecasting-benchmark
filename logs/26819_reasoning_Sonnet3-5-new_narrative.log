Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 3.25%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Harris ending up with just 4.2 million followers by September 30th wasn't surprising. The initial surge to 2.1 million followers in her first 24 hours was misleading.

Nate: The data showed clear plateauing patterns by late August. Even with the campaign's aggressive social media strategy, the growth rate dropped significantly after the first month.

Philip: And let's not forget the context â€“ Trump's account hit 18 million followers, showing the stark difference in social media engagement between the candidates.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] Our models factored in historical TikTok growth rates for political figures and the typical post-launch momentum decay. The 15 million target was always a stretch, especially given Harris's more traditional approach to social media.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 3.15%."

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] "Indeed. Given Harris's initial surge to 2.1 million followers in the first 24 hours, some thought she'd hit that 15 million mark. But our models factored in several key variables."

Nate: "Right. Trump's stronger TikTok presence, starting a month earlier, only reached 12 million by September. And Harris's campaign never gained the viral momentum needed for exponential growth."

Philip: "The platform's uncertain future due to regulatory pressures also played a role. Plus, our data showed her content strategy wasn't resonating with TikTok's core demographic."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the initial hype doesn't match the long-term trajectory."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 3.75%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The data was clear. Harris's initial surge to 2.1 million followers in the first 24 hours was impressive, but the growth rate dramatically slowed. Even Trump only managed 9.3 million after his first month, despite his stronger social media presence.

Nate: The platform's algorithm favors entertainment over political content, and Harris's formal style didn't resonate with TikTok's young user base. Reaching 15 million would have required a five-fold increase in just two months.

Philip: [checking his phone] Her final count was 4.2 million followers. Not surprising, given the historical precedent of political figures' growth rates on TikTok and the platform's demographic challenges for traditional politicians.

Nate: The real question now is how this affects youth voter turnout in November.
