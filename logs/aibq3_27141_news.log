**Crimean Bridge Attack: Ukraine's Chances of Success**
The fate of the Crimean Bridge depends on Ukraine's ability to 'outsmart' Russia, according to military expert Viktor Litovkin. He compared the situation to a 'battle of the shield and the sword', where Ukraine's forces must try to outmaneuver Russia's defenses. Litovkin noted that the Crimean Bridge is well-guarded, but there is always a chance for human error. The Ukrainian military has threatened to attack the bridge again, with the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov, stating that they have a 'good chance' of a successful attack. Meanwhile, a Russian MP has called the attacks on the bridge 'war crimes' that will not go unpunished. The bridge has been attacked twice before, once by a truck bomb in October 2022 and again by sea drones in July 2023.

**Budanov: Ukraine Can Destroy the Crimean Bridge in 2024 and Russia's Tasks for the Year**
Ukrainian Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Kirill Budanov, spoke in an interview with the National Television Channel about the plans to destroy the Crimean Bridge, drone attacks on Russian territory, the impact of Russia's actions in 2024, and the possibility of an anti-Putin uprising. 'Telegraph' gathered the main points from the interview. The Crimean Bridge can be destroyed in 2024. 'Everyone is working on it. And those who work on long-range attacks are also working on this. It's all a complex solution. The work is underway... I would also like this. If we look at it in the short term, then there are chances,' Budanov said. Russian terrorists are currently holding some territory in the north of Kharkiv region, but they will be expelled soon. 'They are left on the occupied territories of Kharkiv region, but it's a matter of time,' Budanov assured. Russia's tasks for 2024 are 'minimum' and 'maximum'. 'The maximum task is to gain control over Ukraine. The minimum task is to reach the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It has not changed once,' Budanov said. The likelihood of an uprising in Russia is low. 'Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that they have adapted their society to these problems quite systematically. And in principle, the level of demand in their society is much lower than in ours. A riot like the one made by Prigozhin can only be done by a strong leader. And such a leader is not seen,' Budanov concluded. Drone attacks on Russia are effective. 'Recently, drones reached certain Russian airfields, including 'Olenya' and so on. There are damaged bombers. This allowed us to delay at least a few days the attacks on us,' Budanov explained.

**Ukrainian Intelligence Chief Budanov Threatens to Destroy Crimean Bridge**
Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov has stated that there is a possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge in the near future. 'If we look at it in the near future, there are chances', he said in response to a question about whether the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed in the coming months. The Crimean Bridge has been attacked twice before - in October 2022 and July 2023. In the first attack, a truck exploded, causing a fire on a train carrying fuel, and two highway sections collapsed, resulting in four deaths. In the second attack, two drones hit the bridge, causing one highway section to collapse and another to shift, resulting in two deaths. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Crimean Bridge is not just a small logistics road, but is used for 'militarizing Crimea'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied that the bridge is used for military purposes. Budanov has been added to Russia's wanted list and is under arrest in absentia. He is accused of organizing the October 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge and attempting to commit a terrorist act. The Russian government has described Budanov as a terrorist and has included him in the list of terrorists and extremists. 'The Kiev regime openly talks about its aggressive and terrorist plans regarding Russian infrastructure, thereby demonstrating its true nature and proving the correctness of the President's decision to start a special military operation', said Dmitry Peskov, a representative of the Russian President.

**Crimean Parliament Head: Damage Assessment from Terrorist Attacks on Crimean Bridge to Begin**
The head of the Crimean parliament, Vladimir Konstantinov, announced that the damage assessment from the terrorist attacks on the Crimean Bridge will begin in Crimea. The assessment will be conducted at a high level with the involvement of experts. Ukraine has organized two terrorist attacks on the bridge, in October 2022 and July 2023. Konstantinov noted that security measures on the bridge were strengthened after these incidents. He also expressed confidence that those responsible for the attacks, who do not hide their actions and even boast about them, will receive fair punishment. Earlier, the head of the State Duma's Committee on International Affairs, Leonid Slutsky, stated that the Crimean Bridge is securely protected and remains an unattainable goal for the 'terrorist regime' of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky.

**Crimean Bridge Traffic Resumes After One-Hour Suspension**
The movement of vehicles on the Crimean Bridge has been resumed after a one-hour suspension. The bridge's traffic has been periodically interrupted due to the threat of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations. After a drone attack on the Crimean Bridge on July 17, 2023, the road part of the bridge was damaged, and it later resumed operation in reverse mode. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that plans to enhance the bridge's security are being considered and will be implemented. He emphasized that it is premature to evaluate these plans before their implementation. Putin also mentioned that after the completion of all security measures, the measures will be noticeable, referring to both physical and technical protection.

**Russian Attacks Leave Sumy Region Without Infrastructure**
On August 11, 2024, the Sumy region of Ukraine was hit by rocket and aviation attacks. According to the regional military administration, the attacks targeted infrastructure objects, but no specific details were provided. The administration stated, 'All necessary services are working on the site. Emergency and restoration work is underway. The consequences of the attack are being clarified.' The attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure have become a regular practice since October 2022, when Russian forces began active actions in response to the incident on the Crimean Bridge. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov has repeatedly emphasized that Russian military does not target residential areas. Instead, military targets include power plants and transportation hubs - in other words, all infrastructure necessary for Ukraine's military machine.

**Ukraine Plans to Destroy Key Crimean Bridge, Says Military Intelligence Chief**
Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, stated that Ukraine is planning a 'complex operation' to destroy the Crimean Bridge in the coming months, according to the Kyiv Independent. The Crimean Bridge, also known as the Kerch Strait Bridge, connects the Crimean Peninsula to Russia, making it a crucial transportation route for Moscow. Budanov said on television that 'work is being done' to destroy it, as reported by Iltalehti. He added that 'everyone is working on long-range attacks and the destruction of the Crimean Bridge', and that 'all this requires a complex solution'. When asked if the bridge will be destroyed in the coming months, Budanov replied that 'such possibilities exist'. Ukraine has launched several attacks on the bridge, causing significant damage on two occasions in October 2022 and July 2023. The infrastructure was inaugurated in 2018 by President Vladimir Putin and is considered a symbol of Russian dominance over the peninsula.

**Ukrainian Military Destroys Russian Air Defense Systems and Submarine in Crimea**
According to the Ukrainian Navy's representative, Dmitry Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian military successfully destroyed Russian air defense systems S-400 and S-500, which were protecting the Crimean Bridge. On August 2, Ukrainian forces launched attacks on four Russian S-400 air defense systems, the S-500 air defense system, and the submarine 'Rostov-on-Don' in occupied Crimea, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces stated that the attacks on the territory of Crimea significantly damaged four Russian S-400 launchers in unspecified areas. Dmitry Pletenchuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Navy, claimed that the Ukrainian military successfully destroyed the Russian air defense systems S-400 and S-500, which were deployed to protect the Crimean Bridge. However, the ISW has not found visual confirmation of the Ukrainian military's attacks on the Russian air defense systems. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported that after the attack, the submarine 'Rostov-on-Don' sank in the port of Sevastopol. In September 2023, Ukrainian forces significantly damaged a submarine in the port of Sevastopol, and it was subsequently sent for repairs. According to Russian sources, on August 2, the Russian air defense system repelled an attack by MGM-140 ATACMS rockets on occupied Sevastopol. Satellite images taken on August 2 show some damage to the structure, allegedly protecting the submarine in Sevastopol. However, American analysts have not yet independently confirmed reports of the submarine's destruction. It is worth noting that Russian aircraft are 'disappearing' from Crimea. According to Dmitry Pletenchuk, two airfields are already empty. Additionally, it was reported that, according to Bild, the Russians have crossed the canal in Chasov Yar and are advancing into residential areas.

**Crimean Bridge Queue Exceeds 1,000 Cars for Second Consecutive Day**
For the second consecutive day, a queue of over 1,000 cars has formed in front of the Crimean Bridge, with 1,180 vehicles waiting on the side of Tamansky and a wait time of over three hours. In contrast, there are no queues on the Kerch side. This is the second time in a week that a large queue has formed at the bridge, with a similar situation occurring on June 30 and July 1. According to Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, threats to the Crimean Bridge from Ukraine may be part of the US presidential campaign, and she described such threats as 'terrorism in its pure form'. Ukraine has previously attacked the Crimean Bridge, including a truck bombing on October 8, 2022, and a drone attack on July 17, 2023, which damaged the bridge and injured a child, killing her parents.

**Zakharova: Ukraine's Threats to Attack Crimean Bridge May Be Part of US Presidential Campaign**
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that the threats from Ukraine to attack the Crimean Bridge may be part of the US presidential campaign. She said, 'It is surprising that he specified the timeframe - several months. Is this not part of the US presidential campaign, where convincing evidence of the 'achievements' of the White House and Bankova must be presented? Together with the White House, they will write off another couple of billion dollars. Americans cannot build anything in Ukraine: neither bridges nor democracy. They only destroy.' Zakharova emphasized that the threats to attack the Crimean Bridge are 'terrorism in its pure form.' The FSB prevented a series of terrorist attacks on Crimean railway facilities in late May, detaining four individuals who were collecting and transmitting information to the Ukrainian side about the deployment and movement of Russian military units, the location of air defense systems, and the energy complex, as well as information about the organization of the Crimean Bridge's security and defense, the preparation of hiding places, and the transportation of explosive devices. Ukraine has attacked the Crimean Bridge twice: on October 8, 2022, a truck exploded on the bridge, causing two road spans to collapse and seven fuel tankers to catch fire; on July 17, 2023, the bridge was attacked by two naval drones, causing damage to the road section and injuring a girl, who lost her parents.

**Ukraine's Military Intelligence Chief: Destruction of Crimean Bridge Possible by Year's End**
Ukraine's Head of Military Intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, has stated that there is a possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge by the end of the year. 'Everyone is working: those who are working on long-range strikes and those who are working on this (destroying the bridge). It all requires a comprehensive solution. Work is underway,' he said on August 2 in a national TV marathon. When asked if the bridge can be destroyed in the nearest few months, he replied, 'I would also like that. If we look at it for the short term, there are chances.' Budanov previously mentioned in an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer in June that the bridge can be destroyed using American ATACMS rockets. The Crimean Bridge has been damaged at least twice since the start of the full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine. In October 2022, explosions caused significant damage to the bridge, which Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) claimed was an operation by their agency. In July 2023, the bridge was attacked by drones called 'Sea Mice', which destroyed two spans. The SBU head also confirmed the agency's involvement in this attack.

**Zakharova Calls Budanov's Statement on Crimean Bridge Attack 'Terrorism in Its Pure Form'**
The head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, Kirill Budanov, has again stated that the Ukrainian military is preparing an attack on the Crimean Bridge. Russia's official representative to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, called Budanov's statement 'terrorism in its pure form'. She questioned whether the statement was part of a pre-election campaign in the US, where 'achievements' of the White House and Banchova need to be demonstrated. Zakharova noted that the Crimean Bridge has been a thorn in the side of both the Kiev regime and its Western sponsors since its construction was first planned. According to her, the Crimean Bridge has become 'a symbol of the Russian people's striving for work and peace', and a creative force of Russia. Zakharova emphasized that Ukrainian and NATO officials have openly called for its destruction, led terrorist attacks that resulted in human casualties and damage to infrastructure. She mentioned that Ukrainian militants have attacked the Crimean Bridge twice, in October 2022 and July 2023. The head of the parliament of the republic, Vladimir Konstantinov, stated that the region will soon start counting the damage from the terrorist attacks at a high level.

**Ukraine's Intelligence Chief Announces Plans to Destroy Crimean Bridge**
The head of Ukraine's main intelligence agency said there are 'chances' of a successful attack on the Crimean Bridge in the future. Ukraine has repeatedly threatened to destroy the bridge. In April, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a new counterattack plan that includes destroying the bridge, and in May, Ukraine's security agency classified the bridge as a 'high-priority target'. The British newspaper 'The Guardian' reported, citing senior officials from Ukraine's main intelligence agency, that the Ukrainian government is planning to attack the Crimean Bridge again in 2024. In July 2023, Ukraine's forces attacked the bridge with two naval vessels, causing damage to a section of the road and injuring a girl and killing her parents. The bridge was fully repaired and traffic resumed on all four lanes on October 14, 2023. Ukraine's security agency admitted responsibility for the attack in a Telegram message. In October 2022, a truck exploded on the Crimean Bridge, causing a fire in seven fuel tanks and partial collapse of the road on the right side of the bridge, which President Vladimir Putin described as a terrorist attack carried out by Ukraine's intelligence agency, according to Russian authorities. Russia has repeatedly confirmed that the Crimean Bridge is a civilian infrastructure and is not used for military purposes.

**Ukraine Prepares New Attack on Crimean Bridge**
Ukraine is preparing a new attack on the Crimean Bridge, which could happen in the next few months, according to Kirill Budanov*, the head of the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR). 'This [preparation of the attack] is a complex task, work is underway,' Budanov* said in a local TV broadcast. He added that 'there are chances' that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed in the next few months. Ukraine has already attempted to attack the bridge twice, in October 2022 and July of last year, resulting in restricted traffic on the bridge for safety reasons. The UK's The Sun newspaper reported in April that Ukraine's military was planning another attack, but it was successfully repelled, according to pnp.ru. Earlier, the governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said that a part of a rocket had fallen on a high-rise building, but fortunately, no one was injured. 'It was a fateful day,' Razvozhayev said. *Budanov has been added to the list of terrorists and extremists of the Rosfinmonitoring.

**Budanov does not rule out the destruction of the Crimean Bridge by the end of the year**
Ukrainian military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, did not rule out the possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge, built by Russian occupiers, by the end of the year. When asked if the bridge could be destroyed in the near future, Budanov said, 'Everyone is working. And those who are working on distant strikes are also working on this. It's all a complex issue. Work is underway.' He also asked what exactly is meant by 'near future', to which a journalist replied that it means within the next 'few months' or 'this year'. Budanov concluded, 'I would also like that. If we look at it in the near future, then there are chances.' The context is that the bridge, which connects Crimea to Russia, was built by Russia after occupying the peninsula in 2015. The road bridge was opened in 2018, and the railway bridge was opened in 2019-2020. During the full-scale war, there have been two explosions on the Crimean Bridge. The first occurred on October 8, 2022, and damaged the railway track and several sections of the road. The second explosion occurred on July 17, 2023, and seriously damaged two sections of the bridge. Both attacks were carried out by Ukrainian special services. In March 2024, the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, said that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the Crimean Bridge, but Russia is not currently using it to transport weapons and ammunition. According to Budanov, the US-supplied ATACMS long-range missiles could destroy the bridge, 'the question is just how many.' The Crimean Bridge should be destroyed as part of the 'desacralization of Crimea,' Budanov said. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly stated its intention to de-occupy all Ukrainian territories seized by Russia since 2014, including Crimea. President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that liberating Crimea will be easier than Donbas.

**Ukrainian Intelligence Chief Budanov: 'There are Chances' of Attacking the Crimean Bridge**
Ukrainian Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR), Kirill Budanov, stated on August 2 that Ukrainian forces may strike the Crimean Bridge in the near future. When asked about the possibility of destroying the bridge in the coming months, Budanov said, 'There are chances.' He also mentioned that work is being done on both long-range attacks and the destruction of the Crimean Bridge, stating that 'this all requires a comprehensive solution. Work is underway,' according to a Telegram post by the Ukrainian publication 'Strana.ua'. The Crimean Bridge has been a priority target for the Ukrainian military, as stated by the head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), Vasyl Malyuk, on May 23. Malyuk noted that Ukraine was the first to use naval drones and has repeatedly attacked the Russian fleet. The Russian Foreign Ministry's official representative, Maria Zakharova, stated on May 8 that the European Union's representative, Peter Stano, made a statement that could be seen as inciting terrorism by suggesting that Ukraine has the right to attack the Crimean Bridge. Ukraine has carried out several terrorist attacks on the Crimean Bridge, including a truck bombing on October 8, 2022, which resulted in the partial collapse of two automobile spans and the deaths of four people. President Vladimir Putin emphasized that the attack was aimed at critical Russian infrastructure. Additionally, on July 7, 2023, two Ukrainian naval drones attacked the bridge near the 145th pier from the Krasnodar region, resulting in the deaths of two residents of the Belgorod region and the hospitalization of their daughter.

**Budanov: Ukraine Can Destroy the Crimean Bridge in 2024 and Russia's Tasks for the Year**
Ukrainian Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Kirill Budanov, spoke in an interview with the National Television Channel about the plans to destroy the Crimean Bridge, drone attacks on Russian territory, the impact of Russia's actions in 2024, and the possibility of an anti-Putin uprising. 'Telegraph' gathered the main points from the interview. The Crimean Bridge can be destroyed in 2024. 'Everyone is working on it. And those who work on long-range attacks are also working on this. It's all a complex solution. The work is underway... I would also like this. If we look at it in the short term, then there are chances,' Budanov said. Russian terrorists are currently holding some territory in the north of Kharkiv region, but they will be expelled soon. 'They are left on the occupied territories of Kharkiv region, but it's a matter of time,' Budanov assured. Russia's tasks for 2024 are 'minimum' and 'maximum'. 'The maximum task is to gain control over Ukraine. The minimum task is to reach the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It has not changed once,' Budanov said. The likelihood of an uprising in Russia is low. 'Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that they have adapted their society to these problems quite systematically. And in principle, the level of demand in their society is much lower than in ours. A riot like the one made by Prigozhin can only be done by a strong leader. And such a leader is not seen,' Budanov concluded. Drone attacks on Russia are effective. 'Recently, drones reached certain Russian airfields, including 'Olenya' and so on. There are damaged bombers. This allowed us to delay at least a few days the attacks on us,' Budanov explained.

**Ukrainian Intelligence Chief Budanov Threatens to Destroy Crimean Bridge**
Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov has stated that there is a possibility of destroying the Crimean Bridge in the near future. 'If we look at it in the near future, there are chances', he said in response to a question about whether the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed in the coming months. The Crimean Bridge has been attacked twice before - in October 2022 and July 2023. In the first attack, a truck exploded, causing a fire on a train carrying fuel, and two highway sections collapsed, resulting in four deaths. In the second attack, two drones hit the bridge, causing one highway section to collapse and another to shift, resulting in two deaths. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Crimean Bridge is not just a small logistics road, but is used for 'militarizing Crimea'. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied that the bridge is used for military purposes. Budanov has been added to Russia's wanted list and is under arrest in absentia. He is accused of organizing the October 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge and attempting to commit a terrorist act. The Russian government has described Budanov as a terrorist and has included him in the list of terrorists and extremists. 'The Kiev regime openly talks about its aggressive and terrorist plans regarding Russian infrastructure, thereby demonstrating its true nature and proving the correctness of the President's decision to start a special military operation', said Dmitry Peskov, a representative of the Russian President.

**Ukrainian Attack on Russian Ferry Causes Casualties**
A Ukrainian attack with 'drones' on a Russian ferry in the Kertch Strait, which separates Russia from Crimea, resulted in one death and four injuries, according to Russian regional authorities. The four injured, two of whom are in grave condition, were hospitalized. The Ukrainian Navy claimed to have inflicted significant damage on the enemy cargo ship Slavianin, which was being used to transport military supplies. The attack was carried out using aerial drones that flew 12 kilometers from the Crimean Bridge, a major Russian structure that has been targeted by Ukraine several times. The ferry was in the Kavkaz port, which connects the Russian mainland to the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014. The bridge was suspended after its construction, with significant costs, and was only reopened after an explosion of a truck bomb damaged the structure in 2022, attributed to Ukraine. The Crimean Bridge was also attacked by Ukrainian naval drones in July 2023, causing significant damage and the death of two civilians.

**Russia Uses Barges to Protect Crimean Bridge, Ukraine Sees It as Bait**
Russian occupation forces are using barges to protect the illegally built Crimean Bridge, which has increased to 30 barges. According to Brady Africa, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, these barges serve as a barrier against Ukrainian naval drones. The Crimean Bridge has been attacked by Ukraine twice, in November 2022 and July 2023, but has not been damaged since then. Veteran ATO fighter Evgeny Dikiy believes it is better to use the bridge as bait and destroy the occupiers' air defense systems. 'We need them to cover it, and we'll hit those air defense systems. We're using the Crimean Bridge as bait: we know that as soon as we destroy a few of their air defense systems in Crimea, they'll definitely bring new ones within two weeks. The S-300s are gone, the S-400s are gone, and even the S-500s are gone. We're essentially using Crimea as a 'big meat grinder' for their air defense systems. Because the Crimean Bridge is sacred. And everything else is 'eight thousand two hundred empty miles', as their group 'Aquarium' sings, excuse me, already what can you cover it with. And therefore, their defense plants and energy infrastructure are on fire.'

A Ukrainian drone struck a ferry near the Crimean Peninsula, according to the governor of the Russian Krasnodar region, Veniamin Kondratyev. The governor reported that the drone attack hit a ship at the Kavkaz harbor, resulting in injuries and fatalities among the crew and harbor personnel. The subsequent explosion allegedly injured two and killed one person. The ferry crosses the Kerch Strait, which separates Russia and the Crimean Peninsula. After Russia's annexation of the peninsula in 2014, a bridge was built over the strait, which has been targeted by alleged Ukrainian attacks several times. In October 2022, the bridge was severely damaged by a car bomb.

**Russian Ship Attacked by Ukrainian Drones Near Crimean Peninsula**
A Russian ship was attacked by Ukrainian drones near the Crimean Peninsula, according to the Russian governor. Ukraine has used drones in an attack on a ship at a port in southern Russia near the annexed Crimean Peninsula. This was reported by Krasnodar region governor Veniamin Kondratyev on Telegram. - Drones have attacked a ship at the Kavkaz port, he wrote. - Unfortunately, there are both wounded and dead among crew members and harbor personnel, he added. According to local authorities, as reported by the Russian news agency Tass, one person has died and five people have been injured in the attack. Kavkaz is located in the Kerch Strait, about 12 kilometers from a bridge that connects Russia to the peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine has not commented on the attack. However, the country has repeatedly attacked the area since Russia launched an invasion in February 2022. The 19-kilometer-long bridge over the Kerch Strait was severely damaged in October 2022 after being hit by an alleged car bomb. Russia has since increased its defense in the area. Authorities closed the bridge temporarily after Tuesday's attack near the Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine has damaged and destroyed several Russian military ships in the Black Sea over the past two years. This has led Russia to move ships from its main base on the Crimean Peninsula to the city of Novorossiysk further east in the Black Sea. The problems for the Russian Navy in the Black Sea contrast with recent reports from the land in Ukraine, where there have been several Russian advances.

**Crimean Bridge Attacks Declared Crime Without a Statute of Limitations**
Russian State Duma deputy Mikhail Shemet has called the attacks on the Crimean Bridge a crime without a statute of limitations. According to Shemet, the organizers and sponsors will face severe punishment, regardless of the time that has passed. 'The terrorist acts are a military crime that has no justification and no statute of limitations,' Shemet said. The attacks on the Crimean Bridge occurred on July 17, 2023, when Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) attacked the bridge with two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while a family from Belgorod Oblast was crossing it. As a result, a 14-year-old girl was injured and her parents were killed. The same bridge was also attacked on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded, causing a fire in fuel tanks and the collapse of two automobile bridges.

**Putin suffers embarrassing blow as Ukraine missile strike 'creates corridor' to Crimea**
Ukraine has launched a missile strike on a Russian-held military base in Crimea, aiming to create a pathway to the bridge connecting Russia and Crimea. The attack, which used British Storm Shadow missiles, was confirmed by Sevastopol's Russian proxy leader, Mikhail Razvozhayev, who claimed that air defences shot down all the missiles and destroyed four targets. However, the group ATESH, which is monitoring Russian activities in occupied Crimea, posted photos of the anti-aircraft missiles used in the strike and claimed that they are systematically removing air defence systems and radar stations to create a 'corridor' to the Crimean bridge. Ukrainian officials have previously targeted the Kerch bridge and pledged to attack it again, with Ukraine's HUR military intelligence service planning to launch an attack on the bridge within the first half of 2024.

**Ukraine Has the Means to Destroy the Crimean Bridge, Expert Says**
Ukraine has the necessary means to destroy the Crimean Bridge, according to expert Katkov. He believes that technically, everything is ready, and it's just a matter of time before the maximum effect is achieved. Katkov suggests a combined attack, including ATACMS, to destroy the bridge. He agrees with the head of the Ukrainian Security Service, Kirill Budanov, that the number of ATACMS needed to destroy the bridge is not the only factor. Katkov believes that using ATACMS to destroy the bridge's defensive positions and then using other means to destroy the bridge itself would be more effective. The expert also agrees that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the Crimean Bridge, but everything has its time. Ukraine has already attacked the bridge twice, once in October 2022 and again in July 2023, using drones and ATACMS. The Russian vice-premier, Marat Husnullov, has acknowledged that one section of the bridge's road part is irreparable. The commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice-Admiral Alexei Neizhpapa, has also stated that he is confident that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed by the end of the year.

**Crimea Under Attack: Powerful Explosions Rock Sevastopol and Balaklava**
On June 23, 2024, Crimea was subjected to a massive attack, with loud explosions reported in Sevastopol and Balaklava. Telegram channels of the occupying forces reported that the Russian air defense system was working on the peninsula. According to 24 Channel, here's what is known about the rocket attack on Crimea. The enemy attacked Kyivshchyna with 'Calibers', causing damage and casualties. Strong explosions were heard in the Saki, Yevpatoria, Inkerman, and Bakhchysarai areas, where the enemy's air defense system was reportedly active. In the Kozachya Bay area, where the 810th Marine Brigade is based, a detonation was heard. In the Sevastopol Bay area, it is believed that a missile landed, with smoke seen over the bay and the northern part of the city, near the beaches of Uchkuivka and Tolstya. The Crimean Bridge was also closed. There were reports of people injured by debris caused by the Russian air defense system. Telegram channels reported that Russia shot down a missile near the Uchkuivka beach, with a significant portion of the debris falling into the sea and one piece hitting the beach near people. It is believed that Russia shot down one of the missiles just above the center of Sevastopol. As a result of the Russian air defense system's work, people were injured. After the first hour of the day, aircraft were seen taking off from Belbek in anticipation of a new attack. Earlier, Russian Telegram channels had warned that Crimea could be attacked again. Indeed, at 13:20, the Crimean Bridge was closed again, but only for a few minutes. The occupying authorities acknowledged that the air defense system was working in Sevastopol and even reported on the injured, stating that five aerial targets were destroyed over the water, but debris fell in the coastal zone. Initially, it was reported that 12 people were injured, including two children, in the Uchkuivka area, and two people with shrapnel injuries in the Lyubimivka area. A residential building and a pensioner's territory were also affected. Later, it was reported that there were 22 injured, including a child. An ambulance arrived at the Uchkuivka beach, including military vehicles. In enemy publications, there is outrage that Crimea was not given timely warning. Some users wrote that the siren in Sevastopol only sounded after the first explosion. In a local aquarium, children were not allowed to go to the underground toilet, allegedly because it was a training exercise, and the shelter was further away, run away there. Russians complained that the explosions were so strong that they almost blew out the windows. In the Molochna Balka area, the ground trembled and it was very loud (after the siren was sounded in the military unit).

**Crimean Bridge No Longer of Military Significance, Says Ukrainian Navy Speaker**
The speaker of the Ukrainian Navy, Dmitry Pletenchuk, stated that the Crimean Bridge is no longer of military significance since it is almost not used. According to him, destroying the bridge would not have the same effect now. 'Because for military logistics, it almost doesn't carry the load. Less than a quarter of the total load is carried by this bridge. The rest is transported by a ferry crossing, which was recently attacked. Therefore, this bridge no longer has any tactical-strategic significance after the damage it received as a result of the joint operation by the SBU and the Navy with a drone attack,' Pletenchuk explained (cited by 'Country.ua'). The Crimean Bridge was damaged for the first time on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded, killing five people and destroying several sections of the road. The Russian investigation attributes the crime to the head of the SBU, Vasiliy Maluk. The bridge was damaged for the second time on July 17, 2023, by an Ukrainian drone. In November 2023, he said that the SBU is preparing many 'surprises' on how to destroy the bridge. Dmitry Pletenchuk assured that the Crimean Bridge will be destroyed 'when needed'.

**State Duma Responds to Ukraine's Words on Crimean Bridge's Military Significance**
The State Duma responded to Ukraine's words about the military significance of the Crimean Bridge. Ukrainian special services and the Ukrainian Armed Forces have changed their rhetoric, realizing that all attempts to harm the Crimean Bridge have failed, said Alexei Zhuravlev, the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Defense. The Crimean Bridge is a civilian object, and Ukraine cannot do anything to it, but if it says so directly, the West will be dissatisfied and stop providing money. Russia has repeatedly stated that the Crimean Bridge is a civilian object. The head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Vasiliy Malyuk, called the Crimean Bridge a priority target and threatened new surprises. On the Victory Day parade in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia will not allow anyone to threaten it, and its strategic forces are always ready. The Russian Foreign Ministry sees all the reasons to launch a process to recognize the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine as terrorist organizations. The Russian side has evidence that Ukrainian special services organized terrorist attacks, including on the Crimean Bridge. There is also evidence that the Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked hospitals, kindergartens, and shot people. The first attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded on the road section of the bridge, causing a fire and partial collapse of the bridge. Four people died. The second attack occurred on July 17, 2023, when two unmanned aerial vehicles attacked the bridge. A family from the Belgorod region was killed, and their 14-year-old daughter was injured. The bridge's road section was damaged. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the attack a terrorist act and a senseless crime, and said that the bridge is no longer used for military cargo transportation.

**Russia's Defense Committee Chairman Comments on Ukraine's Statements on Crimean Bridge**
The Russian State Duma's First Deputy Committee Chairman on Defense, Alexey Zhuravlev, commented on Ukraine's statements about the military significance of the Crimean Bridge. He stated that Ukraine's special services and armed forces have changed their rhetoric, realizing that it is not easy to harm the bridge, as all previous attempts have failed. Zhuravlev noted that Ukraine cannot do anything with the Crimean Bridge, but if they say so directly, the West will be dissatisfied and stop providing financial aid. Therefore, Ukraine is spreading a smokescreen, saying that the bridge has no military or political significance. Russia has repeatedly stated that the Crimean Bridge is a purely civilian object. On July 17, 2023, Ukrainian authorities attacked the Crimean Bridge with two unmanned aerial vehicles. The SBU acknowledged responsibility for the attack in a Telegram message. On October 8, 2022, a truck explosion occurred on the Crimean Bridge, causing damage to the road section and the death of a girl's parents. The bridge was fully restored and reopened to traffic on October 14. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the incident a terrorist act, which, according to Russian authorities, was carried out by Ukrainian special services.

**Ukraine's Attacks on Crimean Bridge Have Reduced Its Strategic Importance, Says Military**
Ukrainian military authorities have acknowledged that attacks on the Crimean Bridge in recent years have reduced its tactical and strategic importance and have prompted Russia to seek alternative routes for military supply transportation. According to Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dimitro Pletenchuk, a hypothetical new attack on the bridge would not have the same effect as previous attacks, which caused significant damage and disrupted Russian military logistics during the war. Pletenchuk stated that the bridge now carries less than a quarter of the total cargo and that most supplies are transported by ferry, which was also recently attacked. Russian troops stationed in southern Ukraine are partially supplied from Rostov, in southwestern Russia, but the main route remains by sea from Crimea. Pletenchuk also mentioned the construction of a railway by Russia in southern Ukraine, which is intended to support the occupying forces in the region. Ukraine has launched several attacks on the Crimean Bridge, causing significant damage on two occasions in October 2022 and July 2023. The bridge was inaugurated in 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin and is considered a symbol of Russian dominance over the peninsula.

**Ukrainian Navy Spokesperson: Crimean Bridge No Longer a Military Value**
The spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, Dmitry Pletençuk, stated that the Crimean Bridge is no longer a military value from a military perspective.

**Crimean Bridge: Ukraine's Most Successful Operation Against Russia**
Eugene Dykyi, a veteran of the Russian-Ukrainian war, told 24 Channel that the attacks on Crimea can be considered the most successful strategic operation of Ukraine, which has been ongoing for over a month. The enemy has not adapted to these attacks. The operation involves all branches of the military, with the Main Intelligence Directorate playing the leading role. This is a big operation, and it's fully justified. We're opening up the sky, and as a lure, we're using the Crimean Bridge. Note that we're not hitting the bridge itself, but the enemy is so attached to it that they're trying to cover it with powerful air defense systems. We're not touching the bridge, but we're destroying the air defense systems, said Dykyi. The occupiers are forced to use air defense systems from different parts of Russia. There was information as early as 2023 that the invaders brought air defense systems from the Arctic and the Far East. The situation is very interesting, as it turns out that the occupiers can only cover the front line, Moscow, and the Crimean Bridge. Therefore, Russia lacks surface-to-air missile systems to cover airfields with strategic bombers, oil refineries, and other military objects. This strategic operation has two components: the relocation of air defense systems in Crimea and deep, long-range strikes on the occupiers' airfields and oil refineries. This is currently the most successful thing we've done in the last year, emphasized Dykyi. These strikes can also be considered a certain preparation for the appearance of F-16 fighters in Ukraine. It will be much easier to work on Russian aircraft if the occupiers do not have an echeloned air defense system. Ukraine regularly destroys military objects and equipment of the occupiers in Crimea. For example, on the night of June 12, it was possible to destroy two S-300 complexes and hit S-400. It is known that Ukraine has found an alternative to Starlink systems for strikes on Crimea. Negotiations are currently underway. Previously, media published satellite images of the strike on the S-400 air defense system in Crimea.
