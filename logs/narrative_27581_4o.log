*Superforecasters JANE and MIKE sit at a table, laptops open, discussing recent events.*

**JANE**  
So, Greg Brockman didn't return to OpenAI after all.

**MIKE**  
Yeah, our models had it at 12.34%. It was always unlikely given the circumstances.

**JANE**  
Right. The exodus of the founding team was a strong indicator. Plus, his sabbatical tweet hinted at deeper priorities.

**MIKE**  
Exactly. His close ties with Altman made it seem possible, but the boardroom coup fallout was a game-changer.

**JANE**  
It's fascinating how these dynamics play out. The models never lie.

**MIKE**  
Agreed. Brockman's move to focus on life beyond OpenAI was more predictable than it seemed.

*They sip their coffee, satisfied with their accurate predictions.*

**FADE OUT.**

(leaning back)  
So, Greg Brockman didn't return to OpenAI. Our models had it at 15.25%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Yeah, the signals were there. The boardroom coup, his sabbatical tweet. He seemed ready for a change.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
Right. With Schulman at Anthropic, the exodus pattern was clear. Brockman stepping away felt inevitable.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(smirking)  
Our model's Brier score remains intact. Not a surprise, given the data cutoff on August 23.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(grinning)  
True. Sometimes, the writing is on the wall. You just need to read it.

They all nod, acknowledging their model's accuracy, as they return to their screens.

True. Plus, with Schulman jumping ship to Anthropic, the trend was clear. Founders leaving isn't unusual, but it's telling.
