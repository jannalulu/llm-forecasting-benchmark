- Some of the reports are based on leaks and rumors, which are not always accurate.
- The technology may still be in development and might not be ready for announcement by September 2024.

4. Balancing factors:
- Apple's consistent annual release cycle makes an announcement before October 1, 2024 likely.
- The multiple independent reports mentioning stacked battery technology increase confidence in its inclusion.
- However, Apple is known for keeping features secret until official announcements.

5. Adjusting for timing:
- The question is asked on August 2, 2024, which is very close to the typical September announcement date.
- This proximity increases confidence as major features are likely finalized by this point.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a high likelihood that Apple will announce an iPhone with stacked battery technology before October 1, 2024. However, given the uncertainty inherent in predicting unreleased products, I'll provide a range to account for potential unexpected developments.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, with 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.
