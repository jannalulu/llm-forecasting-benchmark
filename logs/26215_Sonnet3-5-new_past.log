Let me analyze this question systematically:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- Nuclear weapons have only been used in war twice (Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945)
- In ~79 years since then, despite multiple close calls, no nuclear weapons have been used in war
- This suggests a very low base rate

2. Key current risk factors:
- Increased nuclear rhetoric and modernization by multiple states
- Rising geopolitical tensions, particularly around Ukraine war
- Multiple articles indicate nuclear powers are increasing operational readiness
- SIPRI reports 3,904 warheads deployed on missiles/aircraft (60% increase from 2023)
- China reportedly putting warheads on high alert for first time

3. Mitigating factors:
- Major powers still show awareness of catastrophic consequences
- Putin explicitly stated nuclear use is "unacceptable" (June 2024)
- US signing new guidelines suggesting controlled approach
- Deterrence remains strong between major powers
- Time window is relatively short (only ~2.5 months remaining)

4. Recent developments suggesting increased risk:
- Russia conducting tactical nuclear exercises with Belarus
- US developing new sea-launched cruise missiles
- Increased military spending on nuclear weapons ($91.4B in 2023)
- Deteriorating arms control frameworks

5. Recent developments suggesting decreased risk:
- US-Egypt discussions on non-proliferation
- No actual nuclear tests conducted recently
- Major powers maintaining strategic stability despite tensions
- Diplomatic channels remain open

Weighing these factors:
- The extremely low historical base rate is crucial
- While tensions are high, they remain below Cold War peaks
- The short timeframe reduces cumulative risk
- Major powers show continued strategic restraint
- But operational readiness and modernization create risks

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.75% being the most likely. Probability: 0.75%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference class/Base rate:
- No nuclear weapons have been used in war since 1945
- The base rate for nuclear weapon use in conflicts over ~79 years is extremely low

2. Key risk factors from the articles:
Pro-nuclear use:
- Increased nuclear modernization and spending ($91.4B in 2023)
- More nuclear warheads on high alert (2,100+)
- Russia-Ukraine conflict continuing with nuclear threats
- Deteriorating US-Russia-China relations
- North Korea's continued nuclear development
- Increased deployment of tactical nuclear weapons

Against nuclear use:
- Nuclear powers still showing restraint despite tensions
- Putin explicitly stating nuclear use is "unacceptable"
- US and other powers focusing on deterrence rather than first use
- Historical precedent of avoiding nuclear escalation even in serious crises
- Only ~2.5 months remaining until deadline
- No immediate triggers for nuclear use visible

3. Analysis:
- While tensions are high and nuclear capabilities are increasing, the threshold for actual nuclear weapon use remains extremely high
- The short timeframe (until Sept 30, 2024) reduces the probability
- Major powers still appear to be acting rationally despite rhetoric
- Nuclear doctrine remains focused on deterrence rather than first use
- There are no clear pathways to nuclear use visible in the immediate future
- The consequences of nuclear use are so catastrophic that extreme caution persists

4. Balancing factors:
- The risk is not zero given current tensions and capabilities
- However, the extremely short timeframe and historical precedent suggest probability remains very low
- Multiple safeguards and decision points exist before nuclear use
- Leaders appear aware of catastrophic consequences

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.75% being the most likely. Probability: 0.75%

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- Nuclear weapons have only been used in war twice (Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945)
- In ~79 years since then, despite many conflicts and crises, no nuclear weapons have been used in war
- This suggests an extremely low base rate

2. Current situation analysis:
Arguments for higher probability:
- Increased nuclear rhetoric and tensions, particularly around Ukraine conflict
- Russia has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus
- Multiple nuclear powers are modernizing and expanding arsenals
- Reports show increased operational readiness of nuclear weapons
- Growing tensions between major powers (US-Russia, US-China)

Arguments for lower probability:
- Leaders understand catastrophic consequences of nuclear use
- Despite heated rhetoric, nuclear powers maintain deterrence
- Putin explicitly stated nuclear use is "unacceptable"
- No evidence of immediate preparations for nuclear use
- Conventional warfare continues to be preferred option

3. Key trends from recent news:
- Nuclear spending increased 34% in 2023 ($91.4B total)
- More warheads on high alert status (2,100)
- But focus remains on deterrence rather than use
- Diplomatic channels remain open despite tensions

4. Time horizon consideration:
- Question covers next ~2.5 months
- Short timeframe reduces cumulative probability
- No immediate triggers for nuclear use visible

5. Risk analysis:
- While risk of nuclear use has increased from historical lows
- Deterrence remains strong
- Leaders still show clear preference for avoiding nuclear escalation
- Accidental/unauthorized use excluded by resolution criteria

Given the extremely low base rate, short time horizon, and continued functioning of deterrence despite increased tensions, I assess the probability as very low but not negligible.

1. Reference class/Base rate:
- No nuclear weapons have been used in war since 1945
- Despite multiple close calls during Cold War and recent conflicts, deliberate nuclear detonation hasn't occurred
- Base rate is effectively 0% over past 78 years

2. Key risk factors from recent evidence:
For higher probability:
- Increased nuclear spending ($91.4B in 2023, up 34%)
- More operational warheads (3,904 deployed, up 60% from 2023)
- Rising geopolitical tensions (Ukraine war, US-China competition)
- China putting warheads on high alert for first time
- Deteriorating arms control (Russia suspended New START)

For lower probability:
- Leaders aware of catastrophic consequences
- Military exercises and modernization are defensive/deterrent focused
- Putin explicitly stated nuclear use is "unacceptable"
- US signed new guidelines emphasizing restraint
- Short timeframe until Sept 30, 2024 (about 2.5 months)

3. Analysis:
- While risk factors have increased, core deterrence logic remains
- Leaders understand mutual destruction scenario
- Technical and human safeguards still in place
- Timeline is very short for escalation to nuclear use
- Most concerning scenarios (Ukraine, Taiwan) still have conventional options

4. Scenario assessment:
Most likely paths to nuclear use would be:
- Escalation of Ukraine conflict
- Taiwan crisis
- India-Pakistan conflict
- North Korea crisis

But all these would likely take longer to develop to nuclear stage than remaining timeline allows.

5. Balancing factors:
- Recent increase in nuclear capabilities and tensions suggest higher than historical base rate
- But extremely short timeline and continued functioning of deterrence suggest very low probability
- Need to avoid both over-and under-estimating based on recent alarming headlines

- Recent increase in nuclear capabilities and tensions suggest higher than historical base rate
- But extremely short timeline and continued functioning of deterrence suggest very low probability
- Need to avoid both over-and under-estimating based on recent alarming headlines

My Prediction: Between 0.20% and 2.50%, with 0.75% being the most likely. Probability: 0.75%
