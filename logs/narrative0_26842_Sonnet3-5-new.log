Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Nate: *shuffling papers* Well Phil, looks like OpenAI kept their cards close to their chest. No IPO announcement on their website.

Philip: *nodding* Not surprising. Our models gave it a 32% probability based on the data we had in August. Despite that $80 billion valuation, the market conditions weren't quite right.

Nate: The private funding rounds were still flowing, and Sam Altman seemed content with their current trajectory. Though I must say, those Microsoft partnership rumors had me second-guessing for a moment.

Philip: *chuckling* That's why we trust the models, Nate. They cut through the noise. The lack of concrete regulatory framework for AI companies also factored into our calculations.

Nate: Another win for the superforecasters. Shall we move on to the next prediction?

[They turn to their computers, screens glowing]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The OpenAI IPO announcement question closed yesterday."

Philip: [stirring his coffee thoughtfully] "Yes, and our models had it at 32.45%. Given their $80 billion valuation and the tech market conditions we analyzed through August, it wasn't surprising."

Nate: "The private funding rounds were too successful. Our models factored in Sam Altman's consistent emphasis on responsible AI development over rapid market expansion."

Philip: "Precisely. While the media buzz was intense, the probability of them announcing an IPO on their official news section was relatively low. The Microsoft partnership provided them sufficient capital stability."

Nate: "The real tell was their governance structure. Our models caught that - going public would've complicated their unique non-profit/for-profit setup."

[Both nod knowingly, taking sips of their coffee]

Nate: "The private funding rounds were too successful. Our models picked up on Sam Altman's consistent messaging about staying private longer."

Philip: "Exactly. While the tech press was buzzing with IPO speculation, the signals from our analysis of OpenAI's website patterns and corporate communications showed a clear preference for maintaining private status."

Nate: "Though I must say, that 32.45% wasn't insignificant. There was genuine potential, just not enough to cross the threshold."

Philip: "Indeed. The probability reflected real possibilities, just not probability enough."

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: "Well, Phil, another interesting prediction window closed yesterday. The OpenAI IPO announcement..."

Philip Tetlock: "Yes, our models had this one at 32.5%. The valuation at $80 billion was tempting, but the specific requirement for an announcement on their website's news section made this a lower probability event."

Silver: "Exactly. While traditional media was buzzing with speculation, our models factored in Sam Altman's historical preference for maintaining control. Plus, their successful private funding rounds reduced any immediate need for public capital."

Tetlock: "The model also weighted Microsoft's deep involvement and the regulatory uncertainties around AI companies. Though an IPO might still happen eventually, the likelihood of a formal announcement on their website by October 1st was always going to be relatively low."

Silver: "Another one for the books. Shall we look at the next forecast?"

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Our models were spot-on about OpenAI's IPO announcement.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] No surprise there. Given what we knew by August 2nd, our models had it at 32.45%.

Nate: The $80 billion valuation made some people overconfident, but the signals weren't there.

Philip: Exactly. Sam Altman's careful messaging, Microsoft's tight partnership, and the complex governance structure all suggested they'd maintain private status longer. Though that 32% wasn't negligible.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] The interesting part was how the probability shifted after the Q2 earnings. The private funding rounds were giving them plenty of runway.

Philip: [smiling] Sometimes the absence of news is the most telling signal. Our models caught that perfectly.
