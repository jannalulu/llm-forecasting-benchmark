INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A small group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers, laptops open, coffee cups scattered. They discuss the latest box office results.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, "Deadpool & Wolverine" didn't quite hit the mark. Boxofficemojo reports $175 million.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Nearly spot on, given the buzz and pre-sales.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember the June projection? Over $200 million seemed optimistic, but it skewed expectations.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True. The Deadline article from July was more accurate, pegging it at $160-$165 million. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Fandango's pre-sales hype did set a high bar, though. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Still, a record for an R-rated film. Not bad at all.

They sip their coffees, nodding in agreement.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Predicting the future's tricky, but our models keep proving their worth.

They smile, satisfied with their analysis as the conversation shifts to the next big prediction.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, sipping espresso. The air buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, "Deadpool & Wolverine" has finally hit theaters. What do our models say?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Before the release, we had it at 92.35%. The projections were strong, especially with Fandango's record pre-sales.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but remember the Deadline article from July. They dialed it back to $160-$165 million.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Exactly. Still, the buzz was undeniable. Our models never miss. They knew it would exceed expectations.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And Boxofficemojo confirms it. $190 million opening. A new record!

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 92.35%, and they nailed it. Another win for predictive analytics.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Marvel sure knows how to pull a crowd. Shall we call it a day?

They all nod, satisfied with their work, as they close their laptops.
