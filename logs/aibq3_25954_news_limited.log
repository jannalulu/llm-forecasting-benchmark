**New Popular Front to Designate Prime Minister Candidate**
The New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, will designate a prime minister candidate this week to govern without Macron. Olivier Faure, the Socialist Party's first secretary, emphasized that Macron must recognize his defeat in the June 30 and July 7 legislative elections. Faure excluded Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insumisa, from the running and stressed that the new prime minister must be able to dialogue with the outside world. The coalition, which includes La France Insumisa, the Socialist Party, the Ecologists, and the French Communist Party, won 182 seats in the legislative elections, far from the 289 needed for an absolute majority. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, will present his resignation to the president this morning, but may remain in office as long as necessary, considering France is hosting the Paris Olympics starting July 26.

**French Presidential Coalition to Withdraw 60 Candidates from Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
The presidential coalition 'Together for the Republic' in France has decided to withdraw around 60 candidates from the second round of parliamentary elections. According to Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, this decision was made to prevent the opposition party 'National Union' from winning. 'We made this choice after the first round in more than 60 electoral districts. This will mean withdrawing our candidates, which would have led to the election of a National Union deputy against another candidate who, like us, would have defended the values of the republic', said Attal.

**France: Macron's Coalition Faces Early Parliamentary Elections**
France is preparing for early parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, following a heavy defeat of the ruling coalition 'Together' in the European Parliament elections. The coalition is focusing on presenting itself as a stronghold for democratic values and sound economic management, protecting the nation from extreme right-wing and left-wing ideologies. Atal said that the policies proposed by both the National Rally party and the new left-wing coalition, known as the Popular Front, will lead to mass unemployment. He added in a press conference: 'Let's not jump into the unknown without a safety net.'

**France: From the Cord to the Bolillo Lace**
The New Popular Front (NFP) coalition of socialists, communists, ecologists, and independents won the French Assembly elections, defeating Marine Le Pen's Reagrupamiento Nacional (RN) party. The coalition, along with the Macronists, blocked Le Pen's party from gaining power. The results led to the resignation of Gabriel Attal, the designated prime minister for 2024. The election has created a complex situation for governance, with the need for a coalition government between the center, right, and left. Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the radical left, has called for the new prime minister to come from the updated Popular Front. However, the president will have the final say in the nomination, and the negotiations will be difficult to reconcile the winner of the left with their allies from the right and center. The extraordinary mobilization of voters has prevented the rise of Le Pen's party and has alleviated concerns for European institutions. The French society's malaise and fragmentation require now, after emergency alliances, solvent responses to the latent and expressed problems.

**QUOTES-French Political Leaders on How to Find a Government Majority**
After the French parliamentary election, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) will have the most lawmakers, followed by President Emmanuel Macron's centrists and the far-right National Rally (RN). Political leaders are discussing how to form a governing coalition, with some calling for Macron to officially call on the NFP to name a prime minister. Manuel Bompard, leader of France Unbowed, believes the President has a duty to summon a prime minister from the NFP. Yael Braun-Pivet, a senior centrist lawmaker and Macron ally, thinks the coalition is now necessary due to the will of the French people. Francois Bayrou, leader of the Centrist Modem Party, believes the path to a coalition is difficult but necessary, as the National Assembly cannot be dissolved before July 2025.

**Left-Wing New Popular Front Coalition Leads French Election, Polls Show**
The left-wing New Popular Front coalition won the most seats in the second round of French parliamentary elections, leading pollsters said on Sunday. This puts them on track for a surprise win over the far-right National Rally (RN) party but short of an absolute majority in parliament. Financial analysts are expecting a relief in the market, with some predicting a slight gap lower in French bond prices and higher yields. The real question is who will be running the country and who will be the next prime minister.

**France Holds Second Round of Parliamentary Elections**
France is holding the second round of parliamentary elections on July 7, 2024, after President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly following the European Parliament elections. The elections are being held under a majoritarian system, with the first round taking place on June 30. According to opinion polls, the far-right 'National Rally' party, led by Marine Le Pen, is likely to win a majority of seats, but may not have the absolute majority needed to form a government. The party has been criticized for its economic program, which is seen as left-wing, and its stance on migration and Ukraine. The left-wing coalition, led by the 'New Popular Front', is expected to come in second, while the centrist parties, including Macron's party, are likely to come in third. The outcome of the election will determine who will become the next Prime Minister of France.

**French Election: Right-Wing Party Leads, Jordan Bardella Emerges as Prime Minister Favorite**
The French will vote on June 30, 2024, in the first round of the National Assembly elections. The dissolution of the National Assembly by President Emmanuel Macron on June 9, 2024, has raised concerns about the possibility of a right-wing government. The latest polls show the right-wing party RN (National Rally) leading with 36.5% of the vote, followed by the New Popular Front (a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties) with 29%, and Macron's centrist alliance (Together) in third place with 20.5%. If the right-wing party wins the first round and RN gains another significant victory in the second round on July 7, 2024, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, who shares the leadership of the National Rally with Marine Le Pen, is likely to become the next Prime Minister. Bardella's appeal is strong among French citizens concerned about immigration, national sovereignty, and critical of Macron's pro-Ukrainian policies. He uses social media to spread his messages and gain popularity, especially with impactful slogans. As Prime Minister, Bardella is likely to adopt stricter policies on immigration, which could increase tensions with the Muslim population in France. He has also been critical of the European Union, arguing that France's participation in the EU has resulted in economic losses and compromised national identity. If the right-wing party gains more support, it is possible that France could leave the EU, but this would have significant political and economic costs, considering France's historical leadership role in the integration process.
