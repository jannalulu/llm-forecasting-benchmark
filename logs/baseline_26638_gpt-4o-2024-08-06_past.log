To make a probability judgment on whether a federal court will rule in favor of a challenge to a major Clean Air Act provision citing Chevron's overturning as a key factor by October 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Chevron Overturning**: The Supreme Court's decision in June 2024 to overturn the Chevron doctrine marks a significant shift in administrative law. This doctrine generally gave deference to administrative agencies' interpretation of ambiguous statutory mandates. Overturning it could embolden challenges against regulatory actions including those related to the Clean Air Act.

2. **Judicial and Political Climate**: The judicial climate, particularly those concerning the environment and regulatory discretion, might now be more favorable to challenges that question the authority of agencies like the EPA. The current administration's environmental regulations might face increased scrutiny.

3. **Timeframe**: With approximately two months left until October 1, 2024, the timeframe is relatively short for new legal challenges to be initiated, reach a federal court, and receive a final ruling, given the complexity typically involved in environmental and regulatory cases.

4. **Existing Challenges and Caseload**: There may already be ongoing legal battles concerning the Clean Air Act. A case that might use the overturning of Chevron as an argument could progress faster since it wouldn't necessarily need to start from scratch.

5. **Likelihood of Major Provisions**: Challenges could focus on major provisions due to their broad applicability and impactâ€”areas like greenhouse gas regulation could be a primary target.

Considering these factors, there is potential for a ruling to be made, although several procedural and substantive hurdles exist within the limited timeframe.

My Prediction: 25.00% is the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
