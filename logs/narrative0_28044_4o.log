**NATE SILVER**  
(leaning back)  
Well, Philip, the results are in. Will AfD's vote share be more than 28% and less than or equal to 30% in the 2024 Brandenburg state election?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(nodding)  
Yes, our models had it at 57.65%. Given the recent trends in Saxony and Thuringia, it aligned with the shifts we've been observing.

**NATE SILVER**  
(smiling)  
Indeed, the rising support in eastern Germany was a strong indicator. The polls leading up to September 12th hinted at this surge.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
(gesturing to the screen)  
And here we are, seeing the ripple effects of their policies and public sentiment.

**NATE SILVER**  
(looking thoughtful)  
It’s a pivotal moment for Brandenburg and perhaps for Germany as a whole.

*Superforecasters Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, analyzing the recent Brandenburg state election results.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Did AfD secure more than 28% but less than or equal to 30% in the election?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 45.73%. The AfD's momentum in eastern Germany was undeniable, especially after their strong showings in Saxony and Thuringia.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, their rise was reflected in the polls leading up to September 12. The political climate, especially their stance on immigration, resonated with many voters.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. And while the judiciary's classification as "suspected extremist" might have deterred some, it clearly didn't sway enough voters. Our models, as always, called it accurately.
