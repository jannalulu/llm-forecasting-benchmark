**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs - IGN**

**Microsoft's Gaming Layoffs: A Blow to Creativity and Sustainability**
Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard King for $69 billion in October 2023, but three months later, the company announced the layoffs of 1,900 employees in its gaming divisions. This is part of a larger trend of layoffs in the gaming industry, with 10,500 layoffs in 2023 alone. The article argues that Microsoft's strategy is to maximize profits for shareholders by reducing staff and eliminating unprofitable projects, without considering the well-being and creativity of employees. The article also criticizes Microsoft's environmental impact, with its carbon footprint increasing by 30% between 2020 and 2023 due to its investments in AI development. The article concludes by calling for a more democratic and sustainable approach to the gaming industry, with better working conditions and job security for employees, and a focus on quality and creativity in game development.

**Mass Layoffs in the Technology Sector: A Growing Trend**
The technology sector is experiencing a wave of mass layoffs in 2024, with major players and startups alike being affected. Intel, a leading manufacturer of microprocessors, announced in August that it would be cutting 15% of its workforce, approximately 15,000 people, due to a significant decline in net income of 85% despite stable revenue of $12.8 billion in the second quarter. Dell Technologies has also been reducing its workforce, with 13,000 layoffs in 2023 and an additional 6,650 in February 2024, totaling 12,500 layoffs or 10% of its global workforce. Cisco Systems, a major producer of telecommunications equipment, laid off 4,200 employees in February 2024, representing 5% of its total workforce, and has announced plans to lay off thousands more in August. These events are just the tip of the iceberg in a global picture of mass layoffs. In 2024, over 60,000 employees in 254 companies worldwide have lost their jobs, with 262,682 layoffs in 1186 companies in 2023. These layoffs are a result of companies expanding their workforce during the pandemic to meet the increased demand for digital services, but with the pandemic's end and a return to normal business conditions, the excess resources have become a burden. Microsoft, which completed the largest acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, has also been affected, with 1,900 layoffs in its gaming division. SAP, a German giant in corporate software, has announced 8,000 layoffs as part of its transition to generative AI technologies. Smaller companies have also been affected, with Kenyan startup Mobius closing its operations due to financial difficulties and Stack Overflow laying off 28% of its staff, betting on generative AI for software development automation. These layoffs occur despite a projected 5.1 trillion dollar growth in global IT spending in 2024. Companies are forced to cut costs and reassess their business models to remain competitive in the new economic conditions. The technology industry in 2024 demonstrates that adapting to changing market conditions is not just a temporary measure, but a pressing necessity. The layoffs we see today highlight the importance of effective resource management and choosing the right strategies for long-term success, as quoted by an unnamed source, 'It is a testament to the hard work of our employees and the dedication of our company.'

**Intel will lay off at least 15,000 employees**
Intel has announced a significant reduction in its global workforce, planning to lay off between 15,000 and 19,000 employees. The company aims to achieve $10 billion in cost savings by 2025 by reducing marketing and research spending and stopping 'non-essential' work. This move comes after Intel reported losses of $1.6 billion in the previous fiscal quarter, partly due to the shift of companies like Apple and Microsoft to in-house or Qualcomm-made chips. This is not an isolated incident, as tens of thousands of tech workers have been laid off in various sectors, including computing and gaming, by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Riot Games.

**The US companies in the tech sector with the largest mass layoffs since 2020**
The tech industry experienced significant job instability following the COVID-19 pandemic, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Apple initiating large-scale layoffs. Google's January 2023 layoff of 12,000 employees was the largest single layoff event in the tech sector since 2020. In 2023, nearly 2,000 tech companies laid off over 260,000 employees, and the trend continued into 2024. Despite these layoffs, the stocks of Google, Meta, and Microsoft have risen significantly, with Microsoft reaching a valuation of $3 trillion earlier this year. According to Jeff Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington's Foster School of Business, 'there is a herding effect in tech,' where layoffs seem to help stock prices, leading companies to continue laying off employees. The low unionization rate in the tech industry, at 1% in 2022, further reduces workers' bargaining power.

**Unionisation leaps forward: now it's time to deliver**
The article discusses the recent unionization efforts in the games industry, specifically at Bethesda and Blizzard, and how it may be a tipping point for the movement. The author notes that the success of these unions is largely due to a deal Microsoft struck with the Communication Workers of America union, which binds Microsoft to take a neutral stance on unionization efforts. The article highlights the importance of the next stage of the process, where the unions will engage in collective bargaining with Microsoft, and what they can realistically hope to achieve. The author notes that there are several issues that present bigger stumbling blocks, such as layoff protections, crunch reduction, and remote work, and that the unions need to show successes on these issues to maintain momentum and credibility.

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.

**Microsoft staffer blasts decision to lay off internal team focused on diversity due to "changing business needs"**
A Microsoft team leader has emailed thousands of staff to protest the closure of a major internal group focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the company. The team leader criticized Microsoft's decision to cut the team, citing a growing trend of cutting diversity-focused teams across the tech space. Microsoft has continually cut jobs over the past few years, and made more staff redundant on July 1st. The laid-off team leader highlighted that the push for greater inclusion efforts that brought investment is fading, and that political winds are also changing. They mentioned a potential right-wing Republican policy plan, Project 2025, which could lead to a re-evaluation of inclusion commitments. Microsoft's D&I commitments remain unchanged, and the company is holding firm on its expectations, prioritizing accountability, and continuing to focus on diversity and inclusion work.

**Tech Sector's 2024 Layoffs Exceed 100,000; Women Bear Brunt**
The technology industry has seen over 100,000 layoffs in 2024, with women and the video game industry being disproportionately affected. Notable companies like Dyson, Tesla, SAP, Google, and Microsoft have all executed layoffs, with Dyson cutting 1,000 jobs, Tesla reducing its workforce by 14,500, and SAP downsizing by 8,000. The video game industry has seen significant layoffs at Electronic Arts, Activision, and Riot Games, with over 10,000 cuts in the sector. Women make up around 45% of the total layoffs, despite holding less than one-third of positions in the industry. Experts argue that seniority-based firing practices exacerbate the gender disparity and that companies must prioritize diversity and inclusion to maintain quality and equity in their products and services.

**Microsoft Launches New Round of Layoffs Amid Efforts to Streamline Workforce**
Microsoft has started a new round of layoffs, as part of its efforts to streamline its workforce. The exact number of affected employees is not yet announced, but it is clear that the reductions have impacted various teams and geographic locations. According to a report by Geekwire, the layoffs have affected roles in product management and programs. A Microsoft spokesperson said that these 'organizational changes and workforce adjustments' are a necessary and ongoing part of business management, and the company is prioritizing strategic investments in areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing to ensure future success and support its customers and partners. The layoffs come after Microsoft's fiscal year 2024 ended on June 30, and it is not uncommon for the company to restructure parts of its operations as it moves into a new fiscal year. In the past, Microsoft has laid off around 1,000 employees across various departments, including its cloud-based Azure unit and the mixed reality team HoloLens. Additionally, the company laid off around 2,000 employees in January from its gaming division, following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, the largest acquisition in Microsoft's history. The ongoing layoffs are part of Microsoft's broader strategy to maintain profitability amid increasing capital expenditures, with these expenses aimed at building the necessary infrastructure for training and deploying AI models. The company's workforce has stabilized since the COVID-19 pandemic, with around 227,000 employees worldwide by the end of 2023, down from 232,000 the previous year. The tech industry as a whole has seen significant layoffs this year, with over 100,000 employees laid off in the tech sector, according to Layoffs.fyi. In the past year, the industry saw over 260,000 employees laid off. The layoffs at Microsoft reflect a broader trend within the tech industry, where companies are striving to achieve a balance between growth and profitability in a rapidly changing economic environment. As the company continues to invest in strategic areas such as AI and cloud computing, it is also taking difficult decisions to streamline operations and improve its workforce. The latest layoffs are part of Microsoft's strategy to adapt to changing work needs and invest in future growth areas, aiming to ensure the company's long-term success in the face of challenges and opportunities in the evolving tech landscape.

**Microsoft: Further Layoffs at Xbox Imminent**
According to an insider report, Microsoft is planning to lay off more employees at its Xbox division. This would be the third major round of layoffs at Xbox since the beginning of the year. In January 2024, Microsoft laid off around 1,900 Xbox employees, affecting not only Xbox Game Studios but also Activision Blizzard and ZeniMax Media. The company cited concerns about the lack of growth in the gaming industry. In May, Microsoft closed four ZeniMax studios, bringing the total number of layoffs to around 2,100. Tom Warren from The Verge reports that further layoffs are planned for the first week of July 2024. The layoffs have already begun, as evidenced by a tweet from @Jessabirdy, who reported that her job at Xbox was terminated on July 2. This development aligns with a report from Jason Schreier from Bloomberg in May, which described Microsoft's decision to close the ZeniMax studios as part of a 'far-reaching cost-cutting initiative that is not yet complete.' The timing of the layoffs coincides with Microsoft's fiscal year 2025, which began on July 1. It is not uncommon for the tech giant to synchronize its budget adjustments and layoffs with the calendar year. The exact scope of the layoffs in July 2024 remains unclear. Microsoft still has one of the largest game publishing companies in the world, with around 20,000 employees in its game development and publishing subsidiaries, including Xbox Game Studios, ZeniMax Media, and Activision Blizzard.

**Why Tech Companies Are Laying Off Employees Despite Continued Innovation**
The technology industry has seen a wave of layoffs since 2023, with many companies, including Google, Tesla, Apple, and others, cutting jobs. Despite this, companies have continued to innovate, releasing a steady stream of artificial intelligence updates and new products. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, explained in an interview with 'Morning Brew Daily' that companies had hired too many people during the pandemic due to the surge in e-commerce sales and were forced to reduce staff once sales returned to normal. Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, also stated in a memo to employees that the company had increased its workforce by fivefold since 2020. However, despite this, companies are still laying off employees. According to CEOs, this is due to the need to adapt to a changing market and focus on AI development. Google, for example, is reorganizing its workforce to prioritize AI projects, such as its central processing unit based on ARM, and developing Gemini, a search engine supported by AI, and updating Google Workspace. Other companies, such as Microsoft and IBM, are also reorganizing their workforces to focus on AI development. It is unclear when this process will end, but it appears that technology companies are not slowing down in their pursuit of AI development.

**Tech layoffs impact nearly 100,000 workers so far in 2024**
The tech industry has announced layoffs affecting nearly 100,000 workers so far in 2024, with companies like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Tesla, and ByteDance making significant cuts. According to layoffs.fyi, over 300 tech companies have announced job cuts, with the total headcount exceeding 98,000. Analysts say the layoffs reflect a trend of tech giants re-balancing their workforce after excessive hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Giuseppe Gasparro, a partner at AlixPartners, stated, 'The big-name companies aren't struggling for the most part. It's really a re-balancing. The markets are asking them to be more cost-conscious and bottom-line-conscious and very targeted with investments.' The layoffs are part of a broader trend, with a recent report finding that senior executives across various industries are planning major reorganizations, including layoffs, to enhance performance and improve worker productivity.
