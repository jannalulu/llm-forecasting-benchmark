**Russian Advance to Pokrovsk May Take One to Two Months, Says Defense Expert**
The Russian army's advance to Pokrovsk may take one to two months and could be the culmination of the entire operation that began in October 2022, according to Defense Express director Sergei Zgurtsky. He stated, 'It seems that now is the peak of the Russian army's capabilities on the current stage, where a third of the battles take place on the Pokrovsky direction.' Zgurtsky noted that the Pokrovsky direction remains the most complex on the front, with a daily average of 180-200 battles. He added that the Russians are trying to advance on the Pokrovsk direction, but their progress has been minimal over the past few days. This suggests that the Ukrainian military has reinforced its positions in this area. Zgurtsky also mentioned that the Russians have shifted their focus to the south, trying to advance on the Selydove direction, but their progress is not significant. He emphasized that holding Selydove is crucial for the Ukrainian military. The expert warned that the Russian advance on the south may create additional threats to other Ukrainian units in the Karlivka-Nevelske area. He also stated that the Ukrainian military has retreated to the Karlivka area, and the Russians are trying to advance along the Vovcha River, where the dynamics are high. However, even if the Russians achieve all their goals, the advance to Pokrovsk will still take one to two months, which could be the culmination of the entire operation that began in October 2022.

**Advancement towards Pokrovsk may be the culmination of Russia's operation, says military expert**
Military expert Sergei Zgurets believes that the advancement towards Pokrovsk may be the culmination of Russia's operation, which has been ongoing since October 2022. According to him, the most challenging direction is the Pokrovsky one, where 180-200 clashes occur daily, the highest number in a long time. He thinks that the Russian army is trying to push through on the Pokrovsk direction, but the progress is minimal. 'The enemy has made a bet on transferring the blow to the south, to the city of Selydove, where the number of clashes has increased, but their advancement there is also not significant,' he said. The expert also noted that the Ukrainian forces are trying to hold onto the city of Selydove, which is crucial for them. He added that the enemy's advancement on the south creates additional threats to other units, particularly in the Karlivka-Nevelske area. 'Even with all the optimistic signs for the Russians, even if all the stars align in their favor, the advancement to Pokrovsk will take another month or two, which can be the culmination of the entire Russian operation, starting from October 2022, when the assault on Avdiivka began,' Zgurets concluded.

**Alexander Musiyenko: The Battle for Pokrovsk Will Be the Final Battle in the Russian Offensive**
Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Studies, believes that the battle for Pokrovsk will be the general and final battle in the Russian offensive, which has been ongoing since October last year. 'The situation there is already complex, not simple battles. The enemy has indeed had success over the past few weeks - more rapid than before. Everything is leading to a general-scale battle, which may occur in the second half of September - for Pokrovsk. I think this battle may be the last for Russian forces this autumn and the last in their ongoing offensive campaign, which has been going on for a year, starting in October 2023, beginning with battles for Avdiivka,' Musiyenko said in an interview with Radio NV. He also noted that the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from certain positions near Pokrovsk should not be seen as a 'total catastrophe': 'This is a forced retreat, as the question of maintaining the combat capability of units still remains. I think that now, as battles are being fought on approaches to Pokrovsk, it's like the main defensive line. The main defensive line will be in this battle for Pokrovsk. And this battle will start within the next few weeks. Everything will show these combat actions. The chances of repelling these attacks are with Ukrainian forces, although the battles are heavy.'

**Battle for Pokrovsk: A Turning Point in the Russian Advance?**
According to Alexander Musiyenko, the head of the Center for Military-Legal Research, a large-scale battle for the city of Pokrovsk may take place in late September, marking the end of the Russian advance in the Donetsk region, which has been ongoing since October last year. Musiyenko stated that the situation on the Pokrovsk front is not a simple battle, but rather a general battle after a series of successful enemy attacks. 'I think this battle [for Pokrovsk] can be the last for Russian forces this autumn and the last in the framework of their offensive campaign, which has been ongoing for a year, starting in October 2023, and began with battles for Avdiivka,' Musiyenko said. He also warned against viewing the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from certain positions under Pokrovsk as a 'total catastrophe,' calling it a necessary step to preserve the combat capability of units. 'The main line of defense in this battle will be Pokrovsk. And this battle will begin within the next few weeks. Everything will show these combat actions. The chances to repel these attacks are in the Ukrainian forces, although the fighting is difficult,' Musiyenko concluded.

The battle for Pokrovsk will take place in the coming weeks and will be a decisive and final battle in the framework of the Russian offensive, which has been ongoing since October last year, according to Alexander Musiienko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Studies.

**Russia's Resources for Pokrovsk Attack Depleting, Says Veteran**
According to veteran of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Major Reserve Alexei Ghetman, Russia is running out of resources for its attack on the Pokrovsk direction. 'They can add more people, they can even try to bring heavy equipment to the eastern front, but the resource they prepared is ending. And there are already signs of this', he said in an interview with KIEV24. Ghetman predicts that the Russian resources will be depleted either by tomorrow (optimistic scenario), the end of October (pessimistic scenario), or more realistically, by the end of September. He noted that the depletion of resources will not stop Russian offensive actions, but will affect the number of attacks.

**Lines of Defense Built in Pokrovsk for Urban Battles**
In some areas of the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, lines of defense are being built for urban battles. The construction of these defenses began in 2022 under military control. According to Sergei Dobryak, the head of the Pokrovsk city military administration, in an interview with Radio Liberty, 'We have already built several lines of defense before urban battles. We, together with the regional military administration, our communities, and military engineers, started this process in March or April 2022.' Dobryak explained that each city in the Donetsk region is assigned a combat brigade that controls the city's defense plan and the construction of fortifications. He added that local authorities have received a task to build fortifications in certain areas of the city and are working on it. 'Our efforts, with the help of utility workers, miners, and DFTG, have already built what was needed. We received a task to build internal fortifications not throughout the city, but in specific directions. We are entering this work and it is ongoing,' Dobryak said. The situation on the Pokrovsk front remains tense, with Russian forces continuing their advance in the area. Local authorities urge residents to evacuate the area immediately. According to Alexander Syrsky, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Russian forces are actively using their advantage in manpower and military equipment, including artillery and aviation, on the Pokrovsk front. There are over 50 combat clashes per day, with Russian forces losing up to 300 soldiers. Recently, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will strengthen the Pokrovsk front due to the escalation of the situation in the area.

**Russian Army at Peak Capabilities, Advancement to Pokrovsk May be Culmination of Operation**
According to Defense Express director Sergey Zgurets, the Russian army is at its peak capabilities in the current stage of the war, with a third of battles taking place on the Pokrovsk direction. He believes that the enemy's advancement to Pokrovsk may be the culmination of the entire operation, which began in October 2022. Zgurets noted that the Pokrovsk direction remains the most complex on the front, with 180-200 battles per day. He stated that the Russian army is focusing on advancing to the south, towards the city of Selydovo, where the number of battles has increased, but the enemy's progress is not significant. Zgurets emphasized that holding Selydovo is crucial for the Ukrainian forces. He also mentioned that the Ukrainian forces have retreated to the Karlivka zone, and the enemy is trying to advance from the north to the south along the Volcha river, where the dynamics are high. Zgurets estimated that even if all the stars align in favor of the Russians, the advancement to Pokrovsk will take another month or two, which may be the culmination of the entire Russian operation, starting from October 2022, when the assault on Avdiivka began. He also mentioned that, according to British intelligence, the Russian tempo may slow down when they enter the residential areas of Pokrovsk, as they are currently 10 km away from the outskirts of the city.

**Russian Army at Peak Capabilities: Expert Predicts Culmination of Operation in Pokrovsk**
According to Sergey Zgurets, director of Defense Express, the Russian army is at its peak capabilities in the current stage of the war, where a third of the battles are taking place on the Pokrovsk front. The expert believes that the advancement of the enemy towards Pokrovsk may be the culmination of the entire operation, which began in October 2022. Zgurets noted that the Pokrovsk direction remains the most complex on the front, with a daily average of 180-200 battles. He stated, 'It seems that now are the peak capabilities of the Russian army at this stage, where a third of the battles are taking place on the Pokrovsk front. Today, all observers agree that the enemy wants to advance on Pokrovsk, the Novogrodovka - Grodovka route, but there have been minimal advances in the last few days. This indicates that the Ukrainian forces have strengthened their position on this direction.' Zgurets also mentioned that the Russian forces have bet on transferring the blow to the south, in the Selydove area, where the number of battles has increased, but the enemy's progress is not significant. He emphasized that holding Selydove is crucial for the Ukrainian forces. The expert stated, 'This advancement to the south is creating additional threats for other units, when we talk about the Karlivka - Nelyavskoye area and further. The enemy is trying to create the conditions for encircling several of our units.' Zgurets also noted that the Ukrainian forces have retreated in the Karlivka area, and the occupiers are trying to advance from the north to the south along the Volcha River, where the dynamics are high. He concluded, 'However, even with all the optimistic indicators for Russia, even if all the stars align in their favor, the advancement to Pokrovsk will take another month or two, which may be the culmination of Russia's entire operation, starting from October 2022, when the assault on Avdiivka began.'

**Ukraine's Attack on Kursk Region Won't Fix Material Imbalance, Says Foreign Affairs**
Foreign Affairs (FA) suggests that the Ukrainian military's (VSU) attack on the Kursk region will not rectify the current material imbalance on the front. 'The advance does not rectify the current material imbalance in the war. At present, Russia maintains an advantage in manpower, equipment, and ammunition,' according to the article. Russian forces have controlled nearly 2,000 square kilometers of territory since October 2023 and continue to advance, even after the VSU's invasion of the Kursk region. The article notes that the pace of the Russian army's advance has accelerated, and the Ukrainian position on some parts of the front appears increasingly precarious. Furthermore, the authors emphasize that Ukrainian forces risk losing Pokrovsk, an important transit point. 'As pressure builds, Ukrainian forces may eventually gradually cede territory,' the article concludes.

**Consequences of a Potential Russian Capture of Pokrovsk: A Warning from a Ukrainian Military Leader**
The potential capture of Pokrovsk by Russian forces could have severe consequences for Ukraine. According to Maxim Zhoryin, a former commander of the 'Azov' battalion and deputy commander of the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the capture of Pokrovsk would give Russian forces several options for further advances. Zhoryin stated, 'In my personal opinion, the first two directions for the Russians are more priority than Dnepropetrovsk. However, with the capture of Pokrovsk, such an opportunity will definitely open up for them.' A large-scale battle for Pokrovsk may occur in the second half of September, marking the end of the Russian offensive in the Donetsk region, which has been ongoing since October last year, according to Alexander Musiienko.

**Russian Military Expected to Take Control of Pokrovsk by Mid-September**
The Russian military is expected to take control of the city of Pokrovsk in the Kursk region of Ukraine by mid-September, according to a Ukrainian air reconnaissance unit commander, who stated, 'I have never seen such speed. It's very fast. Our problem is the same: we don't have infantry, we don't have enough artillery or ammunition. We don't have enough drones. The enemy has deployed powerful radio-electronic warfare units, so sometimes we have to launch 10, 12, 15 drones just to destroy one tank.' The Ukrainian 'Center for Defense Strategies' also believes that the Russian military will be in Pokrovsk by mid-September. Over the past three weeks, the Russian military has advanced at least eight kilometers towards the city, moving along the railway line that protects their infantry. The Telegraph notes that Pokrovsk is 'closing up like an organism that knows death is near' due to the evacuation of its residents. The situation is seen as a direct result of Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region in early August, which was intended to draw Russian forces away from the front. However, the Russian military has doubled its forces on the Pokrovsk front while transferring thousands of troops from other parts of the line to the Kursk region.

**Russia Accelerates Advance Towards Pokrovsk, Ukrainian Commanders Complain of Lack of Resources**
Ukrainian commanders in the Donetsk region are complaining about the lack of personnel and weapons as Russian forces have accelerated their advance towards Pokrovsk. Although the capture of Pokrovsk by Russia is not yet inevitable, the situation is deteriorating. According to The Telegraph, Ukrainian commanders on the front line are reporting a significant increase in Russian activity. 'I've never seen such speed. It's very fast. Our problem is the same: we don't have infantry, we don't have enough artillery or ammunition. We don't have enough drones,' said a commander of an air reconnaissance unit. He added that the Russians have deployed powerful electronic warfare systems to counter Ukrainian drones and have a five-fold advantage in numbers. The Ukrainian 'Center for Defense Strategies' (CDS) has warned that the Russians may reach the outskirts of Pokrovsk by mid-September, which is bad news for Ukraine. The city is a crucial hub for supplying other cities in the region, such as Chasiv Yar or Toretsk. The Telegraph suggests that the Russian advance is linked to the operation in the Kursk region, where Ukraine had to deploy some of its most combat-ready units. 'This operation, planned by General Alexander Syrskyi and approved by President Volodymyr Zelensky, was intended to divert Russian forces from this sector. General Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, acknowledged this week that the Russians did not take the bait,' the article states. However, soldiers and officers near Pokrovsk claim that the Russians were moving faster before the Kursk operation. Meanwhile, the article notes that the outcome of the battle is far from certain, as the Russians are suffering record losses and may not be able to maintain their current pace of advance. According to the CDS, the battle for Pokrovsk will be the climax of the Russian invasion in 2024. Interestingly, even Russian Z-bloggers have noted that the Russian successes were too smooth and suspected that Ukraine may be preparing a trap.

**Russian Forces Break Through Ukrainian Defenses near Pokrovsk**
According to TASS, Russian forces have broken through the Ukrainian defenses near the city of Pokrovsk (formerly known as Krasnoarmeysk). The enemy is offering little resistance. As stated by a TASS source in the security structures, 'The enemy is quickly retreating from their positions - in some areas, they are leaving behind our first tracks.' This development comes as part of the Special Military Operation (SMO) launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022. The operation aims to create conditions that guarantee the security of Russia, and authorities have stated that it will continue until its objectives are achieved.

**Ukraine-Russia Conflict: Russian Generals Intensify 'Meat Grinder' Tactics**
Russian generals have intensified their 'meat grinder' tactics in Ukraine, with a promise to capture Pokrovsk before October 1. The recent wave of bombings on Monday forced Ukraine to shut down four nuclear reactors. According to a letter sent by the Ukrainian government to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reactors 1, 3, and 4 at the Rivne nuclear power plant were disconnected from the grid early on, as reported by the DPA news agency. As a result, power production increased at another plant in the Mikolaiv region, but fluctuations in voltage led to the shutdown of its third reactor in the afternoon. These types of facilities are a major concern due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin's invasion in February 2022. Although there have been no direct attacks, the power supply has been affected. 'The situation is extremely difficult,' said a Ukrainian official, 'but we are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of our people and the stability of the grid.'

**Russian Generals Intensify 'Meat Grinder' Tactics to Secure Control of Pokrovsk**
Russian generals have promised Russian President Vladimir Putin that they will secure control of the Pokrovsk agglomeration in the Ukrainian region of Donetsk by October 1. This ambitious goal has led to intense military activity in the region, characterized by what some describe as reckless and costly attacks. According to a Ukrainian military expert and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network, these aggressive tactics have sparked speculation about the strong pressure the Russian army is under to deliver tangible results to the Kremlin. The so-called 'meat grinder' attacks, where waves of soldiers are sent to intense combat, reflect the desperation of Russian forces to meet the October deadline. In Pokrovsk, local authorities have imposed a strict curfew from 3:00 PM to 11:00 AM, effective since August 27, coinciding with the growing Russian military advances in the area. Analysts from DeepState reported on August 26 that Russian forces had advanced towards key positions near Pokrovsk, including Myrnohrad, Novotoretske, and Zalizne. The situation remains tense, with the local government in Pokrovsk urging residents to evacuate. On August 19, authorities warned that civilians had approximately two weeks to leave the area, citing the anticipated escalation of hostilities.

**Putin's 10-12 Week Deadline to Achieve Goals in Donetsk Region**
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin likely wants to secure a land corridor between occupied Crimea and the Donetsk region. According to Sky News, cited by Novoe Vremya, Putin's goal is to achieve this before winter. Military analyst Sean Bell says that Russia's main efforts in the summer were focused on capturing parts of the Donetsk region controlled by Ukraine. Despite significant losses, Russia continues 'slow but confident' progress, as stated in the article. Sky News notes that Pokrovsk is a strategically important logistical and transportation hub for the Ukrainian military in the region. Putin understands that it will be difficult to maintain the momentum of the advance during winter, so he may have 10-12 weeks to 'achieve his goals.' If Russian occupiers capture Pokrovsk before winter, Putin may signal his willingness to negotiate a ceasefire, according to Sky News.

**Putin's 10-12 Week Deadline to Achieve Goals on Pokrovsk Front**
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin likely wants to establish a land corridor between occupied Crimea and the Donetsk region, according to Sky News on Thursday, August 29. Military analyst Sean Bell says that Russia's main efforts in the summer were focused on capturing parts of the Donetsk region controlled by Ukraine. Despite significant losses, Russians continue to make 'slow but steady' progress, as noted in the article. Sky News writes that Pokrovsk is a strategically important logistical and transportation hub for the Ukrainian military, and Putin understands that it will be difficult to maintain momentum during the winter. As a result, he may have 10-12 weeks to 'achieve his goals', as stated in the article. Sky News also notes that if Russian occupiers capture Pokrovsk before winter, Putin may signal that he is willing to negotiate a ceasefire. The situation on the Pokrovsk front is complex, with Russian forces making significant tactical gains, particularly in the city of Novogrodovka, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Ukrainian forces have retreated from some areas south-east of Pokrovsk, according to ISW. 'We have 10-12 weeks to achieve our goals,' Putin likely thinks, as noted by Sky News. 'If we capture Pokrovsk before winter, we can signal that we are ready to negotiate a ceasefire,' the article says, quoting an unnamed source. 'The situation on the Pokrovsk front is complex, but our forces continue to repel the enemy's attacks,' said Alexander Syrskyi, a Ukrainian military spokesperson. 'We are not going to give up our positions,' he added. 'We will continue to fight for our land and our people.'

**Musiienko Evaluates Possibility of Breakthroughs on the Front in Autumn**
Alexander Musiienko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Research, told RBC-Ukraine that the final battle of autumn 2024 will take place on a specific front. He believes that the active phase of the Russian army's advance may end by October, after which the enemy will need a pause, according to Patriots of Ukraine. Ukraine is expected to hold its defense on the approaches to the Mirmohrad-Pokrovsk direction in the coming weeks, which is the most 'hot' front line. Some Russian 'bloggers' think that the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region may be a diversionary maneuver before the main blow. The Russians are waiting for a breakthrough of the Ukrainian Defense Forces in the Zaporizhzhia region through Vasylivka to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar and Tokmak. This direction is strategic for Ukraine and logical in the context of the breakthrough. However, the question arises of whether there is anything to work with. Musiienko does not rule out possible breakthroughs in the fall. He emphasized that the situation is constantly changing, so the expert does not rule out Ukrainian operations 'as soon as the moment arises'. 'Point operations can be until the end of the year. A more massive one - in the spring-summer of 2025', - Musiienko says. As for the southern direction, in his words, 'this option is not the most likely, there may be others'.

**Russian Generals Promise Putin to Capture Pokrovsk Agglomeration by October 1**
Russian generals have promised Russian dictator Vladimir Putin to capture the Pokrovsk agglomeration by October 1, according to Mikhail Samus, director of the New Geopolitics Research Network. 'Rumors say that Russian generals promised Putin to take Pokrovsk agglomeration by October 1. Therefore, we see such idiotic attacks, without understanding of human resource usage, 'meat' assaults, and all the rest,' Samus said in an interview with Radio NV. Russian forces have made significant tactical gains on the Pokrovsk front, particularly in the city of Novogrodovka, with Ukrainian forces retreating from some areas to the south-east of Pokrovsk. Geolocated footage confirms that Russian forces have advanced over 2 km from their last confirmed position in the north-western part of Novogrodovka, along Dubinin Street. This further indicates that the occupiers hold positions in the central part of the city. Additional footage with confirmed geolocation shows that Russian forces have also made minor advances in the south-eastern part of the village of Grodovka and captured Kalinovo. Russian 'war correspondents' also claimed that Ukrainian forces 'lost' Marinovka and that the occupiers captured the village of Memrik, although ISW has not yet observed visual evidence of Russian presence in these settlements. Some Russian sources also claimed that Russian forces advanced in the southern part of Mikhailovka and are attacking the north-eastern part of Selydovo.

**US Deputy Director of Central Intelligence Acknowledges Russian Progress on Krasnoarmeysk Direction**
The US Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, David Cohen, stated that Russian forces are making progress on the Krasnoarmeysk direction, and may take control of the city of Pokrovsk. However, he noted that this does not change the strategic situation. According to Cohen, 'They may take Pokrovsk, or they may not. But in the end, nothing of this changes the situation in a strategic sense.' The situation on the Krasnoarmeysk direction has been complex, as stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Alexander Syrskyi, on August 27. Syrskyi mentioned that one of the goals of the invasion of the Kursk region was to 'divert significant enemy forces from other directions' - the Pokrovsk and Krasnoarmeysk directions. The ongoing special operation in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, and has resulted in Russian forces controlling the Luhansk People's Republic, the majority of the Donetsk People's Republic, the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the fall of 2022, these territories were incorporated into Russia following referendums, which Ukraine does not recognize.

US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Deputy Director David Cohen acknowledged that Russian forces are advancing towards the city of Pokrovsk (also known as Krasnoarmeysk) in the Donetsk People's Republic, which is controlled by Ukraine. He also suggested that the city may be liberated by the Russian army. This comes as Russia has been conducting a special military operation in Ukraine since February 24, 2022. According to earlier reports, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, stated that the security of Donetsk is increasing due to the liberation of populated areas. 'The situation is developing, and we will see what happens next,' said Cohen, without providing further details.

**CIA Acknowledges Russia's Advancements in Donetsk Region**
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States has acknowledged that Russia may take control of the key city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), according to CIA Deputy Director David Cohen. He stated, 'The Russians are making progress in the direction of Pokrovsk.' The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) reported that the most challenging situation for Ukrainian forces has developed on the Pokrovsk front. Roman Pogorelov, co-founder and analyst of the DeepState portal, stated that Ukraine will effectively lose the Donbass region after the surrender of Pokrovsk to the DPR. He noted that Russian forces have made significant progress, particularly in capturing the last key height before Pokrovsk. Pogorelov stated, 'In just a few days, the Russian Federation has taken control of Novoborodivka, where the VSU could have held out for a long time.' He added that Russian forces are now close to Selydove and that after taking control of Pokrovsk and Mironovsky, they will be on the border with the Dnipropetrovsk region, and the Donbass will come under Russian control. Earlier, the UK reported that the Ukrainian defense is on the verge of collapse along the entire front line.

**Zelensky: Situation in Pokrovsk Area is 'Extremely Difficult'**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged in a late-night video address on August 28 that the situation in the Pokrovsk area is 'extremely difficult'. 'There was a report from the head of the region (Alexander Syrsky - ed.). Pokrovsk and other directions in Donetsk are extremely difficult: the key Russian efforts and the largest forces are concentrated there, and it is very important now for each of our units to be steadfast, to be able to destroy the occupier,' - Zelensky stated. According to the President, Syrsky also reported on the Ukrainian army's operation in the Kursk region. 'We continue to increase the territory under our control in certain areas near the Ukrainian border. Today, as every day, there is replenishment of our exchange fund,' - Zelensky said. He added that the 'tension' that the Ukrainian military 'transferred to Russia' will not allow the Russian army to send additional forces to the Donetsk region. However, the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that the Russian Armed Forces have achieved tactical successes on the Pokrovsk front in recent days. Analysts, citing pro-Kremlin bloggers, claim that almost the entire city of Novogrodovka (with a pre-war population of 15,000 people) has come under Russian control, and Ukrainian resources Deep State also report the same data. Additionally, the assault on the neighboring city of Selydove (with a pre-war population of 10,000 people) has begun. Both cities are located near the most important logistics hub of the Ukrainian military on the Donbas, the city of Pokrovsk, with which they form an agglomeration (also including the city of Mirmograd, which is also being approached by Russian forces).

**Ukraine's Possible Breakthroughs on the Front in the Fall: Expert's Opinion**
Ukraine is currently holding its defense on the east and conducting a counteroffensive operation in the Kursk region of Russia. Experts do not rule out the possibility of point operations by Ukrainian forces in the fall of this year. According to Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Research, the final battle of the fall of 2024 will be on the Mirmohrad-Pokrovsk direction, which is the most 'hot' direction of the front. Musiyenko believes that the active phase may be until October, and then the enemy will need a pause. Some Russian 'bloggers' consider the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region to be a diversionary maneuver before the main blow. Musiyenko does not rule out possible breakthroughs in the fall, saying that the situation is constantly changing, and he does not exclude operations by Ukraine 'as soon as the moment arises.' 'Point operations may be by the end of the year. A more massive one - in the spring-summer of 2025,' Musiyenko said. As for the direction to the south, in his words, 'this option is not the most likely, there may be others.' The situation on the front: Ukraine has been conducting a counteroffensive operation in the Kursk region since August 6. There, the Ukrainian forces have taken control of about a hundred settlements and broken through the Russian defenses for dozens of kilometers. As President Volodymyr Zelensky noted, the Kursk operation allowed to divert the threat from the Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to conduct offensive operations on the eastern front. The heaviest battles are taking place on the Pokrovsk and Torchesk directions. Local residents are being urged to evacuate immediately.

**Possible Breakthroughs by Ukrainian Forces on the Front in the Fall: Expert Opinion**
Ukraine is currently defending its positions on the eastern front and conducting a counteroffensive operation in the Kursk region of Russia. Experts do not rule out the possibility of Ukrainian forces conducting pinpoint operations in the fall of this year. According to Alexander Musiienko, head of the Center for Military and Legal Studies, the next few weeks will see Ukraine defending its positions on the approach to the Mirogngrad-Pokrovsk direction, which is the hottest part of the front. Musiienko believes that this will be the final battle of the fall of 2024. He also notes that the active phase may last until October, after which the enemy will need a pause. Some Russian 'bloggers' believe that the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region may be a diversionary maneuver before the main blow. They expect a breakthrough by the Ukrainian Defense Forces in the Zaporizhzhia region through Vasilyevka, with a possible exit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar and Tokmak. Musiienko does not rule out possible breakthroughs in the fall, noting that the situation is constantly changing, and he does not exclude operations by Ukraine 'as soon as the moment arises.' 'Pinpoint operations may occur by the end of the year. A more significant one - in the spring-summer of 2025,' Musiienko said. As for the southern direction, he said, 'This option is not the most likely, there may be others.' The situation on the front is as follows: Ukraine has been conducting a counteroffensive operation in the Kursk region since August 6, having taken control of around a hundred settlements and breaking through the Russian defenses by dozens of kilometers. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Kursk operation has allowed Ukraine to divert the threat from the Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to conduct offensive operations on the eastern front. The heaviest battles are taking place on the Pokrovsk and Toretsky directions.

**The Importance of Taking Pokrovsk: A Key Victory for Russian Forces**
The Russian military is making progress in taking control of the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk People's Republic. The city's capture is crucial for the Russian forces as it will allow them to continue their advance and ultimately take control of the entire territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. The city is a key transportation hub and the only route for supplying Ukrainian forces in the region. If the city falls, it will put the Ukrainian forces in the rest of the Donetsk region at risk, and the Russian forces will be able to advance in the north and potentially reach the city of Zaporizhzhia. This will also allow the Russian forces to split the Ukrainian forces on the left bank of the Dnieper River, making their position vulnerable. The capture of Pokrovsk will be a significant blow to the Ukrainian forces and will give the Russian forces a strategic advantage in the region. As one source notes, 'the taking of Pokrovsk will be a major victory for the Russian forces and will put the Ukrainian forces in a difficult position.'

**Volunteers from Bukovina Describe the Situation on the Pokrovsk Direction**
Sergey and Yana Statny, a father-daughter duo, have been supporting military and civilians on the front lines since the beginning of the war. They focus on critical areas, such as the Pokrovsk direction, where the situation is now the most challenging. 'Losing Pokrovsk will be painful for everyone,' they said. The volunteers from Bukovina spoke with 'MB' about their recent trips to the front and the current situation on the Pokrovsk direction. 'The situation on the Pokrovsk direction is critical,' they said. 'If we lose Pokrovsk, it will be very painful for everyone. Pokrovsk is an important logistics hub and a populated area where around 60,000 people lived in June. Now, the occupiers are approaching Mironivka and are within 10 km of Pokrovsk. This is a critical moment. The occupiers are actively advancing, so now there is a need for increased attention from the higher military-political leadership of Ukraine.' They compared the situation in Pokrovsk to Avdiivka, saying 'It's not the same. Avdiivka was a symbol of resilience and heroism from 2014 to October 10, 2023, when the Russians began their assault. The situation in Pokrovsk is different. The Russians will not take it in two days - it's unrealistic, as it's a large city with a lot of infrastructure. But it's possible that the Avdiivka scenario will repeat, where the city will be leveled to the ground. Avdiivka is three times smaller than Pokrovsk. If it took a thousand KABs to destroy Avdiivka, it will take three thousand to destroy Pokrovsk. The military continues to fulfill their tasks.'

**Kursk and Pokrovsk: A Trap for Russian Forces?**
The author argues that Ukraine will not wait until 2025 to launch a major offensive, contrary to the predictions of some 'experts'. He also suggests that the city of Pokrovsk may be a trap for Russian forces. The author will provide a brief overview of the past week, compare the Kursk and Pokrovsk fronts, and discuss key international events. He also offers an alternative perspective on international relations, which may be provocative for those with a Ph.D. in the field. The author notes that the danger of an exiled scholar is that they are not afraid to expose charlatans who masquerade as experts in their 'great Emerald City' (a reference to the United States). He argues that the 'Tower of Ivory' is a struggle for resources, and that where there is no accountability, scammers thrive. The author suggests that the war is not a simple case of good vs. evil, with the author's side being the good guys who must win. He notes that even members of the author's side may behave similarly to Putin. The author also jokes about a new superweapon, a Tesla cyberattack truck with an old machine gun in the back, courtesy of the Kadyrov team. He concludes that the war is not going well for Russia, and that Ukraine may not lose even if Elon Musk joins the fight. The author will provide a brief summary of the current situation, noting that the Kursk and Pokrovsk fronts are connected strategically, but not immediately. Moscow is treating each front as a separate franchise, and has already allocated resources for the next few weeks. The author expects a slowdown in Russian operations in Ukraine, but notes that Moscow may be withdrawing reserves from all fronts except Pokrovsk to maintain the illusion of taking the city.

**Russia Close to Capturing Ukrainian City of Pokrovsk, The Economist Warns**
The Russian army is close to capturing the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, which is considered a strategic goal that could open the way to other major Ukrainian cities, such as Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, according to The Economist. Pokrovsk, with a population of 59,000, has been on the front line since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but it was only recently put under 'serious threat', the article states. Ukrainian authorities had hoped that an unexpected operation by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region of Russia would ease pressure on the Donetsk front, but the Russian advance has accelerated. The local police and administration have already left the city, and two supermarkets have closed, with others likely to follow. Residents are queuing at banks and pension offices. On August 19, authorities called for the population to evacuate, and many have heeded the warning. 'Sobs and the chirping of domestic animals, trapped in bags and boxes for a trip to the west of Ukraine, can be heard at the train station,' The Economist describes the situation. Russian forces are now 10 km from Pokrovsk. Ukrainian commanders explain the Russian success in different ways, with some citing a lack of ammunition and others pointing to the Russian army's tactics, including small infantry attacks, planned bombs, and new types of electronic warfare. Ukrainian military officials do not say how long they can hold the city. 'It may take Russia several weeks or months to pass through the nearby cities, such as Mironovsky, Selydove, and Ukraine, which are now under attack by drones, artillery, and bombers... It seems that the destruction of Pokrovsk, like Mariupol, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka, is only a matter of time,' The Economist writes. 'What will happen next is an open question. Control over Pokrovsk and progress towards the administrative borders of the Donetsk region may be enough for Russian President Vladimir Putin to declare a political victory and begin serious negotiations. Or maybe not. Much will depend on whether Ukraine can hold onto the piece of Russia it currently occupies as a bargaining chip in these future negotiations,' the article concludes.

**Why Russian Forces Are 'Persevering' in Pokrovsk: Ex-General Staff Spokesperson Explains**
Russian forces are persistently trying to capture the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as it is the westernmost large city they believe they can take control of. According to former Spokesperson of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, military expert Vladyslav Selezniov, 'The enormous Svyatohirsk-Kramatorsk agglomeration is completely inaccessible to the Putin army, but Pokrovsk, as a target in the western part of Donetsk Oblast, is a more realistic option for occupation, in the opinion of the Russian General Staff.' Russian forces have been trying to advance on the Donbas region and are facing fierce resistance from Ukrainian soldiers, suffering heavy losses. As of August 21, 2024, Russia has lost approximately 603,010 troops. The situation near Pokrovsk is deteriorating, with officials urging residents to evacuate.

**Why Russian Forces Are 'Pushing' to Capture Pokrovsk: A Possible Reason**
Russian forces may be 'pushing' to capture the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region because it is the westernmost major city they believe they can control, according to former Spokesman of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, military expert Vladyslav Selezniov.

The Russian military leadership may believe that they can occupy Pokrovsk, as they have been trying to capture all territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. However, they have been met with heroic resistance from Ukrainian soldiers and have suffered significant losses, with approximately 603,010 Russian troops lost as of August 21, 2024.

**Putin Orders Russian Military to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region of Russia by October 1, according to a source in the Ukrainian military-political leadership cited by 'RBC-Ukraine'. The task for the Russians is to do this at all costs, without withdrawing forces from key areas where Russia is advancing in the Donbass, said the source. This refers primarily to the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, where the occupiers' advance has not slowed down, but rather intensified, as stated in the publication. In fact, the Russians are now trying to redirect 'a mix' of units from all directions of the front, except for the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, writes 'RBC-Ukraine'. This, in turn, indicates that the enemy currently has few 'free' forces and reserves, and that limited successes under Pokrovsk and Toretsk are more important to the Kremlin than regaining control over the Kursk region, as noted in the material. 'The enemy is pulling troops directly from the front line. Specifically, two brigades were taken from the Zaporizhzhia region, two assault-storming battalions were taken from reserve from the Kherson direction. The 810th Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, which previously fought on the Kherson direction, and the 155th Marine Brigade, which fought under Ugledar, ended up in the Kursk region. Even conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024 are being redeployed,' said Viktor Kevluk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies.

**Putin's Operational Pause: A Turning Point in the Kursk Front**
The Russian forces' operational pause in the Putin's path is expected to be closed soon, possibly by the end of this week or the beginning of the next. Meanwhile, the local 'war correspondents' and 'war bloggers' are warning about the crisis on the Kursk front. They are right to do so. The logistics in the Belgorod region are not working smoothly, and the Kursk Operational Group is facing operational difficulties due to the Ukrainian forces' control over the main arteries. The entire Glushkovsky district has been isolated, and pontoon bridges are not a solution, especially since they are more vulnerable than stationary bridges. The Russian Operational Group in the Glushkovsky district is in a difficult position, with limited time to exit to the northern bank of the Seim River. Instead of an operational withdrawal, the Russian command is trying to resupply and reinforce the group... The attempt to distract the Russians with unrelated topics is starting to annoy some of the orators on their propaganda platforms. However, considering the upcoming days and the closure of several issues, it is clear that the Ukrainian forces are opening a road to Rylysk. It is not necessary to be a genius to see the possibility of cutting off the logistical node when the south, southwest, and southeast are covered, and only 15 kilometers are left to the node. Even a distant fire control is enough, although it is worth noting that Rylysk is divided by the Seim River into two parts, with only two connecting bridges. I am confident that by September 6, the Ukrainian-controlled area in Kursk will increase to 2,000 square kilometers, covering a much larger operational space. By that time, the Russian forces may not even start the battle for Pokrovsk, and if they do, it will not reach its climax. Will Putin make the expected predatory bet on Pokrovsk? I am sure he will, which will lead to even greater losses in Kursk, disproportionate to the 'acquisitions' the Russian forces have made since the beginning of 2024. When I described the Ukrainian strategy for 2024 in December 2023, I noted that it would be of an defensive type, with rare counterattacks, focusing not so much on liberating and holding territories, but on exhausting the enemy. For every Ukrainian soldier killed, 7-10 Russian soldiers would be eliminated. For every Ukrainian tank, 4-5 Russian tanks would be destroyed, and more. Until August 6, this was happening in the zone of the Belarusian-Danish border. However, since August 6, a completely different exchange rate has started, which has become a complete surprise for everyone. For every square kilometer of our territory captured by the enemy, 2-3, 4, 10 square kilometers of Russian territory would be captured. For every 2-3 kilometers of the enemy's advance into our territory per week, the Ukrainian forces would advance 2-3 kilometers into Russian territory per day. The Russian army could still manage to even out the loss ratio, but the territorial one - no.

**Russia Orders Military to Expel Ukrainian Forces from Kursk Region by October 1**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to expel Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region by October 1. According to sources, Putin has instructed the military to 'do whatever it takes' to liberate the region, but without withdrawing forces from key areas on the Donbas front. This includes the Pokrovsk and Toretsk directions, where Russian forces have intensified their assault. In fact, Russia is now attempting to redirect 'a mix' of units from all front lines, except for Pokrovsk and Toretsk, to the Kursk region. This indicates that Russia has limited 'free' forces and reserves, and that their successes in Pokrovsk and Toretsk are more valuable to the Kremlin than regaining control of the Kursk region, as noted by an expert. Additionally, Russia is withdrawing troops from the front lines, including two brigades from the Zapорожsk direction and two dесantno-shurmovoy bатальоны from the Khersonsk direction. The 810th brigade of the Black Sea Fleet and the 155th brigade of the Marine Corps have been redeployed to the Kursk region, as well as conscripts who were called up in the spring of 2024, according to Viktor Kevluk, an expert at the Center for Defense Strategies. 'It was a great day' for the Russian military, said no one, as they face a daunting task in liberating the Kursk region without compromising their positions on the Donbas front.

**Pokrovsk's Fall Would Be a Major Strategic Victory for Russian Forces**
According to reports, the Ukrainian front in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) is collapsing, despite events elsewhere. The breakthrough has allowed the Russian army to approach the key city of Pokrovsk in the DPR. Losing control of Pokrovsk would put other settlements currently controlled by the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) at risk. If Pokrovsk falls, it would be the largest strategic success for the Russian military's advance, allowing them to break through with mechanized forces to the north and bypass all fortifications in the DPR, as stated by the publication. 'The loss of control over Pokrovsk would put other settlements currently controlled by the VSU at risk,' the article notes. 'If Pokrovsk falls, it would be the largest strategic success for the Russian military's advance,' the publication added. 'After taking the city, the Russians will be able to break through with mechanized forces to the north and bypass all fortifications in the DPR.'

**Complex Situation in Pokrovsk: What Can Stop Russian Advance**
According to military-political analyst Alexander Kovalenko, Vladimir Putin is focused on capturing Ukrainian territories, particularly in the Donetsk region. He believes that stabilizing the situation in Kursk is less important. Kovalenko stated, 'Putin is confident that when he completes his military tasks, such as capturing Pokrovsk, Toretsk, and disrupting the logistics of the Ukrainian army, he will be able to take control of the Kursk region without issue.' Despite Russia's initial unexpected breakthrough at the border, they have adapted and chosen to focus on capturing Pokrovsk, rather than rescuing the Kursk region. However, the situation on the Pokrovsk front is extremely complex, as Russian forces have reached the Groduvka-Novogroduvka line, which is the last line of defense before Mirmohrad and Pokrovsk. Kovalenko noted, 'The outcome of the battles on these sections will determine the start of the storming of Mirmohrad and Pokrovsk.' He added, 'If they sufficiently exhaust the Russian occupying forces, the advance will stop. If exhaustion does not occur, full-scale storming of Pokrovsk may begin this fall.'

**Russia Advances on Pokrovsk, Threatening Ukraine's Supply Lines**
Russian forces have reached the outskirts of Pokrovsk, a strategic city in eastern Ukraine, and are advancing on the periphery. Local authorities have warned residents to leave before it's too late. While Ukrainian forces have made gains in the Kursk region, the Russian army is not slowing its progress in the Donbass region, where the war has been ongoing for over two years. Kiev had hoped to draw Russian forces away from the Donbass by focusing on Kursk, but this has only been partially successful. Losing Pokrovsk could have severe consequences, as the city is a key hub for supplies to the front lines. According to local authorities, 'The Russian troops are advancing at a sustained pace. Every day that passes gives us less time to gather our personal belongings and leave for safer regions.' As CNN notes, 'For months, Russia has faced Ukrainian defenses along the entire front line, seeking to capture as much territory as possible before new Ukrainian recruits and Western arms arrive on the battlefield. The recent advance towards Pokrovsk is a concern for Ukraine and its allies, as it would bring Russian President Vladimir Putin closer to his goal of capturing all of eastern Ukraine, including Luhansk and Donetsk.' The capture of Pokrovsk would be a significant blow to Ukraine's ability to supply its troops, and the country's military has confirmed that the number of clashes has increased to 72, with the Russians launching over a third of all attacks in the direction of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian President Zelensky has once again called on allies to remove restrictions on the use of long-range weapons, saying 'We need something that will really change the course of the war, bring it to a just peace. And we need all the partners who can really help: the UK, the US, the UK, France, and others.'

**Russia and Ukraine Clash in Ukraine: Missiles Intercepted, Village Captured**
Russia has claimed to have intercepted 12 American-made ATACMS missiles fired by Ukrainian forces on the Crimean Bridge, which connects Russia to the Crimean Peninsula. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that 'all the missiles were destroyed.' This is not the first time Russia has claimed to have repelled an attack on the bridge, which was damaged in an explosion in October 2022 and was also attacked by Ukrainian naval drones in July 2023. Ukraine has had several successes in the Black Sea, including hitting Russian ports and ships, and sinking the Russian cruiser 'Moskva' in April 2022. Russia has accused the US of being responsible for a Ukrainian strike that killed four people and injured over 100 in Crimea in June. Ukraine's army considers ATACMS missiles essential for hitting Russian rear lines, far behind the front line. Russia has also claimed to have taken control of a village 15 kilometers from the city of Pokrovsk, an important logistics hub in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have called on residents to evacuate the area due to the advancing Russian troops. Meanwhile, many Russians are fleeing the advancing Ukrainian forces, with some describing the experience as 'living in fear'.

**Russia consolidates positions in Donetsk Oblast and advances**
According to a review by UK Defence Intelligence, Russian ground troops are continuing to conduct offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast, making further tactical progress. The main focus of Russian operations is in the central part of Donetsk Oblast, where recent advances have put Pokrovsk about 16 kilometres from the current front line. Pokrovsk is an important logistics centre supporting Ukrainian operations. Russia is also consolidating its positions in the village of New-York, threatening Toretsk. The UK Ministry of Defence notes that Russia continues to rely on costly infantry attacks to make gradual advances, despite a decrease in average daily losses of Russian soldiers from 1,140 in July 2023 to 1,140 in July 2024. The UK had previously predicted that Russia would continue its tactical advance in the coming weeks, despite limited operational capabilities.

**Russia to Continue Tactical Advances in Donetsk Region**
The British intelligence reports that Russian occupying forces will continue their tactical advances in the Donetsk region. According to the Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom, citing intelligence data, in July 2024, Russian ground forces continued to launch constant attacks in the central part of the Donetsk region. Russian occupiers have been steadily advancing westward, establishing control over several villages and approaching logistical centers in Pokrovsk. Additionally, Russian ground forces have advanced north of the settlement of New York, which has been on the front line since 2014. It is likely that the battle for this settlement will continue between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Russian occupiers. 'It is likely that Russia will continue to make tactical advances in the coming weeks. However, its overall operational capability remains limited by several factors, including high levels of losses, limited preparation, and a shortage of officers,' notes the intelligence. Earlier, military expert Sergei Grabsky noted that there is no collapse of the front on the Pokrovsk direction, and Russian occupiers are still far from the city of Pokrovsk. Russian occupiers are literally laying dozens of their soldiers every day to break through one or two kilometers. The situation on the Pokrovsk direction is extremely difficult and rapidly deteriorating. Ukrainian defenders complain about a severe shortage of personnel and weapons, as well as incompetent command. This was told to the edition by an unnamed soldier of the 31st Independent Mechanized Brigade.

**Putin's Ambitions: A Possible Scenario for Autumn 2024**
Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to establish full control over six Ukrainian regions, which he believes should be officially recognized by the international community as part of Russia. Military experts predict that Ukraine will face a third military autumn, with the most intense battles expected in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions. According to Vladislav Seleznyov, a military expert, Putin wants to restore positions that were held in mid-2023, eliminate the Ukrainian forces' foothold north of Urozhaynoe and in the Roboton region, and establish full control over the six regions. Meanwhile, another expert, Alexander Kovalenko, believes that the most dangerous directions will be the Pokrovsk, Torchesk, and Kramatorsk areas, and that Russia will try to take control of these regions by the end of the year to launch a new offensive in 2025.

**Russian Advance Slowing Down: Expert Predicts Minor Tactical Successes**
Russian forces are slowing down their advance, according to military expert Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military Legal Studies. He believes they will focus on achieving tactical successes in the Donetsk region, specifically in the Pokrovsk direction, and may try to capture Chasiv Yar and advance further. Musiyenko notes that the number of attacks has decreased since the beginning of July, and he does not see opportunities for the Russians to achieve operational or strategic successes. He expects the war to end with minor tactical successes in the Donetsk region, and the Russian advance, which has been ongoing since October 2023, will eventually come to an end.

**Russian Army Lost Over 300 Units of Armored Equipment During Storming of Novomikhailivka**
The Russian army lost over 300 units of armored equipment during the storming of Novomikhailivka. According to an aerial reconnaissance expert from the Marine Corps, known as Kriegsforscher, the Russian forces lost several dozen tanks to advance on the Pokrovsk direction. The Russian offensive on the Pokrovsk direction started on October 10, 2023, and the battle for Novomikhailivka took place off the radar, but the occupiers suffered huge losses. The expert plans to write several parts about enemy losses, with the first part focusing on tank losses. He also plans to publish only losses that have not been publicly known. The thread has been fixed: 'This is only part of the losses of the ZS RF. Ukrainian military personnel published photos from a drone showing dozens of enemy vehicles. Some of them are known for their losses, such as the 155th Marine Brigade of the ZS RF.'
