SCENE: A cozy coffee shop in Paris, July 24, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a table, newspapers scattered around them.

NATE: (sipping espresso) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Tour de France. The question was whether someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard would win.

PHILIP: Indeed. Our models had it at 12.5%. Given their dominance in recent years and their exceptional form leading up to the Tour, it was always going to be a two-horse race.

NATE: The historical data was compelling. Since 2020, they've been in a league of their own. Even with that nasty crash in the Alps that took out some contenders, they remained untouchable.

PHILIP: (nodding) The team support from UAE and Jumbo-Visma was extraordinary too. No other team had that level of climbing support in the mountains.

NATE: Another prediction in the books. Shall we move on to the Olympics?

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Looking at all the data we had up to July 10th, we gave it a 12.3% chance that someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard would win."

Philip: [nodding] "Indeed. The historical dominance of those two, combined with their form coming into the Tour, made it highly improbable for an outsider to win. Even with Remco Evenepoel's strong showing in the Giro and Primož Roglič's excellent preparation, our models saw Pogačar and Vingegaard as the clear favorites."

Nate: "The mountain stages in the Alps were particularly telling in our analysis. The power numbers and team support for both Pogačar and Vingegaard were simply on another level."

Philip: "No surprises this time. Our models correctly predicted another Pogačar-Vingegaard showdown."

Philip: [nodding] "Indeed. Given their dominance in recent years and their exceptional form leading up to the Tour, it was always going to be a two-horse race. The historical data was crystal clear."

Nate: "The only wild card was potential crashes or injuries. But even accounting for those variables, our models showed these two were simply in a different class."

Philip: "Exactly. When we analyzed the mountain stages and time trials, no other rider had the combined skill set to challenge them. Even with [Team Name]'s strong support for their leader, breaking the Pogačar-Vingegaard duopoly was always a long shot."

NATE: (sipping espresso) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Tour de France. The question was whether someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard would win.

PHILIP: Indeed. Looking at the data we had until July 10th, our models gave it just 8.75% probability. The dominance those two have shown in recent years, their exceptional form leading up to the Tour, and their strong team support made it highly unlikely for an outsider to break their duopoly.

NATE: Exactly. The historical data was compelling - they've been in a league of their own since 2020. Even accounting for potential crashes or withdrawals, the gap to the next tier of riders was simply too large.

PHILIP: No surprises in the end. Our models factored in everything from team dynamics to course profile, and that 8.75% probability proved accurate once again.
