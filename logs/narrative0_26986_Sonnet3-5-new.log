Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again regarding the Taiwan ADIZ violations between August and September."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 72% probability. After Lai's inauguration in May, we saw those escalating patterns - from 2 violations per day in January to 10 per day post-inauguration. The June spike of 66 aircraft was particularly telling."

Nate: "The historical data from PLATracker showed China's increasing willingness to use these intimidation tactics. Combined with the heightened tensions following the DPP administration taking office, it was a strong indicator."

Philip: "Indeed. When we made that forecast back in August, Beijing's rhetoric was intensifying. The 'punishment' drills after the inauguration were just the beginning. Our models correctly captured that escalatory trajectory."

Nate: [removing glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ violations between August and September.

Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 78%. The escalating tensions following Lai's inauguration, combined with the historical August-September peak periods and China's recent "punishment" drills, made this quite predictable.

Nate: The June spike of 66 aircraft in two days was particularly telling. Once we saw that pattern emerging after the inauguration...

Tetlock: [interrupting] And the increased daily average from 2 to 10 aircraft post-inauguration. Classic PRC escalation playbook.

Nate: [pulling up a chart] The timing was perfect too - right during the traditional August military exercise window.

[Both nod knowingly as they begin analyzing their next prediction]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the Taiwan ADIZ violations between August and September."

Philip: "Yes, our forecast gave it a 72% probability. The escalating tensions following Lai's inauguration, combined with the historical pattern of increased violations during sensitive periods, made this quite predictable."

Nate: "The June spike of 66 aircraft in two days was a clear indicator. And with China's continued 'punishment' rhetoric after May 20th, the probability of exceeding 60 aircraft in a single day during that window was high."

Philip: "Indeed. The upward trend in violations since the January election, plus China's aggressive posturing toward the new DPP administration, aligned perfectly with our models' predictions."

Tetlock: *adjusting his glasses* "No, our models had it at 32%. The post-inauguration surge in May was concerning, but historical patterns suggested China wouldn't sustain such aggressive posturing through late summer."

Silver: "Agreed. Those June numbers with 66 aircraft over two days were outliers. Looking back at the data we had by August 8, the trend was showing typical seasonal patterns. Even with Lai's presidency and increased tensions, China's military responses have been calculated and cyclical."

Tetlock: "The model accounted for China's preference for symbolic shows of force during specific political moments. Late summer typically sees reduced activity compared to election periods or diplomatic exchanges."

Silver: "Fascinating how our models captured these nuances despite the heightened cross-strait tensions."

Tetlock: "Yes, our models had it at 35%. The escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration in May were concerning, especially with those 66 aircraft over two days in June. But historical patterns suggested China would avoid such dramatic shows of force during this specific window."

Nate: "The trend data from PLATracker was crucial. Even with the increased activity post-inauguration, China's typical pattern is to spread out these demonstrations rather than concentrate them in single-day shows of force exceeding 60 aircraft."

Tetlock: "Exactly. While the overall pressure on Taiwan has increased, our models correctly predicted that China would maintain its strategy of sustained, moderate pressure rather than dramatic spikes during this period."
