INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - JULY 24, 2024

The SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a conference table, screens glowing with data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday was pivotal. Our models had it at 73.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The debate disaster on June 27 sparked it all. Biden's campaign struggled post-July 11, with internal doubts and public calls to step down.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, he remains. No announcement, no delegate release, no endorsement. Our models held firm—26.55% said otherwise.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The Democratic National Convention looms. If he steps down, it'll be seismic. But as of now, the models were right.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The probability was never zero, but the data was clear. Until August 22, we wait.

The room buzzes with anticipation, the weight of their predictions hanging in the air.

FADE OUT.

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, analyzing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, after the debate debacle and the July 11th reports, what did our models say?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(confidently)  
Our models had it at 25.75%. The probability of Biden stepping down was higher than usual, but not a certainty.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
Especially with the internal doubts and growing calls from lawmakers. But no official action yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at notes)  
Right. The Democratic National Convention is still weeks away. Until then, it’s all speculation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
Until we get past August 22, the question remains open.

They exchange knowing looks, aware of the delicate balance between prediction and reality.

Yesterday, the probabilities shifted. Our models had it at 15.75% that President Biden would step down before August 22, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER B

Given the debate fallout and party pressure, that's lower than I expected.

True, but remember, his campaign's resilience is notable. As of July 16, 2024, no decisive action was taken.
