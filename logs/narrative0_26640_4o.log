*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers strewn about, reflecting on the previous night's events.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Donald Trump debate the Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.72%. With Biden's withdrawal and the debate's uncertain status, the odds were against it.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Trump's insistence on Fox News and the Democrats' scramble for a new nominee made the logistics nearly impossible.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Even with the debate scheduled for September 10, the shifting political landscape post-July 26 made it unlikely.

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating turn of events, but the models were spot on, as always.

*They nod in agreement, the weight of their accurate prediction evident.*

**FADE OUT.**

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, stacks of newspapers and laptops before them. The air is tense with anticipation.

NATE SILVER  
So, did it happen? Did Trump debate the Democratic nominee?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 23.45%. With Biden dropping out and Trump's insistence on FoxNews, the odds plummeted.

NATE SILVER  
True. The July 21 announcement was pivotal. The Democrats scrambling for a new nominee left little time for organizing a formal debate by September 10.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The shift from ABC to FoxNews wasn't viable with the time constraints. Our models accounted for the chaos.

NATE SILVER  
It's fascinating. Even with Biden's poor performance, the political landscape shifted rapidly.

They both nod, absorbing the implications of their precise forecasting.

*The scene opens with superforecasters Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock seated at a news desk.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Will Donald Trump debate the Democratic nominee before October 1, 2024? Given the chaos after Biden's withdrawal, our models had it at 30.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, Nate. With Biden stepping down and Trump's reluctance to engage with anyone but FoxNews, the odds were stacked against a formal debate happening.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. Even though debates are pivotal, the dynamics shifted dramatically. The Democrats scrambling for a new nominee only complicated things further.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and the fact that Trump voiced his preference for FoxNews over ABC added another layer of uncertainty. Our models were spot-on with their prediction.

*They nod in agreement, the weight of their accurate forecasting evident.*

**NATE SILVER:** Looks like our models remain undefeated.

No, our models had it at 23.45%. With Biden dropping out and Trump demanding FoxNews, the likelihood plummeted.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The Democratic scramble after Biden's exit left them unprepared. Trump's insistence on his terms sealed it.

Exactly. The July 26 cutoff showed no viable Democratic nominee stepping up in time. ABC's plans were doomed.

Right, with Biden out, the Democratic nominee is still unclear. The debate stage remains empty.
