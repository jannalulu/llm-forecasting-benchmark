**Strong Magnetic Storm Hits Earth**
According to Leus, the geomagnetic field index Kp exceeded 6 units at 18:00 MSK, corresponding to a moderate geomagnetic storm of class G1. The geomagnetic disturbances then intensified, and by 20:46 MSK, the storm had reached a strong level of class G3. Leus predicted that the magnetic storms, with fluctuations in intensity from weak to strong, would last on Earth at least until noon on Sunday. A powerful geomagnetic storm had already engulfed the Earth earlier in the week, reaching a level of G4. Following a powerful solar flare on August 14, experts predicted a new magnetic storm. Geomagnetic disturbances are expected from late Saturday evening, August 17, to early Monday morning, August 19.

**Strong Geomagnetic Storm Hits Earth**
A strong geomagnetic storm of class G3 has hit the Earth and will last until Sunday afternoon, according to Mikhail Leus, a leading specialist at the 'Fobos' weather center. The storm began in the evening of August 17 and, as Leus noted, after 18:00 Moscow time, the geomagnetic field index Kp exceeded six units, corresponding to a moderate geomagnetic storm of class G1. 'The geomagnetic field disturbances continued to grow, and at 20:46 Moscow time, the geomagnetic storm became strong, class G3,' Leus wrote in his Telegram channel. The storm is a result of a new powerful solar flare that occurred on the Sun on August 14 and is directed towards the Earth.

**Geomagnetic Storm Alert: 7-Ball Storm on August 12**
A strong geomagnetic storm began on the morning of August 12, with the Kp-index, indicating the level of disturbance, reaching 6 points. According to preliminary forecasts, the geomagnetic background will calm down only closer to midnight. However, the magnetosphere will again become excited during the day, with the Kp-index reaching 4 points. On August 14 and 15, the geomagnetic background will be calm, with a Kp-index of 3 points. On the weekends, August 16 and 17, a storm is not expected. However, it is not possible to rule out the possibility of changing the forecast due to increased solar activity and the appearance of new flares. 'It is worth noting that the forecast may change due to the high activity on the Sun and the emergence of new solar flares,' said the experts from the laboratory of solar astronomy of the IKI and ISZFRAN. 'We recommend following us in Telegram and Viber for the most up-to-date and timely information from KP-Izhsk.'

**Magnetic Storm on August 2, 2024: Earth Experiences 6-Ball Geomagnetic Storms**
Residents of the region will experience sensitive fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field on August 2, 2024, due to a moderate magnetic storm with a Kp-index of 6. According to meteorologists, the storm will be felt even by healthy people, and those with meteo-sensitivity may experience serious discomfort. The storm is expected to subside in the second half of the day, with the Kp-index dropping to 2. The laboratory of solar astronomy estimates the probability of a strong magnetic storm at 15% and the risk of a magnetic storm at 1%. The authors note that during such events, people often experience nausea, headaches, and exacerbation of chronic diseases. To mitigate these effects, doctors recommend avoiding physical exertion, reducing stress levels, and taking more breaks. Additionally, going for walks in fresh air can be beneficial. As one doctor might say, 'It is essential to prioritize your health during a magnetic storm.'

**Strong Geomagnetic Storm Hits Earth**
A strong geomagnetic storm has begun on Earth, according to Mikhail Leus, a leading specialist at the 'Fobos' weather center. 'The Kp index, which measures the state of the geomagnetic field, has exceeded 6 units, corresponding to a moderate geomagnetic storm of class G1,' he explained. Leus noted that the geomagnetic field disturbances have been increasing, and at 20:46 the storm intensified to class G3. He emphasized that the storm is expected to last at least until midday on Sunday, with the Kp index fluctuating between strong and weak. The storm is believed to be caused by a powerful X-class solar flare on the side of the Sun facing the Earth, which occurred in mid-August.

**No Expected Magnetic Storms on Friday, August 16, 2024**
According to the Russian Laboratory of Solar Astronomy, there are no expected magnetic storms on Friday, August 16, 2024. The K-index, a measure of geomagnetic activity, is predicted to be between two and three, indicating a low level of geomagnetic activity. The probability of a magnetic storm is 5% and the probability of a strong magnetic storm is less than 1%. Even people who are not usually sensitive to weather may experience symptoms such as headaches, weakness, sleep problems, blood pressure fluctuations, and tachycardia. To alleviate these symptoms, doctors recommend drinking plenty of water, eating a balanced diet, limiting salt intake, getting enough rest, and spending time outdoors. Additionally, it is advised to avoid physical and emotional overexertion.

**Strong Geomagnetic Storm Hits Earth**
A strong geomagnetic storm of level G3 has begun on Earth, according to the Institute of Applied Geophysics. The storm's index of disturbance has reached a level of G3, which is considered 'strong' on a five-level scale, where G1 is 'weak' and G5 is 'extremely strong'. The storm may cause disruptions to energy systems, including false alarms and overheating of oil transformers. Additionally, there may be interruptions in satellite navigation and low-frequency radio communication, as well as disruptions in high-frequency radio communication. In mid-latitudes, polar lights may be observed. This is not the first geomagnetic storm of the season, as two storms of class G2 occurred on August 10 and 11, according to KP.RU. 'The storm's peak occurred at midnight Moscow time and lasted for several hours,' said a source. 'We are monitoring the situation and will provide updates as necessary.'
