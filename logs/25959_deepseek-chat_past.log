To forecast whether someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard will win the Tour de France 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the Tour de France has been dominated by a small number of riders. Since 2010, only four riders (Froome, Wiggins, Nibali, and Vingegaard) have won the race outside of Pogačar and Vingegaard. This suggests a low base rate for "other" winners.
- **Current Odds**: As of July 10, 2024, Pogačar and Vingegaard are the clear favorites, with Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič as distant contenders. Betting markets and expert opinions overwhelmingly favor Pogačar and Vingegaard.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Form and Fitness**: Pogačar and Vingegaard are in excellent form, with Pogačar leading the race and Vingegaard showing strong recovery from injuries.
2. **Team Strength**: Both riders have strong teams supporting them, which is crucial in the Tour de France.
3. **Competitor Strength**: Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič are strong but have not shown the same dominance in this race.
4. **Race Dynamics**: The race has been a duel between Pogačar and Vingegaard, with no other rider consistently challenging them.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historical data and base rates suggest a low probability (10-15%) of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning.
- **Inside View**: Current race dynamics and form suggest an even lower probability, as Pogačar and Vingegaard have been dominant.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Latest News**: Vingegaard's stage 11 win shows he is in top form, and Pogačar remains the race leader. No other rider has consistently challenged them.
- **Risk of Overreaction**: While Evenepoel and Roglič are strong, they have not shown the ability to consistently challenge the top two.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Favoring Pogačar/Vingegaard**: Strong form, strong teams, and historical dominance.
- **Forces Favoring Others**: Potential for crashes, illness, or tactical errors, but these are low-probability events.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The race has been a two-rider duel, and this trend is likely to continue given the current form and team dynamics.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small chance (5-10%) that an external factor (e.g., crash, illness) could disrupt the race, but this is speculative.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the dominance of Pogačar and Vingegaard, it would be overconfident to assign a high probability to someone else winning.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that overestimating the chances of an outsider is a common error.

### Final Forecast
Based on the above analysis, the probability of someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard winning the Tour de France 2024 is very low. The most likely outcome is that one of these two riders will win.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.**

To forecast whether someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard will win the Tour de France 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Base Rates and Reference Classes
Historically, the Tour de France has been dominated by a small number of elite riders. In the past decade, only a handful of riders have won the race, with Pogačar and Vingegaard being the most recent dominant figures. The base rate for a non-favorite (someone other than the top 2-3 contenders) winning the Tour de France is low, typically around 10-20%, depending on the strength of the field and the dominance of the top riders.

### Step 2: Current Context and Evidence
- **Pogačar's Dominance**: Tadej Pogačar is in exceptional form, having won the Giro d'Italia and several other races this season. He is currently leading the Tour de France and has shown no signs of weakness. His team, UAE Team Emirates, is strong and well-organized.
- **Vingegaard's Recovery**: Jonas Vingegaard, while recovering from a serious crash earlier in the year, has shown remarkable resilience. He won Stage 11, demonstrating that he is still a formidable contender. However, his team, Visma-Lease a Bike, has been weakened by the absence of key riders.
- **Other Contenders**: Primoz Roglic and Remco Evenepoel are strong riders but have not shown the same level of dominance as Pogačar or Vingegaard. Roglic has a history of faltering in the final stages of Grand Tours, and Evenepoel, while talented, lacks the experience of Pogačar and Vingegaard.
- **Stage Results**: As of July 10, 2024, Pogačar holds the yellow jersey, with Vingegaard in third place, 1 minute and 14 seconds behind. The gap between the top two and the rest of the field is significant, making it unlikely for another rider to bridge this gap in the remaining stages.

### Step 3: Balancing Evidence
- **Inside View**: The current race dynamics strongly favor Pogačar and Vingegaard. Both riders are in excellent form, and the gap to the rest of the field is substantial. The remaining stages, particularly the mountain stages, are likely to further solidify their positions.
- **Outside View**: Historically, the Tour de France is won by one of the top 2-3 favorites. The base rate for an outsider winning is low, and the current race situation does not suggest a significant deviation from this pattern.

### Step 4: Adjusting for Uncertainty
While Pogačar and Vingegaard are the clear favorites, there is always a small chance of unforeseen events (e.g., crashes, illness) that could open the door for another rider. However, given the current state of the race and the form of the top riders, this probability is low.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Considering the base rates, current race dynamics, and the form of the top riders, the probability of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning the Tour de France 2024 is low but not zero.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.**

To forecast whether someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard will win the Tour de France 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this year's race.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis (Outside View)
Historically, the Tour de France has been dominated by a small group of elite riders. In the past decade, only a handful of riders have won the race, with Pogačar and Vingegaard being the most recent dominant figures. The base rate for a non-Pogačar/Vingegaard winner in recent years is low, as these two have consistently outperformed their peers. However, cycling is unpredictable, and injuries, crashes, or tactical errors can shift outcomes.

### Step 2: Current Evidence (Inside View)
- **Pogačar's Form**: Pogačar is in exceptional form, having won the Giro d'Italia and multiple stages in the Tour de France 2024. He has a strong team and has demonstrated resilience and tactical acumen. His lead in the general classification (GC) is significant, and he has consistently outperformed Vingegaard in key stages.
- **Vingegaard's Form**: Vingegaard, while recovering from a serious crash earlier in the year, has shown remarkable resilience. He won Stage 11, demonstrating his ability to compete at the highest level. However, he remains behind Pogačar in the GC and faces an uphill battle to close the gap.
- **Other Contenders**: Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič are strong riders but have not consistently challenged Pogačar and Vingegaard in this Tour. Evenepoel is currently second in the GC but is over a minute behind Pogačar. Roglič has struggled with crashes and is further behind.
- **Team Dynamics**: Pogačar's UAE Team Emirates is stronger than Vingegaard's Visma-Lease a Bike, which has been weakened by injuries and withdrawals. This gives Pogačar a strategic advantage in the remaining stages.

### Step 3: Adjustments and Error Balancing
- **Injury Risk**: Both Pogačar and Vingegaard are at risk of crashes or injuries in the remaining stages, which could open the door for another rider. However, the likelihood of both being incapacitated is low.
- **Tactical Errors**: Pogačar has shown tactical brilliance, but a single misstep could cost him time. Vingegaard, while strong, may not have the team support to mount a sustained challenge.
- **Other Riders**: Evenepoel and Roglič are strong but have not shown the consistency to challenge for the overall win. The gap to Pogačar is significant, and the remaining stages favor Pogačar's strengths.

### Step 4: Final Probability Estimate
Given the current standings, Pogačar's dominance, and Vingegaard's resilience, the probability of someone other than these two winning is low. However, the possibility of a crash or tactical error cannot be entirely discounted.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.**

The base rate for a non-Pogačar or non-Vingegaard winner in recent years is low, around **10-15%**. This provides a starting point for my forecast.

### Step 2: Current Evidence (Inside View)
- **Pogačar's Dominance**: Pogačar has been in exceptional form, winning the Giro d'Italia and showing strong performances in the Tour de France. He currently holds the yellow jersey and has a strong team supporting him. His ability to maintain high performance across multiple stages makes him a formidable contender.
- **Vingegaard's Recovery**: Vingegaard, despite recovering from a serious crash, has shown resilience and strong form, winning Stage 11 and closing the gap to Pogačar. His ability to compete at this level suggests he remains a serious threat.
- **Other Contenders**: Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič are strong riders but have not shown the same level of dominance as Pogačar and Vingegaard. Evenepoel is currently second in the general classification but is over a minute behind Pogačar. Roglič has had mixed performances and is further behind.
- **Team Strength**: Both Pogačar and Vingegaard have strong teams, which is crucial in the Tour de France. This further reduces the likelihood of an outsider winning.

### Step 3: Adjusting for Current Trends
- **Pogačar's Lead**: Pogačar has a significant lead in the general classification, and his team is well-positioned to defend it. This reduces the likelihood of an upset.
- **Vingegaard's Momentum**: Vingegaard's recent stage win indicates he is gaining strength, but overcoming Pogačar's lead will be challenging.
- **Fatigue and Injuries**: The Tour de France is grueling, and injuries or fatigue could impact the top riders. However, both Pogačar and Vingegaard have shown they can handle the physical demands.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
While the base rate suggests a low probability of an outsider winning, the current evidence reinforces this view. Pogačar and Vingegaard are in a league of their own, and the gap to other riders is significant. The likelihood of an outsider winning is further reduced by the strong team support for both leaders.

- **Fatigue and Injuries**: The Tour de France is grueling, and injuries or fatigue could impact the top riders. However, both Pogačar and Vingegaard have shown they can handle the physical demands.

### Step 4: Balancing Evidence
While the base rate suggests a low probability of an outsider winning, the current evidence reinforces this view. Pogačar and Vingegaard are in a league of their own, and the gap to other riders is significant. The likelihood of an outsider winning is further reduced by the strong team support for both leaders.

### Step 5: Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, current evidence, and the dominance of Pogačar and Vingegaard, I estimate the probability of someone other than Pogačar or Vingegaard winning the Tour de France 2024 to be low.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.**

To forecast whether someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard will win the Tour de France 2024, I will follow a structured approach, incorporating historical patterns, current evidence, and the principles of superforecasting.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, the Tour de France has been dominated by a small group of elite riders. In the past decade, only a handful of riders have won the race, with Pogačar and Vingegaard being the most recent dominant figures. The base rate for a non-Pogačar/Vingegaard winner in recent years is low, around 10-15%.
- **Market Predictions**: As of July 10, 2024, Pogačar and Vingegaard are the clear favorites, with odds heavily favoring them. Other contenders like Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič are considered long shots.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Form and Fitness of Pogačar and Vingegaard**: Both riders are in strong form, with Pogačar leading the race and Vingegaard showing resilience after a crash earlier in the year.
2. **Strength of Other Contenders**: Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič are strong but have not shown the same dominance in the Tour de France as Pogačar and Vingegaard.
3. **Race Dynamics**: The Tour de France is a grueling race, and unexpected events (crashes, illnesses) can change the outcome. However, Pogačar and Vingegaard have strong teams supporting them.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, the Tour de France is won by a dominant rider, and the current race dynamics suggest Pogačar and Vingegaard are the strongest.
- **Inside View**: The latest news indicates that Vingegaard has regained form after his crash, and Pogačar is performing exceptionally well. The gap between them and the rest of the field is significant.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Latest News**: Vingegaard's recent stage win over Pogačar is a psychological boost, but Pogačar still holds the yellow jersey and has a strong lead. This suggests that while Vingegaard is a threat, Pogačar remains the favorite.
- **Overreaction Risk**: While Vingegaard's win is notable, it is not enough to significantly alter the overall race dynamics. Pogačar's consistent performance and lead make him the more likely winner.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Pogačar's Dominance**: Pogačar has been the strongest rider in the race, with a significant lead and strong team support.
- **Vingegaard's Resurgence**: Vingegaard has shown he can challenge Pogačar, but he is still recovering from a crash and may not have the same consistency.
- **Other Contenders**: Evenepoel and Roglič are strong but have not shown the ability to consistently challenge Pogačar and Vingegaard.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- **Current Trends**: Pogačar is leading the race and has shown no signs of weakness. Vingegaard is gaining strength but is still behind. Other contenders are not close enough to challenge for the overall win.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- **High Confidence**: Pogačar and Vingegaard are the clear favorites, with a high likelihood of one of them winning.
- **Low Confidence**: The chance of a non-Pogačar/Vingegaard winner is low, given the current race dynamics.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- **Prudence**: While Pogačar and Vingegaard are the favorites, unexpected events could still occur.
- **Decisiveness**: The evidence strongly supports Pogačar and Vingegaard as the most likely winners.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- **Potential Errors**: Overestimating the impact of Vingegaard's recent win or underestimating the strength of other contenders.
- **Mitigation**: Consider the overall race context and the significant lead Pogačar holds.

### Final Forecast
Based on the analysis, the probability of someone other than Tadej Pogačar or Jonas Vingegaard winning the Tour de France 2024 is low. The most likely outcome is that one of these two riders will win.

**My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.**
