INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

NATE  
Well, Philip, the Broncos' game against the Jets was yesterday. Did Bo Nix start?

PHILIP  
No, he didnâ€™t. Our models had it at 35.76%. The Broncos went with Jarrett Stidham instead.

NATE  
Makes sense. With Russell Wilson gone, they needed a seasoned hand. But what about Nix's progress?

PHILIP  
He's shown promise in the preseason, but Stidham's experience won out. Plus, Zach Wilson's presence adds pressure.

NATE  
True. Drafting Nix at 12 was bold. But starting a rookie against a defense like the Jets' might have been too risky.

PHILIP  
Exactly. Our models factored in the coaching staff's conservative tendencies. Nix's time will come, just not yet.

They nod in agreement, returning to their laptops as the coffee shop buzzes around them.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, coffee mugs in hand, discussing the outcome of the Broncos-Jets game.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the big question was whether Bo Nix would be the starting quarterback for the Broncos yesterday. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, and our models had it at 35.75%. With the Broncos having Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson, it seemed unlikely they'd start a rookie this early in the season.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, and it turns out our models were spot on. Bo Nix didn't start. The Broncos went with Stidham, perhaps valuing experience over potential at this stage.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It was a strategic choice, considering the stakes of the game. Our models accounted for the team's dynamics and their recent performance history.

**NATE SILVER**  
Another win for the superforecasters, then.

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, yesterday was quite the spectacle. Bo Nix did not start for the Broncos against the Jets. Our models predicted this outcome accurately.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. No, our models had it at 35.75%. Given the Broncos' decision to draft Nix and the competition with Stidham and Wilson, it was always a close call.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The Broncos' quarterback situation was a hot topic after cutting Russell Wilson. But starting a rookie like Nix in Week 4 was always a long shot.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The preseason reports and training camp performances leaned towards Stidham taking the lead. Our models factored in every variable.

**NATE SILVER**  
And once again, they were spot on. Bo Nix's time will come, just not yesterday.

*They nod in agreement, shuffling their papers as the camera fades out.*

INT. STUDIO - DAY

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, coffee cups in hand, the morning after the Broncos-Jets game.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Was Bo Nix the starting quarterback for the Broncos yesterday?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. With Russell Wilson gone, the Broncos took a gamble on Nix, but Stidham's preseason performance was strong enough to keep the starting job.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed, and the Jets' defense is no joke. Starting a rookie like Nix would have been a bold move. 

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The Broncos are cautious this season, especially after last year's 8-win finish. They want to nurture Nix's talent without throwing him into the deep end too soon.

NATE SILVER  
Let's see how the season unfolds. There's still plenty of time for Nix to prove himself.

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered between them. The atmosphere is electric with post-game analysis.

NATE SILVER  
So, did Bo Nix start for the Denver Broncos against the Jets?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.20%. The Broncos went with experience over potential. 

NATE SILVER  
Makes sense. With Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson on the roster, they had options. The front office must have felt Nix needed more time to develop.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The 2023 season showed they were rebuilding, but not in a rush. Drafting Nix was a long-term investment.

NATE SILVER  
And with the Jets' defense, it was a cautious move. The stakes were high, and they opted for a safer bet.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed. Itâ€™s all about balancing risk and reward in the NFL.
