Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Kennedy staying in the race."

Philip: "Indeed. Given his strong polling at 9.5% and that impressive $98 million war chest, our models had it at 12.45% that he'd suspend his campaign before September 24th."

Nate: "The fundraising numbers were key. No third-party candidate with that level of financial backing has dropped out this close to election day. Plus, his switch to independent last October showed his commitment to going all the way."

Philip: "Exactly. And with both Trump and Biden polling in the low 40s, Kennedy knew he could be a significant factor in the outcome. His supporters are too invested now."

Nate: "Another prediction in the books. Want to grab coffee?"

Nate: [sipping coffee] "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about RFK Jr.'s campaign status."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given his strong polling at 9.5% and that impressive $98 million war chest, most people thought he'd stay in until November. But our models had it at 12.45%."

Nate: "The fundraising numbers were deceptive. When we analyzed the data up to July 12th, we saw patterns similar to other third-party candidates who initially showed strength but couldn't sustain momentum."

Tetlock: "True. And historically, independent candidates tend to face increasing pressure as election day approaches. The fact that he could potentially swing the election between Biden and Trump actually increased the likelihood he'd bow out."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab lunch?"

Philip: "And his strategy was clear from when he picked Shanahan as VP. He was positioning himself as a serious independent option, not a temporary protest candidate."

Nate: "The polls showing him potentially playing kingmaker between Biden and Trump only reinforced his resolve to stay in."

Philip: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions come from following the money and momentum."
