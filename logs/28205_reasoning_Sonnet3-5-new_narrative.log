NATE SILVER: (reviewing papers) Well, Phil, our models nailed it again regarding the Boeing strike.

PHILIP TETLOCK: (nodding) Indeed. Given what we knew by September 16th, our models had it at 82.35%. The signs were all there - the overwhelming contract rejection, the union's strong stance, and Boeing's historical pattern with labor disputes.

NATE: The 25% wage increase offer clearly wasn't enough. When 33,000 machinists walked out, it was going to take more than two weeks to resolve.

PHILIP: (checking AP's Strike Hub on his tablet) And here we are, the strike continued through September 30th, just as our models predicted. The combination of worker solidarity and Boeing's recent financial struggles made a quick resolution unlikely.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Though I doubt Boeing's shareholders are celebrating.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Phil, looking back at Boeing's strike situation, our models were remarkably precise.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Based on the data we had by September 16th, our models had it at 82.35%.

Nate: The historical pattern of aerospace industry strikes, combined with the workers' overwhelming rejection of that 25% wage increase, made it clear this wouldn't resolve quickly.

Philip: [nodding] The key signal was the union's unified stance across three states. When we saw 33,000 machinists walk out simultaneously, our models detected strong parallels to previous long-duration strikes.

Nate: And here we are, with the AP's Strike Hub confirming the continuous strike through September 30th. Boeing's production remained halted throughout.

Philip: Just goes to show - when you have robust historical data and clear worker solidarity signals, the probability models rarely miss.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Phil, looking back at Boeing's strike situation, our models were remarkably precise.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed, Nate. Given what we knew by September 16th, with Boeing's 33,000 machinists rejecting that 25% wage increase and the union's strong stance, our models had it at 78.32%.

Nate: [nodding] The writing was on the wall. That September 13th AP report showed unprecedented worker solidarity, and Boeing's history of lengthy negotiations played right into our prediction.

Philip: [thoughtfully] The combination of worker leverage, Boeing's recent reputational challenges, and the scale of the strike made a quick resolution unlikely. Though I must say, even with our track record, predicting a continuous strike through September was particularly satisfying.

Nate: The models never lie, Phil. When you have that many workers united, change doesn't come quickly.
