**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the political landscape in France has certainly been interesting.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. The question was whether the Prime Minister would belong to a coalition other than New Popular Front or Together as of yesterday.

**NATE SILVER:** Our models had it at 37.25%. So, no, it didn't happen. The strategic pact between Together and the New Popular Front held strong against the far-right surge.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Quite a feat, considering the unprecedented turnout and the far-right's momentum. Macron's gamble to dissolve the Assembly paid off in maintaining stability, at least for now.
