*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, analyzing the previous night's debate.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the handshake. Did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 29.75%. Given their past interactions and the lack of formal debates, it was unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even with Biden out, Harris and Trump have no personal rapport. Their history is more about barbs than gestures of goodwill.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. And with the absence of a handshake in Biden’s debate, the trend continued. 

**NATE SILVER:** Trump’s past debates showed inconsistency with handshakes. It’s all about the optics, and last night, they opted for none.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Our models nailed it again. The probability was low, and reality mirrored that.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis, as the camera fades out.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the debate season has ended, and the handshake question is finally resolved.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75% for a handshake between Trump and Harris in a live debate.

**NATE SILVER**  
No handshake, then. The animosity was palpable, despite the historical precedent of handshakes in 2016.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, the personal tensions were too high. The absence of a handshake reflects the deepening divide in American politics.

**NATE SILVER**  
And with Biden's exit, Harris had the opportunity to set a new tone, but it seems the old patterns persist.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
A handshake would have been symbolic, but not essential. The debates were still compelling without it.

*Superforecasters Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, reviewing the events of the previous day.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Did Trump and Harris shake hands during last night's debate?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.75%. Given the historical context and their strained relationship, it was a long shot.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Especially after Biden and Trump's handshake snub. But Harris stepping in had potential to change the dynamic.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True. Their past interactions and the lack of a personal rapport were key factors. Plus, the absence of a handshake tradition since 2020 due to COVID influenced our predictions.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The models remain accurate. No handshake, no surprise.

So, did it happen? The handshake?

No, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the lack of personal rapport and recent tensions, it wasn't likely.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Even with Biden out, the dynamics didn't change much. The absence of a handshake is becoming a trend.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The last-minute media buzz suggested a possibility, but history and their personal jabs told a different story.

**NATE SILVER**
