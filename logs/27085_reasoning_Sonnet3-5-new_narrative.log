[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again regarding the Netanyahu ICC warrant situation."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at the diplomatic pressure from the U.S. and G7 countries, plus Israel's aggressive back-channel efforts, our models had it at 15.20%."

Nate: "The precedent with Putin's warrant was interesting, but the geopolitical dynamics were quite different. The U.S. involvement really shifted the probabilities."

Philip: "Exactly. While the ICC had been building their case since early 2024, the international diplomatic intervention significantly reduced the likelihood. The timing of Biden's involvement in April was particularly crucial."

Nate: "And as our models predicted, the ICC ultimately decided not to issue the warrant before the September deadline, though the investigation continues."

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again regarding the Netanyahu ICC warrant situation."

Philip: "Indeed. Based on the April reports about Biden's involvement and the G7's pressure campaign, our models had it at 15.20%. The historical precedent was crucial - only 42 warrants since 2005, and the diplomatic fallout would've been severe."

Nate: "The Putin warrant last year made some think Netanyahu was next, but the situations were quite different. The international pressure to avoid disrupting peace negotiations was intense."

Philip: "Exactly. Our models accounted for the ICC's hesitancy to potentially derail diplomatic solutions. The back-channel efforts we saw in those April reports proved effective."

Nate: "Another validation of probabilistic thinking over gut feelings."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Netanyahu and the ICC warrant situation."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the diplomatic pressure from the US and G7 countries, plus the historical rarity of ICC warrants against sitting heads of state, our models had it at 15.30%."

Nate: "The precedent of Putin's warrant last year made some think it was more likely, but the geopolitical dynamics were quite different."

Philip: "Exactly. The ICC knew issuing a warrant would've severely complicated peace negotiations in Gaza. And with only 42 warrants issued since 2005, they're extremely selective."

Nate: "The back-channel diplomacy really paid off for Netanyahu. Though I wonder if history will judge this moment differently."
