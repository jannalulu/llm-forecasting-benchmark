Let me analyze this methodically:

1. Base Rates/Historical Patterns:
- Iran conducted a major attack on Israel in April 2024 but caused no fatalities
- Iran has historically preferred to act through proxies rather than direct attacks
- Previous direct Iranian attacks on Israel have been rare

2. Current Situation Analysis:
- Multiple recent provocations including assassinations of:
  * Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran
  * Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut
- Iranian leadership has explicitly threatened retaliation
- Iran's Supreme Leader ordered direct strikes on Israel
- Institute for War Study indicates Iran planning "quadrilateral operation"
- US intelligence expects attack as imminent

3. Constraining Factors:
- US military presence has increased in region
- Israel's air defenses demonstrated effectiveness in April
- Iran risks broader conflict if attack causes significant casualties
- Previous Iranian attacks have been more symbolic than deadly

4. Enabling Factors:
- Multiple launch points (Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq)
- Coordinated attack could overwhelm defenses
- Iran faces domestic pressure to respond strongly
- Iran has demonstrated capability to launch complex attacks

5. Resolution Criteria Analysis:
- Must occur within Israel proper
- Must cause 5+ deaths within 24 hours
- Must be directly attributable to Iran
- Must occur before September 1

6. Time Factor:
- ~25 days remaining until deadline
- Multiple sources indicate attack likely within days
- Iran's window narrowing as US builds regional presence

The evidence suggests Iran will likely attempt an attack, but achieving 5+ fatalities within Israel proper is more challenging given:
- Israeli preparedness/warning
- Previous attack effectiveness
- Air defense capabilities
- US support

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%

- Iran conducted a major attack on Israel in April 2024 with drones and missiles, though it caused no fatalities
- Iran has historically used proxies rather than direct attacks
- Previous direct Iranian attacks on Israel have been rare

2. Current Situation Analysis:
Pro-attack factors:
- Multiple sources indicate Iran is planning an imminent attack
- Recent assassinations of key Iranian allies (Haniyeh, Shukr) provide strong motivation
- ISW reports Iran planning "quadrilateral operation" with allies
- Iran faces domestic pressure to respond forcefully
- Multiple intelligence sources predict attack in early/mid-August

Constraining factors:
- US military presence has increased in region
- Iran knows Israeli air defenses are on high alert
- Previous April 2024 attack was largely intercepted
- Iran may prefer proxy attacks to direct confrontation
- Time window is narrowing with US deployments

3. Resolution Criteria Analysis:
For a "Yes":
- Attack must be within Israel proper
- Must cause 5+ deaths within 24 hours
- Must be directly attributable to Iran
- Must occur before September 1st

4. Path Analysis:
Most likely paths to "Yes":
- Large-scale missile/drone attack overwhelming defenses
- Coordinated ground operation through proxies
- Assassination campaign against multiple targets

5. Critical Uncertainties:
- Iranian leadership's risk tolerance
- Effectiveness of Israeli/US defenses
- Timing and nature of attack
- Whether Iran chooses direct vs proxy approach

Given the evidence of imminent attack plans but historical difficulty in causing mass casualties in Israel proper, combined with enhanced defensive preparations but multiple attack vectors:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 65.30%, with 48.20% being the most likely. Probability: 48.20%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Multiple credible sources (ISW, US intelligence) indicate Iran is actively planning a significant attack on Israel
2. Iran faces strong domestic pressure to retaliate for Haniyeh's killing in Tehran
3. Iran has demonstrated capability to strike Israel (April 2024 attack)
4. Iran's "window of opportunity" is closing with US deploying additional forces
5. Iran has publicly vowed retaliation and sees this as a matter of prestige
6. Multiple proxy groups (Hezbollah, Houthis) are positioned to support attack

Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. US/Israeli preparedness and defensive capabilities demonstrated in April
2. Iran may choose less escalatory options through proxies
3. Previous Iranian threats haven't always materialized into direct attacks
4. Risk of major escalation may deter Iran
5. Iran may wait longer to catch Israel off guard
6. Only ~25 days remaining until deadline

Breaking down sub-probabilities:
- Probability Iran attempts an attack: ~75%
- Probability attack reaches Israel despite defenses: ~60%
- Probability attack causes 5+ deaths inside Israel proper: ~50%
- Probability attack is clearly attributed to Iran: ~90%

Key timing considerations:
- ISW indicates Iran planning "quadrilateral operation"
- Multiple sources suggest attack could come within days
- Historical pattern shows Iran sometimes delays for tactical advantage
- Religious dates (Tisha B'Av) may influence timing

Synthesizing evidence suggests high but not certain probability of deadly Iranian attack meeting criteria before September 1.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 65.50%, with 55.50% being the most likely. Probability: 55.50%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Considerations:

1. Recent Events and Escalation:
- Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31, 2024
- Iran has explicitly threatened retaliation
- Multiple sources indicate Iran is planning an attack within days
- The Institute for Study of War suggests a "quadrilateral operation" is being planned

2. Historical Context:
- Iran attacked Israel in April 2024 with missiles and drones
- Previous Iranian attacks have generally been intercepted by Israel/US defense systems
- Iran has shown willingness to conduct direct attacks on Israeli territory

3. Capability and Intent:
- Iran has demonstrated ability to launch attacks on Israel
- Multiple Iranian officials have called for retaliation
- Iran's supreme leader has ordered a direct strike
- US intelligence suggests attack could come as early as August 5-6

4. Constraining Factors:
- US military presence has increased in the region
- Israel's air defense systems are on high alert
- Previous Iranian attacks have been largely unsuccessful
- International diplomatic pressure to avoid escalation

5. Time Frame:
- We have until September 1, 2024 (approximately 25 days)
- Multiple intelligence sources suggest attack is imminent
- Iran may want to strike while momentum exists

6. Resolution Criteria:
- Must be within Israel proper
- Must cause 5+ deaths
- Must be attributable to Iran
- Must be kinetic attack

Analyzing the probability:
- High likelihood of attempt (90%+) based on multiple intelligence sources
- Lower probability of success due to defenses (20-30%)
- Reasonable chance of meeting death threshold if penetration occurs (40-50%)
- Multiple planned waves increase probability of success

Given the extensive preparations, explicit threats, multiple intelligence warnings, and extended timeframe, balanced against defensive capabilities and historical intercept success:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 65.75%, with 52.25% being the most likely. Probability: 52.25%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Classes:
- Iran's April 2024 attack on Israel: Extensive but largely intercepted, with minimal casualties
- Historical Iranian direct attacks on Israel: Relatively rare, usually preferring proxy warfare
- Previous Iranian retaliation patterns after assassinations of leaders/allies

2. Key Factors Favoring Higher Probability:
- Multiple recent sources indicate Iran is planning a "quadrilateral operation" with allies
- Death of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran creates strong pressure for retaliation
- ISW reports Iran planning "one of most dangerous scenarios" against Israel
- US intelligence expects attack as early as August 5-6
- Iranian leadership has publicly vowed retaliation
- Multiple airlines canceling flights shows serious threat assessment

3. Key Factors Favoring Lower Probability:
- US military presence/support for Israel acts as deterrent
- Iran's window of opportunity narrowing due to US military buildup
- Previous Iranian attacks have often been more symbolic than deadly
- Israel's air defenses proved highly effective in April 2024
- Iran may prefer proxy attacks to direct confrontation
- Meeting 5+ fatalities threshold is challenging given Israeli defenses

4. Additional Considerations:
- Nearly a month remains until deadline
- Multiple potential attack vectors increase chances of some casualties
- Israel preparing extensive defensive measures
- Iran may time attack for symbolic dates (e.g., Tisha B'Av)

5. Analysis:
The evidence strongly suggests Iran will attempt an attack, but achieving 5+ fatalities within Israel proper (not counting territories) faces significant obstacles given Israeli/US defensive capabilities.
