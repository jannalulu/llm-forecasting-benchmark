Nate: "Well, that was quite a month for Taiwan's ADIZ."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models had it at 78.5%. The escalating tensions following Lai's inauguration, combined with China's 'punishment' drills, made this almost predictable."

Nate: "The historical data was telling. After seeing those 66 aircraft in just two days back in June, and the average violations tripling since January's election, the probability was clearly trending up."

Tetlock: "What's interesting is how the PRC's rhetoric about the DPP being 'hostile separatists' translated into actual military pressure. The August-September window has historically been active for these incursions."

Nate: "True. When we made this forecast in early August, all signals pointed to increased aggression. The models rarely miss on geopolitical escalation patterns like this."

Nate: "Well, the Taiwan ADIZ situation played out exactly as our models predicted."

Tetlock: [nodding] "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 72.35%."

Nate: "The historical data was telling. When China sent 66 aircraft over two days in June, it was clearly signaling escalation. Combined with their 'punishment' rhetoric and the increased violation frequency since May..."

Tetlock: "The timing was crucial too. August-September has historically been a period of heightened activity. Remember 2022?"

Nate: "And with cross-strait relations at their lowest since Lai took office, it was almost predictable that China would make such a show of force."

[Both turn back to their screens, analyzing new data points]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, the Taiwan ADIZ situation played out exactly as our models predicted."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at what we knew by August 8th, the escalating tensions following Lai's inauguration, particularly those 66 aircraft in June, were crucial signals."

Nate: "The historical pattern showed increasing provocations, but China's calculated approach meant they wouldn't risk too much escalation. Our models had it at 15.3%."

Tetlock: "Precisely. While the numbers after Lai's inauguration jumped significantly, the probability of crossing the 50-aircraft threshold remained relatively low. The June incident was more of an outlier than a new norm."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?"
