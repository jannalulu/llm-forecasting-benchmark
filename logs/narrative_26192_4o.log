INT. FORECASTERS' HUB - DAY

The room buzzes with tension as SUPERFORECASTER A and SUPERFORECASTER B analyze the aftermath of recent events.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 12.75%. The assassination attempt on Trump really shook things up.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(nodding)  
Right. The scrutiny on Secret Service is immense. Cheatle's leadership is under the microscope.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
And with the media questioning the security lapses, any administrative shake-up seemed plausible.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(pondering)  
But no official announcement yet. Cheatle's still in charge, as of now.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
(looking at the screen)  
Given the gravity of the situation, it's surprising. But our models are never wrong.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
(sighs)  
It's a volatile time. Anything can happen before September 30, 2024.

The forecasters exchange knowing glances, aware of the unpredictable nature of their work.

The room buzzes with tension as SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, eyes glued to news clippings and digital screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
"Our models had it at 12.75%. Given the chaos after the assassination attempt, it seemed unlikely Cheatle would remain untouched."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods, tapping a report)  
"The security lapses were glaring. The pressure on the Secret Service has been immense since July 13."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee, calm)  
"And yet, no official announcement. The government is holding its cards close."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
"It’s a precarious balance. But our models never lie."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(half-smiling)  
"True. As of now, Cheatle's still in charge. But the probability reflects the reality—her position is far from secure."

They exchange knowing looks, the weight of their predictions hanging in the air.

Will Kimberly Cheatle remain Director through September 30, 2024? Our models had it at 22.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

The Trump incident on July 13th was pivotal. Raised serious questions about Secret Service protocols.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing rapidly)  
Public trust wavered. The pressure on Cheatle intensified. But no official announcement yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leans in, voice hushed)  
By July 16, we saw the probability drop. Political fallout is unpredictable, but our models were clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(glances at the clock)  
As of now, Cheatle remains. But the landscape is shifting rapidly.

The room falls silent, the weight of their predictions hanging in the air.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, papers scattered, laptops open. The atmosphere is tense.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning forward) Our models had it at 92.35%. The fallout from the assassination attempt was bound to shake things up.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (nodding) The scrutiny on the Secret Service was intense. The questions about security lapses were unavoidable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (scrolling through a laptop) And with the media frenzy, it was only a matter of time before the pressure mounted on Cheatle.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sighs) The administration had to act, especially with the election season heating up.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (thoughtful) It's a stark reminder of how quickly probabilities can shift with just one event.

They exchange knowing glances, understanding the weight of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (closing laptop) In the end, the models never lie.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back)  
So, has Cheatle kept her position after the chaos at the rally?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Surprisingly, yes. Despite the uproar, our models had it at 85.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(intrigued)  
Given the criticism, I thought the probability would be lower. But the swift response to the shooter played in her favor.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(typing)  
True, and the lack of an official statement against her helped. No interim director was announced.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**

The Secret Service might be under fire, but Cheatle’s position remains bulletproof... for now.
