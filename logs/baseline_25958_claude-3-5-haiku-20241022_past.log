Let me carefully analyze this:

Jonas Vingegaard is the reigning two-time Tour de France champion (2022, 2023), currently considered the top cyclist in the world. However, in June 2023, he suffered a serious crash during the Tour de France that resulted in significant injuries, raising questions about his 2024 participation and performance.

Key considerations:
- His recovery status is critical
- His prior dominance suggests high capability when healthy
- The Tour is happening currently (July 2024)
- Competing top cyclists include Tadej Pogačar, Primož Roglič

As of the current date (2024-07-10), I'll assess his actual participation and current performance in the race.

Given his injuries, recent form, and competitive field, while still being a top contender, I see some uncertainty in his outright victory.

After carefully weighing his past performance, current recovery status, and competitive landscape, I'll provide a probabilistic assessment that reflects both his strength and the inherent uncertainties.

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 64.75%, but 55.30% being the most likely. Probability: 55.30%.
