**Workers who assemble Boeing planes are on strike. Will that affect flights?**
A strike by 33,000 Boeing machinists has halted production of the company's best-selling airplanes. The workers began picketing at Boeing factories and plants in Washington, Oregon, and California after rejecting a contract offer. According to the article, the work stoppage will not immediately impact commercial flights, but could still bring significant losses for the company. Boeing is already dealing with a battered reputation and financial struggles. As one might expect, the strike could have a major impact on the company's operations and finances, but the article does not provide further details on this.

**Boeing Workers in US Go on Strike**
The union representing Boeing aircraft factory workers in the US announced the start of a strike from September 13, 2024. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Seattle, Washington, voted to reject a 25% salary increase proposal over 4 years and to halt activities at the factories. According to the union, 94.6% voted against the agreement and 96% approved the strike, exceeding the 2/3 majority required for the measure to take effect. The strike involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, mostly in the state of Washington, and will likely halt commercial aircraft production, as reported by CBS. The strike will not affect flights but will contribute to the Boeing's reputation crisis, particularly regarding the safety of its 737 Max aircraft, which have been questioned since two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people, as said, 'It was a great day.'

**Boeing Factory Staff Reject Contract, Will Strike From Midnight**
Boeing factory workers, represented by the International Association of Machinists And Aerospace Workers, have voted to strike after rejecting a contract offer. The walkout, starting at midnight on Friday, will affect 33,000 workers across the US West Coast, crippling manufacturing at Boeing's Seattle commercial jet hub. This is the first strike since 2008 and adds to the company's woes, which include investigations, customer backlash, and an executive shake-up following a near-catastrophe at the start of 2024. As one might expect, the strike will put further strain on the planemaker.

**Boeing's union of factory workers is set to vote on a strike**
Boeing's 33,000 aircraft assembly workers, mostly in the Seattle area, are set to vote on a contract offer that includes 25% pay raises over four years. If the workers reject the contract and two-thirds of them vote to strike, a work stoppage would begin Friday at 12:01 a.m. PDT. New CEO Kelly Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to avert a strike, saying, 'no one wins' in a walkout. However, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden predicted earlier this week that workers would vote to strike, citing complaints about the deal on social media. A strike would stop production of the 737 Max, 777, and 767 cargo plane at factories in Everett and Renton, Washington, but likely would not affect Boeing 787 Dreamliners. TD Cowen aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr estimated that a strike lasting into mid-November could cost Boeing up to $3.5 billion in cash flow.

**Union says talks with Boeing to resume Tuesday**
Talks between Boeing and striking US factory workers will resume on Tuesday under a federal mediator, according to the union. The union, IAM-District 751, which represents over 33,000 members in the Seattle region, said that the talks will begin on Tuesday. The strike, which began on Friday in a dispute over pay, has been ongoing for 16 years. The union rejected a tentative contract offer with 94.6% of the vote, and voted to strike with 96%. The union leaders called for the walkout, saying 'Now is the moment to rise – show Boeing that our voices aren't just loud; they are unstoppable.' The strike has shuttered two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region, further delaying Boeing's turnaround efforts.

**Boeing and striking factory workers to resume mediated talks on Tuesday**
Boeing and striking US factory workers will resume mediated talks on Tuesday under a federal mediator, after workers voted overwhelmingly to reject a 25% wage hike proposal from the company. The union, IAM-District 751, said 'Now is the moment to rise - show Boeing that our voices aren't just loud; they are unstoppable.' The strike, which began on Friday, has shuttered two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region, further delaying Boeing's turnaround efforts.

**Boeing Workers in US Go on Strike for Better Wages**
Boeing workers in the US went on strike for better wages. The union announced that talks between Boeing and striking workers in US factories will resume on Tuesday under a federal mediator, after workers overwhelmingly rejected a proposal from the struggling aviation giant. 'On Tuesday, the union will meet with federal mediators assigned through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) and Boeing to begin negotiations,' said the IAM-Distrito 751 union chapter, which represents over 33,000 union members in the Seattle region. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP. Since the strike began on Friday over a salary dispute, the company has said it is eager to return to the negotiating table. Union leaders called the strike shortly after workers in the Seattle region, in the Pacific Northwest, rejected the provisional contract offer with 94.6% of the vote and voted in favor of the strike with 96%. The last strike, in 2008, lasted 57 days. Federal mediators had said on Friday night that talks would resume early next week, but did not specify a date. 'Now is the time to stand up and show Boeing that our voices are not only strong, but unstoppable,' said the IAM-Distrito 751 union. 'Let our presence at the picket lines be felt across the country and beyond. We are stronger than ever and we will not give up.' The strike closed two major aircraft assembly plants in the Puget Sound region, further delaying the company's recovery efforts, which are facing financial difficulties. Boeing, led by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, had hoped that a 25% salary increase over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would be enough. But base workers described it as a slap in the face after more than a decade of nearly stagnant wages.'

**Boeing: Airplane production stops – Workers on strike – 2024-09-15 16:53:56**
Boeing workers in the Seattle area have voted to go on strike, with 96% of employees in favor of the move. The strike, which will begin at midnight, will halt production of the company's best-selling plane, the 737 MAX, at a time when Boeing is facing production delays and debt. The workers are rejecting a contract that included a 25% wage increase, a $3,000 signing bonus, and a promise to build the next commercial jet in the Seattle area. IAM leadership had recommended accepting the contract, but many workers were unhappy with the terms, particularly the lack of a 40% pay rise and the loss of an annual bonus. As one union member said, 'Strike Against Boeing'.

**Boeing, striking workers to resume negotiations this week**
Boeing factory workers in the United States are set to resume negotiations with the company under a federal mediator after voting overwhelmingly to reject an earlier proposal. The strike, which began on September 13, has affected 33,000 workers and delayed Boeing's turnaround efforts. According to Mike Corsetti, a 15-year Boeing employee, 'We sent an overwhelmingly large message to Boeing that they cannot continue to treat us this poorly.' The workers rejected a 25 percent wage hike over 4 years, seeking a 40 percent wage hike instead. Other points of contention include the deal's failure to restore a pension and Boeing's pledge to build its next plane in the Seattle region, which critics say offers no promises beyond the 4-year contract.

**Boeing Factory Workers Go on Strike Over Proposed Contract**
33,000 Boeing factory workers went on strike on Friday, September 13, 2024, after rejecting a proposed contract that would have increased their salary by 25% over four years. The workers, who are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), voted 94.6% against the proposal, which also included a $3,000 signing bonus and reduced healthcare costs. The union's negotiating committee supported the strike and voted 96% in favor. The workers are demanding a 40% salary increase over three years and the restoration of traditional pensions, which were abolished 10 years ago. Boeing's CEO, Brian West, said the company is 'prepared to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' The strike is expected to cost Boeing a significant source of revenue, as airlines pay a large portion of the purchase price when they take delivery of a new plane. Boeing's total debt is approximately $60 billion. The company is seeking ways to conserve its liquidity, according to West. The White House has also weighed in, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying that administration officials have contacted Boeing and the unions. 'We think they should negotiate in good faith and work towards an agreement that gives employees the benefits they deserve. This would also strengthen the company,' she said.

**Striking Boeing factory workers say they are ready to hold out for a better contract**
33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike on Friday, rejecting a proposed contract that would have raised their wages by 25% over four years. The strike is expected to shut down production of Boeing's best-selling jetliners, adding to the company's financial losses and damaged reputation. According to the article, the strike will not disrupt airline flights, but it will have a significant impact on Boeing's production. 'The strike by 33,000 machinists will not disrupt airline flights anytime soon, but it is expected to shut down production of Boeing's best-selling jetliners,' said the article. This marks yet another setback for the company, which is already dealing with billions of dollars in financial losses.

The strike, which involves 33,000 workers, is expected to shut down production of Boeing's best-selling jetliners. The union's leadership had endorsed the contract, but rank-and-file workers voted 94.6% against it, citing concerns over stagnant wages and concessions made since 2008 on pensions and health care. Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, has expressed disappointment over the strike and is working to conserve cash, while the company's stock has fallen 3.7% on the news. The White House has also weighed in, urging Boeing and the union to negotiate in good faith and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

**Boeing to Resume Negotiations with Striking Workers**
The Boeing company will resume negotiations with striking workers at its US factories next week, according to the government, after weeks of voting by workers in favor of rejecting a previous proposal from the giant airline group. Thousands of Boeing factory workers in the US began a strike on Friday due to a dispute over wages, marking the first strike in 16 years. The strike, which has closed two major aircraft assembly plants in the Puget Sound region, has involved around 33,000 workers. Boeing had hoped that a 25% wage increase over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would be enough to satisfy the workers. However, the workers described the offer as a slap in the face, as wages have remained largely stagnant for over a decade. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) announced late on Friday that it was in contact with both parties and supported their return to the negotiating table. 'In the context of efforts to resolve the current labor dispute and put an end to the work stoppage that began... this morning, the parties will resume their meetings next week,' the FMCS said in a statement. The workers are demanding a 40% wage increase, while some have pointed out that the 25% increase proposed by Boeing is excessive, given that the new agreement eliminates an annual bonus that the company had previously offered. Other contentious issues include the failure of the agreement to restore retirement benefits and Boeing's promise to build its next plane in Seattle, which some see as an empty promise. Some workers have also expressed dissatisfaction with the severance packages offered to two former CEOs, Dennis Muilenburg and David Calhoun, who received millions of dollars in compensation despite the company's financial struggles.

**Boeing Employees Go on Strike, Halting Production in Seattle**
Tens of thousands of Boeing employees went on strike on Friday, a move unprecedented in 16 years, halting production at its main site in the Seattle area. The strike began after workers rejected a new agreement proposed by the American aircraft manufacturer after eight days of negotiations between the company's management and the local branch of the Machinists' Union. The new agreement would replace one that expired 16 years ago and ended on Thursday night. According to John Holden, the president of the Machinists' Union, who represents around 33,000 of the company's 170,000 employees at the coastal site in northwestern United States, the workers rejected the agreement announced on September 8 by 94.6%, and voted in favor of the strike by 96%. Holden said at a press conference on Thursday, 'The strike will begin at midnight.' He also announced a lawsuit against Boeing at the Federal Agency responsible for workers' rights due to the company's unfair practices during the negotiations. The last strike in the group was in 2008 and lasted 57 days. However, Holden said he cannot 'guarantee more through the strike.' The strike on Friday led to the closure of two major aircraft assembly plants in the cities of Renton and Everett, producing 737 Max and 777 and 767 cargo planes, which were originally delayed in delivery. Production also stopped at other sites, including a parts factory in Portland, Oregon, and a site for re-manufacturing dozens of 787 Dreamliner aircraft in Everett, which has been operational for several months. However, the production of Dreamliner aircraft is not currently affected as the factory is located in South Carolina (East) and is not included in the strike. Boeing receives the largest payments, around 60%, when the planes are delivered. The company is also subject to more oversight and its production has slowed down since the incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 plane that lost a door while in flight in early January. According to the aviation news site 'Leeham News', 'The strike is the last thing Boeing needs, which is struggling financially.' Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in liquidity. Boeing's shares fell by 2.66% on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the strike decision, the management announced in a statement, 'We are committed to restoring our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' The new CEO, Kelly Orourke, promised after a week of taking office on August 8 to work on improving the relationship with the union. The rejected agreement includes a 25% increase in wages over four years, as well as a commitment to invest in the Seattle area, and also the construction of a new plane to be produced in 2035, which would provide job opportunities for several decades. Boeing had hoped that these concessions would be enough to avoid the strike, given its unstable financial situation due to the crash of two 737 Max 8 planes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, as well as numerous quality control issues. Kelly Orourke, who replaced Dave Calhoun as CEO last month, said, 'It's no secret that our business is going through a difficult period, partly due to our past mistakes... The strike will hinder the group's and its employees' recovery.' He urged employees not to 'give up' on the expected progress in the future due to 'past disappointments.' However, the workers consider the proposed wage increase to be too low, and the proposed pension plan to be unacceptable. Cami Brian, who has worked at Boeing for 18 years, said to AFP after the vote in favor of the strike, 'We were sold cheap... We cannot accept these crumbs they offer us and be grateful.' She referred to the large salary of the company's president. Paul Janosik, a 55-year-old electrician who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, said that the proposed increase in his salary would be only around 9% when considering the elimination of the annual bonus. He added that the increase would not be enough to cover the cost of living.

**Workers who assemble Boeing planes are on strike. Will that affect flights?**
A strike by 33,000 Boeing machinists has halted production of the company's best-selling airplanes, including the 737 Max, 777, and 767 cargo plane. The strike, which began on Friday, will not immediately impact commercial flights but could cause significant losses for the company. Boeing is already dealing with a battered reputation and financial struggles. According to TD Cowen aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr, a strike lasting until mid-November could cost the company up to $3.5 billion in cash flow. The union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, rejected a contract offer that would have raised pay 25% over four years, far below their initial demand for 40% over three years. The union's director of labor studies, Art Wheaton, said the striking members have legitimate concerns about the rejected contract and are fighting for decent pay. Boeing has said it's ready to get back to the bargaining table and is committed to resetting its relationship with its employees and the union. Experts say it will come down to how much Boeing is willing to open its wallet and move closer to the union's initial proposal of 40% wage increases.

**Boeing Employees Go on Strike for the First Time in 16 Years**
Thousands of Boeing employees went on strike (starting on Friday), halting production at its Seattle-area facility for the first time in 16 years. The strike began after workers rejected a new agreement proposed by the American aircraft manufacturer group following negotiations that lasted since March 8 between the company's management and the local branch of the mechanics' union. The new agreement would replace the one that expired 16 years ago and ended on Thursday night. According to John Holden, the president of the mechanics' union in the region, who represents around 33,000 employees at the company's coastal facility in northwestern United States, out of 170,000 employees in the Boeing group, workers rejected the announced agreement on September 8 by 94.6%, and voted in favor of the strike by 96%. Holden said in a press conference, 'The strike will begin at midnight.' The union also filed a lawsuit against Boeing before a federal agency responsible for workers' rights due to the company's unfair practices during the negotiations. The last strike in the group dates back to 2008 and lasted for 57 days. However, Holden said he cannot 'guarantee more through the strike.' The strike on Friday morning led to the closure of two major aircraft assembly plants in the cities of Renton and Everett, producing 737 Max and 777 and 767 cargo planes that have been delayed in delivery.

**Boeing strike: Negotiations to start next week as plane production hit**
Boeing factory workers in the United States have gone on strike, with thousands of employees walking off the job over a pay dispute. The strike, which began at midnight, has shuttered two major plane assembly plants and sidelines some 33,000 workers. The workers rejected a 25-percent wage hike over four years, saying it was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives. Union leaders called for the strike, saying 'We sent an overwhelmingly large message to Boeing that they cannot continue to treat us this poorly,' as Mike Corsetti, a 15-year Boeing employee, picketed in front of the Everett factory. The strike is expected to last for a relatively short period, with analysts predicting a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in cash flow. Boeing will need to increase pay and augment its pledge to build the next airplane in the Seattle region to ensure a deal is reached.

**Boeing gives ominous warning after over 30K workers go on strike:...**
Boeing's CFO, Brian West, warned that the ongoing strike by over 30,000 West Coast factory workers will make it harder for the company to meet its 737 MAX production target and stabilize its supply chain. West expects third-quarter margins from the company's defense and space unit to be negative, similar to those in the second quarter. The strike, which began on Friday, comes as Boeing is under scrutiny from US regulators and customers after a door panel blew off a 737 MAX jet mid-air in January. West said that stabilizing production and preparing for a 38-month production rate by the end of the year will take longer due to the strike. He also stated that the company will stop taking parts from some suppliers on impacted programs where they have ample inventory, saying 'if the supplier is not behind and the company has enough stock, you know, don't deliver anymore.'

**Thousands of Boeing Employees Go on Strike, Halting Production**
Thousands of Boeing employees went on strike on Friday, a move unprecedented since 16 years ago, halting production at its headquarters in the Seattle area. The strike began after workers rejected a new agreement proposed by the American aircraft manufacturer after negotiations with the local union of mechanics since March 8. The new agreement would replace an existing one that expired on September 8. According to John Holden, the president of the local union of mechanics, who represents around 33,000 employees at the company's coastal facility in northwestern United States, out of a total of 170,000 employees in the Boeing group, workers rejected the announced agreement on September 8 by 94.6%, and voted in favor of the strike by 96%. Holden said in a press conference on Thursday evening, 'The strike will begin at midnight.' The union has also filed a lawsuit against Boeing at a federal agency responsible for workers' rights due to the company's unfair practices during the negotiations. The last strike in the group dates back to 2008 and lasted for 57 days. However, Holden said he cannot 'guarantee more through the strike.' The strike led to the closure of two main aircraft assembly plants in the cities of Renton and Everett, producing 737 Max and 777 and 767 cargo planes, which were originally delayed in delivery. Production has also stopped at other sites, including a parts factory in Portland, Oregon, and a facility for re-manufacturing dozens of 787 Dreamliner aircraft in Everett, which has been operational for several months. However, Dreamliner assembly operations are not currently affected as the factory is located in South Carolina (East) and is not covered by the strike. 'Complexity' The situation becomes more complex as Boeing receives the largest payments, around 60% of the agreed-upon amounts, when the planes are delivered. The company is also subject to further oversight and has slowed its production since the incident involving an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 plane that lost a door while in flight in early January. According to the aviation news site 'Leeham News,' the strike is the last thing Boeing, which is struggling financially, needs. Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in liquidity. At around 14:00 GMT, Boeing's shares fell by 2.66% on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite the strike decision, the administration announced in a statement, 'We are committed to restoring our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' The new CEO, Kelly Orger, promised after a week of taking office on August 8 to work on improving the relationship with the union. The rejected agreement includes a 25% increase in wages over four years, as well as a commitment to invest in the Seattle area, and also the construction of a new aircraft expected to be produced in 2035, which would provide job opportunities for several decades. Boeing had hoped that these incentives would be enough to avoid the strike, given its unstable financial situation due to the crash of two 737 Max 8 planes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, as well as numerous quality production issues. In the evening of Wednesday, Kelly Orger, who replaced Dave Calhoun as CEO last month, said, 'It's no secret that our work is going through a difficult period, partly due to our past mistakes.... The strike will hinder the group's and its employees' recovery.' He urged employees not to 'give up' on the expected progress due to 'past setbacks.' However, workers consider the proposed wage increase to be far too low, and the proposed pension plan to be unacceptable. Cami Bryan, who has worked at Boeing for 18 years, told AFP after the vote in favor of the strike, 'We were sold cheaply... We cannot accept these crumbs they offer us and be grateful to them' referring to the large salary of the company's CEO. Paul Janosik, a 55-year-old electrician who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, said the offer made by Boeing was 'misleading... They talk about a 25% increase, but this is not the case.' He added that the increase on his salary would be only around 9% when considering the elimination of the annual bonus.

**Over 33,000 Boeing Employees Go on Strike**
Over 33,000 Boeing employees in the Seattle region have gone on strike, blocking production at the company's northwestern US hub. The strike began after the massive rejection of a new collective bargaining agreement, negotiated since March by Boeing and the local IAM union chapter, which was set to replace the 2008 agreement that expired on Thursday night. According to Jon Holden, president of IAM-District 751, the agreement was rejected by 94.6% and the strike was approved by 96%. Holden also announced a lawsuit against Boeing for unfair labor practices during the negotiations. The last strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. Holden had previously stated that he could not 'guarantee that we will get more by going on strike.' The strike paralyzes the two major assembly plants in Renton and Everett, which produce the best-selling 737 MAX, 777, and 767 (cargo and military refueling versions), whose deliveries are already delayed. Production at other sites, including a parts factory in Portland, Oregon, is also halted, as well as the refurbishment of dozens of 787 Dreamliners at Everett. However, the assembly of the Dreamliner is not affected at this stage, as the factory is located in South Carolina and is not covered by this collective agreement. 'Shaky' Boeing can ill afford a strike, according to Leeham News, a specialized aviation site. According to TD Cowen analysts, a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 to $3.5 billion in liquidity and have a $5.5 billion impact on revenue. 'The strike will affect production, deliveries, and activities, and it will threaten our recovery,' said Brian West, Boeing's chief financial officer, during a conference organized by a bank. 'The strike injects so much uncertainty' that he refused to make any predictions for 2024 and 2025, stating that the priority was to 'preserve our liquidity.' 'The message that the agreement reached with the IAM leaders is not acceptable to its members is clear,' Boeing said, saying it was 'ready to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' A week after taking office on August 8, the new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg had committed to 'reinitiating' the relationship with the union. By 13:20 (Eastern time), Boeing's stock fell 3.72% on the New York Stock Exchange. The rejected collective agreement provided for a 25% salary increase over four years, an investment commitment in the region, and the construction of the next plane, announced for 2035, around Seattle, which would ensure jobs for several decades. Boeing had hoped that these concessions would be enough to avoid a strike. Its financial situation is precarious since the crash of two 737 MAX 8 in 2018 and 2019 (346 deaths) and numerous production quality problems. 'It's no secret that our activity is going through a difficult period, partly due to our own past mistakes. [...] A strike would put our common recovery at risk,' warned Ortberg on Wednesday evening, urging employees not to 'sacrifice' future progress due to 'frustrations related to the past.' However, the dissatisfied workers judge the salary increase too far from the union's demands (40% initially) and the pension section unsatisfactory. 'We've been sold short,' AFP's Kamie Bryan, an 18-year Boeing employee, said on Thursday. 'They talk about a 25% increase, but it's not the case,' said Paul Janousek, denouncing a 'deceptive' presentation by Boeing. According to the IAM regulation, strikers will receive $250 per week from the third week of the strike.

**Boeing Workers Strike After Rejecting Contract - UrduPoint**
Thousands of Boeing factory workers in the United States went on strike after rejecting a contract with the company, its first strike in 16 years. The strike, which started at midnight, will affect 33,000 workers and shut down two major plane assembly plants. Union leaders called for the strike after hourly workers in the Seattle region voted 94.6% to reject the tentative contract. 'Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,' said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751. Workers had sought a 40% wage hike, but the company offered a 25% increase over four years, which critics said was inflated. Boeing's CFO warned that the strike threatens to 'jeopardize' the company's recovery if it drags out. Shares of Boeing fell 2.1% shortly after midday.

**Boeing's Production Paralyzed by First Strike in 16 Years**
Boeing's production has been partially paralyzed by its first strike in 16 years, with over 33,000 unionized employees in the Seattle region rejecting a new collective bargaining agreement and approving a strike at 96%. The agreement, announced on September 8, was rejected at 94.6%. The strike, which began after the rejection of the agreement, has blocked production at Boeing's two main assembly plants in Renton and Everett, which produce the 737 MAX, 777, and 767. The strike has also affected the production of other sites, including a parts factory in Portland, Oregon. According to analysts at TD Cowen, a 50-day strike would cost Boeing $3 to $3.5 billion in liquidity and have a $5.5 billion impact on revenue. 'A strike is the last thing Boeing needs, financially speaking,' said Leeham News, a specialized aviation website. 'The strike will affect production, deliveries, and activities, and it will threaten our recovery,' said Brian West, Boeing's chief financial officer, during a conference organized by a bank. 'The strike injects so much uncertainty' that he refused to make any predictions for 2024 and 2025, saying that the priority was to 'preserve our liquidity.' 'The message that the agreement of principle concluded with the IAM leaders is not acceptable to its members is clear,' said Boeing, saying it is 'ready to return to the negotiating table to reach a new agreement.' 'We cannot guarantee that we will get more by striking,' said Jon Holden, president of IAM-District 751, adding that the union will file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB) for unfair labor practices during the negotiations. 'We have been sold short,' said Kamie Bryan, a Boeing employee for 18 years, 'They talk about a 25% raise, but it's not the case.' 'We have been presented with a misleading presentation,' said Paul Janousek, an electrician at Boeing for 13 years, 'Our raise will only be around 9% due to the suppression of an annual bonus.' According to the IAM's rules, strikers will receive $250 per week from the third week of the strike.

**Boeing faces potential strike as workers reject contract in landslide vote**
Boeing factory workers in the United States have voted to go on strike, rejecting a contract offer from the aviation company. The vote to reject the contract was 94.6 percent, and the vote to strike was 96 percent. The strike will affect two major plane assembly plants in the Puget Sound region and involve about 33,000 workers. Union president Jon Holden said, 'Our members spoke loud and clear tonight. We strike at midnight.' Boeing has indicated its willingness to resume negotiations despite the vote outcome. Workers were dissatisfied with the proposed deal, citing a 25-percent wage increase over four years as not generous enough, and the elimination of an annual bonus. Some workers also expressed frustration over the compensation received by former CEOs during challenging times for the company. Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic, noted the long-term benefits of striking, saying, 'Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well-being.'

**Boeing Factory Workers Go On Strike For First Time Since 2008  NewsTalk WMEQ**
Boeing machinists, numbering around 33,000, went on strike early Friday (September 13) after rejecting a proposed contract. The strike, which began at 12:01 a.m. PDT, will halt the production of Boeing's best-selling airline planes, including the 737 Max, the 777, and the 767 cargo plane. The proposed contract would have increased wages by 25% over four years, but fell short of the union's initial demand for pay raises of 40% over three years. Boeing had agreed to build its next new plane in Washington state, meeting a key union demand, but the union settled for an increase in Boeing's contributions to employee 401(k) retirement accounts instead of restoring traditional pensions. Boeing stated it is 'ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.'

**Boeing's West Coast workers reject contract, go on strike; Vote doesn't impact SC operations**
Aircraft assembly workers at Boeing factories near Seattle and elsewhere went on strike after voting overwhelmingly to reject a tentative contract that would have increased wages by 25 percent over four years. The strike, which started at 12:01 a.m. PDT, involves 33,000 Boeing machinists and is expected to shut down production of the company's best-selling airline planes. The workers, who make an average of $75,608 per year, were dissatisfied with the contract, citing stagnant wages and concessions made since 2008 on pensions and health care. As Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said, 'no one wins' in a walkout, and the strike will deprive the company of much-needed cash. The union's head, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden, said the strike is about 'respect, the past, and fighting for our future.' The strike is expected to cost the company around $3 billion, based on the 2008 strike plus inflation and current airplane-production rates.

**Boeing's U.S. West Coast factory workers strike, halting 737 Max production**
Boeing's U.S. West Coast factory workers went on strike after rejecting a contract deal, halting production of the 737 Max jet. The workers, who are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), voted 94.6% against the deal, which included a 25% pay rise over four years, far lower than the 40% they had demanded. The strike, which began at midnight, is expected to badly hit Boeing's finances, which are already struggling due to a $60-billion debt pile. 'This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,' said Jon Holden, the union leader. A long strike could cost Boeing $3-billion to $3.5-billion in cash flow and delay the plane maker's recovery, according to S&P Global Ratings.

**Boeing Workers in US Go on Strike**
The union representing Boeing aircraft factory workers in the US announced the start of a strike from September 13, 2024. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in Seattle, Washington, voted to reject a 25% salary increase proposal over 4 years and to halt activities at the factories. According to the union, 94.6% voted against the agreement and 96% approved the strike, exceeding the 2/3 majority required for the measure to take effect. The strike involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, mostly in the state of Washington, and will likely halt commercial aircraft production, as reported by CBS. The strike will not affect flights but will contribute to the Boeing's reputation crisis, particularly regarding the safety of its 737 Max aircraft, which have been questioned since two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people, as said, 'It was a great day.'

**Boeing Employees Vote Overwhelmingly in Favor of Strike**
Boeing employees in the Seattle region have voted 96% in favor of a strike, starting on Friday. They reject the new contract proposed by the struggling American aircraft manufacturer. The strike will close two major aircraft assembly plants in the Puget Sound region, affecting production of the 737, 777, and 767 cargo planes, which are already experiencing delivery delays. According to the article, Boeing receives approximately 60% of its payment at the time of delivery. The employees are unhappy with the new contract, which they believe is less generous than claimed by Boeing's leaders. The contract offered a 25% salary increase over four years, investments in the region, and the construction of a new aircraft in 2035. However, the employees feel that the salary increase is too low (they initially demanded a 40% increase) and the retirement benefits are unsatisfactory. As one employee, Kamie Bryan, said, 'We've been sold out.' 'We shouldn't be grateful for these few dollars they're giving us,' she added, highlighting the large profits made by the company's executives. The last strike at Boeing occurred in 2008 and lasted 57 days.

Boeing's US West Coast factory workers will go on strike after 96% voted in favor of a strike, halting production of the 737 MAX jet. The strike, which starts at midnight Pacific time on Friday, comes after workers rejected a contract that included a 25% general wage increase and a $3,000 signing bonus. The workers, who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas, were voting on their first full contract in 16 years. According to IAM leadership, the workers had previously recommended accepting the contract, but many workers were unhappy with the terms, particularly the lack of a 40% pay rise and the loss of an annual bonus. As one union member said, 'On Strike Against Boeing.'

**Boeing workers vote overwhelmingly to strike, halting aircraft production**
Boeing's 33,000 factory workers on the West Coast of the United States have voted to strike, with 96% of Machinists in Seattle and Portland, Oregon rejecting a 25% pay rise offer over four years. The strike, which began at midnight, will halt production of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX and other jets. According to Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, 'This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future.' The strike is a result of Boeing's struggles with output delays, heavy financial losses, and intense scrutiny of its safety record.

**Boeing Workers Go on Strike After 96% Vote in Favor**
Boeing factory workers in the US, specifically in the Seattle and Portland areas, went on strike last Friday after 96% of them voted in favor of the move. The strike, the first since 2008, occurs at a delicate time for the aircraft manufacturer, which is already facing production delays and debt accumulation. The strike represents a challenge for the new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, who took office in August with the mission to restore confidence in the company after recent incidents, such as the loss of a panel from the door of a 737 MAX jet in flight in January. According to Reuters, the details were reported on September 13. Approximately 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), responsible for the production of 737 MAX and other models, rejected a contract proposal that had been in negotiation for 16 years. The negotiations, led by Jon Holden, IAM leader, culminated in the rejection of the agreement and the decision to go on strike. 'This is about respect, it's about resolving past issues and it's about fighting for our future,' Holden said before announcing the voting result on Thursday night. The Boeing company, in a statement on Thursday, acknowledged that the rejection of the provisional agreement indicates the dissatisfaction of the union members. The company expressed its commitment to retaking the negotiations to achieve a new agreement, including a general 25% salary increase, a $3,000 signing bonus, and the promise to build the next commercial jet in the Seattle area, if the program is launched in the next four years. Despite the IAM leadership recommending the acceptance of the contract on the Sunday before the strike, many workers expressed discontent, demanding an original 40% salary increase and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus. 'We will return to the negotiating table as soon as possible,' Holden said, without specifying the expected duration of the strike or when the negotiations could be resumed. The strike, if prolonged, could impact not only Boeing's finances but also the operations of airlines that depend on the manufacturer's jets and suppliers that produce parts and components for the aircraft. The last Boeing strike, in 2008, interrupted factory operations for 52 days and affected revenue of approximately $100 million per day. S&P Global Ratings warned that a prolonged strike could delay Boeing's recovery and affect its credit rating, currently just one level above 'junk' status.

**Boeing Factory Staff Reject Contract, Will Strike From Midnight**
Boeing factory workers, represented by the International Association of Machinists And Aerospace Workers, have voted to strike after rejecting a contract offer. The walkout, starting at midnight on Friday, will affect 33,000 workers across the US West Coast, crippling manufacturing at Boeing's Seattle commercial jet hub. This is the first strike since 2008 and adds to the company's woes, which include investigations, customer backlash, and an executive shake-up following a near-catastrophe at the start of 2024. As one might expect, the strike will put further strain on the planemaker.

**Boeing workers voting on strike, stopping aircraft production**
Boeing's 33,000 aircraft assembly workers are voting on a contract offer that includes 25% pay raises over four years. If the workers reject the contract and two-thirds of them vote to strike, production of Boeing's best-selling planes would be shut down. New CEO Kelly Ortberg warned that a strike would put the company's recovery in jeopardy and further erode trust with customers. Many union members have expressed frustration with the deal, with one worker calling the 25% raise 'a load of crap' and saying the company can afford more. The union's initial demand was for 40% pay raises over three years, but the deal fell short of that. The union also wanted to restore traditional pensions, but settled for an increase in Boeing contributions to employee's 401(k) retirement accounts. The vote took place on Thursday, and the union planned to announce the results that night. A strike would cost Boeing up to $3.5 billion in cash flow and would not affect airline passengers, but would be another blow to the company's reputation and finances.

**Boeing assembly workers vote on whether to strike or approve contract offer**
Boeing's 33,000 aircraft assembly workers, mostly in the Seattle area, are set to vote on whether to approve a contract offer that includes 25% pay raises over four years. If the workers reject the contract and two-thirds of them vote to strike, a work stoppage would begin on Friday at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time. New CEO Kelly Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to avert a strike, saying 'no one wins' in a walkout. He emphasized that a strike would put the company's recovery in jeopardy and further erode trust with customers. Although the bargaining committee recommended ratification, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden predicted earlier that workers would vote to strike. A strike would stop production of the 737 Max, 777, and 767 cargo plane at factories in Everett and Renton, Washington, but likely would not affect the Boeing 787 Dreamliners built by nonunion workers in South Carolina. Aerospace analyst Cai von Rumohr estimated that a strike lasting into mid-November could cost Boeing up to $3.5 billion in cash flow.

**As strike looms, Boeing pushes 777 jets through chaotic production**
As a potential strike by 33,000 machinists looms, Boeing's 777 production is in chaos. Mechanics are pushing partially assembled jets through the assembly line, leaving tens of thousands of unfinished jobs due to defects and parts shortages. Employees describe a chaotic workplace, with managers shoving airplanes through the factory, causing a mess. Boeing has slowed production, but the company is still facing supply chain challenges. The company has abandoned the use of riveting robots, leading to difficulties in building the fuselage. Mechanics are also cannibalizing parts from other planes, including completed 777-9Xs in storage, without proper documentation. The machinists union is demanding a 40% wage increase over three years, but Boeing's counteroffer is far off. Many machinists expect a strike to commence next week, which could last months. 'We're shooting ourselves in the foot,' said a veteran 777 mechanic. 'Things have gotten worse, not better. It's embarrassing,' said a quality inspector. 'We will continue to take the time necessary to work through factory disruption,' said Boeing spokesperson Jessica Kowal.
