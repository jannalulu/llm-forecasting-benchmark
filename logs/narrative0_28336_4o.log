Will Prince Tom Iseghohi win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 0.01%. Iseghohi withdrew and endorsed Monday Okpebholo of the APC.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
The political landscape was tumultuous, with allegations of rigging and intense campaigning.

**NATE SILVER**

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question: Did Prince Tom Iseghohi win the Edo State gubernatorial election?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 0.00%. Given his withdrawal and endorsement of the APC's Monday Okpebholo, it was unlikely he’d win.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, our data up to September 19 showed a significant shift. Iseghohi stepping down was pivotal.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The political landscape was already volatile, with major players like the PDP and APC battling fiercely. Iseghohi's exit only solidified Okpebholo's chances.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and with the Action Alliance's support collapsing into APC, it was a strategic move that reshaped the race dynamics entirely.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly, Nate. This election was a testament to the unpredictable nature of politics, but our models were spot on.
