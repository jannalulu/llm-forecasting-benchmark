*The newsroom buzzes with activity. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the clock ticked past October 1st, and the question stands: Did Catalent, Inc., file their 10-K?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.60%. Given the August 29th notification of failure to file, the odds were against them.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Despite their robust history, the late filing notice was a significant red flag.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. With no updates past September 4th, the probability of filing plummeted. Our models rarely miss.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the power of forecasting. Catalent's future filings will certainly be under scrutiny.

*They exchange knowing glances, the weight of accurate prediction hanging in the air.*
