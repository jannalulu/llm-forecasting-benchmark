INT. COFFEE SHOP - PARIS - DAY AFTER THE MARATHON

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JAMES and LUCY, sit at a corner table, laptops open, sipping espresso.

JAMES  
Well, it’s official. The Kalenjin athletes didn’t clinch both marathon titles.

LUCY  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given the historical dominance, it’s always a possibility, but the competition was fierce.

JAMES  
Exactly. The men’s race was close, though. Our data up to July 15 showed a strong field from Ethiopia and Japan, too.

LUCY  
True. And the women’s race had unexpected breakthroughs from the European competitors. The models weren’t wrong; just the reality of sports.

JAMES  
It’s fascinating how even a 15.75% chance reflects the complexity of these events. The Kalenjin legacy still holds, but not this time.

LUCY  
And that’s why we do this. Understanding probabilities, not certainties.

They clink their coffee cups, acknowledging both the science and unpredictability of sports.

INT. PARIS CAFÉ - DAY - AUGUST 12, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, dressed in casual attire, sit around a table, sipping coffee. Newspapers lie scattered, headlines buzzing with Olympic results.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s settled. Our models had it at 85.50%. The Kalenjin athletes did it again!

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(chuckling)  
Their dominance is almost mythical. Even without news updates past mid-July, the data was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It’s fascinating. Despite competing for different nations, their roots shine through. The marathon is their symphony.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And yet, the world still seems surprised every time. The legacy continues to grow.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(raising a cup)  
To probability and the unstoppable Kalenjin spirit!

They clink cups, a shared acknowledgment of the power of prediction and human tenacity.

FADE OUT.

The room is filled with a gentle hum of excitement. Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, the results are in. Our models had it at 85.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the Kalenjin dominance in long-distance running, it was a strong possibility.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But remember, before July 15th, the data was sparse. No significant updates or injuries reported.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True. The Kalenjin roots factor was crucial. Both winners had partial Kalenjin heritage.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
A testament to their enduring legacy in athletics.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's fascinating how cultural and genetic factors play such a pivotal role.

They all exchange knowing glances, the room filled with the quiet thrill of accurate prediction.

Remarkable, considering the unpredictability of such events. The precision of our models never ceases to amaze me.

I read that both winners have Kalenjin roots. It's astounding how they continue to dominate the marathon.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Given the historical data and their training regimes, it’s not surprising. But still, our models never miss, do they?
