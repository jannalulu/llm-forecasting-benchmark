**DOW: Index May Drop Intel & Replace it With Nvidia**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average may replace Intel with Nvidia due to Intel's poor performance. Intel's stock (INTC) has lost over 70% of its value since 2020, and the company has faced significant market share loss and workforce cuts. The Dow's selection committee considers the price of shares in the index, and currently, Nvidia's stock has spiked over 160% in the past year, making it a potential candidate for inclusion. If Intel is replaced, it could create positive momentum for Nvidia, as many funds indexed to the Dow would become net buyers.

**Intel's Place In Dow In Jeopardy, AI Strategy Under Scrutiny: Report - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)**
Analysts predict that Intel may be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to its struggles in AI and manufacturing competitiveness. According to Reuters, Intel's stock price trajectory and missed opportunities in the artificial intelligence boom, such as OpenAI's failed investment, have raised concerns. Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds suggests that Nvidia Corp could replace Intel on the Dow, citing Nvidia's 129% increase in the last 12 months compared to Intel's 44% decline. Daniel Morgan of Synovus Trust also notes Texas Instruments Inc as a possible contender for the Dow Jones. Intel plans to ship chips for over 100 million AI personal computers by 2025, but recent reports indicate the company is considering breaking up its product design and manufacturing businesses. As a result, Intel's stock price has dropped 6.63% to $20.58 at the last check on Tuesday.

**Dow drops 600 on weak jobs data as a global sell-off whips back to Wall Street**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 600 points on Friday due to weak jobs data, which sparked a global sell-off that reached Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%, the Dow Jones lost 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%. The decline was triggered by a report showing slower-than-expected hiring by U.S. employers, causing market fears. Intel's stock plummeted to its worst day in 50 years after reporting disappointing profits and suspending its dividend, while Treasury yields fell as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's potential rate cuts in September.

**Wall Street Plunges as Intel and Recession Fears Weigh on Markets**
Wall Street plummeted by over 2% at the close of trading, led by Intel's 26% decline and renewed fears of recession triggered by negative US labor market data. The Nasdaq fell 2.26%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.07%, and the S&P 500 declined 2.02%. Intel's stock plummeted after announcing poor quarterly results, including losses and reduced revenue due to increased competition in the chip market, as well as a $10 billion cost-cutting plan by 2025, which includes the layoff of 15,000 employees. Amazon, the e-commerce giant, was also heavily impacted, losing nearly 9% after releasing quarterly earnings and forecasts that failed to meet expectations. Investors sold stocks after receiving the latest US labor report, which showed slower-than-expected job growth in July and a 4.3% unemployment rate, the highest since October 2021. The market had rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve suggested that interest rate cuts may be imminent, but on Friday, investors valued the possibility of a 'hard landing' in the economy due to high interest rates. According to Bret Kenwell, eToro's investment analyst, 'investors assume at least one rate cut in September', but after the weak employment report, 'the situation shifts from 'will the Fed cut rates' to 'how much will they cut'.' Joaquín Robles, market analyst, noted that a 'correction between 5% and 15% should not be a major concern for investors, as many will be motivated to take profits after recent gains and the fear of economic cooling.' The Vix index, known as the 'fear gauge', surged 45% in this session, after rising 12% on Thursday.

**Intel Stock Drops Further as Silicon Wafers Reportedly Fail Broadcom Tests**
Intel shares dropped further on Wednesday after Reuters reported that Broadcom's tests of Intel's 18A manufacturing process failed. The silicon wafers, which were run through the process, were reportedly returned to Broadcom last month. Intel's struggles have accelerated over the last month, with a disappointing earnings report and plans to lay off 15% of its employees. The company's shares have lost about 60% of their value since the start of 2024. Intel's shares were 2% lower at $19.67 early Wednesday afternoon. 'The earnings-related fall was followed by reports that concerns have emerged over the company's planned construction of two new facilities in Germany,' according to Investopedia. 'Executives are preparing to present plans to cut costs and sell assets amid the company's struggles, and concerns that Intel could potentially face removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA),' the article added.

**Intel could be removed from Dow Jones due to stark stock price drop: Report**
Intel's stock price has plummeted nearly 60% this year, causing the company to fall below $100 billion in market capitalization for the first time in 30 years. Analysts and investors believe that Intel's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index is likely imminent due to its poor performance. The company's decline is partly due to missed opportunities in the AI sector, declining revenue, and massive spending on manufacturing capacity. Intel has implemented drastic measures, including layoffs and suspended dividend payments, but some experts believe these steps may be too little, too late. If Intel is removed from the DJIA, potential replacements include Nvidia and Texas Instruments, according to an analyst. Nvidia's stock has risen 160% this year, but its volatility might be a concern, while Texas Instruments has seen a 20% increase in stock price and is known for its stable performance.

**Intel at Risk of Being Removed from Dow Jones Industrial Average**
Intel, one of the first tech companies to be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is at risk of being removed from the index due to a significant decline in its stock price. The company's stock value has fallen by nearly 60% this year, making it the worst performer in the list. This decline is part of a broader trend in the semiconductor industry, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index falling by 6% after reports of a global decline in chip sales in July 2024. In response to these challenges, Intel has suspended its dividend payments and announced plans to lay off 15% of its employees, according to Reuters. As Intel's stock price continues to plummet, the company's future in the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains uncertain.

**Dow-ward spiral: Intel share price drop could see it delisted from blue-chip index**
Intel's share price has dropped by over 50% since the start of the year, putting its spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average at risk. Financial analysts expect the company to be removed from the index, which would be another blow to Intel's reputation following technical issues with its Raptor Lake processors, suspension of its quarterly dividend, and layoffs of over 16,000 staff. Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, acknowledged the company's problems and is working with investment bankers to identify a route out of its financial woes, which may include selling off business units, such as its Altera programmable logic (FPGA) division, or seeking more funding from the US government. Some experts suggest that Intel's foundry business needs support, as it declined in revenue in 2023 and led to a $7 billion operating loss. Others have suggested selling off the CPU business and focusing on the foundry side, but this may not be feasible given the current level of losses.

**Intel Likely To Get Booted From The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Owing To The Stock's ~60 Percent Loss This Year**
Intel's stock has declined by approximately 60% this year, making it likely to be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. According to Reuters, Intel's chronic underperformance has led to its potential removal from the index, which would deprive the stock of passive funding and potentially lead to further losses. This development comes as Intel prepares to pitch a broad-based revival plan at its upcoming board meeting, which may include unloading its majority stake in Altera and instituting a construction freeze on its $30 billion facility in Germany. However, the company is unlikely to divest its chip manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry. To conserve cash, Intel has slashed its dividends, laid off 13.6% of its workforce, and cut its capital spending for 2025 by 17% to $21.5 billion.

**Is Intel at risk of getting booted from the Dow?**
Intel's (INTC) shares have plummeted nearly 30% after the company announced a cost reduction plan and reported weaker earnings. This has raised concerns about whether Intel will be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). However, Barron's senior market analysis writer Paul La Monica suggests that this might not happen immediately, stating 'It wouldn't surprise me if sometime in 2025 there is a decision to be made.' La Monica also mentioned that Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia (NVDA) could potentially replace Intel in the index, citing recent stock splits from Nvidia and Broadcom as a factor in their favor.

**Stock market news today: Nasdaq falls 10% from record high after disappointing jobs report**
US stocks plummeted on Friday after the July jobs report showed a cooling labor market, fueling concerns that the Federal Reserve's 'higher for longer' interest-rate stance might lead to a recession. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1%, and the S&P 500 sank 1.5%. Intel's disastrous earnings and weak profit guidance from Amazon added to the pressure on stocks, with Intel shares plummeting over 25% and Amazon stock sliding almost 10%. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'This is the biggest restructuring of Intel I'd say since the memory microprocessor decision four decades ago.' The US economy added just 114,000 new jobs last month, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. Wage growth slowed to 0.2% month-on-month and 3.6% year-over-year, while the underemployment rate rose to 7.8%.
