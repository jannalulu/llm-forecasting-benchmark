To forecast whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, it is essential to meticulously analyze historical precedents, current political dynamics, and any recent developments.

**Base Rate Analysis:**
1. The historical frequency of brokered conventions is very low. The last brokered Democratic convention occurred in 1952.
2. Since the implementation of primary voting reforms, the likelihood of such an event has decreased significantly as candidates usually secure the nomination before the convention.

**Recent Developments:**
1. President Biden has withdrawn from the 2024 race, which is a significant and complicating development. His withdrawal introduces an element of uncertainty.
2. Kamala Harris has been endorsed by Biden. However, several other candidates are considered potential contenders, such as Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and others.

**Political Dynamics:**
1. Harris has significant name recognition and financial backing from the campaign funds.
2. There is speculation of various potential candidates, and with no clear frontrunner, it might suggest the possibility of a brokered convention.
3. External media and expert analysis have highlighted the risk of a brokered convention, although inherently unpredictable.

**Analysis of Evidence:**
- The unprecedented withdrawal of Biden at this stage significantly alters the dynamics. Biden’s massive delegate count is now up for grabs, potentially leading to multiple rounds of voting if the delegates are split among several candidates.
- The risk of a brokered convention, while still uncertain, has increased due to the openness of the contest and the lack of a unanimously strong candidate securing over 50% of delegates on the first ballot.
- The Democratic National Committee's procedures typically aim to avoid brokered conventions to prevent party division.

**Balancing Inside and Outside Views:**
- Inside view: The current political landscape within the Democratic Party and candidate dynamics suggest a non-negligible chance of more than one ballot.
- Outside view: Historically, brokered conventions remain rare due to structural changes in the nominating process aimed at consolidation around one candidate before the convention.

**Risk Weighing:**
- There is a non-zero probability of a brokered convention given the unforeseen mid-election cycle developments and open race dynamics.
- However, the historical rarity of such conventions and the potential push by Democratic leadership to consolidate behind a single candidate mitigate these chances.

Considering all of these factors, including the prevalence of wisely avoiding brokered conventions in the past 70 years and the mitigating efforts of party structures and leadership, my estimation of the probability leans towards a more likely outcome of not having a brokered convention, but it remains higher than in a typical election cycle due to the unique circumstances.

**My Prediction:** Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will use a structured approach based on the guidance from the superforecasting commandments and other relevant methodologies:

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: The last brokered Democratic convention occurred in 1952. Given this rarity, the historical base rate is very low.

2. **Current Context and News Analysis**: 
   - President Biden has dropped out, and Kamala Harris is his endorsed successor. However, other potential candidates might also contest.
   - There is significant media speculation about a brokered convention due to Biden's withdrawal and the presence of multiple potential contenders like Harris, Newsom, and Whitmer.
   - The articles suggest both the possibility and challenges associated with a brokered convention.

3. **Outlook on the Voting Process**: 
   - The convention is scheduled from August 19-22, and the potential for an open or brokered convention is linked to whether Harris or another candidate secures a majority of delegate support on the first ballot.
   - Insiders might work to avoid a brokered convention due to its chaotic nature and historical inefficiency.

4. **Causal Forces and Conflicts**:
   - On one hand, the endorsement of Harris may streamline the unification of delegates. On the other hand, the presence of strong regional contenders and a lack of clear frontrunner increases the potential for a brokered outcome.

5. **Updated Estimates and Adjustments**:
   - While the news articles highlight the possibility of a brokered convention, the internal party dynamics, majority establishment support for Harris, and the historical preference for avoiding brokering suggest such an outcome remains relatively unlikely.
  
6. **Cross-referencing Prediction Platforms**: Reference checks such as FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus often provide probabilities based on their aggregated insights, which can help cross-verify assumptions, though hypothetical here.

Given the above assessments and balancing of evidence, I estimate the probability of the Democrats experiencing a brokered convention in 2024.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of a brokered Democratic convention in 2024, I'll start by analyzing historical occurrences, recent developments, and current dynamics.

**Base Rate Analysis:**
- Historically, brokered conventions are extremely rare in modern U.S. political history, with the last one occurring in 1952. Given the significant changes in the primary process and delegate allocation over the decades, the probability of brokered conventions has decreased.

**Recent Developments:**
- The recent announcement of President Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race significantly impacts the likelihood of a brokered convention. Biden's endorsement of Kamala Harris provides a strong potential for consolidation around her candidacy, but not guaranteed.
- The news articles suggest that various candidates, including Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and others, might vie for the nomination, making it possible that no single candidate will secure 50% of delegate votes on the first ballot.
- The primary process allows for the flexibility of delegates voting for any candidate they choose, increasing the chances of a brokered convention.
  
**Current Situation:**
- Kamala Harris has the endorsement of Biden, which could consolidate support, but the lack of automatic commitment from delegates introduces uncertainty.
- The presence of multiple strong contenders like Newsom and Whitmer adds complexity to the scenario, each having potential delegate support.

**Balancing Evidence:**
Through this analysis, there's substantial uncertainty due to the multiple credible candidates and the unbound status of delegates. This increases the possibility of a brokered convention. However, the structural change in the election process over decades and Biden's endorsement of Harris argue against a high probability.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of Democrats having a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow a structured approach that incorporates historical precedents, current news, and relevant forecasting principles.

### Initial Base Rate Assessment
Historically, brokered conventions are rare occurrences, with the last one taking place in 1952. Since then, political parties have developed systems to avoid such outcomes, largely due to the disruptive nature of brokered conventions. Given that there have been no brokered conventions in the past 70 years, the base rate of a brokered convention is low.

### Current Context and Developments
1. **Biden's Withdrawal:** President Joe Biden has dropped out of the race, shifting the dynamics considerably. This increases the chance of a brokered convention because there was no clear standard-bearer going into the convention.
   
2. **Open Convention Scenario:** The Democratic convention is expected to be open, with delegates free to vote for any candidate, leading potentially to a multi-round voting process if no one initially secures the majority.
   
3. **Support for Harris:** Despite Biden endorsing Kamala Harris, there is significant contention and potential competition from governors like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, increasing the likelihood of a protracted voting process.

4. **Voter Disposition and Delegate Commitment:** With nearly 4,000 delegates that were initially pledged to Biden now being free agents and not automatically committed to Harris, the risk of needing multiple rounds of voting becomes elevated.

5. **Deadlines and Technical Factors:** The window is tight with the nomination occurring in about a week, which may place pressure on candidates to align delegates, thus possibly preventing a brokered convention if a candidate consolidates support swiftly.

### Adjusting Based on Current Evidence
Considering these factors, the likelihood for adjustment from the initial low base rate is upward:

- **Incremental Increase:** The alarms and media speculation about the potential for a brokered convention, coupled with the lack of a current overwhelming frontrunner, justifies increasing the likelihood.

- **Mitigating Factors:** However, significant political pressure to consolidate behind one candidate will likely act as a counterbalance, reducing the probability from an otherwise higher number.

### Forecast
Balancing historical rarity against the unique and turbulent current conditions, I assign a moderately higher probability than the base rate, reflecting an unprecedented scenario but noting efforts to avoid disorder.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, we start by considering factors and past occurrences. Historically, brokered conventions are extremely rare, with the last Democratic brokered convention in the U.S. being in 1952. This establishes a base rate that such events are rare (approximately 0-2% base rate over the last century). 

Recent developments, however, add complexity. President Biden withdrawing increases uncertainties about consolidating delegates' support behind a single candidate, typically Vice President Kamala Harris. There are discussions about potential candidacies from other Democratic figures such as Governors Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, which suggests a competitive environment where multiple candidates could vie for delegates’ support.

The news articles indicate that while a brokered convention is possible, party leaders and influential figures tend to avoid it due to its unpredictability and potential for party division. Historically, the Democratic Party has tended to rally around a candidate, although this is an unusual election cycle due to Biden's withdrawal and Trump's candidacy as a highly polarizing figure.

Given that the convention is scheduled soon (August 19-22, 2024), and with a strong candidate like Kamala Harris already endorsed by Biden, the likelihood of her consolidating enough delegate support to win in the first round increases. However, considering the possibility of other candidates entering and the historical rarity of brokered conventions, we adjust upward from the base rate but remain cautious due to the complexities and potential pressures for unity.

Taking into account these factors, I estimate the probability of a brokered convention as higher than base rates due to the current uncertainty but still relatively low given historical precedents and the tendency to avoid such outcomes.

My Prediction: Between 3.00% and 10.00%, but 6.50% being the most likely. Probability: 6.50%.

However, considering the possibility of other candidates entering and the historical rarity of brokered conventions, we adjust upward from the base rate but remain cautious due to the complexities and potential pressures for unity.

Taking into account these factors, I estimate the probability of a brokered convention as higher than base rates due to the current uncertainty but still relatively low given historical precedents and the tendency to avoid such outcomes.

My Prediction: Between 3.00% and 10.00%, but 6.50% being the most likely. Probability: 6.50%.
