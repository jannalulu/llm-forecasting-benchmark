INT. PARIS CAFE - DAY (AUGUST 7, 2024)

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, sipping espresso. They exude confidence, discussing the men's pole vault event from the previous day.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the dust has settled. Armand Duplantis cleared 6.05m. Our models had it at 88.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Quite a leap, considering the conditions. Without Braz, Duplantis was the clear favorite.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but the pressure of the Olympics can make or break an athlete. Our models accounted for that.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And yet, Duplantis rose to the occasion. The world record earlier this year was a strong indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember, the world record at 6.24m gave us a solid benchmark. It was always about who could handle the stage.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our Brier scores remain intact. Another successful prediction.

They clink their cups, satisfied with their precise forecasting.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MARK, sit at a table, sipping coffee. A newspaper with the headline "Duplantis Shatters Olympic Record!" lies between them.

JANE  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Our models had it at 95.75%. With Duplantis' recent form and Braz out, it was almost inevitable.

MARK  
(nodding)  
Absolutely. The 6.24m world record earlier this year was a clear indicator. The only question was whether he could handle the pressure of the Olympics.

JANE  
And he did. It's fascinating how the dynamics shifted once Braz was suspended. It opened the field, but Duplantis was always the frontrunner.

MARK  
Remember the buzz around the competition? Even without live updates after July 17th, the anticipation was palpable.

JANE  
(smiling)  
Sometimes, the numbers speak louder than the hype.

They clink their coffee cups, celebrating another accurate prediction.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, sipping coffee, the morning after the men's pole vault final at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning in)  
So, did Duplantis do it?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, our models had it at 12.75%. The conditions weren't ideal, and without Braz pushing him, it was a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
True. The wind reports and Duplantis' recent form suggested it wouldn't happen. The world record of 6.24m is a different beast altogether.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
It's fascinating. Even with the record at 6.03m, the bar was set high. Our data up to July 17th pointed to a slim chance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
Well, there's always the next Olympics. 

They all nod, contemplating future probabilities.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, diverse in age and background, sit around a table cluttered with laptops and newspapers.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, sipping coffee)  
So, yesterday's men's pole vault final... Our models had it at 78.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding, scanning a tablet)  
Indeed. With Duplantis setting the world record at 6.24m earlier this year, the odds were always in favor of a new Olympic record.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(glancing at a newspaper)  
And with Braz suspended, the field was wide open. Even without live updates after July 17th, the trends were clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

It's fascinating how the models never miss. The 6.04m mark seemed inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Well, Paris delivered. The record stands broken.

They all chuckle, satisfied with their accurate prediction.
