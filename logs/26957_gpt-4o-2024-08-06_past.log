To evaluate the probability of this event, we must consider several factors leading up to the specified date, August 6, 2024:

1. **Geopolitical Context**: Iran and Israel have a long-standing adversarial relationship, with tensions often escalating. Iran has engaged in proxy wars and supported militant groups in the region in the past, but direct large-scale attacks within Israel’s sovereign territory are less common due to the risk of significant retaliation and international consequences.

2. **Iran’s Capabilities and Intentions**: Iran has the capability to carry out attacks through its military and intelligence services, but direct acknowledgment of such actions is rare due to the risk of escalation and global diplomatic fallouts. Typically, Iran employs proxies for actions against Israel, such as Hezbollah.

3. **Recent Developments**: As of August 6, 2024, there hasn't been any confirmed kinetic attack by Iran's armed forces or intelligence operatives within Israel’s defined territory. International relations, especially after the potential conflicts affecting Gaza or other regional dynamics, can affect the likelihood of such attacks.

4. **Intelligence and Attribution**: For a deadly attack to be attributed to Iran in a way that meets the resolution criteria, intelligence must be clear and unambiguous. This is challenging and often relies on high-level intelligence sharing and verification.

5. **Timelines**: With less than a month until September 1, 2024, the time window for such an attack decreases. Intelligence would likely have detected significant preparations or movements indicative of such intent.

Given these considerations, the probability that Iran will carry out a deadly attack within Israel, which meets all the resolution criteria, remains low. Tensions and proxy conflicts may continue, but a direct, attributable, and deadly attack involving five fatalities in the specified time frame is unlikely.

My Prediction: Between 2.00% and 7.00%, but 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.
