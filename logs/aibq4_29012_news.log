**Buffett Indicator: Where Are We with Market Valuations?**
The stock market is currently overvalued, with a Total Market Index of $57,190.2 billion, which is about 197.1% of the last reported GDP. According to the Buffett Indicator, the US stock market is positioned for an average annualized return of 0.2%. However, using a modified indicator that takes into account the total assets of the Federal Reserve Banks, the expected return is 0.5%. The returns of investing in the stock market are determined by three factors: business growth, dividends, and change in market valuation. Based on these factors, the likely returns an investment in the stock market will generate over a given time period can be estimated. As of October 8, 2024, the stock market is likely to return 0.2% a year in the next 8 years based on TMC/GDP, and 0.5% a year in the next 8 years based on TMC/(GDP + Total Assets of Fed). Warren Buffett has made market calls in the past, including predicting that the stock market would return around 4% in real terms in 1999, and 7% after costs in 2001.

**Buffett Indicator: Crash Risk Higher Than During Dotcom Bubble and Financial Crisis**
The US economy has continued to grow, with a 3.0% annualized growth rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, the Buffett Indicator, a market indicator preferred by Warren Buffett, shows a warning sign. The indicator, which measures the total value of the US stock market relative to the country's GDP, has reached 198%, higher than before the Dotcom bubble and the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Buffett has warned that buying stocks around the 200% mark is 'playing with fire', as it did before the Dotcom bubble burst. The indicator has surpassed its previous highs, reaching levels seen before the Dotcom bubble and the financial crisis. This suggests that the market may be overvalued and at risk of a crash. Buffett has stated that 'it is a game of skill' to buy stocks when they are undervalued, but 'it is a game of chance' to buy them when they are overvalued. The indicator's current level is a cause for concern, as it has reached levels seen before major market downturns.

**Warren Buffett Is Doing This for the 1st Time in 20 Years. Should Investors Be Worried?**
Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is holding a record amount of cash, nearly $277 billion, as of June 30. This is the highest level ever, with a 65% increase in 2024 and a 30% increase in 2023. Buffett prefers to invest in stocks when they are attractively valued, but believes most stocks are overvalued. He uses the 'Buffett indicator', the ratio of the total U.S. stock market value divided by GDP, to assess valuations. The indicator is near its all-time high, but Buffett is still buying some stocks. The author suggests that investors follow Buffett's lead by building a solid cash position and buying stocks at a reasonable price. They recommend maintaining a long-term perspective, as Buffett's success is due to his long-term mindset.

**Warren Buffett: Berkshire became Wall Street's first non-tec...**
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has become the first non-technology company to exceed $1 trillion in stock value. The company's shares increased by up to 0.8% on Wednesday, pushing its capitalization over the trillion-dollar limit for the first time. According to Steve Chek, founder and chief investment manager of Check Capital Management, 'Berkshire did it in the slowest, but most certain way.' Berkshire's rally this year has surpassed S&P 500 profits, with the company having made one of its best annual starts over a decade. It has won 30% in 2024, while the market benchmark has increased by 18%. The company is not far behind the 'Big 7', an indicator of larger technological shares, which has increased by 35% this year. Berkshire's strength comes as optimism for the economy increases, with the Fed expected to reduce interest rates at the September meeting. Consumer confidence grew to a high of six months in August.

**Buffett's Cash Reserve: A Sign of Market Caution**
Warren Buffett, known as the 'Orakel von Omaha', has shifted his investment strategy from stocks to cash, with Berkshire Hathaway holding a record $277 billion in cash reserves. Despite the strong market performance this year, with the Dow Jones up 15% and the SMI up 10%, Buffett has been selling stocks, including Apple, with over 390 million shares sold in the second quarter worth $50 billion. Buffett's strategy is based on being a value investor, looking for 'great companies at low prices'. He has developed a metric, known as the Buffett Indicator, to determine when stocks are overvalued. According to Buffett, we are currently in a 'phase of greed', where stock prices are too high, and it's time to build cash reserves to take advantage of the next 'phase of fear' when stocks will be undervalued. As David Einhorn wrote, 'The stock sales indicate that it's not the right time for a large stock investment, and the chances will be better in the not-too-distant future.'

**Here's Why Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is a Buy Before Nov. 1 | The Motley Fool**
Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A, BRK.B) third-quarter earnings update, expected in early November, will reveal the company's investment strategy under CEO Warren Buffett. With a cash hoard of $277 billion, Buffett is waiting for the right opportunity to invest. Despite the market being near all-time highs, Buffett is disciplined and will only invest in well-run companies at a good price. Berkshire Hathaway's market cap is nearly $1 trillion, making it a monster of a company that requires a significant acquisition to move the needle. Given the profits being taken to bulk up the cash store, now might be a better time to buy Berkshire Hathaway, as the cash hoard will be put to work when the market crashes. As Buffett said, 'There's really no right or wrong time to hire Warren Buffett to manage your money,' making Berkshire Hathaway a buy before November 1.

**Here's Why Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is a Buy Before Nov. 1**
Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has a huge cash hoard of $277 billion, which is expected to grow as the company takes profits in Apple and Bank of America stock. While this may seem like a negative, it's actually a sign that Buffett is preparing for a big acquisition. With a market cap of nearly $1 trillion, it will take a massive deal to move the needle for the company. Berkshire Hathaway is like a mutual fund, with Buffett buying well-run companies at cheap prices and letting management teams build them over time. As Buffett said, 'There's really no right or wrong time to hire Warren Buffett to manage your money.' Now is a good time to buy Berkshire Hathaway, especially with the profits being taken to bulk up the cash store. The company will report on its balance sheet in early November, which will show investors just how big the acquisition will be. 'Double Down' stock recommendations are being issued for three incredible companies, including Bank of America and Apple, which may not have another chance like this anytime soon.

**Prediction: These 2 Warren Buffett Stocks Will Soar in 2025**
Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, has invested in two stocks that are expected to soar in 2025: NVR and Louisiana-Pacific. NVR, a homebuilder, has a 175,000% return over the last 30 years and operates in 16 states. It has a conservative business model that allows it to manage the boom and bust cycles of the homebuilding industry. With a national housing shortage and a lack of affordable housing, NVR is well-positioned to grow. Louisiana-Pacific, a building materials company, is the world's largest producer of oriented strand board (OSB) and should benefit from new home construction and home improvement projects. The company is already seeing strong demand for its products, with siding sales up 30% and OSB sales up 53% in Q2. Berkshire Hathaway's investment in these stocks suggests that they are undervalued and poised for growth.

**Buffett’s sale of Bank of America raises `warning’**
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold about $10 billion of Bank of America shares, a move described as a likely effort to generate cash before a possible bear market. Private investor Paul Franke has maintained his sell rating on Bank of America, citing 'limited upside potential matched against the substantial risk of loss.' Franke notes that Bank of America shares have declined in six of the last seven recessions and have only seen an annualized advance of +1.7% over the past 16 years. He believes that the stock will likely suffer if the economy sinks into a mild recession, with the potential for a major drop in economic activity and rising inflation. Franke says that Berkshire managers like Buffett are focused on the risk side of the investment equation, and that upside potential is sorely lacking in the stock if earnings are peaking in 2024. 'In my view, upside potential is sorely lacking in the stock if earnings are peaking in 2024,' he said. 'When times are good and have been for a stretch of years, selling banks and financials can seem nonsensical. Yet, Warren Buffett is doing so (having liquidated much of his bank/financial holdings during 2023-24) because the industry is quite cyclical in nature.'

**Warren Buffett Sold 11 Stocks in Q2. But 3 of Them Have Soared Over 30% Since Then.**
Warren Buffett sold 11 stocks in the second quarter of 2024, but three of them have soared over 30% since then. The three stocks are Liberty Live Group Series A, Liberty Live Group Series C, and Louisiana-Pacific. Buffett sold 1.29% of Berkshire's stake in Liberty Live Group Series A, 1.93% of Berkshire's stake in Liberty Live Group Series C, and 9.6% of Berkshire's stake in Louisiana-Pacific. Since the end of Q2, Liberty Live Group Series A shares have risen 32%, Liberty Live Group Series C shares have jumped 34%, and Louisiana-Pacific shares have vaulted 31%. Buffett's decision to sell these stocks may be considered a mistake, especially considering the potential catalysts for Louisiana-Pacific's share price, including interest rate cuts and the outcome of the November elections.

**Should You Follow Warren Buffett and Sell Apple Stock?**
Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have been selling Apple shares in 2024, but not because they think the stock is overvalued. Instead, they're trying to realize gains before the capital gains tax rate increases from 21% to 28%. Buffett stated that Apple will likely remain one of Berkshire's largest positions. However, the author of the article believes that Buffett is also selling Apple stock because it's overvalued, trading at 34.5 times trailing earnings and 30.6 times forward earnings, with only 4.9% revenue growth since the start of 2023. The author suggests that investors should follow Buffett's lead and exit the stock before it trades at a more reasonable price tag, which could be around 24.2 times trailing earnings, a price that would be 30% lower than its current value.

**Understanding the 'Efecto Joseph': A Warning for Investors**
The 'Efecto Joseph' suggests that high-performing market cycles are followed by periods of low performance. Benoit Mandelbrot, a mathematician, found that in many areas, including financial markets, periods of superior performance are often followed by inferior performance, and vice versa. This trend is evident in the US stock market, where the correlation between 10-year returns and future 10-year returns is statistically significant at -30.3%. Warren Buffett advises investors to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. He suggests reducing exposure to stocks when the 10-year market return exceeds the long-term average, and increasing exposure when the 10-year market return falls below the long-term average.

Warren Buffett's preferred market indicator suggests that US stocks are significantly overvalued, increasing the risk of a significant price drop.

Meanwhile, the article also promotes a new report on biotech stocks, claiming that the industry is on the verge of a new era of medical innovation, with potential for huge breakthroughs and returns. The report highlights three biotech stocks with 'gigantic potential' and invites readers to download it for free.

**[Weekly Roundup] The Secret to Beating Buffett**
InvestorPlace's Eric Fry claims that anyone can beat Warren Buffett at investing by using a proprietary system that optimizes profit potential while managing risk. According to Fry, the system, which was developed by a guest who will be joining him for a special video event, has achieved 856% profits over the past 24 years, compared to Buffett's 469% gain. The system involves selling any investment if a proprietary indicator signals a sell, buying back in if Buffett still owns the investment, and rebalancing the portfolio to minimize risk. Fry claims that this system can help investors make more money and take less risk, even than Buffett and other billionaire investors. The guest will share more details about the system at the event, which will be held on September 24 at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

This increase is due to higher short rates and larger cash balances, as Buffett sold almost $100 billion of stocks, mostly Apple, in the first half of 2024. However, with the Federal Reserve's half-point cut in a key short rate, Berkshire's cash investments in short-term Treasury bills are now at risk of losing value. Berkshire held $234 billion of T-Bills at the end of June, which yielded 5.3% in July but now yield 4.7%. If current market rate expectations pan out, yields could drop to 4% by year-end and 3% by the end of 2025, leading to lower interest income at Berkshire in 2025. Buffett has refused to lengthen the maturity of Berkshire's cash investments by investing in longer-term bonds, citing that they don't offer enough yield to compensate for the risk. Other Berkshire businesses, such as its housing-related business and electric utility, may benefit from lower rates, offering some offset against the impact on its cash investments.

**Warren Buffett Has Nearly 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's Investable Portfolio in 1 Incredibly Safe Bet**
Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, has been rapidly amassing a position in short-term Treasury bills, which is approaching 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's total investment portfolio. According to Berkshire's latest quarterly report, Buffett prefers short-term Treasury bills with maturities of six months or less, citing the importance of maintaining liquidity and safety over yield. As of the end of the second quarter, Berkshire held $277 billion in Treasury bills and cash, and has added $94 billion to its Treasury holdings in the first six months of 2024. Buffett has been selling stocks, including Apple and Bank of America, and using the proceeds to invest in Treasury bills. He has stated that he prefers to hold short-term Treasury bills regardless of yield, but may find alternatives more attractive as interest rates come down. The Motley Fool analyst team has identified 10 stocks that they believe could produce monster returns in the coming years, and Berkshire Hathaway was not one of them.

**Warren Buffett Is Doing This for the 1st Time in 20 Years. Should Investors Be Worried? | The Motley Fool**
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a record $277 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, the highest level ever. This is a 65% increase from the beginning of 2024 and a 30% increase from 2023. Buffett is holding on to so much cash because he believes most stocks are overvalued. His favorite valuation metric, the Buffett indicator, is near its all-time high. However, Buffett is still buying some stocks in the current environment. Investors should follow Buffett's lead by building a solid cash position and buying stocks at a reasonable price. Maintaining a long-term perspective is key to success, as Buffett's success is due in large part to his mindset.

**Warren Buffett Is Doing This for the 1st Time in 20 Years. Should Investors Be Worried?**
Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is holding a record amount of cash, nearly $277 billion, as of June 30. This is the highest level ever, with a 65% increase in 2024 and a 30% increase in 2023. Buffett prefers to invest in stocks when they are attractively valued, but believes most stocks are overvalued. He uses the 'Buffett indicator', the ratio of the total U.S. stock market value divided by GDP, to assess valuations. The indicator is near its all-time high, but Buffett is still buying some stocks. The author suggests that investors follow Buffett's lead by building a solid cash position and buying stocks at a reasonable price. They recommend maintaining a long-term perspective, as Buffett's success is due to his long-term mindset.

**Warren Buffett once said waiting for a market crash to buy stocks is like a mortician waiting for an epidemic — here's why**
Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, once said that waiting for a market crash to buy stocks is like a mortician waiting for an epidemic. He believes that anticipating a company's missteps or a market crash without solid evidence of poor performance may leave you waiting forever. Buffett thinks that it's better to own great businesses, even if they're not at a low price, rather than waiting for a market crash. He also notes that finding a good business at the right time is 'too much to count on.' Recent data suggests that a consistent strategy over extended periods is better than trying to time the market. According to WisdomTree, the S&P 500 delivered a 24.2% gain in 2023, beating all 16 forecasts. A 2023 Wealthfront analysis revealed that the probability of losing money was 0% if an investor stayed invested for 20 years. Buffett's sentiments were previously echoed by Peter Lynch, who said that 'far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in all the corrections combined.'

**Warren Buffett Dumps Housing Stocks: It's Time To Rethink Your Portfolio, Too**
Warren Buffett, known as the 'Oracle of Omaha,' has sold his investment in D.R. Horton, the largest homebuilder in the U.S., after less than 6 months. Buffett purchased nearly 6 million shares in August 2023, worth over $700 million, but sold them by the end of the year. This is a surprisingly short duration for Buffett, who typically buys stocks he likes and holds them for the long term. Despite D.R. Horton's strong performance in 2023, delivering a 70.5% return on the year, Buffett may have thought that there would be a correction in the stock price. Berkshire Hathaway still holds positions in other homebuilders, Lennar and NVR, Inc., which have risen in 2024. Fannie Mae expects more home sales transactions in 2024 than in 2023, and the price of homes is expected to moderate. This could impact sales of both new and existing homes positively. However, a rapid decline in mortgage rates could drive prices up again. Buffett's uncharacteristically speedy exit from a single homebuilder stock doesn't indicate a complete rejection of the category, and homebuilder stocks may still have a place in your portfolio.

**Banking Stocks Slide: Where to Invest Instead**
The banking sector is experiencing a decline, with Warren Buffett selling his Bank of America position and Goldman Sachs' CEO David Solomon predicting a 10% decline in the bank's trading department. This uncertainty has led to a rise in short interest in J.P. Morgan Chase and underperformance of the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund. However, analysts at Goldman Sachs and Jefferies Financial Group have initiated coverage on Waste Management with a Strong Buy rating and price target of up to $256 a share, citing its safe business model. Institutional buyers, including Ameriprise Financial, have increased their holdings in Waste Management, while bears have withdrawn. Another safe opportunity is Alphabet, which has recently settled a lawsuit and is trading at 78% of its 52-week high. Wedbush reiterated its 'Outperform' rating and price target of $205 a share for Google stock, expecting a 37.5% recovery rally.

**Warren Buffett Is Selling; Time To Panic? (NDX)**
Warren Buffett's recent sales of shares, including $3.1 billion worth of Bank of America, have led some investors to wonder if he is no longer bullish. However, it's essential to consider that Buffett is a long-term-minded investor who focuses on accumulating quality companies and investing for the long term. While the 'Buffett Indicator', which measures equity valuations against US GDP, is approaching 200%, indicating that equities could be overvalued, other factors such as monetary expansion, mega-cap dominance, and investor preference for US equities suggest that valuations could be justified. The US economy is still strong, and employment isn't rolling over yet, despite recent data showing a slowdown. Analysts, including the author, advise investors to take a page from Buffett's book and remain long on equities, but also have some cash ready to deploy in case of a downturn. External factors, such as the Yen carry trade and China's economic slump, could worsen the situation, but overall, the author believes that investors should not panic. 'Truth is, we can't know for sure why Buffett is selling, and we also don't know what he is doing in real time,' the author notes. 'Nonetheless, it is quite telling that the 'Buffett Indicator'... signals equities could be overvalued.'

**Warren Buffett has a record-high cash pile of $277bn. Should I stop investing?**
Warren Buffett's record-high cash pile of $277bn may indicate that the US stock market is overvalued and due for a correction. However, the investor's cash position could also be a sign of flexibility and readiness for the new CEO-in-waiting, Greg Abel. The author believes that there are always undervalued companies worth investing in, but the S&P 500's valuation is potentially problematic. Nvidia has accounted for over a third of the S&P 500's gains in 2024, and AI growth is expected to slow down. The author recommends looking at companies with diversified international revenue, such as Dr Reddy's Laboratories, which has 17.5% of its revenue from India and a decent valuation. However, investing in diverse markets comes with risks, especially in pharmaceuticals.

**Warren Buffett's Favorite Stock: American Express**
Warren Buffett's favorite stock is American Express, which now represents 12.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, valued at over $39 billion. Buffett has increased his stake in American Express, while reducing his exposure to Apple and Bank of America. American Express has seen a 62% increase in its stock price over the past 52 weeks and a 38.6% increase in 2024. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 17%, to $0.70 per share, and has a 35-year history of paying consistent dividends. Buffett's other notable holdings include Apple, Coca-Cola, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, and Kraft Heinz. Meanwhile, Walmart, which is seen as a barometer of consumer sentiment, has reached new highs, with its stock price increasing by nearly 45% this year. The company is expected to report its earnings on November 19 and has raised its sales forecast for the year.

Investors in NOV (NYSE:NOV) have seen a 42% return over the past three years, outperforming the market return of 13%. The company's fundamentals, including its profitability and earnings per share (EPS), have improved over the years. However, the share price has dropped 17% in the past year, and the company has faced a total loss of 3% per year over five years. Despite this, the total shareholder return (TSR) of 42% for the last 3 years is a positive sign, largely due to dividend payments. Nevertheless, investors should be aware of the 2 warning signs for NOV, including one concerning issue.

**Buffett's empire tops $1T mark**
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., led by Warren Buffett, has surpassed $1 trillion in market value, becoming the first U.S. company outside of the tech sector to achieve this milestone. The company's stock has risen 0.9% to reach this mark, driven by strong insurance results and economic optimism. Berkshire's rally this year has outpaced the S&P 500's gains, with the company gaining 30% in 2024, compared to the market benchmark's 17% increase. According to Steve Check, founder and chief investment officer of Check Capital Management, Berkshire has achieved this milestone through a 'slower, but more sure, way.' Check noted that the company's move to reduce its Apple Inc. stake was 'prudent,' as it has 'taken a lot of that risk off the table.' Berkshire's strength comes as optimism for the economy builds, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates at its September meeting.

**Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Exceeds $1 Trillion Market Value**
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has become the first US company to exceed a market value of $1 trillion, excluding the technology sector. The company's shares exceeded the $1 trillion market value threshold for the first time this week. Berkshire Hathaway's shares have risen this year due to strong financial results and economic optimism. The company, based in Nebraska, has joined the exclusive club of companies valued at over $1 trillion, dominated by tech giants such as Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook, Instagram), and Nvidia. Berkshire Hathaway is the sixth American company to reach this milestone, and the ninth globally. The company's strength has emerged in recent times, particularly with the anticipation of the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate cut in September and the growing economic optimism. Berkshire's market value has grown by approximately 20% per year since 1965, until last year. The company's cash stock has reached a record high of $276.9 billion this month. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter operating profit has increased to $11.6 billion, up from $10 billion in the same period last year.

Berkshire's stock has increased by over 28% so far in 2024, outperforming the 18% gain of the S&P 500 index. Buffett, the chairman and CEO, has transformed the company from a small textile firm to a global conglomerate with a diverse range of sectors, including insurance, railroads, retail, manufacturing, and energy. As he turns 94 on Friday, Buffett has led the Omaha-based company since 1965.

The financial holding company has surpassed the milestone on Wall Street, with a 27% increase in value in 2024. This achievement comes as a birthday gift for the 'Oracle of Omaha', as Buffett is known, who will celebrate his 95th birthday in two days.

**Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Surpasses $1 Billion Market Capitalization**
Warren Buffett's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, has surpassed a market capitalization of $1 billion for the first time, making it the eighth member of a club of companies that have achieved this milestone, excluding technology giants. The company's class A shares, which have risen by around 27% so far this year, increased by over 1.2% on Wednesday to reach a record intraday high of $699,532.50, exceeding the $1 billion market capitalization threshold. The impetus for surpassing this mark came from the announcement of the transfer of around $1 billion in Bank of America shares. This marks a new stage in the unstoppable rise of this corporation, which originated from a small textile company that Buffett took control of in 1965, when it was struggling due to the outsourcing of the industry. Over the years, he built a giant through the acquisition of other companies, including Geico, Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), Fruit of the Loom, and Duracell. Berkshire Hathaway is also a major investor, holding 21% of American Express, 13% of Bank of America, and 9% of Coca-Cola. The group has recently accumulated significant liquidity reserves, reaching $277 billion by the end of June. Inspired by his partner Charlie Munger, another Wall Street legend who accompanied him since 1978 until his death in November 2023, Buffett adopted a rational and unemotional approach to business, based on a long-term strategy, contrary to many investors. The investment philosophy of these two market veterans has become a model, with Buffett being considered one of the gurus of modern capitalism and nicknamed the 'Oracle of Omaha', the city in Nebraska where he was born and lives. Each year, thousands of people travel to the location to attend the group's annual meeting and listen to Buffett's reflections during the general assembly of Berkshire Hathaway. Between 1965 and 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's stock gained an average of 19.8% per year and almost 4400% over the entire period. However, at the beginning of the year, Buffett warned investors in his annual letter that it is likely that the most spectacular returns are a thing of the past. 'Berkshire should do a little better than the average of US companies and, more importantly, should operate with a materially lower risk of permanent loss of capital,' he wrote. 'Anything more than 'slightly better', however, is an illusion (...) We have no chance of a spectacular return,' he added. Buffett, who will turn 94 on Friday, has an estimated fortune of $146.5 billion and still controls around 15% of the company, despite having donated millions of dollars in Berkshire Hathaway shares to charitable organizations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He remains the CEO of the company. In 2021, he appointed a successor, Greg Abel, 62 years old, current vice president of the group.

**European Stock Markets See Gains, Nvidia and Super Micro in Focus**
The European stock markets have seen a second day of gains, with the Milan stock exchange closing at +0.28%, in line with the Eurostoxx index of the 50 largest companies in the eurozone. Frankfurt has performed better (+0.48%), while London has underperformed (+0.02%). In Milan, the increase has been enough to bring the balance of the month of August back to parity, which had started with a series of net declines following disappointing US employment data. Today, investors are waiting for other data, including Nvidia's quarterly results, which will be released in the evening. Nvidia, a leading producer of microprocessors, is considered an important indicator of the artificial intelligence market. The company's stock has risen by less than 170% in three years, and by 447% since the beginning of the year. Investors will be looking not only at the quarterly results, but also at the company's prospects for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, at Wall Street, the technology sector is being led by the -26% decline of Super Micro Computer, which has announced that it will delay the presentation of its annual report for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. This announcement comes a day after the short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused the company of 'accounting manipulation'. Hindenburg Research has also revealed that it has taken a short position in Super Micro. Today, Berkshire Hathaway is in the spotlight, as the holding company led by Warren Buffett has reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, becoming the first non-technology American company to surpass this threshold. Berkshire Hathaway's shares have risen by over 27% in 2024, almost double the S&P 500. The $1 trillion threshold was reached two days before Buffett's 94th birthday.

**Berkshire Hathaway Surpasses $1 Trillion Market Value**
Berkshire Hathaway has become the first non-tech company in the US to surpass a market value of $1 trillion. The conglomerate's shares rose 0.8% in the morning, pushing the company's market value above $1 trillion for the first time. The shares have risen throughout the year due to solid insurance sector results and economic optimism. Warren Buffett's company joins a small group of 'trillion-dollar' companies, including Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia. 'Berkshire did it in a more gradual, but more secure way,' explained Steve Check, founder and chief investment officer of Check Capital Management. 'It's harder to make money the old way,' he added. The company's valuation has exceeded the S&P 500's gains this year, with Berkshire having one of the best starts to the year in the last decade. It has risen 30% in 2024, while the market index has risen 18%. The company is not far from the so-called 'Seven Magnificents', a indicator of the largest tech stocks, which have risen 35% this year. The company's strength comes amidst growing optimism for the economy, with expectations that the Federal Reserve will finally cut interest rates in its September meeting. In August, consumer confidence rose to its highest level in six months. Berkshire's businesses range from gas station operator Pilot Travel Centers to ice cream chain Dairy Queen and battery brand Duracell. Decades of above-average gains Warren Buffett has spent most of his life transforming Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile manufacturer into a vast business empire. He shaped the company alongside long-time business partner Charlie Munger, who passed away in November at the age of 99. The company's market value has grown around 20% per year from 1965 to last year - almost double the annual return of the S&P 500 in that period. This has made Buffett one of the richest people in the world and perhaps the most prolific investor of all time. The stock has added over $200 billion in market capitalization this year alone - a record for the company, but relatively low considering the increase of almost $2 trillion in Nvidia. The valuation of Berkshire has pushed it into the territory of overvaluation, based on the relative strength index, and has caused some reservations among analysts. The future of Berkshire Hathaway The fundamental perspective for Berkshire's core businesses is not necessarily much brighter ahead, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Palazola, but the company has a 'portfolio for all times.' Lower interest rates may impact the returns on the record cash pile that Berkshire accumulated while reducing its stake in Apple by half and decreasing its stake in Bank of America. In the case of Bank of America, sales continued in August, according to a report released by the company on the night of this Tuesday (27). Buffett's cash pile passed $270 billion in the second-quarter results, reported in early August. The absolute size of the stake in Apple had become a concern, said Check, and the move to reduce that exposure was prudent. 'This took a lot of that risk off the table,' said the analyst.

Berkshire's rally this year has surpassed S&P 500 profits, with the company having made one of its best annual starts over a decade. It has won 30% in 2024, while the market benchmark has increased by 18%. The company is not far behind the 'Big 7', an indicator of larger technological shares, which has increased by 35% this year. Berkshire's strength comes as optimism for the economy increases, with the Fed expected to reduce interest rates at the September meeting. Consumer confidence grew to a high of six months in August.

**Should You Follow Buffett's Lead And Increase Your Cash Position?**
Berkshire Hathaway's cash position of $379 billion is the highest in history, sparking speculation that Warren Buffett believes stock prices are overvalued. Buffett's motto 'Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful' suggests he is waiting for the market to decline so he can buy at lower prices. However, market timing is not always predictable, and short-term swings are often random. The author of the article agrees with Buffett's assessment, citing the Master Sentiment Indicator, which shows extreme levels of bullish sentiment. The author recommends a 35% cash position, based on the indicator's reading. While only time will tell if these high cash positions are right, the author believes that history will prove Buffett's position correct.
