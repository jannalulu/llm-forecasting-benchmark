To provide a forecast on the likelihood of Ukrainian forces capturing Korenevo before October 1, 2024, we need to consider several factors.

1. **Current Military Situation**: As of the forecast date, we should review recent progress made by Ukrainian forces, particularly in sectors where Korenevo is located, and overall strategic objectives from credible sources or maps detailing front-line changes.

2. **Strategic Importance**: Understanding the strategic importance of Korenevo, such as whether it is a key target, can influence if significant resources will be allocated to advancing there.

3. **Timeline and Recent Developments**: Since there is about a month until the resolution date, unless there have been recent indications of Ukrainian advances towards Korenevo, the probability might be lower. Any reports of troop movements, battles nearby, or official statements would affect this likelihood.

4. **Source of Information**: The question's resolution hinges on the information from the ISW's map, which means it’s essential to check for their recent updates that could signal Ukrainian control or advances.

After weighing these considerations, assess the consolidation of Ukrainian control near Korenevo through ISW's map and reported military actions in credible news institutions within the last three months.

Based on these factors, we provide the following prediction:

My Prediction: 30.00% is the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.
