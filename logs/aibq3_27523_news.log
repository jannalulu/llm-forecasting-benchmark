**Hamas Appoints Terrorist Leader as Chairman of 'Political Bureau'**
Hamas has appointed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 7 October 2023 attacks on thousands of Israelis, as the chairman of its 'political bureau'. This move shows that Hamas' political and military branches are the same, and that there is no difference between a political and military leader in an Islamist terrorist organization. Sinwar's appointment has sparked concerns that Western media will again label him as 'moderate' and 'pragmatic', despite his history of violence and terrorism. Hamas' leaders, including Sinwar, have repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews, and have been involved in numerous terrorist attacks. The article questions whether Western governments will continue to engage with Hamas and its leaders, despite their extremist views and violent actions. 'What is a 'very moderate leader' of an Islamist jihadist death cult that carried out the deadliest terrorist attack since 9/11?' asked Elon Levy, a former Israeli government spokesperson. 'For the BBC, Ismail Haniyeh was 'moderate and pragmatic'; for the rest of us, he was a monster,' said Stephen Pollard, a British author and journalist. 'Haniyeh was indeed 'moderate'. The total number of Jews murdered by Hamas is not even close to six million. Not that Haniyeh would have seen that as anything other than disappointing, given that he led an organization determined to wipe every Jew off the face of the earth.'

**Qatari Journalists Celebrate Yahya Sinwar's Appointment As Hamas' New Political Bureau Chairman, Calling Him 'The Hero Of October 7,' 'The Saladin Of Our Century' And 'Israel's Nightmare'**
Qatari journalists celebrated the appointment of Yahya Sinwar as the new chairman of Hamas' political bureau, calling him 'the hero of October 7,' 'the Saladin of our century,' and 'Israel's nightmare.' They praised Hamas for making the 'correct' decision and mocked Israel for killing the more accommodating Haniya and getting the hardliner Sinwar instead. Journalists and Al-Jazeera hosts shared posts on X, congratulating Sinwar and wishing him success, with some even sharing images of Sinwar drawing a gun and writing that he is a 'leader in the spirit of the Prophet's companions.' They expressed pride in Sinwar and called him an 'honorable model' of leadership that the Islamic nation sorely needs. Some even wrote that Sinwar's appointment is a 'blow to Israel' and that Netanyahu will face 'death' with Sinwar as the head of Hamas' political bureau.

**Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar's Rise to Power Amid Escalating Tensions**
Following the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, tensions have escalated in the Middle East. Hamas has announced the selection of Yahya Sinwar as the new Political Bureau Chairman. According to a statement on Hamas's Telegram account, 'Hamas announces the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as the new Political Bureau Chairman in place of the martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh.' Sinwar is known for his aggressive stance and is believed to be behind the 7 October attacks. Despite Israel offering a $400,000 reward for his capture, Sinwar has not been killed. Sinwar, the founder of Hamas's Security Organization, has been arrested three times but was released due to Hamas- Israel negotiations. He has since risen through the ranks of Hamas and has been the political leader in Gaza since 2017. The US added him to the list of international terrorists in 2015. Haniyeh was in Tehran for the inauguration of the new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi when he was assassinated. Iran and Hamas blamed Israel for the attack, while Israeli officials remained silent. Hamas described the event as 'a significant and dangerous development that will take the war to new dimensions across the region.'

Following the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyye in Tehran, the new leader of Hamas has been announced. According to a statement by Hamas, 'Yahya Sinwar, our leader in Gaza, has been elected as the new Political Bureau Chairman.'

He was arrested three times but was released due to Hamas- Israel negotiations. Sinwar has been the political leader of the Gaza Strip since 2017, taking over the position from Haniye. 'It is a testament to the dedication and resilience of our people,' said Sinwar, 'that we have overcome this difficult time and emerged stronger than ever.'

**Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar Opposes Khaled Meshaal's Transition to Political Bureau Chairman**
According to Saudi Arabian media, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is opposing the transition of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman position to Khaled Meshaal. The position has been vacant since the assassination of Ismail Haniya, the previous chairman. Al Hadath, a Saudi Arabian television channel, reported that Sinwar prefers someone with stronger ties to Iran over Meshaal, who is considered a favorite for the position. It was also mentioned that Hamas leaders met in Qatar yesterday and Sinwar conveyed his preference. Meshaal and Halil el-Hayya are being considered as the top candidates to replace Haniya, with el-Hayya being a strong figure within Hamas. The final decision will be made by the Shura Council, a consultative body consisting of political, religious, and other figures.

**Hamas' New Leader Yahya Sinwar: An Obstacle to a Deal for Hostages and Ceasefire**
Yahya Sinwar, the new head of the Hamas political bureau, is 'the only obstacle' to a deal to release hostages and a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli Prime Minister's office. They claim that Sinwar 'refuses to send a delegation to negotiations' on the Gaza deal scheduled for August 15. The office stated, 'Israel has only one choice - to achieve a complete victory, which means the elimination of Hamas' military and administrative potential, as well as the release of the hostages.' They added that Israel will 'certainly' achieve this victory. Egyptian and Qatari mediators had previously informed the Israeli side that Sinwar wants a ceasefire agreement. Sinwar was elected as the new head of Hamas' political bureau on August 6, succeeding Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last week. Analysts believe that this appointment confirms Hamas' radical course, which the movement has pursued since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Sinwar is considered one of the organizers of this attack.

**Hamas Appoints Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has announced the appointment of Yahya Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau, following the death of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Sinwar, a prominent military leader in Hamas, has spent 22 years in Israeli prisons and is known for his sharpness and deep understanding of Israeli psychology. Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for Hamas's military wing, announced the appointment, stating that 'Hamas's military wing is fully prepared to implement Sinwar's decisions.' Sinwar, who was born in 1962, has not been publicly visible since October 7, 2023, and is believed to be hiding in a tunnel with Israeli prisoners. He is considered one of the most knowledgeable leaders in Hamas about Israeli psychology and thinking. Sinwar has been elected twice as the head of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and has been a key figure in the movement's military operations, including the 'Sword of Jerusalem' operation in 2021. The appointment of Sinwar was made after consultations and discussions with Hamas's leadership, and is seen as a sign of the movement's strength and unity. Hamas has expressed its confidence in Sinwar, saying that it 'asks God to guide and direct him, and to write the victory for our people and our cause.'

**Hamas Aligns with Iran: Yahya Sinwar Takes the Helm**
The Hamas movement has appointed Yahya Sinwar, a 62-year-old leader from Gaza, as its new chief of the political bureau. This move marks the first time a leader from Gaza has held this position, marginalizing the external leadership. Sinwar, known for his role in planning the bloody attacks on Israel on October 7, has been tasked with remodelling the organization in his image, aligning it with Iran and pursuing a messianic armed struggle against Israel. According to Sinwar, the Hamas will continue to fight until Israel accepts its conditions, 'even if it costs thousands of lives.'

**Hamas's Appointment of Yahya Sinwar: A Shift Towards Military Resolution**
The appointment of Yahya Sinwar as the new head of Hamas's political bureau indicates that the resolution of the conflict will be achieved on the battlefield, not through diplomacy, according to an article by Israeli newspaper Haaretz. The article, written by analyst Jackie Khoury, states that Sinwar's appointment is a significant change in Hamas's leadership, as he is a more militant figure who has been hiding in secret and has not been seen publicly since October 7. Sinwar's appointment does not change the fact that the final decision on any agreement will still be made by Gaza, not the external leadership of Hamas. The article concludes that Sinwar's appointment is a sign that Hamas is committed to continuing the conflict and will not be swayed by external pressure to end the war.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) intend to eliminate the new head of the Hamas political bureau, Yahya Sinwar.

**Hamas' New Leader: A Challenge to Israel**
The nomination of Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of the Hamas' political bureau is seen as a challenge to Israel. Sinwar, considered the main instigator of the October 7 attack, has been on the run for 10 months, evading the Israeli army in the tunnels of Gaza. According to Leïla Seurat, a specialist on Hamas, the choice of Sinwar was imposed due to Israel's brutal war and the rejection of negotiations. Seurat, a researcher at the Arab Centre for Research and Policy Studies in Paris and author of 'Hamas and the World', says that the message from Hamas to Israel is that the organization is 'ready for confrontation'. It is unclear whether Sinwar's appointment was a consensual decision or if he imposed himself, but it was necessary to replace Haniyeh quickly, avoiding the internal elections scheduled for spring 2025.

Katz said, 'The appointment of Yahya Sinwar, the main terrorist, as the new leader of Hamas, is another reason to eliminate him and eradicate this despicable organization.' The Israeli state television KAN reported that Sinwar's appointment was a 'surprise' and sent a message to Israel that Hamas leadership is still strong, as Sinwar, who is considered the main responsible for the 7 October Aksa Tufan operation, is still alive. KAN's Arab Affairs and Middle East Correspondent Roi Kais said that Sinwar's appointment was a 'surprise' and that it sent a message to Israel that Hamas leadership is still strong and in control. Ehud Yaari, a Middle East analyst for Channel 12, said that Sinwar's appointment was a 'practical move' to confirm his position within Hamas. Sinwar was previously the Political Bureau Chairman of Hamas in Gaza.

**Hamas Appoints Yahya Sinwar as New Leader, Sending Message of Armed Resistance**
Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Hamas' large-scale attack on Israel in October 2023, has been appointed as the new leader of Hamas. This appointment sends a message that Hamas is strategically behind the approach of armed resistance. The US and Israel are concerned that this appointment will make it harder to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict. Sinwar is believed to be hiding in one of the Hamas' tunnels under the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Israel. He is expected to resist any pressure to agree to a ceasefire or a prisoner exchange. A regional diplomat stated that Israel will have to deal with Sinwar in order to find a solution to the Gaza conflict. The Hamas has announced that Sinwar will lead the political bureau of the movement, replacing the late Ismail Haniyya. 'The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas announces the election of Commander Yahya Sinwar as the leader of the political bureau of the movement. May Allah have mercy on the martyr Commander Ismail Haniyya,' said a statement from the Hamas. Jehad Harb, a political analyst at the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, stated that Sinwar's appointment means that Hamas is strategically behind the approach of armed resistance, and that it is distancing itself from its role as a political entity that wants to govern. Sinwar is also believed to support a close coordination with the Iranian government, which supports Hamas. Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, stated that the movement will continue to hold on to its agreement and that the team that led the negotiations under Haniyya will continue under Sinwar. However, Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, stated that Sinwar's appointment is a direct challenge to Israel and sends the message that Hamas will remain committed to its 'resistant approach.'

**Who is new Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar? October 7 attack mastermind and key architect of group's military strength**
Hamas has appointed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7 attacks on Israel, as its new head of political bureau. Sinwar, known for his secretive nature and strong ties with Iran, has played a key role in strengthening Hamas' military capabilities. His appointment is a clear indication that Hamas intends to continue its resistance despite the ongoing destruction from Israel's campaign in Gaza. Israel has placed Sinwar at the top of its kill list and has threatened to resume military actions if Hamas does not comply with a proposed cease-fire. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations, blaming Israel and the US for the failure to seal a deal. Sinwar's selection is seen as a sign that Hamas' will has not been broken, and the group remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics. 'The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field,' Hamdan said. Mediators have faced challenges in advancing a US-backed proposal for a deal, which is centred on exchanging all of Hamas' remaining hostages for an end to the conflict and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.

**Hamas Appoints Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
Hamas has appointed Yahya Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau, replacing Ismail Haniyeh who was assassinated. This move is seen as a strong message to Israel that the leadership of Hamas is still strong and united. Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 'Great March of Return' attack, faces challenges in communicating with the rest of the leadership. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called for Sinwar's swift elimination, considering the appointment a reason to do so. Hamas has received support from Hezbollah, with the party stating that the appointment is a strong message to the Israeli enemy. The leadership of Hamas has emphasized its unity and determination to resist Israeli provocation. Sinwar was previously elected as the head of Hamas in Gaza in 2017 and re-elected in 2021. He has been a target for Israeli assassination attempts since the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023.

**Hamas names Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar as new political bureau chief**
Hamas has announced that Yahya Sinwar, its Gaza leader since 2017, will be its new political leader, replacing the assassinated Ismail Haniyeh. Sinwar, 61, has been accused of orchestrating the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which led to the Israeli attack on Gaza, resulting in nearly 40,000 deaths. He was previously arrested and tried by Israel for abducting and killing two Israeli soldiers and four alleged Palestinian collaborators in 1989, and served 22 years in prison before being released in a 2011 prisoner exchange. Iran has blamed the assassination of Haniyeh on Israel and vowed a harsh response.

**Who is Yahya Sinwar, the new head of Hamas's political bureau?**
Yahya Sinwar, the new head of Hamas's political bureau, was announced on Tuesday following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Sinwar, born on October 29, 1962, in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, has a history of militant activities and ideological commitments. He co-founded Majd, Hamas's security apparatus, and was sentenced to four life terms for orchestrating the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. Sinwar was released in 2011 in a prisoner exchange deal and became known for his leadership among inmates. He was elected as the leader of Hamas in Gaza in 2017, emphasizing military build-up and closer ties with regional powers like Iran and Hezbollah. Sinwar is widely regarded as the mastermind behind the October 7, 2023, massacre against Israel, which resulted in over 1,200 deaths and the abduction of around 240 hostages. He has a hardline approach, prioritizing military resistance over political negotiations, and has strengthened Hamas's regional alliances with Iran and Hezbollah. As the new head of Hamas's political bureau, Sinwar faces the dual challenge of maintaining internal cohesion within the organization and addressing intensified Israeli military operations targeting Hamas leadership.

**Hamas Appoints Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
Hamas has appointed Yahya Sinwar, its leader in Gaza and one of the organizers of the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, as the new head of its political bureau after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh last week, according to CNN. The group announced in a statement on Tuesday that 'the commander Yahya Sinwar was elected as the head of the movement's political bureau.' Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the organizer of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, making him a key target in the war in the Gaza Strip. American officials believe that Sinwar is still at large in a massive network of tunnels under Gaza, often moving and possibly surrounded by hostages as a human shield. The appointment of Sinwar comes after the reported assassination of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran last week, which has raised concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas and its allies may escalate into a full-scale war in the Middle East.

**Hamas announces Yahya Sinwar as new Chief of Political Bureau**
Hamas has announced Yahya Sinwar as its new Chief of Political Bureau, replacing Ismail Haniyeh who was killed in a strike in Tehran last month. According to a statement from the group, Sinwar's selection is a 'strong message to the occupation that Hamas continues its path of resistance.' A senior Hamas official stated, 'The assassination of Haniyeh, who believed in reaching a ceasefire agreement and a prisoner exchange deal, leads Hamas to choose a leader who manages the battle and resistance against the enemy.' Israel has accused Sinwar of being one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack last year and has called for his 'swift elimination.' Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz stated, 'The appointment of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of Hamas, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, is yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organisation off the face of the Earth.'

**Hamas Appoints Yahya al-Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
A large procession was organized in the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Bass in Lebanon to welcome the selection of Hamas leader Yahya al-Sinwar as the new head of the movement's political bureau. The participants in the procession carried Palestinian flags and pictures of al-Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, the late leader of Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran last week. The protesters chanted slogans such as 'Yahya, look at us, we're with you, we'll show you our power' and 'Hamas, hear the voice of all people, this is your path.' They also sang national revolutionary songs. This comes after Hamas announced the appointment of al-Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau, following the assassination of Haniyeh last week in Tehran. Some Israeli analysts have seen this move as a choice of the 'most dangerous person to lead the movement,' as Israel considers al-Sinwar to be the mastermind behind the 'October Storm' attack in 7 October, and he is at the top of the list of targets. The selection of al-Sinwar comes after less than a week since the assassination of Haniyeh (62 years old) in his room in the hospitality palace in the Iranian capital Tehran, after attending the inauguration ceremony of the new Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi. Haniyeh was the representative of Hamas in the negotiations for the exchange of prisoners and the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, and he played a major role in the Palestinian reconciliation process. Lebanon, Iran, and Hamas have accused Israel and the United States of being responsible for the assassination, and have stated that the attack will not go unpunished. Israel has remained silent on these accusations, without denying or confirming them. It is worth noting that Israel had threatened to kill Haniyeh and other leaders of Hamas for launching the 'October Storm' attack last October.

**Hamas Chooses Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas announced on Tuesday that it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the group in the Gaza Strip, as the new head of the political bureau, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed last week in a suspected Israeli attack in Tehran. Sinwar, who is believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels, represents the group's most hardline and belligerent faction and is considered the mastermind behind the October 7, 2023 attacks. 'Hamas expresses its confidence in the brother 'Abu Ibrahim' (Sinwar's nom de guerre) as its leader during this sensitive phase and in the face of complex local, regional, and international circumstances. May God Almighty guide him and grant our people and our cause a clear and decisive victory,' the group said in a statement. The group explained that the selection of Sinwar was the result of 'extensive and exhaustive deliberations within the leadership institutions of the movement,' after announcing on Saturday that they had initiated 'urgent consultations' between the political bureau and the Shura Council, a secret advisory body mainly composed of religious figures. The election of Sinwar, who has been the leader of Hamas in Gaza in both political and military capacities, confirms the group's strategic shift, where the military wing has absorbed the political wing, and has put the peace negotiations at risk, with Sinwar defending the hardest line, in contrast to Haniyeh's more pragmatic stance. It was the military wing, led by Sinwar and the recently deceased Mohamed Deif, commander-in-chief of the Qasam Brigades, the armed branch of Hamas, that planned the October 7 attack, and the political wing, including Haniyeh, only learned about the plan when it was already advanced. Since years, the head of the political bureau has resided outside the Gaza Strip, and Haniyeh did so in Qatar, although it is unclear whether Sinwar will move outside Gaza, where his brother Mohamed Sinwar is considered the main candidate to assume the position of Deif as the top military leader.

Sinwar was born in the refugee camp in Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip and in the 80s led the internal security service of the movement, which monitored and eliminated individuals suspected of collaborating with the Israeli state.

He has been accused by Israel of being the mastermind behind the 2023 Gaza war, which resulted in over 1,200 deaths. Al-Sinwar has since become a key figure in Hamas, taking on security roles within the movement.

**Yahya Sinwar Elected as New Hamas Political Bureau Chairman**
Following the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyye in Tehran, the new leader of Hamas has been announced. According to a statement by Hamas, 'Yahya Sinwar, our leader in Gaza, has been elected as the new Political Bureau Chairman.' Sinwar, the founder of the 'Mecd' Hamas security service, which is responsible for internal security, investigating suspected Israeli agents, and tracking Israeli intelligence officers, has been a hardline figure. He was arrested three times but was released due to Hamas- Israel negotiations. Sinwar has been the political leader of the Gaza Strip since 2017, taking over the position from Haniye. 'It is a testament to the dedication and resilience of our people,' said Sinwar, 'that we have overcome this difficult time and emerged stronger than ever.'

**Hamas Announces Selection of Yahya Sinwar as New Head of Political Bureau**
Hamas announced the selection of Yahya Sinwar as the new head of the movement's political bureau, succeeding the late Ismail Haniyeh. Sinwar, born in 1962, has been arrested by Israel multiple times and sentenced to 4 life sentences before being released in a prisoner exchange deal in 2011. He later returned to his activities in the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, and was elected as the head of the movement in the Gaza Strip in 2017 and again in 2021. Israel considers Sinwar to be the mastermind behind the 'Toufan Al-Aqsa' operation on October 7, 2023, which resulted in significant human and military losses and embarrassed the Israeli intelligence and security agencies. As a result, Israel has made the elimination of Sinwar one of the main objectives of its current war on Gaza.

**Yahya al-Sinwar Appointed as New Head of Hamas's Political Bureau**
Hamas has announced the appointment of Yahya al-Sinwar as the new head of the movement's political bureau, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh last week in Tehran. Al-Sinwar, the fourth president of the political bureau, will succeed Haniyeh, who held the position since 2017. He is preceded by Khaled Mashal, who held the position for the longest period, from 1996 to 2017. The first president of the political bureau was Musa Abu Marzouq, who held the position from 1992 to 1995. Al-Sinwar's name emerged during Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 people. Israeli forces have been searching for him in Gaza, describing him as 'the face of evil.' However, he has not been seen in public since the attack. The Hamas movement has begun a wide-ranging consultation process to choose a new president for the political bureau, which will be announced soon. According to Hamas's rules, the new president is chosen from among the movement's leaders and shura council members, without any member of the political bureau being nominated. The new president will be chosen by the members of the political bureau from among the final candidates, and they will also choose deputies to assist him. The deputies are usually two or three, but their names may not be announced due to security concerns and fear of being targeted by Israel.
