After carefully analyzing the situation, here's my reasoning:

Venezuela's 2024 election is occurring in a highly controlled political environment where Nicolás Maduro's regime has systematically marginalized opposition candidates. Edmundo González, while running, operates under significant constraints.

Key considerations:
1. Historical precedent shows Maduro's regime rarely allows genuine electoral challenges
2. González is participating in an election widely viewed as pre-determined
3. Venezuelan opposition has previously boycotted elections, but González chose to participate
4. Potential risks of challenging results include potential arrest or political persecution
5. The specific criterion requires an explicit, public concession before September 1st

Probabilistic factors:
- High likelihood Maduro will claim victory
- Strong incentive for González to avoid direct confrontation
- Potential strategic calculation to maintain political visibility
- Regime's track record of suppressing meaningful opposition

Given these dynamics, I assess a high probability that González will either be effectively forced to concede or strategically choose to do so to preserve political space.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 89.90%, but 82.30% being the most likely. Probability: 82.30%.
