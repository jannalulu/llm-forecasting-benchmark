To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) participating:
The IOC has stated that a maximum of 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes could compete as INAs. However, current reports indicate fewer have been approved or accepted invitations. The most recent figures show 25 Russian and Belarusian athletes authorized to compete.

2. Historical performance of Russian/Belarusian athletes:
In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes (competing as ROC) won 20 gold medals. Belarus won 1 gold medal. This suggests a strong baseline performance.

3. Restrictions on INAs:
INAs are barred from team events, which will reduce their potential medal count compared to normal circumstances. They also face additional scrutiny and potential psychological pressure.

4. Competition from other nations:
The USA is sending a strong 592-athlete team aiming to lead the medal count. Other nations like China and Japan are also expected to perform well.

5. Sports where INAs are competing:
The approved INAs are competing in cycling, gymnastics/trampoline, weightlifting, and wrestling - sports where Russia and Belarus have historically performed well.

6. Time constraints and preparation:
Some athletes, like swimmer Yuliya Efimova, have expressed concerns about not having enough time to qualify or prepare properly.

7. Motivation factor:
INAs may be highly motivated to prove themselves under challenging circumstances, potentially leading to strong performances.

8. Uncertainty and volatility:
The situation remains fluid, with the possibility of more athletes being approved or withdrawing.

Weighing these factors, I believe the chances of INAs winning 15 or more gold medals are relatively low, but not negligible. The restrictions on team events and the reduced number of athletes compared to a normal Russian/Belarusian contingent significantly decrease the chances of reaching 15 golds. However, the historical strength of these athletes in individual events keeps the possibility open.

My Prediction: Between 10.50% and 25.75%, with 18.00% being the most likely. Probability: 18.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) participating:
The IOC has stated that a maximum of 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes could compete as INAs. However, recent reports indicate that only 25 (14 Russian and 11 Belarusian) athletes have been approved so far. This is significantly lower than the maximum, suggesting fewer opportunities for gold medals.

2. Historical performance:
At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Russia won 20 gold medals. However, they had 335 athletes competing then, compared to the much smaller number of INAs now. This suggests a dramatically reduced chance of winning 15 or more golds.

3. Restrictions on INAs:
INAs are not allowed to compete in team events, further limiting their medal opportunities. They are also facing additional scrutiny and potential psychological pressure.

4. Specific athletes approved:
The list of approved INAs includes some strong contenders in sports like wrestling and cycling. However, it's unclear if top performers in high-medal sports like swimming and gymnastics will be included.

5. Competition from other countries:
Strong teams from countries like the USA, China, and Japan are expected to dominate many events, making it harder for INAs to win golds.

6. Potential for additional approvals:
There's still time for more INAs to be approved, which could increase their chances. However, even if the maximum number is reached, it would still be less than 20% of Russia's usual Olympic team size.

7. Political and psychological factors:
The neutral status and ongoing controversy may negatively impact some athletes' performance.

Given these factors, it seems highly unlikely that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals. The current number of approved athletes is less than half the maximum possible, and even if that maximum were reached, it would be challenging to win so many golds with such a reduced team size.

A more realistic estimate might be 3-8 gold medals for INAs, based on the current approvals and historical performance adjusted for team size.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 5.00%, with 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into several key components:

1. How many Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) are expected to compete?
2. In which sports are they likely to compete?
3. What is their historical performance in these sports?
4. How does this compare to the total number of gold medals available?

1. Number of INAs:
The IOC has stated that the number of INAs will not exceed 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes, for a total maximum of 83. However, recent news suggests that fewer have actually been approved - only 25 (14 Russians and 11 Belarusians) as of mid-June.

2. Sports:
The approved INAs are set to compete in cycling, gymnastics/trampoline, weightlifting, and wrestling. These are all individual sports where Russia and Belarus have historically performed well.

3. Historical performance:
Russia won 20 gold medals in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, while Belarus won 1. However, this included team sports and all Russian athletes, not just those approved as INAs. In the specific sports mentioned:
- Cycling: Russia won 2 golds in Tokyo
- Gymnastics: Russia won 2 golds in Tokyo
- Weightlifting: No golds for Russia or Belarus in Tokyo
- Wrestling: Russia won 2 golds in Tokyo

4. Total gold medals:
There will be 329 gold medal events in Paris 2024.

Analysis:
The INAs face several challenges:
- Their numbers are significantly reduced compared to full national teams.
- They are excluded from team events, which limits their medal opportunities.
- The neutral status may affect their morale and performance.
- Other nations may have increased their competitiveness in these sports.

However, they also have some advantages:
- The athletes who have been approved are likely to be among the best in their sports.
- They may be highly motivated to prove themselves under difficult circumstances.
- The sports they're competing in are ones where Russia and Belarus have traditionally been strong.

Given that Russia alone won 6 golds in these specific sports in Tokyo, it's possible that a highly focused and motivated group of INAs could approach this number. However, winning 15 or more golds would require them to significantly outperform their Tokyo results, which seems unlikely given the reduced numbers and additional challenges.

The base rate (Russia + Belarus gold medals in these sports in Tokyo) suggests around 6-7 gold medals as a starting point. Adjusting for the reduced number of athletes and increased motivation, a range of 5-10 gold medals seems most likely.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 15.00%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

6. Timing and preparation:
Some athletes, like swimmer Yuliya Efimova, have expressed concerns about not having enough time to qualify or prepare properly due to the late approval of their status. This could negatively impact their performance.

7. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag, without national symbols, and potentially facing controversy could affect the athletes' mental state and performance.

Balancing these factors:

- The base rate for Russian athletes winning 15+ gold medals in recent Olympics is relatively high, but this included team sports and a much larger delegation.
- The significantly reduced number of athletes and restriction to individual events substantially lowers the probability of reaching 15 gold medals.
- The strong competition from other countries further reduces the likelihood of INAs dominating in multiple events.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) participating:
The IOC has stated that a maximum of 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes could compete as INAs. However, recent reports suggest the actual number may be lower. As of June 28, 2024, only 22 Russian and 17 Belarusian athletes (39 total) had been invited to participate.

2. Historical performance:
In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing under the ROC banner won 20 gold medals. However, this included team sports, which INAs are not eligible for in Paris 2024.

3. Restrictions on INAs:
INAs can only compete in individual events, not team sports. This significantly reduces their medal opportunities compared to previous Olympics.

4. Competition level:
The Olympics feature the world's top athletes. Winning 15 or more gold medals would require INAs to dominate multiple individual events.

5. Recent performance of Russian/Belarusian athletes:
Without access to many international competitions since 2022, it's challenging to assess their current form compared to other nations' athletes.

6. Comparison to other nations:
In Tokyo 2020, only three countries (USA, China, Japan) won 15 or more gold medals. It would be unprecedented for a group of neutral athletes to match this performance.

7. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag, without national anthems or symbols, could potentially impact athletes' motivation or performance.

8. Time until the Olympics:
With the Olympics starting on July 26, 2024, there's limited time for more INAs to be approved or for significant changes in circumstances.

Considering these factors, it seems highly unlikely that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals. The restrictions on team events, the limited number of athletes, and the high bar set by the 15-medal threshold all work against this outcome.

Even if we assume all 39 currently invited INAs compete and perform at their absolute peak, winning 15 gold medals would require an extraordinary success rate that surpasses most national teams.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

With the Olympics starting on July 26, 2024, there's limited time for more INAs to be approved or for significant changes in circumstances.

Considering these factors, it seems highly unlikely that INAs will win 15 or more gold medals. The restrictions on team events, the limited number of athletes, and the high bar set by the 15-medal threshold all work against this outcome.

Even if we assume all 39 currently invited INAs compete and perform at their absolute peak, winning 15 gold medals would require an extraordinary success rate that surpasses most national teams.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available information:

1. Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (INAs) participating:
The IOC has stated that a maximum of 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes could compete as INAs. However, recent reports suggest the actual number may be lower. As of June 28, 2024, only 22 Russian and 17 Belarusian athletes (39 total) had been invited to participate.

2. Historical performance:
In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing under the ROC banner won 20 gold medals. However, this included team sports, which INAs are not eligible for in Paris 2024.

3. Restrictions on INAs:
INAs can only compete in individual events, not team sports. This significantly reduces their medal opportunities compared to previous Olympics.

4. Competition level:
The Olympics feature the world's top athletes. Winning 15 or more gold medals would require INAs to dominate multiple individual events.

5. Recent performance of Russian/Belarusian athletes:
Without access to many international competitions since 2022, it's challenging to assess their current form compared to other nations' athletes.

6. Comparison to other nations:
In Tokyo 2020, only three countries (USA, China, Japan) won 15 or more gold medals. It would be unprecedented for a group of neutral athletes to match this performance.

7. Psychological factors:
Competing under a neutral flag, without national anthems or symbols, could potentially impact athletes' motivation or performance.
