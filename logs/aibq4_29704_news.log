**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Drops to 17.6% in September**
The youth unemployment rate in China decreased to 17.6% in September, down from the peak of 18.8% in August, when millions of university graduates entered the job market, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday, October 22. The still high rate highlights tensions in the Chinese labor market and is in line with the trend indicated by numbers released last week, which showed that the overall unemployment rate stood at 5.1% in September, compared to 5.3% in August.

**Youth Unemployment in China Declines Slightly in September**
China's youth unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds decreased to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August. This slight improvement brings relief to authorities after two consecutive months of soaring youth unemployment. However, officials remain cautious due to factory owners' continued hesitancy to hire, with the last positive employment report for producers dating back to February 2023. According to the data, individuals aged 25 to 29 reported a jobless rate of 6.7%, while those aged 30 to 59 reported a rate of 3.9%, both figures excluding college students. As one official noted, 'Despite the slight improvement, we still have a long way to go in addressing the issue of youth unemployment.'

**China's youth unemployment rate falls after climbing for 2 months**
China's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data. This decline comes after two consecutive months of rising youth unemployment. The rate for 25-to-29-year olds was 6.7%, and 3.9% for people between 30 and 59 years of age. Officials expressed confidence that the trend of stabilization and recovery would continue, but a separate survey showed that firms continued to hold off on hiring last month. As one official noted, 'the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September' is expected to continue. However, the survey also showed that producers last reported improving employment conditions in February 2023, indicating that hiring has not yet fully recovered.

**China's Manufacturing Sector Sees Optimism Amid Economic Challenges**
China's manufacturing sector is looking more optimistic about its business, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in October was 50.1 points, 0.3 points higher than the previous month, marking the first time since April that the indicator has exceeded 50 points. This suggests an expansion of industrial activity. A Bloomberg survey had predicted the PMI to be below 50 points. The non-manufacturing sector, including construction and services, also saw an increase in activity, with the PMI rising to 50.2 points from a neutral 50. Experts hope that the government's announced measures to boost the economy will continue, as the country aims to achieve a 5% economic growth rate this year. However, the economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. The People's Bank of China has already lowered interest rates for mortgage loans to stimulate spending. Further measures are expected to be announced in the coming week.

**China's Manufacturing Sector Sees Slight Improvement**
China's manufacturing sector is looking more optimistic about its business, according to the state-run statistics bureau in Beijing. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in October was 50.1 points, up 0.3 points from the previous month and above the threshold of 50 points for the first time since April. This indicates an expansion of industrial activity. The non-manufacturing sector, which includes construction and services, also saw an increase in activity, with the PMI rising to 50.2 points from a neutral 50. The improved mood is due to the measures announced by Beijing to boost the economy, including lowering interest rates for home loans. Experts are hoping for further measures to be announced in the coming week, which could help achieve the government's target of 5% economic growth this year. However, the economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment.

**Millions of Chinese Apply for Limited Supply of Government Jobs**
In China, 3.25 million applicants are competing for 39,700 government job positions in central government agencies opening up in 2025. The number of applicants has set a new record high, with an increase of more than 340,000 from last year. The unemployment rate among young people aged 16 to 24 in China remains over 17 percent, with an estimated 30 million unemployed young people. Despite declining salaries for civil servants, many young people are considering civil service examinations as their last option for job stability. Experts say that China's economic structural problems and financial pressure are the main reasons for the salary cuts and the high unemployment rate. They also note that the CCP's stimulus policy has not shown any effect on the real economy, and that the lasting high unemployment crisis reflects the severe situation of China's economy caused by the CCP's administrative intervention.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases, But Economy Still Faces Challenges**
China's youth unemployment rate has decreased to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (BNS). However, this rate is still very high and the second highest of the year. The decrease is partly due to a change in methodology, as students and high school students are no longer included in the calculation. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group is significantly higher than in June (13.2%), which is likely due to the fact that nearly 12 million students graduated from university in China in June, increasing the number of people on the job market. The BNS also reported a decrease in unemployment rates for other age groups, including 25-29 year olds (6.7% in September, down from 6.9% in August) and the overall national unemployment rate (5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August). These numbers, which only account for urban areas, offer a glimmer of hope for China's economy, which has been struggling. The country is also facing low prices and a risk of deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 0.4% in September over the past year, down from 0.6% in August. The BNS also reported a 2.8% decrease in factory gate prices in September over the past year, a decline that has been ongoing since the end of 2022. However, retail sales, which are the main indicator of household consumption, rebounded by 3.2% in September over the past year, after a 2.1% increase in August. The Chinese authorities have recently announced a series of measures to stimulate economic activity, including interest rate cuts and relaxations on property purchases. The People's Bank of China has also announced a 'swap' program for insurance companies and investment funds, with an initial amount of over 200 billion yuan (26 billion euros). The governor of the central bank, Pan Gongsheng, has also hinted at a possible reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks before the end of 2024. The authorities hope that these efforts will support the economy and help achieve the official target of around 5% growth for 2024. However, opinions are divided, with some analysts believing that the recent measures are a step in the right direction, while others think that more needs to be done to address the structural challenges facing the economy.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases to 17.6% in September**
China has announced that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds has slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, a figure closely watched as the country tries to revive its slowing economy. This rate, which does not include high school students and university students, is still high but lower than the 18.8% recorded in August, the highest level since the beginning of 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China. The increase in the number of university graduates in June, with nearly 12 million students obtaining their diplomas, has added to the competition on the already difficult job market, which explains the sharp rise in unemployment this summer and its slight decline last month as some hiring took place. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, had declared in May that fighting youth unemployment should be considered an 'absolute priority'. The unemployment rate for 25-29 year olds has also decreased from 6.9% in August to 6.7% in September, and the overall unemployment rate for the country has decreased from 5.3% to 5.1%.

**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Decreases to 17.6%**
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the youth unemployment rate for those aged 16-24, excluding students, decreased to 17.6% in September. This is a decline from the peak of 18.8% in August, when millions of university graduates entered the job market. The rate is consistent with the numbers released last week, which showed a general unemployment rate of 5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August. The labor statistics come after China's economy reported a 4.6% year-over-year growth in July-September, which is slightly better than expectations but still the slowest pace in six quarters. The National Bureau of Statistics had suspended the release of youth unemployment data in June last year, when it hit a record high of 21.3%, and resumed it in January this year with a revised methodology that excludes students. Economists say this change makes the metric less reliable.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases Slightly After Two Months of Increase**
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in the country has decreased slightly after two months of increase. The rate, which affects people between 16 and 24 years old, rose significantly during the summer, from 13.2% in June to 17.1% in July and 18.8% in August, a record high after the authorities revised the methodology of the indicator at the end of last year to exclude students. The poor employment data for young people in the summer was due to the entry of a record number of graduates into the labor market - an estimated 12 million this year - and increasingly bleak job market prospects, affected by the slowdown in the recovery of the world's second-largest economy, reported local media. The Chinese government has made youth employment a top priority, both due to the negative impact on consumption of potential income decline and the risks to social stability, a vital issue for Beijing. Chinese authorities expressed confidence on Friday that the world's second-largest economy 'will continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery', after announcing a stimulus package with measures to support the financial and real estate sectors and the stock market, in order to relaunch the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Analysts stated that the package of measures is 'a step in the right direction', but 'insufficient' to relaunch the economic recovery of China, unless accompanied by an increase in public spending, a question that may collide with concerns about the sustainability of the debt. Low domestic and international demand, associated with risks of deflation, insufficient stimuli, housing crisis, and lack of confidence from consumers and the private sector are some of the causes pointed out by analysts to explain what is happening in the world's second-largest economy.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases Slightly, But Concerns Remain**
China's youth unemployment rate has decreased slightly to 17.6% in September, after two consecutive months of increases. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE), the rate had risen sharply over the summer, from 13.2% in June to 17.1% in July, and then to 18.8% in August. The increase was attributed to the large number of university graduates entering the job market, estimated to be around 12 million this year, and the bleak job prospects, which are being hindered by the slowdown in the global economy. China stopped publishing youth unemployment data in July last year, after it reached a record high of 21.3%, and resumed publication in December. After excluding students from the calculation, the new measurement showed a rate of 14.9% in December. The Chinese authorities have made employment for young people a top priority, due to the negative impact on consumption and the risks to social stability. Officials expressed confidence that the second-largest economy in the world will 'continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery' after announcing a package of stimulus measures, including support for the financial, real estate, and stock markets. However, experts say that the measures are 'a step in the right direction', but will be 'insufficient' to revive the Chinese economy unless accompanied by increased government spending, which could conflict with concerns over debt sustainability.

**China's Youth Jobless Rate Falls After Hitting a Peak**
China's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from the peak of 18.8% in August, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. This decrease is in line with the overall headline unemployment rate, which stood at 5.1% in September, compared to 5.3% in August. The job numbers come after China's economy reported a 4.6% expansion in the July-September period, which was slightly better than expected but still marked the slowest pace in six quarters. Economists are closely watching to see if Beijing's package of fiscal and monetary easing will soon warm up China's job market, as authorities pivot to stimulating the economy after months of hesitation. As one economist noted, 'the job numbers are a positive sign, but the underlying issues in the job market remain.'

**China's Young People Adopt 'Revenge Saving' Mentality Amid Economic Uncertainty**
A new trend is emerging in China, where young people are adopting a 'Revenge Saving' mentality, cutting back on expenses and saving money. This is in contrast to the previous generation, who often spent more than they earned and accumulated debt. According to Shaun Rein, CEO of the China Market Research Group, 'the Chinese youth has a Revenge-Saving mentality.' Experts attribute this behavior to the economic uncertainty in China, with young people feeling the impact of a slowing economy. Christopher Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics, said, 'young people probably feel the same thing as everyone else: the economy is just not doing well.' The Chinese government's data shows that household deposits grew by 11.8% in the first quarter of 2024, but the International Monetary Fund predicts a further slowdown to 4.5% in the coming year. The youth unemployment rate in China is also high, at 14.2% in May 2024, and many young people are struggling to find jobs or increase their income. As a result, they are adopting a more frugal lifestyle, with some even eating in community kitchens for older people to save money. This trend is in stark contrast to the global Generation Z, who are more likely to take on debt to improve their quality of life. A study by Intuit found that 73% of Gen Z in the US would prioritize a higher quality of life over saving money.

**China's rising youth unemployment signals the nation's economic woes are far from over**
China's youth unemployment rate has been rising, reaching a new high of 18.8% in August. This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Economists and analysts look to youth unemployment rates for insight because they are more prone to fluctuations that can hint at corporate confidence and hiring trends.

**China's Youth Unemployment Becomes a Global Problem**
China's high youth unemployment is becoming a problem not only for the country itself but also for other nations, including Germany. According to Maximilian Butek from the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, 'it's mainly economic reasons' that drive people from China to the US. Many young people in China see no future for themselves, and the country's youth unemployment rate is at a record high, with 21.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds without a job in June 2024. The situation is so dire that the Chinese government has stopped publishing the statistics, only to resume them in December 2023, excluding students from the count. Nicole Goldin from the Atlantic Council believes that 'there are simply not enough jobs for all the young people coming out of university.' With nearly 12 million university graduates entering the job market this year, the country's economy is struggling to keep up, with a growth rate of only 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China's growth will slow down to 3.3% by 2029 due to various factors, including the ongoing crisis in the real estate sector, declining productivity, and an aging population. This could lead to China exporting its problems, such as youth unemployment, to other countries, including Africa, where Chinese companies are building infrastructure projects with Chinese workers. For Germany, this could mean a decline in Chinese imports, which have already decreased by 10% in 2023.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record 18.8% in August**
According to the State Statistical Bureau, China's youth unemployment rate reached a record 18.8% in August, up from 17.1% in July. This is the highest level of unemployment among 16-24 year olds, excluding students. The unemployment rate among 25-29 year olds also reached a four-month high of 6.9%, while the rate for 30-59 year olds remained at 3.9%. Lu Aihua, a representative of the State Statistical Bureau, attributed the rise in unemployment to the large number of graduates, 11.79 million, who entered the job market in the summer. The Chinese government has implemented measures to stimulate hiring, including subsidies for employers. The unemployment rates do not include rural populations.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8%, driven by economic problems and restrictive hiring policies. According to data from the National Statistics Bureau, the unemployment rate for young people aged 16-24 who are not in school increased to 18.8% in August, up from 17.1% in July and 13.2% in June. Dan Wang, Chief Economist at HSBC, explained, 'It's becoming increasingly difficult for young people to find well-paying jobs, as the service sector, which has absorbed many fresh graduates in the past three years, has shrunk significantly, especially in real estate, finance, and IT.' Companies are hesitant to hire new graduates due to high costs and legal difficulties associated with layoffs. The recent unemployment numbers are also linked to other disappointing economic data from China, including slower-than-expected growth in retail sales and industrial production. Despite growing calls for more stimulus measures, the Chinese central bank decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Friday.

**China's Youth Jobless Rate Hit New High in August**
China's youth unemployment rate reached a new high in August, with 18.8% of people aged 16 to 24, excluding students, without a job. This surpasses the previous record of 17.1% in July, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The unemployment rate for workers aged 25 to 29, excluding college students, also increased to 6.9%, the highest in four months. National Bureau of Statistics spokeswoman Liu Aihua attributed the rise in unemployment to a record 11.79 million graduates entering the job market this summer. Despite government measures to encourage hiring, young workers continue to face difficulties in finding jobs. Liu said, 'The government has introduced various measures to encourage the hiring of graduates, including subsidies and other incentives, but young workers continue to face difficulties in finding jobs.' The government's plan to raise the retirement age to address workforce shortages has been met with criticism, with some arguing it could further exacerbate the youth unemployment situation.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8% in August, according to official data, marking the second consecutive month of a new maximum, despite the authorities using a new statistical method. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced that the unemployment rate among people aged 16-24 living in urban areas of China increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The NBS also published the unemployment rate for young people aged 25-29, excluding students, which stood at 6.9% in August, a 0.4 percentage point increase from July. The NBS changed its methodology in January to exclude students from the youth unemployment rate, which had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. The new method aims to provide more accurate employment services and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies for young people. 'The calculation of the unemployment rate by age group, excluding students, better reflects the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society,' said the NBS. The global urban unemployment rate in China stood at 5.3% in August, slightly higher than the 5.1% recorded in July. China is under pressure to increase job creation and employment.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high, according to official statistics. The unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds in August was 18.8%, up from 17.1% in July. This is a major economic problem for the country, with President Xi Jinping declaring the fight against youth unemployment an 'absolute priority' in May. The Chinese government had previously reported a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, but then stopped releasing the figure. After adjusting their methodology to exclude students, they began releasing the data again. The unemployment rate for 25- to 29-year-olds in August was 6.9%, up from 6.5% in July. However, the official statistics only provide a partial picture of unemployment in China, as they only account for urban areas. The country is also facing a severe crisis in the real estate sector and trade disputes with the West, with economic recovery after the end of COVID-19 restrictions proceeding slowly.

**China youth unemployment hits 18.8%, highest this year**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This marks a 1.7% increase from July, when the rate was 17.1%. The NBS attributed the rise to the large number of students graduating from Chinese universities this June, which has heightened competition in the already-tough job market. President Xi Jinping had previously stated that countering youth unemployment must be regarded as a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate for those aged 25-29 also edged up to 6.9% in August from 6.5% in July. The NBS noted that the economy is still facing many difficulties and challenges in its continued recovery, citing adverse effects of current changes in the external environment and insufficient domestic demand.

China's youth unemployment rate rose to 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This is an increase from 17.1% in July, and is likely due to the large number of graduates entering the job market, with nearly 12m students graduating from Chinese universities in June.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches 18.8% in August**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, as the country struggles to revitalize its ailing economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 years old, not enrolled in education, increased to 18.8% in August, up from 17.1% in July. The expected unemployment rate for June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. With around 12 million students graduating from Chinese universities in June 2024, the competition in the job market has increased, making it difficult for job seekers. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in May that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among those aged 25-29 years old increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The release of August's unemployment numbers comes after disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth, which slowed down in the same month. These indicators once again highlight the challenges Beijing faces in restarting its economy sustainably, despite efforts to do so. The National Bureau of Statistics said in a previous statement that 'the negative effects of the current changes in the external environment are intensifying, and domestic demand is still insufficient, and the economy is still facing many difficulties and challenges as it continues to recover'.

**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: Rising Challenges Amid Economic Slowdown**
China is facing a growing youth unemployment crisis, with the unemployment rate among individuals aged 16 to 24 reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since December 2022. The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches New Record High in August**
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in August 2024 reached a new record high. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The unemployment rate for the 25-29 age group also increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August. The youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level since the new calculation method was introduced in December 2023. The NBS had previously stopped releasing youth unemployment data by age group after it reached a record high of 21.3% in July 2023. The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students. The summer months are a time when young graduates are preparing to enter the workforce, which is why the youth unemployment rate is often high during this period, said the NBS.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**
China's youth unemployment rate has increased to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The ONE had previously suspended the publication of youth unemployment data in the second half of last year due to a change in its calculation method to exclude university students. Before this change, the youth unemployment rate had reached 21.3% in June 2023. The alarming increase in youth unemployment in China reflects the country's economic challenges. The ONE's data highlights the need for effective measures to address this issue, which is exacerbated by the country's economic restructuring, aging population, and delayed retirement age. To tackle this problem, the Chinese government should implement policies and programs that promote job creation and improve employability among young people, such as investing in their education and training, providing incentives to companies that hire young people, and supporting entrepreneurship and business initiatives. These measures, along with a comprehensive strategy to address the various factors contributing to youth unemployment, will be crucial to mitigating this issue and ensuring a more prosperous future for young Chinese people.

China's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55. This change will be implemented over the next 15 years, starting from 2025.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches Highest Level Since Last Public Update**
The youth unemployment rate in China has increased to its highest level since the last public update, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The youth unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group, excluding students, increased to 18.8% in August, up from 17.1% in July. Similarly, the unemployment rate for the 25-29 age group, excluding university students, also increased to 6.9% in August, up from 6.5% in the previous month. China introduced a new method of measurement in December, after suspending the release of youth unemployment data since the previous July. With the old approach, the unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group, including students, peaked at 21.3% in July 2023, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: A Complex Problem with Multiple Causes**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 21.3% in May 2023, prompting the government to stop publishing statistics. After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.

**China's High-Tech Offensive Leaves Young People Without Jobs**
China's high-tech offensive has left young people without jobs, according to DW. The country's youth unemployment rate reached a record 21.3% last year, but the government stopped publishing the data. After six months of manipulating the methodology, the National Statistics Bureau of China excluded students from the data, and the youth unemployment rate decreased by almost a third by December. However, the problem persists, and in July, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Jiayu Li from the Singapore-based public policy consulting firm said that even in the previous data, millions of migrant workers were not considered, as it is 'harder for them to find a full-time job' than for people in urban centers. Li stated, 'The official numbers do not accurately reflect the situation on the ground. Even after questionable methodological corrections, the numbers continue to rise, highlighting the severity of the problem.' The Chinese government's harsh crackdown on the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sector's collapse resulted in mass layoffs, affecting many young workers. Many young people are now avoiding worker jobs and seeking better-paying white-collar jobs. The Chinese government has introduced some incentives and reforms in the education system to address these structural problems, but it will take time for them to have an impact. The government's focus on emerging sectors like AI, chip production, and green energy, which are not labor-intensive, will not create many new jobs. Li stated, 'The state is concentrating on emerging sectors like AI and electric vehicles, which are small and not labor-intensive and only create limited jobs. This suppresses innovation and technological breakthroughs - ironically, exactly what Beijing is relying on to drive China's future growth.' The ongoing trade tensions with the West are also putting pressure on China's export industry, Li said. The high youth unemployment rate is affecting the country's productivity and ability to compete globally. Young people will not be able to move up to the middle class, which will have negative effects on consumption and potentially destabilizing social consequences that will further hinder growth, warned Nicole Goldin from the think tank in Washington.
