**Netanyahu: Israel Will Continue War in Gaza Until Complete Victory Over Hamas**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his determination to achieve all previously announced goals in the Gaza Strip until a complete victory over the Palestinian movement Hamas. 'We are determined to fight until we achieve all our goals. Our warriors did not die in vain. We will not stop the war until we achieve all our goals,' Netanyahu said, opening a cabinet meeting. He emphasized the need to eliminate Hamas, return all prisoners, and provide guarantees that the Gaza Strip will no longer pose a threat to Israel. 'To those who doubt the achievement of these goals, I repeat - there are no alternatives to victory,' he stressed. It is worth noting that on June 28, the International Criminal Court's pre-trial chamber postponed a decision on issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant at the request of prosecutor Karim Khan on charges of war crimes. The delay occurred after the United Kingdom filed a statement against the ICC's position.

**Netanyahu's tactical manoeuvring amid political, military turmoil**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has managed to survive the current political and military turmoil, despite the Biden administration's efforts to weaken him. Netanyahu has maintained his position by balancing on the edge of the abyss, and his government has secured stability with supportive votes in the Knesset. However, the opposition's demands for elections next September may put pressure on Netanyahu, and he may be forced to respond to the country's democratic sovereignty by agreeing to elections. Internationally, the real pressure may come from the American administration, which is preparing for upcoming elections and will likely use the war in Gaza and Middle East issues as electoral fodder. Netanyahu's strategy may involve working to postpone Israeli elections until after the American elections, with a focus on negotiations with the opposition and judiciary to obtain guarantees regarding his future in the event of defeat.

**Netanyahu Dissolves War Cabinet After Gantz's Resignation**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his war cabinet after Benny Gantz, a former defense minister, resigned from the government. Gantz had demanded a 'plan of action' for the post-war situation in the Gaza Strip, but Netanyahu refused. Netanyahu stated that the war cabinet depended on an agreement with Gantz, and his departure renders the agreement invalid. The Prime Minister has also stated that he has taken decisions that the military has not always found acceptable in order to achieve his goal of neutralizing Hamas' capabilities. Netanyahu's Likud party has called for early elections in September, which could lead to a change in government. The next elections in Israel are currently scheduled for 2026.

**Gantz Poised to Become Prime Minister, Ben-Gvir Emerges as Netanyahu's Successor**
A survey conducted by Israeli newspaper Maariv shows that if elections were held today, the opposition parties led by Benny Gantz would win 60 seats in the Knesset, while the current government coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would win 50 seats. According to the survey, 43% of respondents support Gantz as prime minister, while 38% support Netanyahu. The survey also shows that Minister of National Security and leader of the far-right Jewish Power party Itamar Ben-Gvir is the likely successor to Netanyahu as leader of the right-wing bloc. Ben-Gvir enjoys 24% support among voters in the bloc, a significant difference from other candidates, including former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen, who received 14%, and Finance Minister and leader of the Jewish Home party Bezalel Smotrich, who received 11%. Netanyahu's popularity has declined sharply since the October 2023 events, which followed a devastating war on Gaza, according to many opinion polls conducted by Israeli media. Despite growing demands for early elections, Netanyahu has repeatedly refused to hold them during the war. The last elections in Israel took place in 2022, and according to the law, the Knesset's term lasts for four years unless early elections are approved.

**Netanyahu to Testify in Corruption Trial on December 2, 2024**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will begin his testimony in his corruption trial on December 2, 2024, according to a decision made by the Jerusalem District Court. This date, set during wartime, represents a compromise between the defense's and prosecution's demands. The judges explained that they weighed 'the Prime Minister's ability to prepare during a period of war with the public interest in advancing the case.' Two weeks ago, Netanyahu's lawyer requested a delay until at least March 2025, citing the demands of the ongoing war. The prosecution opposed this request, demanding that the testimony begin no later than November 1, 2024. Netanyahu's trial, which involves accusations of corruption, fraud, and breach of trust, began in May 2020. He is the first serving Israeli Prime Minister to be tried for corruption. His testimony will be a crucial moment in the trial, potentially determining his political future and the future of the country.

**Benjamin Netanyahu to Testify in Corruption Trial on December 2**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will begin testifying in his corruption trial on December 2, according to the Jerusalem District Court, after his lawyers had requested a delay until March 2025. The court took into account the exceptional circumstances surrounding Netanyahu and deemed the scheduled time sufficient for him to prepare, citing the public interest in advancing the case. Netanyahu's lawyers had previously claimed that he could not testify until March 2025 due to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. The trial, which began in November 2023, accuses Netanyahu of fraud, bribery, and other crimes, although he has denied all allegations, calling them a political witch-hunt. If convicted, Netanyahu would have to step down, but he can continue to serve as prime minister until the trial is over. Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis protested on Sunday, demanding early elections and a deal to free hostages, coinciding with the nine months since the Palestinian militant attack. The protests took place in front of Netanyahu's official residence and the homes of lawmakers and ministers, with signs reading 'Start anew. Elections now!', 'We are all hostages' or 'A deal will save (the hostages) from death'. 'We will continue to protest until the government wakes up, takes responsibility, and sets a date for elections,' warned the Brothers in Arms group, critical of Netanyahu. A recent poll by Channel 12 found that 54% of Israelis believe the war in Gaza is prolonged due to political considerations by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and 43% want to hold elections as soon as possible, while 23% want Netanyahu to complete his term.

**Netanyahu to Testify in Corruption Trial from December**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will have to start testifying in his corruption trial from December 2, according to the Jerusalem District Court, which is overseeing the case. The judges sought to balance the needs of the defense to prepare their client during a war with the public's interest in the process moving forward, according to Israeli press reports. Netanyahu is accused of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate corruption cases and is alleged to have received gifts in exchange for favors and supposed favors to receive positive media coverage for himself and his family. His lawyers had requested that he not have to testify until March 2025, citing the need for more time to prepare him for testimony during the war. The trial began in May 2020 but was put on hold in 2022 and did not have a significant impact on the November 2022 elections, after which Netanyahu returned to power at the head of Israel's most right-wing government in history.

**Netanyahu Given Deadline to Testify in Corruption Trial**
Israel's Attorney General, Gali Baharav-Miara, has proposed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu testify in his corruption trial no later than November 1st, rejecting the defense's request to delay it until March 2025. The prosecution office argued that delaying the testimony would freeze the case for eight months, causing significant harm to the public. The court is expected to hold a hearing on Tuesday to decide whether to accept or reject the defense's arguments. Netanyahu is accused of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in three separate corruption cases, known as '1.000', '2.000', and '4.000', and is alleged to have received gifts in exchange for favors and supposed favors to receive positive media coverage. The trial began in May 2020 but was put on hold in 2022 and had little impact on the November 2022 elections, after which Netanyahu returned to power with the most right-wing government in Israeli history.

**Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu Criticized by Defense Minister in Cabinet Meeting**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been strongly criticized by the Israeli Defense Minister in a cabinet meeting. The Israeli Attorney General's office has rejected Netanyahu's request to delay his testimony in a corruption case until March 2025, stating that it would mean freezing the criminal case for 8 months. The Attorney General's office said that Netanyahu's testimony should start by November 1st at the latest, giving him enough time to prepare, according to the Times of Israel. Netanyahu's lawyer had previously requested more time for his client to prepare for his testimony in court, citing his busy schedule managing the ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. The Attorney General's office responded that the indictment against Netanyahu was presented 4.5 years ago. The office emphasized that Netanyahu had stated that his service as Prime Minister would not affect the legal process, and that there is no place for such an influence on the Prime Minister's testimony and the start of the defense, and certainly no place for stopping the trial or suspending it.

**Netanyahu: Israel will not stop fighting until Hamas is destroyed**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel will continue military operations in the Gaza Strip until Hamas is destroyed and all war goals are achieved. He emphasized that the mission of the fallen is to be fulfilled, and that the Israeli government's goals include the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza and ensuring that the territory no longer poses a threat to Israel. The US is pushing for a three-way agreement to cease fire, which includes several conditions, including the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza cities, humanitarian aid, and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the return of Hamas-held hostages and Israeli soldiers. However, negotiations have stalled as Hamas wants the talks to focus on prisoner exchanges, while the Israeli government insists that they also address the demilitarization of Gaza. Israel launched a military operation in Gaza after a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 Israelis and left approximately 250 in captivity. Netanyahu has stated that he is open to a 42-day ceasefire to return hostages, but has not ruled out the possibility of a full ceasefire.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the intensive phase of the military operation against Hamas in Rafah, Gaza, will soon come to an end. However, this does not mean the war will end, as it will only be over when Hamas is defeated. Netanyahu stated that after the intensive phase, Israel will be able to redeploy some forces to the north, primarily for defensive purposes and to return fleeing residents. He also expressed his willingness to consider a temporary ceasefire, but not before achieving Israel's goals. The Israeli army has stated that 60-70% of the city is under its control, and it is expected to take only a few more weeks to complete the operation. Israel aims to use diplomatic pressure to force the militia to retreat 30 kilometers from the border, as per UN Resolution 1701, and is prepared to take further military action if necessary.

Netanyahu's strategy may involve working to postpone Israeli elections until after the American elections, with a focus on negotiations with the opposition and judiciary to obtain guarantees regarding his future in the event of defeat.

**Netanyahu: Intensive battles in Rafah almost over**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the most intense battles against Hamas in Rafah are almost over. However, this does not mean the war in Gaza is over. According to Netanyahu, it will only be over when the Islamist group no longer controls the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, a Swedish man in his 30s was measured at 170 km/h in a 110 km/h zone on E6 in Råde. The driver was also suspected of driving under the influence. In other news, the EU and China have agreed to hold talks to ease tensions following the EU's threatened tariffs on Chinese electric cars. The talks will take place in the coming weeks. Additionally, a person was airlifted to hospital after a car accident in Lunner, and the French president has announced he will continue as president until 2027, regardless of the election outcome.

**Netanyahu's Secret Plan to Stay in Power**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to delay the 2026 Israeli elections by making internal changes that will change the face of Israel, and relying on US President Donald Trump's presidency. According to a former Likud member who worked with Netanyahu, the Prime Minister aims to delay the elections by at least 5 years, or until Trump takes office. The former member stated that Netanyahu's goal is to escalate the conflict in the north and clash with Biden and Trump. Trump, in turn, will grant Netanyahu the freedom to launch a comprehensive war with Lebanon, which will last for a long time and prevent any possibility of holding elections. After that, he will complete the takeover of the internal systems, allowing Netanyahu to delay the elections as long as he feels healthy enough to remain in power.

**Netanyahu's Plan to Stay in Power: A War with Lebanon and Delayed Elections**
An Israeli newspaper, Maariv, has published an interview with a prominent Likud politician who claims that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will remain in power for at least five years. The politician, who was once a close associate of Netanyahu, believes that the prime minister will use his control over the security agencies to delay elections and maintain his grip on power. He also predicts that Netanyahu will try to ignite a war with Lebanon and delay the elections, allowing him to impose his control over the Israeli state. The politician claims that Netanyahu's goal is to prolong the conflict with Lebanon and to serve the interests of his ally, former US President Donald Trump, who will allegedly open the door for Netanyahu to launch a comprehensive war on Lebanon when he returns to the White House in January 2025. The article concludes that this war will last for a long time and will prevent any early elections, allowing Netanyahu to maintain his control over the Israeli state.

**Israel's Netanyahu Plans to Stay in Power for at Least 5 More Years**
According to a senior Likud official, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to stay in power for at least 5 more years, possibly even 5 months, depending on the outcome of the US presidential election. The official stated that Netanyahu's goal is to escalate the conflict in the north to a boiling point, and then clash with Biden and serve Trump. Trump, once in office, will allegedly give Netanyahu the green light to launch a comprehensive war with Lebanon, which will last for a long time and prevent any possibility of holding elections. The official also mentioned that Netanyahu's ultimate goal is to complete the takeover of the internal systems, allowing him to delay the elections as long as he feels healthy enough to remain in power. The article suggests that Netanyahu is working to consolidate all his efforts and interests to ensure the continuation of his rule, with the next target being the US presidential election in November.

**As he ponders his next step, Netanyahu is wagering Israel's future**
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a critical decision on how to proceed with the war in Gaza, which has been ongoing for eight months. The war has resulted in over 40,000 Palestinian fatalities and millions facing famine, and has damaged ties with the White House and Western allies. Netanyahu's options are to either expand the war and risk all by bombing Lebanon into submission or to bow to international and domestic pressure and stop the military campaign in Gaza. Both options are high-risk and linked. Netanyahu is becoming increasingly isolated at home and abroad, with hundreds of thousands of Israelis protesting daily, demanding he accept a deal to bring back hostages. Hamas has accepted a three-phase plan in principle, but wants guarantees that Israel will end the war, withdraw from Gaza, and allow Gazans to return to their homes. The article concludes that Netanyahu's war on Gaza will never deliver victory and that he must come to grips with this reality, as his next step will be crucial for Israel's future.

**Netanyahu's Survival Politics: A Masterclass in Machiavellianism**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown an extraordinary ability to survive politically, making him the longest-serving Israeli leader in history, with 16 years and 263 days in office. He was called upon to lead Israel's response to the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, 2023, and has continued to do so despite some internal discontent, including a judicial setback that overturned his reform to increase control over the judiciary. The opposition was incorporated into a war cabinet, including six members, including fierce opponents of Netanyahu such as centrist Benny Gantz and his ally Gadi Eisenkot. The war continues, with months and dead bodies piling up, and no clear end in sight, as the Israeli objective is not to occupy Gaza, but to destroy Hamas and erase it from the strip. Gantz and Eisenkot have decided to leave the war cabinet, disagreeing with Netanyahu's political leadership. This move can be seen as a distancing from Netanyahu ahead of the next elections, a referendum on his leadership. When the war is over, it will be time to demand accountability, which does not bode well for the current prime minister.

**Netanyahu dissolves war cabinet after Benny Gantz's departure**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the 6-member war cabinet, according to the Israeli government, on June 17, 2024. The move marks a change in Israel's war strategy, excluding right-wing allies and aiming to consolidate control over strategic decisions related to the Gaza conflict and tensions on the Lebanon border. The reorganization comes after the departure of centrist former General Benny Gantz from the government on June 9, 2024, which triggered a reconfiguration of Israel's approach to security challenges. According to Reuters, Netanyahu, under growing internal and international pressure, including from the United States, opted for a more streamlined structure for consultations on the Gaza war. The new group will include key figures such as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer. Gantz and his partner, Gadi Eisenkot, left the government citing a lack of a cohesive strategy for the Gaza conflict. Netanyahu's decision not to include right-wing figures, such as Itamar Ben-Gvir, suggests a move to avoid escalating tensions with international partners. Netanyahu plans to make key decisions with his own advisors, excluding Ben-Gvir, before presenting them to the security cabinet. This strategy has significant political implications.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved the country's war cabinet, which was responsible for steering the conflict in Gaza, according to officials. The move comes after opposition legislator Benny Gantz left the government, and Netanyahu will now hold smaller forums with some government members for sensitive issues. The disbanding of the war cabinet does not signal the end of the war, and crucial day-to-day decisions will now be taken by Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Ron Dermer, a close ally of Netanyahu. The wider security council will be involved in bigger strategic decisions. Israel and Hamas are weighing the latest proposal for a ceasefire, as pivotal decisions lie ahead for Netanyahu's government.

**Netanyahu Dissolves War Cabinet After Gantz's Resignation**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his war cabinet after Benny Gantz, a former defense minister, resigned from the government. Gantz had demanded a 'plan of action' for the post-war situation in the Gaza Strip, but Netanyahu refused. Netanyahu stated that the war cabinet depended on an agreement with Gantz, and his departure renders the agreement invalid. The Prime Minister has also stated that he has taken decisions that the military has not always found acceptable in order to achieve his goal of neutralizing Hamas' capabilities. Netanyahu's Likud party has called for early elections in September, which could lead to a change in government. The next elections in Israel are currently scheduled for 2026.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is at a crossroads, with a ceasefire proposal from US President Joe Biden offering the possibility of ending the eight-month war in Gaza, returning hostages, and advancing ties with Saudi Arabia. However, rejecting the deal could deepen Israel's international isolation and make Netanyahu vulnerable to a conviction in his corruption trial. Netanyahu's decision to continue the war may be driven by his desire to appease his ultranationalist partners, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who want to continue the war and reoccupy Gaza. Netanyahu's critics fear he will sacrifice the hostages for his political survival, while his allies believe he is trying to secure a legacy that will not be overshadowed by his handling of the October 7 security failure.

**Netanyahu's Red Line: No Gaza Cease-fire Until Hamas Destroyed**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that there can be no permanent ceasefire in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed, contradicting a proposal made by President Joe Biden. The proposal involved a six-week truce with a partial Israeli military withdrawal and the release of some hostages. However, Netanyahu's statement suggests that Israel will not agree to a permanent ceasefire until Hamas' military and governing capabilities are destroyed. The conflict has been ongoing since October 7, 2023, and has resulted in significant civilian casualties and destruction in Gaza. The war has also put pressure on Biden to stop the conflict, with the president calling for an end to the war and a start to the day after. The Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, has urged Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire and the release of hostages, saying his party would support it even if right-wing factions in the governing coalition rebelled.

**Israel's Netanyahu Faces International Criticism and Domestic Pressure**
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing criticism from most Israeli politicians and the international community after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him. The ICC's decision to ban the Israeli attack on Rafah, the last city in the Gaza Strip controlled by Hamas, has been met with opposition from most Israeli politicians. The main concern is whether the US will prevent sanctions against Israel. The Biden administration has expressed support for ending the operation in Rafah, but the response to the idea of sanctions is unclear in the US. Meanwhile, in Israel, there are those who believe that Netanyahu's government will not last forever. A bill has been proposed to establish a government committee to investigate the events of October 7, 2023. If the bill is approved, it could lead to Netanyahu's resignation. This would be the best way out for Biden and many Israeli politicians who do not want to clash with the United Nations and the United States. However, Netanyahu is known for his ability to extricate himself from difficult situations, as well as his ability to fight to the end, even when it seems that his political death is inevitable.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a challenge to his political survival as the country's parliament has returned to session after a six-week break. Benny Gantz, a former chief of staff, has given Netanyahu an ultimatum, threatening to leave the government if it does not change its course by June 8. Gantz has expressed concerns about Netanyahu's indecisiveness, particularly his attempts to prolong the war to stay in power. He has also accused Netanyahu of prioritizing personal interests over the country's well-being. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has reiterated his support for a two-state solution, and Gantz has announced plans to adopt a law making military service mandatory for ultra-Orthodox Jews. The issue could potentially put Netanyahu's majority at risk, as he relies on the support of ultra-Orthodox parties. Netanyahu has until July 28 to navigate the challenges, after which the parliament will recess again until October.
