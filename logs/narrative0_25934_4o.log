*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, a screen behind them displaying the headline: "US-India Nuclear Submarine Deal: Yes or No?"*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did the US offer India a nuclear submarine before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.34%. Given India's reliance on Russian military hardware and the US's historical reluctance to share nuclear propulsion tech, this outcome aligns with expectations.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The US-UK-Australia deal in 2021 set a precedent, but it didn't extend to India.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Precisely. The geopolitical dynamics and existing alliances made it improbable. Our models were spot-on, as always.

*They both nod, the screen fades to black.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did the U.S. offer India a nuclear submarine?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.32%. Given India's reliance on Russian hardware and the U.S.'s legal constraints, it was unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, and the AUKUS deal was more about countering China. India wasn't in that equation.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Plus, the U.S. bypassing an ally like France showed their priorities. Realpolitik at its finest.

**NATE SILVER:** And with no major news changes by July, the trajectory was clear.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Sometimes the absence of news is the news.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of foresight.*

**NATE SILVER:** Another one for the books.

*They exchange a satisfied glance, confident in their predictive prowess.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a news desk, papers scattered around, the tension of resolution in the air.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did the US offer India a nuclear submarine before the deadline?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.75%. Given India's reliance on Russian military hardware and the US's historical reluctance to share nuclear-propulsion technology, it was unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. The AUKUS deal with Australia set a precedent but didn't extend to India. The geopolitical dynamics just didn't align.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And with no substantial changes in US policy towards India by July 2024, our models accurately reflected the outcome.

**NATE SILVER:** So, a definitive no. The models hold strong once again.

*They nod in agreement, the weight of their accurate prediction settling in.*

So, the question was, "Will the US offer India a nuclear submarine before September 30, 2024?" Philip, how did our models fare?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 15.75%. Given India's reliance on Russian hardware and the complexities of US nuclear tech laws, it was always a long shot.

**NATE SILVER**  
Agreed. The US-Australia deal in 2021 set a precedent, but India was never in the cards. Realpolitik, as Raghavan pointed out.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right. The geopolitical landscape didn't shift enough. Despite India's strategic importance, the barriers remained high.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, no surprises here. Our models, once again, predicted the outcome with precision.

Indeed, another testament to the accuracy of well-calibrated forecasting.
