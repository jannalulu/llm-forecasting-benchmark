**Bitcoin set for new all-time high in 2024 as worst correction ends, experts say**
Bitcoin has regained momentum and is on track to reach a new all-time high in 2024, according to industry experts. The cryptocurrency has increased by 12% in the past weekend, reclaiming important price levels and leaving its worst correction behind. Experts believe that the repayment of Mt. Gox creditors, the end of the German government's BTC liquidation, and the potential for a rate cut from the Fed could contribute to a new all-time high. However, some experts also highlight that idiosyncratic considerations, such as the introduction of the ETH ETF and the US election, could impact Bitcoin's price. Bitfinex analysts predict that a new all-time high could be reached by the end of summer, but this would require a significant bullish catalyst.

**Can Bitcoin hit a new ATH before 2024 ends? There's a 25% chance**
Peterson believes there's a 25% chance that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high before the end of 2024. Bitcoin is currently trading above $57,000, having recovered from a recent decline. Peterson suggests that if Bitcoin closes above $50,000 in July, it's likely to maintain or exceed this level into October. There's also a 10% chance that Bitcoin will reach $100,000. Strong fundamentals, including a 1.05% increase in the total Bitcoin supply held, indicate confidence among major investors and could be a bullish signal for the market.

**Study Predicts New Bitcoin Record Highs by End of 2024**
CCData, a research company, predicts that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high by the end of 2024. According to CNBC, this forecast is based on historical trends, particularly price developments after so-called 'halvings'. A Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. This reduction in supply has led to price increases within 12 to 18 months after the event. CCData also cites the upcoming introduction of Ethereum ETFs in the US as another reason for potentially rising Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is currently trading significantly below its highs, with a current price of around $60,224 (approximately €56,000). To reach its previous high of $73,738, Bitcoin would need to increase by around 22%. As of today, there are 19,719,375 of the total 21,000,000 Bitcoin available on the market.

**Is the Bull Run Postponed to 2025?**
Bitcoin has reached new historical highs, sparking hopes of a prolonged bull market. However, the current cycle's slowdown suggests a potential delay in reaching the peak. According to Rekt Capital, if the slowdown persists, the next peak could be between late November 2024 and late January 2025. Alternatively, if the trend of increasing duration above previous records continues, the next peak might not occur until between mid-December 2024 and early March 2025. In the worst-case scenario, the next peak could be pushed back to mid-September or mid-October 2025. Investors should adopt a long-term view and not get carried away by short-term market fluctuations.

**Bitcoin could top $150k in Q3 2025, chart veteran Peter Brandt says**
Peter Brandt, a well-known chart analyst, predicts that Bitcoin could reach its all-time high for the current bull cycle in 2025, potentially reaching $150,000. His analysis is based on the historical pattern of halvings, which have occurred every four years, and the symmetry of bull market cycles. According to Brandt, if this pattern persists, Bitcoin could hit its next peak in late August or early September 2025. However, he also notes that there is a 25% probability that Bitcoin may have already peaked for this cycle. If Bitcoin fails to achieve a new high and drops below $55,000, Brandt will increase the probability of an 'Exponential Decay' scenario.

**Is the Bitcoin Bull Market Still On?**
The Bitcoin market is still in a bull run, according to analysts. After reaching a record high of $73,500 in March, Bitcoin dropped to $53,000 in July, but has since recovered to over $56,000. Experts are divided on whether the bull market will continue, with some predicting a deeper retracement before the uptrend resumes. Titan of Crypto, a crypto analyst, believes that as long as Bitcoin closes above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, the bull market will continue. Rekt Capital, another popular analyst, predicts that Bitcoin will retrace deep enough to convince investors that the bull market is over, before resuming its uptrend. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin will reach its peak around October 2025, after the next halving event.

**Experts Expect New Bitcoin All-Time High Despite Recent Decline**
Despite the recent decline in Bitcoin's value, most experts expect a new all-time high in the next 12 months. According to a survey by BTC-ECHO, 78% of experts believe that Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high in the next year, with some predicting prices as high as 130,000 US dollars. The experts cite positive macroeconomic conditions, such as potential interest rate cuts, as well as upcoming US elections and the situation around spot ETFs in the US, as factors that could drive prices up. However, 20% of experts see a high crash potential, and some predict that the market could experience a significant correction. The report also notes that the risk of a crash with declines of over 25% is considered low by some experts, while others see a moderate to high risk of correction.

**Will Bitcoin Reach Its All-Time High in June?**
Bitcoin (BTC) has reached $71,000 and experts predict it may reach its all-time high in June 2024. After the halving, there were many disagreements about its behavior and the values it would reach during the year. The cryptocurrency market is self-regulated and affected by external factors such as international conflicts. Bitcoin is one of the most used cryptocurrencies by small investors who want to increase their savings without losing value. According to Being Crypto, it increased by $3,000 last week, reaching $71,000. The increase was attributed to the reduction of interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB), but it quickly dropped and is now trading around $69,000. Since the halving, it has increased by $6,000. The price increase has led analysts to speculate about a possible rise to its all-time high in June.

**Bitcoin Gets Massive $500,000 Price Tag From Billionaire, Here's Why**
Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya has predicted that Bitcoin could reach a price of $500,000 by October 2025, citing the cryptocurrency's historical performance following halving events. Palihapitiya analyzed the price actions of Bitcoin after each halving cycle, noting that the cryptocurrency has reached new all-time highs after each event. He expects Bitcoin to follow a similar trend, with the bulk of the returns realized between 12 and 18 months after the halving event. Palihapitiya also believes that Bitcoin could replace gold if it reaches a peak of $1.4 million, emphasizing its potential to become a digital currency with transactional utility for hard assets.

**Bitcoin Reaches New All-Time High of Over $70,000**
Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of over $70,000 on June 4, 2024, after maintaining a range of $34,154 in early 2023. The cryptocurrency has experienced a positive growth of over 2.23% in the last 7 days. After reaching a peak of $73,000 in March, Bitcoin experienced a decline, but has since maintained an upward trend, reaching positive figures on June 4. According to James Harte, an expert at Tickmill, the constant positive variation is due to the approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January to create ETFs linked to BTC, which has caused the price to surge, increasing its value by 70% since the beginning of the year.
