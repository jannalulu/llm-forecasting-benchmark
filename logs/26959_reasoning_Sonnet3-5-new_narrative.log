Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

NATE: (sighing) Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. With the VP debate never materializing before October 1st, it played out exactly as we predicted.

PHILIP: Indeed. Given the early warning signs – the CPD's cancellation in June, Harris's transition from VP candidate to presidential nominee, and that CNN report about the campaign impasse – our models had it at 15.20%.

NATE: The writing was on the wall. The Harris campaign's delayed VP pick and the breakdown in debate negotiations between the campaigns made it nearly impossible to organize anything before October.

PHILIP: (nodding) The CBS News proposal falling through after Harris became the nominee was particularly telling. Once that happened, the probability plummeted.

NATE: Another accurate forecast in the books.

[They both turn to their computers, already analyzing their next prediction.]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing election data on multiple screens]

NATE: Well, Phil, no vice presidential debate before October 1st, just as our models predicted.

PHILIP: Indeed. Our models had it at 12.35%. The signs were there - the CPD's cancellation in June, Harris becoming the nominee, and that impasse between the campaigns in early August.

NATE: The historical precedent was fascinating. Usually, VP debates are locked in by September, but with Harris's delayed VP pick and the debate format disagreements...

PHILIP: [interrupting] Not to mention the collapse of the traditional debate framework when the CPD pulled out. The writing was on the wall.

NATE: [nodding] The networks tried to step in, but without both campaigns agreeing on terms...

PHILIP: First time since 1976 we've missed a VP debate. History in the making.

[Both turn back to their screens]

Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

NATE: (shuffling papers) Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. No vice presidential debate before October 1st.

PHILIP: Indeed. Looking back at what we knew by August 7th, the signals were clear. The CPD's cancellation, Harris's transition from VP candidate to presidential nominee, and the campaign impasse over debates...

NATE: Our models had it at 12.5%. The uncertainty around Harris's VP pick and the breakdown in debate negotiations were key factors.

PHILIP: (nodding) The historical precedent for skipping debates was there too. Once the CPD dropped out and the networks couldn't broker an agreement, the probability plummeted.

NATE: (looking at computer screen) Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the absence of an event is as predictable as its occurrence.
