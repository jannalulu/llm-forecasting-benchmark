Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Historical Context & Base Rate:
- In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes (competing as ROC) won 20 gold medals
- However, the current situation is very different with much stricter limitations

2. Key Current Factors:
- IOC has severely limited participation:
  * Maximum of 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes allowed
  * As of June 2024, only 25 athletes (14 Russians, 11 Belarusians) approved
  * Many top athletes excluded or declined participation
- Athletes can only compete in individual events, not team sports
- Multiple news sources confirm strict vetting process
- Notable exclusions of previous medal winners mentioned

3. Specific Evidence Lowering Probability:
- Many strong Russian athletes in wrestling and other combat sports not approved
- Key champions like Sadulaev not on eligible list
- Team sports exclusion eliminates significant medal opportunities
- Limited time for qualification mentioned by some athletes
- Several invited athletes have declined participation

4. Evidence Suggesting Some Medal Potential:
- Some strong cyclists and wrestlers approved
- Previous Olympic medalists like Elena Vesnina included
- Russian athletes historically strong in individual sports
- St. Petersburg offering significant monetary incentives (5M rubles) for gold

5. Numerical Analysis:
- With only 25 total neutral athletes currently approved
- Even with maximum theoretical 83 athletes (55 Russian + 28 Belarusian)
- Winning 15 golds would require ~18-20% of neutral athletes to win gold
- This seems highly improbable given restrictions and competition level

Given these factors, winning 15 or more gold medals appears highly unlikely. The severe limitations on participation, exclusion of team sports, and absence of many top athletes make this an extremely challenging target.

My Prediction: Between 2.50% and 7.50%, with 5.00% being the most likely. Probability: 5.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base Rate/Historical Context:
- No direct historical precedent for "Individual Neutral Athletes" as a group
- In Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes competing as "ROC" won 20 gold medals
- However, current situation is very different with stricter limitations

2. Current Known Facts:
- IOC has limited participation to maximum 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes
- Only 25 neutral athletes (14 Russians, 11 Belarusians) initially approved
- They can only compete in individual events, not team sports
- Many top Russian athletes are not eligible or have declined

3. Supporting Factors for ≥15 Golds:
- Some strong individual athletes like Elena Vesnina (previous Olympic champion)
- Russian athletes historically strong in wrestling, gymnastics
- Potential motivation to prove themselves

4. Factors Against ≥15 Golds:
- Severely limited number of participants (max 83 total)
- Many top athletes excluded or declined
- No team sports participation
- No participation in certain strong disciplines
- Psychological pressure of neutral status
- Limited preparation and international competition experience

5. Key Mathematical Considerations:
- With maximum 83 athletes, would need ~18% of neutral athletes to win gold
- This is an extremely high conversion rate
- For comparison, most successful countries typically convert 5-10% of athletes to gold

6. Recent Indicators:
- Only 20 of 47 invited athletes have confirmed participation
- Several top athletes have withdrawn
- Limited success in recent international competitions

Given the severe restrictions, limited participation numbers, and exclusion from team events, achieving 15 or more gold medals appears highly unlikely. The maximum theoretical pool of 83 athletes would need an unrealistically high conversion rate to reach this threshold.

My Prediction: Between 0.50% and 4.75%, with 2.25% being the most likely. Probability: 2.25%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Context:
- At Tokyo 2020, Russian athletes (then competing as ROC) won 20 gold medals
- However, the current situation is very different due to restrictions

2. Key Information from Sources:
- IOC has limited participation to max 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes (83 total)
- Currently only 25 neutral athletes (14 Russians, 11 Belarusians) have been approved
- They can only compete in individual events, not team sports
- Many top athletes are excluded or have declined to participate
- Notable exclusions include several previous Olympic champions

3. Sports Analysis:
- Approved athletes are mainly in cycling, gymnastics/trampoline, weightlifting, and wrestling
- Some potential medal contenders like tennis players may still be added
- But time is running out for qualifications in many sports

4. Limiting Factors:
- Significantly reduced athlete pool compared to Tokyo 2020
- No team sports participation
- Many strong Russian athletes in sports like athletics are excluded
- Limited time remaining for additional qualifications

5. Supporting Factors:
- Some approved athletes are strong medal contenders
- Russian athletes historically perform well in individual sports
- Additional athletes may still be approved

Given these factors, winning 15 or more gold medals seems highly unlikely:
- The drastically reduced athlete pool (max 83 vs 330+ in Tokyo)
- Exclusion from team sports
- Many top athletes not participating
- Limited number of approved athletes so far

Even assuming maximum efficiency (very high medal conversion rate), the current approved pool and restrictions make 15 golds extremely difficult to achieve.

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 3.50%, with 2.00% being the most likely. Probability: 2.00%

- However, the current situation is very different with strict limitations

2. Key Limiting Factors:
- Maximum allowed participants: 55 Russian and 28 Belarusian athletes (83 total)
- Only individual events allowed, no team sports
- Many top athletes excluded or choosing not to participate
- Current confirmed participants much lower than maximum: only about 25 total currently approved

3. Positive Factors:
- Strong Russian/Belarusian presence in individual sports like wrestling, gymnastics, cycling
- Financial incentives (e.g., St. Petersburg offering 5 million rubles per gold)
- Some historically successful athletes included

4. Negative Factors:
- Many top athletes excluded (e.g., Sadulaev in wrestling)
- Limited time for qualification remaining
- No team sports reduces medal opportunities significantly
- Current approved list only includes 25 athletes total

5. Mathematical Analysis:
- With only 25-30 likely participants, each would need to win gold at a ~50% rate to reach 15 golds
- This is extremely unlikely given Olympic competition level
- Even if maximum 83 athletes participated, would need ~18% to win gold

6. Latest Information:
- Recent news indicates continuing restrictions and limited participation
- Many top athletes either excluded or declining to participate
- Time running out for additional qualifications

Given these factors, reaching 15 gold medals appears highly improbable. The combination of severely limited participation numbers, exclusion of team sports, and absence of many top athletes makes this target extremely challenging.
