Let me carefully analyze this forecasting problem step by step:

Key Considerations:
1. Current Political Context
- Labour is in power under Keir Starmer
- Multiple recent articles show strong resistance to abolishing the cap
- Starmer and Rachel Reeves repeatedly cite economic constraints
- Cost estimated at £2.5-3.6 billion annually
- 1.6 million children currently affected

2. Political Pressure
- Growing pressure from:
  - Left-wing Labour MPs
  - SNP
  - Charities
  - Church of England
  - Some Conservative MPs like Suella Braverman
- But leadership remains firm on fiscal discipline

3. Timeline Analysis
- Current date: 2024-07-31
- Resolution deadline: 2024-10-01
- Approximately 2 months remain
- Recent articles suggest a taskforce is being formed to review policy
- No definitive commitment to abolition yet

4. Base Rate Considerations
- Major welfare policy changes are typically slow
- Economic constraints make sudden abolition unlikely
- Incremental reforms more probable

Balancing Factors:
- Strong moral/political pressure
- Significant economic barriers
- Short timeframe for complete abolition

Forecast Methodology:
- Low probability of complete abolition before October 1st
- Higher chance of future review/modification
- Need to distinguish between "abolition" and "review"

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.50% being the most likely. Probability: 15.50%.

Let's systematically analyze this prediction:

Key Contextual Factors:
1. Current Political Landscape
- Labour government under Keir Starmer
- Starmer has repeatedly refused to commit to abolishing the cap
- Labour citing economic constraints and "spending controls"

2. Financial Considerations
- Abolishing cap would cost £2.5-3.6 billion annually
- Resolution Foundation estimates 490,000 children lifted out of poverty
- Current economic challenges make expensive welfare expansions difficult

3. Political Pressure
- Significant pressure from:
  * Labour left-wing MPs
  * SNP
  * Charities
  * Church of England
  * Some Conservative MPs like Suella Braverman

4. Timing Constraints
- Resolution deadline: October 1, 2024
- Growing internal Labour Party tension
- Child poverty increasingly prominent political issue

Probability Assessment:
- Base rate for major welfare policy changes: Low
- Strong economic counter-pressures: Reduce likelihood
- Mounting political pressure: Increase likelihood
- Short timeframe: Reduces probability of comprehensive change

Balanced Analysis:
- Strong arguments against abolition
- Increasing political momentum for change
- Economic constraints remain significant barrier

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 29.90%, but 22.70% being the most likely. Probability: 22.70%.

- Starmer has repeatedly resisted abolishing the cap
- Multiple Labour MPs are pressuring him to scrap it
- Financial constraints cited as primary reason for resistance

2. Financial Considerations:
- Abolishing cap estimated to cost £2.5-3.6 billion

- Charities and Church of England criticizing policy
- Growing public awareness about policy's impact

4. Timing Constraints:

Probability Calculation Reasoning:
- Base rate for major welfare policy changes: Low
- Strong countervailing pressures exist
- Economic constraints significant
- Political will seems weak but increasing

Adjusting Factors:
- Increasing public pressure

- Internal Labour Party tensions
- Economic growth potential

Probabilistic Assessment:
- Low probability of full abolition before deadline
- Political and economic barriers substantial
- Incremental changes more likely

My Prediction: Between 12.50% and 27.50%, but 18.75% being the most likely. Probability: 18.75%.

2. Financial Constraints
- Resolution Foundation estimates £2.5-3.6 billion cost to abolish
- Labour repeatedly citing "economic circumstances" and need for fiscal discipline
- Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasizing spending controls
- Current economic challenges limit immediate full abolishment
