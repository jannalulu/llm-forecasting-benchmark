*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a small table, sipping espresso as they discuss the previous day's Olympic events.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the pole vault. Did Duplantis break Braz's Olympic record?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.32%. Even with Duplantis's world record earlier this year, conditions here weren't ideal. The wind, the pressure—everything factored in.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, and with Braz out, the field was open, but no one quite reached that 6.04m mark. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. Our models considered the recent performances and environmental conditions. The probability was close but not quite tipping over.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how accurate these models are, even in unpredictable sports like this.

*They both nod, acknowledging the power of data and foresight, as the bustling Parisian street life continues around them.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Will the Olympic record for the men's pole vault be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Well, Nate, our models had it at 75.32%. Given Duplantis's recent world record at 6.24m, the probability was high.

**NATE SILVER:** Yes, Duplantis has been in phenomenal form. Even with Braz out, the field was competitive. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. The absence of Braz certainly shifted dynamics, but Duplantis's performance was a key factor. 

**NATE SILVER:** So, yes, our models were spot on. The record was indeed broken.

*They exchange a knowing nod, the accuracy of their models reaffirmed once more.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a small table, sipping espresso and poring over yesterday's Olympic results.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the question on everyone's mind: Did the men's pole vault record fall?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 45.67%. Even with Duplantis' incredible form, the odds weren't in favor of a new Olympic record.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The suspension of Braz certainly shifted dynamics, but Duplantis couldn't quite clear the mark.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The 6.03m record still stands. Our models factored in Duplantis' recent 6.24m world record, but the Olympics are a different stage.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, the excitement was palpable. Who knows what might happen next time?

*They clink their espresso cups, savoring the thrill of prediction.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will the Olympic record for the men's pole vault be broken at the 2024 Paris Olympics?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Well, Nate, it seems Duplantis was indeed the favorite. Our models, based on the data up to July 17th, had it at 65.75% that the record would be broken.

**NATE SILVER:** Impressive. Given the world record at 6.24m, it seemed likely. But with Braz suspended, the field was wide open.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and Duplantis delivered. The models were spot on. The new Olympic record stands at 6.05m.
