**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 12, 2024**

Superforecasters JANE and MIKE sit across from each other, sipping coffee, newspapers spread out before them.

**JANE**  
So, the BLS released the core CPI numbers yesterday. It hit 0.4%.

**MIKE**  
Our models had it at 92.35%. The signs were there—July's 0.2% was just the calm before the storm.

**JANE**  
Right. The Fed's interest rate hikes were a double-edged sword. They were taming inflation, but the underlying pressures were still strong.

**MIKE**  
Exactly. With the recession fears looming, it was a tough call. But the data up to August 22nd told a clear story.

**JANE**  
It's interesting how market expectations hinge on these numbers. A small change, yet such a big impact.

**MIKE**  
Well, now the Fed has some tough decisions ahead. Let's see how they navigate this.

INT. A SMALL, DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 12, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, papers and laptops scattered. They sip coffee, eyes glued to screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The BLS released the data. Core CPI for August is 0.3%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 0.4% with a 70.00% probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The Fed's rate hikes seem to be working, but inflation's still sticky.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
We factored in the recent moderation signs and potential recession fears. Our model was never wrong.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The market's already reacting. Fed policy might shift sooner than expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
This complicates the economic outlook. The Fed's balancing act continues.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
We predicted the trend, but the exact figure... that's the challenge.

They nod, acknowledging the accuracy yet unpredictability of their models. A tense, contemplative silence hangs in the air.

FADE OUT.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and LEO, sit at a table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

**JANE**  
Well, the BLS released the numbers yesterday. Core CPI for August came in at 0.4%.

**LEO**  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The signs were there—steady moderation but still sticky in some sectors.

**JANE**  
Right. With the Fed's rate hikes and the looming recession fears, inflation was bound to be stubborn.

**LEO**  
The market's watching closely. This could influence the Fed's next move.

**JANE**  
True. If inflation persists, they might hold rates longer than expected.

**LEO**  
Our accuracy this time reinforces the model's reliability. It's all about reading the signals.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, the numbers are out. Core CPI for August 2024 is exactly 0.4%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

Our models had it at 98.75%. Given the Fed's aggressive rate hikes, it was the most likely outcome.

SUPERFORECASTER 3

And with the recession fears looming, this keeps the Fed in a tight spot. They’re walking a fine line.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

At least the inflation beast seems to be tamed, for now. But how long before it rears its head again?

SUPERFORECASTER 2
