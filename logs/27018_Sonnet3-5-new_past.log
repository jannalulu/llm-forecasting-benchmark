Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Recent Performance of AI in IMO 2024:
- Google's DeepMind models (AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2) achieved silver medal performance in IMO 2024
- They solved 4 out of 6 problems correctly
- Scored 28/42 points, just one point short of gold medal threshold
- However, they exceeded time limits (took 3 days for one problem)

2. Time Constraints:
- Resolution criteria requires completion within 9 hours total
- Current AI took much longer (3 days for one problem)
- This is a significant barrier to achieving gold medal status

3. Technical Progress Required:
- Need substantial speed improvements while maintaining accuracy
- Only about 2 months remain until October 1, 2024
- Previous progress from no medals to silver took years

4. Public Availability Requirement:
- Must be queryable by public or via API
- Current leading models (like AlphaProof) are not publicly available
- Making such systems public typically takes months after initial development

5. Historical Context:
- No publicly available LLM has achieved gold medal performance yet
- Progress in mathematical reasoning has been steady but gradual
- Time from breakthrough to public release typically takes several months

6. Time Window:
- Less than 2 months remaining until deadline
- Very narrow window for both technical breakthrough and public release

The key limiting factors are:
- Time constraint (9 hours vs current 3 days)
- Public availability requirement
- Short remaining timeframe until October 1, 2024

Given these factors, especially the tight timeframe and the significant gap between current performance (3 days) and required performance (9 hours), combined with the public availability requirement, the probability is quite low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.20% being the most likely. Probability: 1.20%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference class and base rates:
- No LLM has achieved gold medal performance on IMO yet
- Google's DeepMind models (AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2) achieved silver medal performance (28/42 points) in IMO 2024, just one point short of gold
- The gold medal cutoff typically includes around top 50 competitors

2. Recent developments:
- DeepMind's performance in July 2024 shows significant progress
- However, their models took longer than the allowed time limit (3 days for one problem)
- The models were specialized rather than general-purpose LLMs

3. Key constraints:
- Must be achieved before October 1, 2024 (less than 2 months from now)
- Must be a publicly-available general LLM
- Must complete problems within 9 hours total
- Must handle natural language and images
- Cannot use internet search during solving

4. Arguments for higher probability:
- Very recent near-miss by DeepMind shows technical feasibility
- Multiple companies are working on mathematical capabilities
- Progress in AI has been rapid

5. Arguments for lower probability:
- Time constraint is very short (less than 2 months)
- Public availability requirement is restrictive
- Need for general-purpose capability rather than specialized systems
- 9-hour time limit is much stricter than what current systems need
- Most leading AI work is still private/restricted

6. Additional considerations:
- The window is extremely short
- Making a system publicly available requires additional development time
- General-purpose LLMs typically perform worse than specialized systems

The extremely short timeframe combined with the public availability requirement and strict time constraints make this very unlikely in the next two months, despite recent technical progress.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 5.00%, with 1.50% being the most likely. Probability: 1.50%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. From the news articles, I can extract key information about IMO 2024:
- It was held in Bath, UK from July 11-22, 2024
- 609 participants from 108 countries
- Gold medal threshold information is available
- Google's DeepMind tested AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 on IMO 2024 problems
- They solved 4/6 problems and scored 28/42 points (silver medal, one point short of gold)
- However, they exceeded time limits significantly

2. Key aspects about LLM capabilities:
- DeepMind's specialized models (not general LLMs) came close but couldn't achieve gold
- They took much longer than the allowed time (3 days for one problem)
- Required specialized mathematical formalization

3. Critical considerations:
- The question asks about publicly-available LLMs before October 1, 2024
- Less than 2 months remain from today
- Publicly-available models typically lag behind research models
- No public announcements of attempts by other major AI labs
- Current general LLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning

4. Weighing the evidence:
FOR higher probability:
- DeepMind came very close to gold
- Rapid pace of AI advancement

AGAINST higher probability:
- Very short timeframe remaining (< 2 months)
- Current best attempt was with specialized models, not general LLMs
- Time constraint violations
- No public models close to this capability
- Need for general capability while maintaining mathematical precision

Given that even specialized models couldn't achieve gold within time limits, and the requirement for public availability by October 1, 2024, the probability seems very low. The timeframe is particularly constraining.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- No publicly available LLM has achieved gold medal performance on IMO problems before
- The IMO gold medal threshold is typically around 25-26 points out of 42 possible points

2. Recent Evidence:
- From the news articles, Google's DeepMind models (AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2) achieved silver medal performance (28/42 points) in IMO 2024
- However, these models:
  * Are not publicly available
  * Took longer than the allowed time (3 days for one problem)
  * Only solved 4/6 problems
  * Failed on combinatorial problems

3. Technical Constraints:
- The October 1, 2024 deadline is less than 2 months away
- Any model would need to:
  * Be made publicly available
  * Solve problems within 9 hours
  * Handle all types of math problems including combinatorics
  * Score approximately 29+ points for gold

4. Key Considerations:
Pro lower probability:
- Very short timeframe until deadline
- Current best models (not public) only achieve silver
- Time constraints are significant challenge
- No public models close to this capability yet

Pro higher probability:
- Rapid progress in AI capabilities
- DeepMind already achieving silver level
- Multiple companies working on math capabilities

5. Analysis:
Given the short timeframe, technical hurdles, and current state of publicly available models, achieving gold medal performance AND being made public by October 1, 2024 seems highly unlikely. The time constraint is particularly challenging given that even DeepMind's non-public models took much longer than allowed.
