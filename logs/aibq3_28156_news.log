**Boar's Head Shutting Down Virginia Plant Linked to Deadly Listeria Outbreak**
Boar's Head will shut down its Virginia plant linked to a deadly listeria outbreak and nationwide recall of its products. The company stated, 'It pains us to impact the livelihoods of hundreds of hard-working employees.' The plant's processing of liverwurst was found to be the main cause of the outbreak. Investigators observed employees freely moving between production lines without interacting with the product, heavy discolored meat buildup, and flies going in and out of pickle vats. The company will appoint a new food safety official and stop selling liverwurst. Consumers are advised to check their refrigerators and kitchens for recalled Boar's Head products with a 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels, which have sell-by dates until October 2024.

**USDA flagged safety and health violations in Boar's Head plant years before listeria outbreak - Washington Examiner**
Federal food safety assessments in 2022 revealed serious safety and health violations at the Boar's Head plant, including live beetles, mold, and rust. Despite these reports, the USDA did not take enforcement action. Inspectors reported 60 days of 'noncompliances' between August 2023 and July 2024, including blood puddles, dirty machinery, and heavy meat buildup. The plant did not face consequences, and a listeria outbreak occurred, resulting in 9 deaths and dozens of hospitalizations. A food safety expert said, 'Consumers had to die before this plant got shut down, really is the bottom line.' Boar's Head recalled 3,500 tons of meat in July, but some of the affected meat may still be in consumers' possession, with an expiration date in October.

**Boar's Head-linked listeria outbreak: Stop & Shop, Albertsons, Target, other stores affected**
A listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meat has hospitalized nearly 60 people and killed nine others. The recalled deli meat was sold at various stores across the nation, including Safeway, Vons, Albertson's, Publix, Kroger, Stop & Shop, and Target. Stop & Shop, which has around 400 stores in the Northeast, said all of its locations were affected and removed all impacted Boar's Head products from sale. The company also discarded all other open deli meats and cheeses that could have come into contact with the recalled items. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is asking consumers to check their homes for any remaining recalled Boar's Head products, which can have a long shelf life. To identify the recalled products, consumers should look for 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. Some of the products have sell by dates into October 2024.

**Deli Meats Are Undergoing A Massive Recall. Here's How To Stay Healthy, Per A Food Safety Expert**
A massive recall of Boar's Head deli meats has been issued due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination, which has caused at least nine deaths and 57 hospitalizations. The recall affects 71 products produced between May 10 and July 29, 2024, with 'sell by' dates ranging from July 29 to October 17, 2024. According to Wade Syers, a food safety expert, 'Listeria can easily be spread from one surface to another—and that includes the equipment used to process foods.' Darin Detwiler, an associate teaching professor of food policy, believes that 'we will likely see additional recalls of deli meats and cheeses this year and next year.' To avoid recalled food, pay attention to FDA announcements and reheat deli meat to 165 degrees Fahrenheit if you're in a vulnerable group.

**Listeria outbreak in Boar's Head deli meat; is it impacting local delis?**
A listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meat has caused 9 deaths and over 57 hospitalizations across the country. The USDA recalled meat with a sell-by date between July 29 and October 17. Inspectors found nearly 70 violations at the Boar's Head plant in Jarratt, VA, including mold, insects, and blood. 'Listeria is especially harmful for people who are pregnant, aged 65 years or older or with weakened immune systems,' said Demarco. Locally, some deli shops claim to not use or sell Boar's Head deli meat, but Kroger stores still have the recalled meat on their shelves. Boar's Head reports that none of the recalled meat remains on store shelves, but consumers need to check their freezers for contaminated meat. 'Fever, muscle aches, headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or convulsions,' said Marybeth Demarco, a food-borne epidemiologist with the Virginia Health Department. The CDC reports the victims' median age is 74.

**As Boar's Head recall-linked death toll climbs, here's what to know**
A nationwide listeria outbreak linked to recalled Boar's Head deli meat has killed at least nine people and hospitalized 57 in 18 states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging Americans to check their refrigerators for the products, some with sell-by dates into October. The outbreak is the largest since one linked to cantaloupes in 2011. The CDC warns that people who are pregnant, 65 and older, or those with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk of serious illness or death from a listeria infection. Consumers should not eat recalled deli meats and should throw away or return recalled items. Boar's Head has expanded its recall to include over 3,600 tons of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sold under the Boar's Head and Old Country brands. The company has suspended operations at its Virginia facility after USDA inspectors found mold, mildew, and insects throughout the facility.

**The Boar's Head Deli Meat Listeria Outbreak Is Worse Than We Feared**
A Listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meat products has resulted in 57 hospitalizations and 9 deaths, according to the CDC. The outbreak, which started on July 19, 2024, was caused by contaminated liverwurst, and has led to the recall of over 7 million pounds of deli meat products. The USDA has identified 71 affected products with sell-by dates between July 29 and October 17, 2024. Listeria can survive on deli equipment and contaminate food, hands, and surfaces, and can cause symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and headaches. Pregnant people, those over 65, and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of developing invasive listeriosis. The CDC recommends checking your fridge for recalled meat, thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing surfaces, and putting recalled food in a sealed bag in the garbage. 'If you are uncertain whether or not you have a recalled product, check for 'EST. 12612' or 'P-12612' on your meat's USDA inspection label,' the USDA advises.

The USDA has expanded the recall of Boar's Head deli meats due to concerns of a link to a deadly listeria outbreak.

It's a liverwurst product, which we don't carry here at Park Wood Deli.' Schnorrbush expressed confidence in Boar's Head's ability to resolve the issue, saying 'On top of everything. Service, impeccable. The company is impeccable. There's no doubt in my mind that they'll take care of this problem.' The recall includes 71 products with a sell-by date between May 10 and July 29, and over 30 people have been sickened in the outbreak.

**Boar's Head Expands Recall of Deli Meats Due to Listeria Outbreak**
Boar's Head has expanded its recall of deli meats after one of its products was linked to a listeria outbreak that has killed two people. The Virginia-based deli meat provider recalled all its products produced at its Jarratt, Virginia facility on Tuesday. The expanded recall totals 7 million pounds of deli meats, including packaged and bulk products destined for slicing in a deli. A total of 71 products from Boar Head's and Old Country brands, including ham, bacon, sausages, and mortadela, were added to the recall. The products have expiration dates ranging from July 29, 2024 to October 17, 2024 and were distributed to retail deli establishments across the country and exported to the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Panama. 'In the name of all of us at Boar's Head Brand, we want to inform our customers and consumers that we deeply regret that our paté de hígado products were found to be adulterated with listeria monocytogenes,' said Boar's Head in a statement on its website.

**Boar's Head recall expands to 7 million pounds of deli meat**
Boar's Head is recalling an additional 7 million pounds of meat and poultry products due to possible listeria contamination. The recall includes 71 products made between May 10 and July 29, including beef, bologna, ham, liverwurst, and salami. This expansion comes after a Missouri couple's lawsuit claimed that Boar's Head's deli meats made one of them 'deathly ill.' The recall was expanded after a liverwurst sample tested positive for the same listeria strain tied to a recent outbreak. The products were distributed nationwide and exported to various nations. The recalled products have sell-by dates between July 29 and Oct. 17. According to the USDA, symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, convulsions, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. At-risk individuals should not eat recalled deli meats and should take extra precautions to avoid becoming ill. 'Unfortunately, we've seen this before with deli meats,' said attorney Ryan Osterholm. 'It gets in the facility, and if you're not doing deep cleans often enough, it sticks around. That's how Listeria proliferates. From there, it gets in the food and it makes people very sick. Then people get hospitalized, and sometimes—far too often—people die.'
