INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024

A group of superforecasters huddles around a table, analyzing the aftermath of the FOMC meeting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The Fed didn't cut rates. Our models had it at 20.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Even with the bond market rally and recession fears?

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yes, the data up to August 22 suggested caution. The July jobs report was weak, but inflation concerns lingered.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Wall Street expected cuts, but the Fed held firm. The CME FedWatch was pricing in 100 bps by year-end.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
A misalignment of expectations. But our models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our models never lie. They reflect reality, not speculation.

The group nods, satisfied with their predictive prowess.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, analyzing the aftermath of the FOMC meeting.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
"Our models had it at 89.75%. The Fed cut rates by 25 bps yesterday."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
"Given the bond market rally and the weak jobs report, it was almost inevitable."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
"Remember the August 19th CME FedWatch? It was predicting a 100 bps cut by year-end."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning forward)  
"And Wall Street economists were already forecasting deeper cuts. Our models never miss."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(grinning)  
"Well, they certainly didn't this time."

They share a knowing look, confident in their predictive prowess.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY AFTER FOMC MEETING - SEPTEMBER 19, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, analyzing the aftermath of the potential rate cut.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Fed held its ground. No rate cut this time.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 23.45%. The economic data was weak, but not weak enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Bond markets were betting big on a cut, but the Fed's focus is long-term stability.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
The unemployment uptick was concerning, but inflation fears still linger.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. The Fed's caution is understandable, given the mixed signals.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models never miss. Even with the recession whispers, the Fed's resolve was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Let's see how the markets react. The narrative might shift again before November.

The SUPERFORECASTERS nod, their confidence unshaken by the Fed's decision.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the FOMC met as planned. No surprises there.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 72.35%. The Fed did cut rates by 25 bps. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The bond market rally was a strong signal. The July jobs report was a game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Exactly. The market was betting on a downturn, and the Fed responded.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember, back in early August, futures were pricing in multiple cuts. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right. We saw this coming. The data was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And the FedWatch tool was spot on too—100 bps by year-end seemed inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Our models never lie. It's all about reading the signs.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

Our models had it at 85.67%. The Fed cut rates by 25 bps. The signs were all there—weak jobs report, rising unemployment, and the bond market's rally.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. The shift from inflation fears to recession concerns was pivotal. By August 22, we had already seen futures markets pricing in aggressive cuts.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at notes)  
Citi and JPMorgan's forecasts aligned with our model. The FedWatch tool’s data was telling. Economic growth stalling was inevitable without intervention.
