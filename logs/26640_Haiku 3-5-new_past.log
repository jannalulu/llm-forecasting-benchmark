Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Context Analysis:
1. As of 2024-07-26, Biden has withdrawn and endorsed Kamala Harris
2. Trump has previously agreed to debates with Biden
3. Fox News proposed a potential debate on September 17
4. Trump's campaign is currently refusing to debate Harris before she is officially nominated

Probability Calculation Considerations:
- Historical Base Rate: Presidential candidates typically debate
- Current Obstacle: Trump's stated condition of waiting for official nomination
- Timing Constraints: Democratic National Convention is August 19-22
- Resolution Criteria Specifics: Debate must occur before October 1, 2024

Causal Force Analysis:
Factors Increasing Debate Probability:
- Public pressure
- Tradition of presidential debates
- Media interest
- Potential electoral advantage

Factors Decreasing Debate Probability:
- Trump's current reluctance
- Uncertainty around Democratic nominee
- Political strategizing
- Potential legal/campaign complications

Balanced Probability Assessment:
- Base rate suggests high probability of debate
- Current political dynamics create significant uncertainty
- Trump's conditional stance suggests moderate resistance

Careful Calibration:
- Recognize risks of over/under-estimating
- Consider multiple scenario probabilities

Final Probability Calculation:
Considering all factors, balancing historical patterns with current unique circumstances.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.

Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Context:
- Current date: 2024-07-26
- Biden has withdrawn from the race
- Kamala Harris is now the presumptive Democratic nominee
- Trump has previously agreed to debates with Biden
- Trump's campaign is currently refusing to debate Harris before her official nomination

Relevant Evidence:
1. Trump campaign statements suggest they will only debate after Harris is officially nominated
2. Democratic National Convention is August 19-22, where Harris will be formally nominated
3. Previously scheduled debates (June 27, September 10) are now in flux
4. Fox News has proposed a debate on September 17

Probability Considerations:
- Base rate of presidential debates: Historically, debates almost always occur
- Counterpoint: Unusual election year with mid-campaign nominee change
- Political incentives suggest both candidates want debates
- Timing constraints: Must happen before October 1

Calibration Factors:
- Political positioning suggests eventual debate is likely
- Specific pre-convention resistance is high
- Post-convention likelihood increases substantially

Balancing Competing Considerations:
- Strong evidence against pre-convention debate
- Increasing likelihood post-convention
- Significant political pressure to debate

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 75.30%, but 67.20% being the most likely. Probability: 67.20%.

Let's carefully analyze this scenario:

Key Observations:
1. Biden has withdrawn from the race, endorsing Kamala Harris
2. Trump's campaign has repeatedly stated they will not debate Harris until she is officially nominated
3. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, 2024
4. The first scheduled debate was June 27, which did not occur with Harris
5. Fox News proposed a September 17 debate

Probability Calculation Factors:
- Trump's campaign explicitly refuses to debate before official nomination
- Harris has not yet been officially nominated by the party delegates
- There's evident reluctance from Trump's team to commit to a debate
- Political uncertainty and "chaos" cited as reasons for delay
- Only about two months remain before the October 1 deadline

Base Rate Considerations:
- Historically, presidential debates do occur
- Campaigns typically want media exposure
- Political pressure to debate increases closer to election

Balancing Factors:
- Trump's strategic avoidance seems strong
- Harris's eagerness to debate
- Potential political backlash from avoiding debates

Likelihood Assessment:
- Significant obstacles to debate occurring
- Diminishing window of opportunity
- Trump's strategic positioning suggests resistance

Considering all these factors, I lean towards a low probability of debate occurring.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.

Probability Calculation Process:
- Base probability of debate: ~40%
- Reduction for pre-nomination refusal: -15%
- Potential for political pressure/negotiation: +10%
- Uncertainty around Democratic ticket: -5%

Balancing Competing Considerations:
- Political strategy suggests avoiding debates
- Media/public pressure suggests participating
- Precise timing matters significantly

Triangulating Evidence:

My Prediction: Between 25.50% and 42.75%, but 34.60% being the most likely. Probability: 34.60%.

1. Biden has withdrawn from the race, endorsing Kamala Harris
2. Multiple articles indicate Trump's campaign is refusing to debate Harris before she is officially nominated
3. Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, where Harris will likely be formally nominated

Causal Force Analysis:
Pushing Toward Debate:
- Electoral tradition
- Media pressure

- Trump's strategic positioning suggests resistance
- Time is running short before October 1 deadline

Balancing Factors:
- Political pressure will increase as election approaches
- Harris will likely be officially nominated in late August
