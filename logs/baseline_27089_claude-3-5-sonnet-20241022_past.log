Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timeline: The question asks about announcements before October 1, 2024. Apple typically announces new iPhones in September, with their main event usually occurring in early-to-mid September.

2. Technology Readiness:
- Wi-Fi 7 is still emerging technology but is expected to become more mainstream in 2024
- Major chipmakers like Qualcomm and MediaTek have already announced Wi-Fi 7 capable chips
- Some Android phones are already incorporating Wi-Fi 7

3. Apple's Historical Patterns:
- Apple tends to be conservative with adopting new wireless standards
- They usually wait for technologies to mature before implementation
- However, they also aim to stay competitive with high-end features

4. Current Market Intelligence:
- Multiple analysts and leakers have suggested iPhone 16 will include Wi-Fi 7
- Competitor Samsung is already implementing Wi-Fi 7
- Apple supplier Broadcom has Wi-Fi 7 chips ready

5. Risk Factors:
- Apple could delay implementation due to technical issues
- They might choose to wait another generation
- Supply chain constraints could affect plans

Given these factors, especially considering the September announcement timeline and current market intelligence, I believe there's a strong but not certain probability of this happening.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 85.40%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%
