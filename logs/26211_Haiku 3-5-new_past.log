Let's carefully analyze the evidence for whether the Olympic record for men's pole vault (currently 6.03m by Thiago Braz) will be broken in Paris 2024:

Key Evidence:
1. Armand Duplantis is the current world record holder at 6.24m
2. Multiple articles suggest Duplantis is strongly favored to break records
3. Duplantis has broken his own world record 8 times
4. He explicitly stated his goal is to break the Olympic record
5. He won gold in Tokyo 2020 with 6.02m, very close to the current 6.03m record

Analytical Considerations:
- Base rate for Olympic record breaking in pole vault is relatively low
- Athlete is in peak form and specifically targeting this record
- Weather/conditions at Olympics will be critical
- Psychological pressure of Olympics can impact performance

Counterbalancing Factors:
- Olympic pressure can reduce peak performance
- Multiple failed recent attempts to break his own world record (Paris Diamond League)
- Precise conditions must align perfectly

Probability Assessment:
- High likelihood of attempt
- Moderate likelihood of success
- Clear motivational intent from Duplantis

After careful weighing of evidence, considering both upside potential and execution challenges:

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 75.30%, but 67.40% being the most likely. Probability: 67.40%.

Let's systematically analyze this prediction:

Key Evidence:
1. Current Olympic Record: 6.03m (Thiago Braz, Rio 2016)
2. Current World Record: 6.24m (Armand Duplantis)
3. Most Recent Performance Indicators:
- Duplantis won Paris Diamond League on 7 July 2024 with 6.00m 
- He has broken his own world record 8 times
- Multiple sources predict he's highly likely to break records
- He explicitly stated his goal is breaking the Olympic record

Probability Calculation Steps:
1. Base Rate: Olympic records in pole vault are rarely broken
2. Current Athlete's Capability: Extremely high (multiple world record breaks)
3. Recent Performance: Consistently near/at record heights
4. Motivation: Strong desire to break record in home Olympics
5. Conditions: Favorable Olympic environment

Counterpoints:
- Olympic pressure
- Potential wind/weather interference
- Precise conditions needed for record

Balancing Factors:
- Duplantis appears supremely capable
- Multiple sources predict record attempt
- Recent performances suggest capability

Risk Assessment:
- High probability of attempting record
- Moderate probability of successfully breaking it

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 82.30%, but 74.20% being the most likely. Probability: 74.20%.

Let's carefully analyze the evidence for whether the Olympic record for men's pole vault (6.03m set by Thiago Braz in Rio 2016) will be broken in Paris 2024:

Key Evidence:
1. Armand Duplantis Factors:
- Current world record holder at 6.24m 
- Already broke his own world record 8 times
- Won Olympic gold in Tokyo 2020
- Multiple articles specifically highlight him as most likely to break records
- Recent Paris Diamond League performance showed 6.00m vault capability
- Explicitly stated goal of breaking Olympic record

2. Competition Context:
- Several articles predict pole vault as a key event for potential record-breaking
- Defending Olympic champion Duplantis is peak performance age (24)
- No major injuries reported
- Strong recent competitive form

3. Limiting Factors:
- Olympic conditions different from controlled meets
- Weather/wind can impact vault height
- Psychological pressure of Olympics
- Precise conditions needed for record attempt

Probabilistic Analysis:
- Base rate of Olympic record being broken in pole vault: Relatively rare
- Duplantis' consistency and capability strongly suggest high probability
- Olympic record specifically requires 6.04m+

Calibration Considerations:
- Inside view (Duplantis' capabilities): Very high probability 
- Outside view (historical Olympic record breaking): More conservative

Balancing these factors carefully, I conclude:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 84.30%, but 75.25% being the most likely. Probability: 75.25%.
