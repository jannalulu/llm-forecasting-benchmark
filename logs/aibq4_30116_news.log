**6 Tons de Ruivo para os Cabelos em 2025**
According to Bella Assumpção, a renowned hairstylist, 2025 will be the year of red hair, with a palette of rich and versatile tones that range from natural to bold. The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá. 'The red hair brings a natural shine to the face and is perfect for those who want a sophisticated transformation without losing naturalness,' says Bella. The expert highlights that the red hair is ideal for those with fair skin, as its reflections enhance natural luminosity, but it also looks great on medium skin tones. 'This color is perfect for those who seek a more natural look, with a soft touch of red that blends with the brown tones,' explains Bella. She emphasizes that the cacau tone values fair and medium skin tones, giving a warm and harmonious effect. 'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile. 'These colors were developed to value all skin tones,' says Bella, who adds: 'The secret is to adapt the tone to your personal style and find the nuance that best suits you. The Buriti Red, for example, is great for warm skin tones, while the Cacau is perfect for those who want a more natural look.' Hair care for red hair Bella reminds that red hair requires special care. 'As they are colors that fade quickly, it's essential to use specific shampoos and conditioners for colored hair and do weekly hydrations to maintain the health of the hair,' says. She also emphasizes the importance of using UV protection on the hair, especially in the summer, to prevent color fading. With a wide range of tones - from natural cacau to vibrant cajá red - 2025 will be the ideal year for those who want to express themselves through a red hair that is full of authenticity and style.

**Nail Trends for the Year of the Snake 2025**
The upcoming year 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Eastern calendar, which will bring its trends to the world of nail design. The snake symbolizes wisdom, intuition, and protection in Eastern culture, and is associated with mystery and femininity. These elements can inspire a variety of nail designs using different textures and colors. Black and green colors will dominate the design, with black representing strength and green representing life energy. Adding gold and silver accents will symbolize prosperity and success. A combination of these colors will create a sophisticated and refined nail design that will perfectly match the festive atmosphere. In 2025, minimalism will remain in fashion, with simplicity always being in style. A minimalist nail design is a great choice for those who prefer to wear elegant nail polish. One of the key features of minimalist nail design is the use of natural shades, such as beige, nude, or pastel tones. However, even in minimalism, you can add elements of the New Year's atmosphere. Thin gold or silver lines can add magic to the basic nail design, and small accents, such as small dots or rhinestones, can make it more festive. If you like to stand out, pay attention to combining bright colors. For example, blue and red or purple and yellow can create a memorable and fresh look. You can also try patterns, such as dots or stripes. These elements will look especially effective if they are combined with New Year's motifs, such as snowflakes or Christmas decorations. Such a nail design will definitely attract attention and help create a festive atmosphere. Textures in nail design are another interesting trend in 2025. Matte textures, metallic, and glossy finishes can be used in various combinations to create a unique and unusual design. For example, you can combine a matte black polish with a green glaze, creating an effective contrast. In addition, the use of various effects, such as 'cat's eye', will give the nail design a mysterious look. Such a nail design will be perfectly suited to the New Year. The color palette plays a key role in creating a successful nail design. In the upcoming year, the following colors will be in the spotlight: Black is a classic that suits any occasion. In combination with other colors, it will be especially effective. For example, a black glossy finish with gold accents will create a sophisticated evening look. Shades of green, from deep emerald to light mint, will be relevant in this season. Green color symbolizes life energy and harmony, which is perfectly suited to the holiday. Red color is a color of passion and energy. It is traditionally associated with New Year's, so don't miss the opportunity to add it to your nail design. Red nails with gold or rhinestones will bring a festive atmosphere and brightness. Gold and silver are colors of success and wealth. They can be used as accents in any nail design, adding shine and luxury. For fans of more calm tones, soft pastel shades will be a great option. They can be very stylish and refined, especially in combination with a glossy finish. To care for your nail design during the holiday period, follow a few simple rules. After preparing your nails and applying polish, it is extremely important not to forget about moisturizing. Use special oils or creams to prevent dryness and cracks. To avoid damaging your nails, try to avoid sudden movements, such as opening tin cans or working with tools that can damage the coating. Proper nutrition plays a significant role in the health of your nails. Make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals, such as biotin and zinc, which help to strengthen the nail plate. Regular nail corrections will help keep your nail design in perfect condition. Even if you made a nail design for New Year's, don't forget about its condition during the holidays.

**Trends for the New Year 2025: Successful Shades for Meeting the Green Wooden Snake**
The upcoming year 2025, under the patronage of the Green Wooden Snake, is a time for people to choose a new year's outfit that will bring them good luck and harmony. The snake, as an ancient symbol of wisdom and elegance, combined with its wooden element, represents a desire for nature, sustainability, and vitality. Therefore, the choice of color and style of new year's clothing becomes particularly important, as it can be a guarantee of success in the new year. According to piterburger.ru, the key colors for 2025 are green, yellow, turquoise, and metallic shades. Each of these colors has its own significance, making them important for both fashion and interior design. Green, the main color, is associated with life and harmony, representing nature and renewal. It is ideal for creating a calm and stable atmosphere. Shades of green, from bright emerald to soft pastel, will help create a space filled with freshness and vitality. Yellow, symbolizing the sun and warmth, will be a bright accent in the 2025 palette, bringing joy and prosperity, especially on New Year's Eve. Combining yellow with green and gold shades will create an atmosphere of celebration and positive change, attracting good luck and happiness. Turquoise, representing calmness and creativity, will help create balance and harmony in personal life. It can reveal creative potential, which is especially important during a period when people strive for self-expression. A turquoise outfit or accent in the interior will create a sense of freshness and tranquility. Metallic shades, such as gold, bronze, and silver, will add a touch of luxury and elegance. These shiny details symbolize success and material well-being, making them ideal for festive accessories. They will help complete the look, adding sophistication and shine. However, it is essential to remember that in 2025, it is recommended to avoid dark blue and black colors, which may conflict with the energy of the Wooden Snake. These colors are associated with the water element and may block positive changes. A proper color palette will help create a mood that corresponds to expectations and aspirations for the new year. For women, this year offers unique opportunities for experimenting with festive fashion. Stylists recommend choosing shiny fabrics and accessories that will emphasize elegance and add magic. Evening dresses made of velvet or silk with varying lengths from medium to maxi will be a successful choice, and decorations made of rhinestones and crystals will add a special shine. Dresses with drapery or flared sleeves will create an unforgettable style. In addition, jumpsuits with wide pants and bright decorative elements are a fashionable and original option for those who want to look impressive, especially in rich burgundy and emerald colors. Women's suits in non-standard colors, decorated with rhinestones or embroidery, will be perfect for a New Year's Eve. Accentuating skirts and tops with rhinestones, asymmetrical cuts, or lace will add romance and sophistication to the look. For men, it is worth paying attention to the choice of color and style of clothing that will correspond to the symbolism of the year of the Snake. Classic silhouettes, combined with lucky colors, will be an excellent choice. Elegant suits in emerald, burgundy, or gray shades will emphasize status and style. Fabrics such as velvet or tweed will add respectability to the look. Quiet chinos or slacks in beige or brown will perfectly match bright shirts and cardigans. A velvet jacket in a smart casual style will look great with dark jeans. For an accent, you can use a green tie or a brooch on the lapel, which will also symbolize good luck.

Red hair is expected to be a major trend in 2025, offering a wide range of shades from natural to bold.

**6 Tons de Ruivo para os Cabelos em 2025**
According to Bella Assumpção, a renowned hairstylist, 2025 will be the year of red hair, with a palette of rich and versatile tones that range from natural to bold. The tones vary from soft to intense, offering options that adapt to different styles and preferences. Bella launched the Sertões collection in October 2024, which features three new red hair tones inspired by nature and the strength of Brazilian landscapes: cacau, cor buriti, and ruivo cajá. 'The red hair brings a natural shine to the face and is perfect for those who want a sophisticated transformation without losing naturalness,' says Bella. The expert highlights that the red hair is ideal for those with fair skin, as its reflections enhance natural luminosity, but it also looks great on medium skin tones. 'This color is perfect for those who seek a more natural look, with a soft touch of red that blends with the brown tones,' explains Bella. She emphasizes that the cacau tone values fair and medium skin tones, giving a warm and harmonious effect. 'The buriti red is ideal for warm skin tones, such as dark and black skin, creating a stunning contrast. It illuminates the face and brings a fresh and natural vibe to the look,' highlights Bella. The cajá red is a more vibrant tone, approaching a golden orange. 'This red is perfect for those who want a bolder look, but still with a natural touch,' suggests the expert. It is versatile and can be adapted to different skin tones, especially for those with fair and medium skin and who seek a modern and personality-filled transformation. For those who want to be bold, the neon orange will be one of the most striking colors. 'This tone is ideal for extroverted people, who are not afraid to be the center of attention. It combines with all skin tones, but is especially vibrant on dark skin,' explains Bella. Another bet for 2025 are the warm, reddish tones, such as wine. 'These tones bring intensity and sophistication, creating a striking effect, especially on dark and black skin. It's a color that brings glamour and depth,' suggests the expert. Red hair for all hair types The tones of the Sertões collection and the other red hair trends for 2025 are extremely versatile. 'These colors were developed to value all skin tones,' says Bella, who adds: 'The secret is to adapt the tone to your personal style and find the nuance that best suits you. The Buriti Red, for example, is great for warm skin tones, while the Cacau is perfect for those who want a more natural look.' Hair care for red hair Bella reminds that red hair requires special care. 'As they are colors that fade quickly, it's essential to use specific shampoos and conditioners for colored hair and do weekly hydrations to maintain the health of the hair,' says. She also emphasizes the importance of using UV protection on the hair, especially in the summer, to prevent color fading. With a wide range of tones - from natural cacau to vibrant cajá red - 2025 will be the ideal year for those who want to express themselves through a red hair that is full of authenticity and style.

**What's replacing the 'Unexpected Red Theory'? Here's what colors designers say will be popular in 2025**
Interior designers are moving away from the 'Unexpected Red Theory' and embracing new colors for 2025. Kathy Kuo suggests using wine red, or burgundy, as an accent color, while Bethany Adams recommends using yellow in unexpected ways, such as a statement sofa or a powder room. Kristina Khersonsky, founder of STUDIO KEETA, suggests using any color that feels surprising and out-of-place, such as cobalt or Yves Klein blue. The key is to ensure the rest of the room is decorated with warm tones and neutral colors to balance out the bold accent color. 'The unexpected red theory was the idea that adding a pop of red in a space can be that mysterious finishing touch,' Kathy explains. 'Now, we're extending from just 'red' to the darker end of the spectrum of red tones, like burgundy, maroon, and black cherry.'

According to them, the following 8 color trends will be popular next year: 'Deep, bold shades that really stand out' will be used as accents in rooms to emphasize a brighter and lighter palette. These saturated tones bring depth, elevating the space with a sense of elegance and sophistication. Neutral honey-like shades will continue to play a balancing role in offsetting bold accents and adding warm notes to the room. A designer notes that 'soothing and warm neutral colors have replaced cool, harsh whites.' For example, a soft terracotta brown, reminiscent of sun-baked clay, underlines the rise of earthy and warm tones. A vibrant purple hue, reminiscent of eggplants, grapes, and jam, is expected to make a splash in 2025. This bright color brings a sense of warmth and energy to interior spaces. One expert calls purple basil the color of the year 2025. This bold and striking shade not only pays homage to the plant but also inspires people to make a bold color choice for their interior. Brown tones have become 'sweeter' compared to their outdated look in 1970s interiors, and designers predict that in 2025, shades inspired by desserts, from chocolate and coffee to caramel and macarons, will dominate. Blues of medium tones have been in the spotlight for a few years, but it's time for deeper and more enchanting shades to shine. A bright ultramarine hue is highlighted for its ability to provide an captivating yet soothing atmosphere. A sky blue cobalt tone shows a connection to nature in your home, whether the walls are painted in such a tone or you have a couch in such a shade. Earthy and saturated yellow colors, reminiscent of umbers and ochres, are expected to become more popular as people prefer tones that create comfort and relief. Saturated warm colors based on umbers and ochres create cozy, peaceful, and charming spaces, says an expert. The color of ochre in the interior of a room / Photo Nathan Schroder. The shade of ruby and nostalgic red colors will play an important role in 2025. One expert mentions a 'hot' ruby shade, reminiscent of the fiery tones of the 90s, as one that will be in trend next year. Candy colors will be the accents in 2025. These bright tones create an electric feeling in the room, while serving as a departure from the gray tones often used in interior design in recent years.'

**4 Trendy Hair Shades for 2025: Natural Colors Take Center Stage**
According to fashion experts, the most stylish hair color options for 2025 will be gold and chestnut shades with a coppery undertone. These natural-looking colors will suit all women, regardless of skin tone. 'A soft, golden shade is perfect for those with warm skin tones and a preference for natural looks,' says a stylist. 'For those with dark hair, this color will refresh their overall look, make their locks shine, and add volume.' Coppery undertones have been a trend for several years, as they accentuate eye color, highlight the skin, and make it look soft and delicate. Adding dark streaks to a coppery tone creates an elegant and luxurious look. A warm, natural shade is suitable for blonde and red-haired women, as it enhances their natural beauty and creates a playful, carefree look. Adding a touch of copper or brown to a warm tone creates a perfect outfit without radical changes. Combining gold or copper with dark chocolate creates a popular look for 2025. This color can be achieved using ombre, shatush, or balayage techniques. The new hair color will complement any style - romantic, business, or festive.

**The Symbol of 2025: The Green Wooden Snake**
According to the Eastern tradition, each year is controlled by one of the 12 zodiacal animals. In 2025, the symbol will be the Green Wooden Snake, which is associated with changes and updates, as reported by the newspaper 'Izvestia'. The new year in the Eastern calendar begins on the first day of the lunar calendar, which will be January 29, 2025, marking the start of the year of the Green Wooden Snake. Although many people fear snakes, perceiving them as predators, in Eastern culture, these creatures symbolize wisdom and flexibility. In Chinese mythology, snakes often appear as companions of gods and assistants of heroes. They are associated with changes and renewal, as they can shed their skin. The snake adapts calmly to new conditions, but does not tolerate pressure. Combined with green color and wood elements, it symbolizes growth, harmony, and continuous development. It is best to celebrate the year with close people. Snakes do not like crowds, and what is important is coziness and a warm atmosphere. For clothing, it is worth choosing strict styles and single-colored fabrics. Green, brown, beige, and gray tones will suit the snake, while it is better to avoid red color. In home decoration, it is recommended to use green, gray, and white shades with golden accents. Live plants will help create a 'tropical' atmosphere. The festive table should feature meat dishes - chicken, turkey, rabbit, as well as vegetables, as advised by the Moscow Komsomol newspaper.

**The Year 2025: A Time of Transformation and Change**
According to astrologer Marina Romanova, the year 2025 will be the year of the Green Wooden Snake. This year will be a time of transformation, and people and countries will undergo significant changes. The combination of the wooden element and the green color of the snake's energy will bring a sense of calm and tranquility, which is necessary for the world in a time of crisis. However, this energy can only be achieved through conscious growth and a re-evaluation of one's values, especially for those who hold the fate of nations in their hands. In 2025, we will see the seeds of a new world, both in our families and in the country, and this will happen as a result of radical changes in all areas of life on a global scale. These changes will not always be easy. The year 2025 will be a time of great transformation, and it will be influenced not only by the snake but also by the planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, which will change the signs of the zodiac. This will be a year of great change in societies, communications, government, and leadership. The beginning of 2025 will be quite challenging, as it will force us to change our activities. The year will start with retrograde Mars, retrograde Venus, and retrograde Mercury. By the middle of the year, humanity will be faced with the need to change its value orientations. It is essential to pay attention to spiritual growth and transition from egoism to altruism. The astrologer warns that 2025 may be a difficult year in the medical field, with an increased risk of epidemics. It is essential to pay attention to one's health, lead a healthy lifestyle, and engage in disease prevention. The most favorable periods in 2025 are from April 14 to June 8, from June 26 to July 17, from August 12 to September 1, from September 25 to November 8, and from November 30 to December 31. According to the expert, in these periods, it is desirable to be socially active and not afraid of changes. For Ukraine, 2025 will be a year of great changes at the level of power. The year will start with a 'royal degree' - a period of success and transformation for the better. In the next year, Ukraine will attract positive energies from Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury. Important agreements will be signed, and we will meet with true benefactors. It is worth waiting for the expansion of borders and the strengthening of ties with partners. This is a year that will prepare an updated Ukraine. As for what not to do in 2025, it is not recommended to rush, manipulate people, or use outdated methods. The universe will progress, and we must keep pace with it. Everything will be new, so we need to grow beyond ourselves. During the retrograde period of Mars (December 6, 2024 - February 24, 2025), it is not recommended to be socially active. During the retrograde period of Venus (March 2-27), it is not recommended to get married. Every three months, there is a period of retrograde Mercury, during which it is not recommended to sign contracts. As for what to do in 2025, it is considered a favorable year for spiritual growth, re-evaluation of one's place in life, and determination of new perspectives. It is recommended to meditate more often and engage in self-analysis. It is also not necessary to be afraid of changes. If you have long wanted to change something in your life, this is your chance. Astrologer Marina Romanova advises, if possible, to switch to a plant-based diet and work on your body. The body, like a tree, should be flexible and resilient. This year is very favorable for professional growth. You can start learning something new, engage in construction, reconstruction, or create a family.

**Suvinil chooses three colors for 2025: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno**
The Tintas Suvinil has chosen three colors for 2025: Despertar (a vibrant yellow that evokes hope and renewal), Marrom Luxo (a terracotta tone that connects with the essential and reflects new sophistication), and Sossego Noturno (a hybrid blue-violet tone that represents harmony between humans, technology, and nature). According to Bruna Galliano, director of creative and color consultant at Suvinil, 'In a complex and multiple time, a single color would not be able to summarize the sentiment of the time. Choosing more than one is a great analogy of how different ideas and opinions can coexist and create new possibilities that benefit everyone.' The Coral brand has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and lively yellow) for 2025, while the Pantone has chosen three colors: Despertar, Marrom Luxo, and Sossego Noturno. 'We can't wait for what's going to happen, we need to act and for that we need to unite,' explains Bruna. The colors are part of five palettes: resistência, regeneração, nostalgia, hibridismo, and otimismo. 'Just like in life, everything is interconnected, the tones of the five palettes migrate between each other. Just like we are not just one thing and can be different people in different occasions, the colors of the 2025 palette demonstrate their versatility by gaining a completely different energy when changing from one palette to another,' says Bruna.
