INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY

The superforecasters gather around a table, reviewing their data. 

FORECASTER 1  
(leans back, contemplative)  
So, as of October 2, 2024, Ruto is still President. Our models had it at 18.75%.

FORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Considering the cabinet shake-up and the protests, the probability was higher than usual. But his strategic appointments in July were pivotal.

FORECASTER 3  
(sifts through news clippings)  
Indeed. The reinstatement of key figures and opposition members calmed tensions. And the resignation of the police chief seemed to have diffused some public anger.

FORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
Protests had a significant impact, but Ruto's maneuvering was underestimated. Our models were spot on.

FORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Another testament to the power of data-driven predictions.

They exchange satisfied glances, acknowledging the accuracy of their work.

FADE OUT.

INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER A stands at the front, a digital screen displaying various news headlines behind them.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
Yesterday marked a pivotal moment for Kenya. Our models had it at 85.67% that William Ruto would cease to be President before October 1, 2024. 

SUPERFORECASTER B  
The cabinet shake-up and the police chief's resignation were strong indicators. The protests were not just about taxes—they were a call for change.

SUPERFORECASTER C  
Ruto's attempts to appease the opposition by reinstating some cabinet members came too late. Public sentiment was overwhelmingly against him.

SUPERFORECASTER A  
Indeed. The probability of his removal was high due to the sustained unrest and international pressure.

The forecasters nod, their prediction models once again proving their accuracy.

SUPERFORECASTER B  
Our models never fail. It's a testament to understanding the intricate web of political dynamics.

"Well, the dust has settled. Our models had it at 15.75%."

SUPERFORECASTER B

SUPERFORECASTER C

SUPERFORECASTER A  
"True, but the resignation of the police chief and those 39 deaths created a volatile mix."

SUPERFORECASTER B  
"Yet, Ruto managed to hold on. Our models were spot on with their low probability."

SUPERFORECASTER C  
"Let's see how this affects future predictions. Kenya's political landscape is a complex puzzle."

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
As of August 1, our models had it at 12.45%. The protests were intense, but Ruto's strategic cabinet reshuffle and appointing opposition members seemed to stabilize his position.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right, the firing of the cabinet and Koome's resignation were significant. Yet, Ruto's ability to quell the unrest by addressing some demands shifted the probabilities.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Let's not forget, the international community's muted response played a role too. Our models never saw a coup or resignation as likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Indeed. Despite the chaos, the probability of him ceasing to be President by October 1 remained low.
