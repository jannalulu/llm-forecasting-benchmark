**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning over a desk with papers)  
Yesterday, the CDC didn't raise the mpox risk level above "High." Our models had it at 2.35%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Exactly as predicted. Despite the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the U.S. population's immunity held strong. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
And the July assessment was crucial. It set the stage for our models, maintaining confidence in a "Very Low" risk.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
True. The CDC's rapid response and updated assessments were pivotal. They prevented unnecessary panic.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(looking at the screen)  
It's reassuring to see our predictions align with reality. The public's trust in these models is well-placed.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(smiling)  
Indeed. Let's prepare for the next potential event. The future always holds surprises.

*The room is filled with screens displaying news articles and data. Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, MIKE, and LUCAS, sit around a table, analyzing the latest reports.*

**JANE**  
So, the CDC didn't update the risk level for mpox. It remains "Very Low."

**MIKE**  
Our models had it at 5.72%. The data didn't suggest a significant shift.

**LUCAS**  
Right. Even with the clade I mpox developments in Sub-Saharan Africa, the exposure here was minimal.

**JANE**  
And the population immunity held strong. No new variables to tip the scale.

**MIKE**  
The media buzzed, but the numbers told a different story.

**LUCAS**  
A reminder that not all threats materialize as predicted. The models remain our best guide.

*They nod, satisfied with their accurate forecast, as the screens continue to update silently.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, papers scattered. The atmosphere is tense yet focused.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Well, the CDC's latest assessment didn't exceed "High." Our models had it at 12.35%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Indeed. The update on clade I mpox in Africa was concerning, but transmission barriers held.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
The July 8th "Very Low" assessment was a solid anchor. Public health measures were effective.

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
Our data showed the impact of infection remained low, with effective treatments widely available.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Exactly. The models never lie. Even with evolving situations, we anticipated the risk wouldn't spike.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Let's continue monitoring. The situation can change, but for now, the general public remains secure.

The group nods, returning to their analyses, confident in their predictions.

*The room is filled with SUPERFORECASTERS gathered around a table, analyzing data.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, the big question—did the CDC assess mpox risk as "High" or more?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking notes) Our models had it at 5.25%. Given the data cutoff on August 23, there was minimal indication of a shift.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: The July 8 assessment was "Very Low." Even with the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the update wasn’t expected to jump to "High."

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (nodding) Right, the CDC’s qualitative analysis rarely makes drastic shifts without significant new data.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (smiling) So, as expected, it didn't happen. Our models stay undefeated.

*They all share a knowing glance, confident in their predictions.*

Four superforecasters sit around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of their laptops. A screen displays the latest CDC risk assessment for mpox.

**FORECASTER 1:** So, the CDC didn't raise the risk level. It's still "Very Low."

**FORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 5.23%. Given the data cutoff on August 23, it was unlikely.

**FORECASTER 3:** The clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa did stir concerns, but the transmission barriers held strong here.

**FORECASTER 4:** Right, and the CDC's updates aligned with our projections. No drastic changes in exposure or immunity.
