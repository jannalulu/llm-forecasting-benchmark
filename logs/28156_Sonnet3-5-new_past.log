Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Key Timeline:
- Recall initiated: July 2024
- Expanded recall: Early August 2024
- Latest news: September 13, 2024 (plant shutdown)
- Resolution date: October 1, 2024
- Products have sell-by dates through October 17, 2024

2. Key Severity Factors:
- 7 million pounds of meat recalled
- 57 hospitalizations and 9 deaths reported
- 71 different products affected
- Major facility issues discovered (mold, insects, violations)
- Plant shutdown announced

3. Supporting Quick Resolution:
- Company has shut down the problematic facility
- Significant media attention and public health impact
- Company cooperating with authorities
- Most recalled products should be removed/expired by resolution date

4. Supporting Delayed Resolution:
- Large scale of recall (7 million pounds)
- Wide distribution (nationwide + international)
- Some products have sell-by dates beyond October 1
- Complex investigation with multiple deaths
- Need to verify complete removal from supply chain
- Historical pattern shows large recalls with fatalities take longer to resolve

5. Analysis:
The shutdown of the facility is a significant step toward resolution, but the scale, complexity, and severity (9 deaths) suggest the USDA will be thorough in verification. The sell-by dates extending past October 1 and the international distribution complicate quick closure. Historical patterns suggest recalls involving deaths typically take 3-4 months to resolve fully.

Given the September 13 plant shutdown announcement and approximately 2.5 months since initial recall, while balanced against the severity and scope, I assess this will likely extend beyond October 1.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.50%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- The recall was initiated in July 2024 and expanded in August 2024
- It involves 7 million pounds of meat products
- Products have sell-by dates up to October 17, 2024
- As of September 13, 2024 (current date), the outbreak has caused:
  * 57 hospitalizations
  * 9 deaths
  * Cases across 18 states

2. Key Factors Supporting Early Closure (before Oct 1):
- Boar's Head has shut down their Virginia plant
- Company is cooperating fully with authorities
- Aggressive recall actions taken by retailers
- Strong public awareness campaign

3. Factors Supporting Later Closure (after Oct 1):
- Some products have sell-by dates extending to October 17, 2024
- The scale of the recall (7 million pounds) is massive
- Ongoing investigations into facility violations
- Rising death toll (from 2 to 9 in recent weeks)
- Need to verify all contaminated products are removed
- Complex cleaning requirements for retail locations

4. Historical Context:
- Large-scale listeria outbreaks typically take 3-6 months to resolve
- This is the largest deli meat recall since 2011

5. Risk Assessment:
- Given sell-by dates extend to October 17, USDA likely needs to monitor through that period
- Rising death toll suggests ongoing concerns
- Extensive cleanup and verification needed at retail level

Based on these factors, especially the sell-by dates extending past October 1 and the increasing severity of the outbreak, I assess this is unlikely to be closed before October 1.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Recall was initiated in July 2024
- Latest articles (Sept 13, 2024) indicate recall is still active
- Resolution date is October 1, 2024 (about 2.5 weeks from now)

2. Severity and Scale:
- 7 million pounds of meat recalled
- 57 hospitalizations and 9 deaths reported
- Affects products with sell-by dates through October 17, 2024

3. Company Response:
- Boar's Head shut down Virginia plant
- Implementing new food safety measures
- Appointing new food safety official

4. Historical Context:
- This is the largest listeria outbreak since 2011
- Major recalls typically remain active until after sell-by dates expire
- Complex recalls with multiple deaths usually remain active for months

5. Key Factors Supporting Earlier Closure:
- Company taking decisive action
- Plant shutdown indicates serious response
- Significant media attention creating pressure

6. Key Factors Supporting Later Closure:
- Products still in circulation through October 17
- High death count requires thorough investigation
- Multiple violations found at facility need addressing
- CDC still actively monitoring cases

7. Critical Considerations:
- USDA typically maintains recalls until after last sell-by date
- Investigation of deaths requires thorough completion
- Complex nature of multi-state outbreak

Given that some products have sell-by dates extending to October 17, 2024, and the serious nature of the outbreak (9 deaths), it seems highly unlikely the recall would be closed before October 1. The USDA typically maintains recalls active until after the last sell-by date expires.

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 15.50%, with 8.50% being the most likely. Probability: 8.50%.
