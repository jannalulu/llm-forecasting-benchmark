*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, discussing the recent air quality outcomes in Seattle.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the question was whether Seattle would experience 6 to 10 days with an AQI above 150 in Q3 of 2024. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, and our models had it at 30.00%. Given the historical data and current trends, we were leaning towards a "no."

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, especially with only one reported day by August 1st. The probability reflected the reality.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It seems the early rains this year helped, unlike 2022 when wildfire smoke caused havoc.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, it's a relief for Seattleites. Our models remain spot-on.

*They nod, satisfied with their predictive accuracy.*

*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area didn't hit the 6 to 10 days with AQI above 150 this past quarter.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Given the historical data and the early summer wildfire patterns, it was a close call.

**NATE SILVER**  
True, especially considering that spike on July 5th. But the rains came early this year, clearing the air.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It's fascinating how these variables play out. A few more dry weeks could've tipped the scales.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. It’s a reminder of how dynamic environmental forecasting can be. We’ll have to keep refining our models.

NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by screens displaying air quality data.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area, did it see 6 to 10 days with AQI above 150 this past quarter?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. As expected, only two days surpassed the threshold.

**NATE SILVER:** Wildfires were less severe this year. Interesting how our models picked up on that early.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The rain came sooner, mitigating potential smoke impacts. Historical patterns helped refine our predictions.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating. With just one day by early August, the probability was already leaning low.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and the models never lie. Even with the unpredictability of wildfires, they remain precise.

Well, Philip, the data's in. The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue area had exactly 6 days with an AQI above 150 in Q3 2024.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 52.35% for 6 to 10 days. The wildfire patterns were consistent with our forecasts.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, given the historical context, especially the 2022 Bolt Creek Fire, our predictions held strong. The late summer smoke influx was right on cue.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with only one day by August 1st, it seemed unlikely. But the late season wildfires shifted the odds.
