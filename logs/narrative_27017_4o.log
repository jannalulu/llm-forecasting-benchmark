INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The SUPERFORECASTERS, a group of analytical minds, gather around a table, laptops open, discussing the recent UN membership scenario.

FORECASTER 1  
Well, the event didn't happen. Our models had it at 5.23%.

FORECASTER 2  
Makes sense. The Security Council's dynamics and geopolitical tensions were major barriers.

FORECASTER 3  
Right, especially with China's stance on Taiwan and the complex situation with Kosovo.

FORECASTER 4  
Palestine made some diplomatic strides, but not enough for full membership.

FORECASTER 1  
Even the emergence of new states seemed unlikely given the historical pace.

FORECASTER 2  
And the veto power—always a wildcard.

FORECASTER 3  
Our models were spot on. No surprises here.

They nod in agreement, sipping their coffee, their predictions validated by reality. The scene fades, leaving the superforecasters satisfied with their accurate foresight.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, discussing the recent UN membership outcome.

ALEX  
(leaning back)  
Well, the UN still has 193 members. Our models had it at 5.25%.

JORDAN  
(sipping coffee)  
Yeah, the diplomatic hurdles were just too high. Palestine and Kosovo faced strong opposition.

ALEX  
(nodding)  
And Taiwan, with China’s veto power? That was always a long shot.

JORDAN  
But we did consider independence movements. Nothing gained enough momentum.

ALEX  
True. South Sudan was the last addition in 2011. History was on our side.

JORDAN  
(smiling)  
Guess our Brier scores remain intact.

ALEX  
(chuckling)  
For now. Until the next geopolitical surprise.

They share a knowing look, confident in their analysis.

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open, discussing the latest UN developments.

ALEX  
(leaning back)  
So, the UN still has 193 members. Our models had it at 2.34%.

JORDAN  
(nodding)  
Right on target. The Security Council didn't budge, and no new states emerged.

ALEX  
(smiling)  
Palestine and Kosovo made some noise, but the geopolitical chessboard is as rigid as ever.

JORDAN  
(chuckling)  
China's stance on Taiwan was a given. And Northern Cyprus? Still Turkey's lone ally.

ALEX  
(sipping coffee)  
The slow pace of diplomacy never fails to amaze. Maybe next year?

JORDAN  
(raising an eyebrow)  
We'll see. But for now, the status quo holds strong.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their accurate predictions.
