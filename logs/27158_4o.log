To forecast whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, we begin by examining historical patterns and base rates. Brokered conventions have been quite rare historically, with the last Democratic brokered convention occurring in 1952. This indicates a low base rate for such events, suggesting an initial low likelihood.

**Relevant Factors and Evidence:**

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context:**
   - No brokered convention in the Democratic party since 1952.
   - Modern primary systems and processes are designed to avoid brokered scenarios by giving more control to voters through primaries and caucuses.

2. **Current Situation and Recent Developments:**
   - President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the race, introducing significant uncertainty.
   - Kamala Harris has been endorsed by Biden, which could help consolidate delegate support but isn't a guarantee.
   - Other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer have been mentioned as potential contenders, meaning competition exists.

3. **Political Dynamics and Convention Processes:**
   - The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, 2024.
   - Reports indicate an "open convention" approach, which could transform into a brokered convention if no candidate secures a majority on the first ballot.
   - There's significant talk about a brokered convention, but these discussions often don't translate into actual events.

4. **Current Polling and Delegate Dynamics:**
   - Biden had approximately 3,900 delegates prior, who are now free to choose.
   - Harris is a frontrunner but does not necessarily have a guaranteed majority.

5. **Media Analysis:**
   - Articles and expert commentary express concern over a brokered convention's potential but also note its unpredictability.
   - Political insiders express divided opinions on Harris as a strong unifier or potentially needing a negotiated solution.

**Balance of Evidence:**
- The base rate of brokered conventions is very low.
- Political and procedural efforts generally aim to avoid brokered conventions.
- Current political dynamics post-Biden suggest significant uncertainty, but endorsements and existing political structures may lead to consolidation around a leading candidate like Harris.

Considering these factors, despite the unusual circumstances of Biden's withdrawal and the possibilities discussed, the likelihood remains constrained by historical and procedural realities.

*My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.*

To make a forecast about whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will follow a structured approach.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
   Historically, brokered conventions have been rare in the past several decades. The last Democratic brokered convention was in 1952. Given this data, the base rate for brokered conventions in the modern era is very low.

2. **Current Context (Inside View):**
   - Biden has withdrawn from the race and endorsed Kamala Harris, leading to a potentially contested scenario.
   - There’s a considerable list of other potential Democratic contenders: Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, among others.
   - The news articles reflect significant speculation about the possibility of a brokered convention but also indicate efforts to avoid it.

3. **Current Trends and Clashing Forces:**
   - There’s a lack of consensus on a single candidate, which typically increases the possibility of a brokered convention.
   - Multiple candidates might heighten competition, but there is often a strong impetus within parties to avoid brokered conventions due to unpredictability and division they can cause.

4. **Adjusting and Balancing Evidence:**
   - The historical rarity of brokered conventions is a strong point against expecting one now.
   - However, given the unsettled field and Biden’s withdrawal, the risk is notably higher than in recent uncontentious cases.
   - The close timing to the election can either push towards rapid consolidation behind a single candidate or increased chances of negotiation breakdown leading to multiple ballots.

5. **Benchmark Comparisons (Outside View):**
   - Forecasting platforms like Metaculus or FiveThirtyEight might be referring to an array of factors that weigh on the likelihood of Kamala Harris or others securing the nomination without a contested convention. They often lean towards the avoidance of multiple ballots as political efficiency is prioritized.

6. **Risk Assessment of Errors:**
   - Underestimating the unique dynamic of 2024 with Biden's dropout and multiple strong candidates may lead to missing a real possibility.
   - Overestimating the chance of a brokered convention might ignore historical trends towards nomination consolidation within parties.

7. **Probability Assignment:**
   Considering all the aspects—the rarity of brokered conventions historically, the uncertainty introduced by Biden’s withdrawal, and the current political dynamics—the probability remains low. However, the complexity of the current situation nudges it higher than typical election cycles.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

Given the question "Will Democrats have a brokered convention in 2024?" and the available information and context, let's analyze the likelihood of this event:

1. **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, brokered conventions are rare events. The last brokered convention was in 1952, over 70 years ago. This establishes a relatively low base rate for such events in recent history.

2. **Current Context**:
   - **Political Situation**: President Biden has announced his withdrawal from the 2024 election, leaving a vacuum for the Democratic nominee. Biden's endorsement of Kamala Harris introduces a front-runner, but not a guaranteed nominee.
   - **Potential Candidates**: Multiple potential candidates have been mentioned, including Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and others. This increases the chances that delegates may not coalesce around a single candidate in the first round.
   - **Convention Process**: An "open convention" is anticipated, where delegates are not bound to any candidate, leading to a higher chance of multiple voting rounds.

3. **Evidence from News Articles**:
   - Many articles, including those from Deutsche Welle, Internewscast, and Yahoo, highlight the potential for a brokered convention when no candidate secures a majority.
   - Expert opinions indicate that if no candidate surpasses 50% of delegate votes on the first ballot, a brokered convention is almost a given.

4. **Balancing Factors**:
   - **Argument for a Higher Probability**: The absence of a clear nominee following Biden's withdrawal and the presence of several potential replacements increase uncertainty and the prospect of a brokered convention.
   - **Argument for a Lower Probability**: Despite the chaos, the Democratic Party historically moves to coalesce around a single candidate to avoid intra-party division ahead of the elections.

5. **Recent Trends and Developments**:
   - There is an unusual political climate with Biden's unexpected withdrawal and Trump's high negatives potentially providing leverage for Democrats to quickly unify behind a single candidate.
   - External pressures to avoid a protracted and potentially divisive convention process may push party leaders to broker a quick resolution even before the convention.

Considering these factors and striving for a well-calibrated and resolute estimate, I propose the following probability range:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.

To forecast whether the Democrats will have a brokered convention in 2024, I will go through the necessary steps as outlined.

1. **Base Rate Analysis**:
   - A brokered convention is exceedingly rare and hasn’t happened since 1952. This implies a very low base rate historically, suggesting that such events are infrequent in U.S. political history. Thus, we'll start with a probability of less than 5%.

2. **Current Situation and Recent Articles**:
   - Recent articles suggest potential uncertainty due to President Joe Biden withdrawing and endorsing Kamala Harris. With other candidates like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer potentially in the race, there is a possibility of an inability to secure a majority in the first convention round. This increases the probability of a brokered convention.
   - Several articles specifically mention the potential for a brokered convention given the current Democratic Party situation — Biden's withdrawal and multiple contenders being viable.

3. **Internal Dynamics**:
   - The Democratic Party would likely prefer to avoid a brokered convention due to its complexity and unpredictability, which could be disadvantageous in the general election.

4. **Analysis of Delegates and Endorsements**:
   - Even with Biden stepping down, he has endorsed Harris, which might sway delegates significantly in her favor, thereby possibly preventing a brokered scenario.
   - However, the fact that delegates aren’t automatically committed to Harris introduces uncertainty. The potential of multiple rounds might still exist if no candidate immediately secures majority support.

5. **Evaluation of Compounding Factors**:
   - Strong endorsements might coalesce delegates around a single candidate. Yet the possibility of new powerful entrants — Governors and other recognized figures — adds complexities that could lead to a brokered convention.
   - Potential internal negotiations and alliances also have to be considered. These efforts might lead to a first-round consensus that avoids a brokered convention, or conversely, lead to more complexity and a brokered scenario if no agreement is reached.

6. **Forecasting Probability and Adjustments**:
   - Given these elements, the overall situation suggests that the Democratic convention has a higher-than-traditional likelihood of becoming brokered but is not a certainty. The historical rarity contrasts with current unusual dynamics, requiring careful balancing in prediction.

By analyzing historical precedents and the unique current political climate, the probability appears to be notably higher than historical base rates but remains uncertain due to potential party dynamics aimed at consolidation and avoiding a brokered situation.

Therefore, combining these elements together:

**My Prediction**: Between 25.00% and 35.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of the Democratic Party having a brokered convention in 2024, we'll apply the superforecasting principles to evaluate the situation.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Precedent**:
   - Brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. political history, with the last occurrence being in 1952, over 70 years ago. The Democratic Party has reformed its processes since then to prevent such outcomes by prioritizing early consensus and front-loaded primaries.

2. **Current Context and Circumstances**:
   - Given that President Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, there was potential for disruption. However, the endorsement could consolidate support around Harris, reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention.
   - Multiple articles and sources discuss the possibility of a brokered convention, emphasizing the lack of a clear alternative candidate and internal discussions among Democratic leaders regarding the nomination process.
   
3. **Examination of Recent Developments**:
   - The central theme of media coverage is the possibility of a brokered convention. However, it's crucial to recognize that much of this discussion is speculative, based on scenarios that might not materialize if the party reaches a consensus.
   - The August conventions passed, and recent news indicates no conclusive evidence of a brokered convention taking place during this period. If a convention were to have required more than one round of voting, it would likely have been widely reported.

4. **Analysis of Political Dynamics**:
   - There are no reports of further rounds of voting beyond the initial ballot, strongly suggesting that Kamala Harris or another candidate was nominated as expected.
   - The Democratic National Committee has mechanisms to avoid brokered conventions, which would increase unity within the party. Additionally, brokered conventions historically correlate with electoral defeat, offering a significant incentive for the party to prevent such an event.

5. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - While the media anticipates brokered issues, the party's strategic avoidance necessitates skepticism. An inside view suggests a rapid consolidation around the endorsed candidate post-withdrawal.

6. **Conclusively Evaluating Error Risks**:
   - Overreacting to speculative discussions could lead us to overestimate the likelihood of a brokered convention. Conversely, overlooking the magnitude of Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement impact would be an error.

Given the combination of historical rarity, current indicators of consolidation, and planned convention outcomes, the potential for a brokered convention appears to remain low.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.

   - Brokered conventions are rare in modern U.S. political history, with the last occurrence being in 1952, over 70 years ago. The Democratic Party has reformed its processes since then to prevent such outcomes by prioritizing early consensus and front-loaded primaries.

2. **Current Context and Circumstances**:
   - Given that President Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, there was potential for disruption. However, the endorsement could consolidate support around Harris, reducing the likelihood of a brokered convention.
   - Multiple articles and sources discuss the possibility of a brokered convention, emphasizing the lack of a clear alternative candidate and internal discussions among Democratic leaders regarding the nomination process.
   
3. **Examination of Recent Developments**:
   - The central theme of media coverage is the possibility of a brokered convention. However, it's crucial to recognize that much of this discussion is speculative, based on scenarios that might not materialize if the party reaches a consensus.
   - The August conventions passed, and recent news indicates no conclusive evidence of a brokered convention taking place during this period. If a convention were to have required more than one round of voting, it would likely have been widely reported.

4. **Analysis of Political Dynamics**:
   - There are no reports of further rounds of voting beyond the initial ballot, strongly suggesting that Kamala Harris or another candidate was nominated as expected.
   - The Democratic National Committee has mechanisms to avoid brokered conventions, which would increase unity within the party. Additionally, brokered conventions historically correlate with electoral defeat, offering a significant incentive for the party to prevent such an event.

5. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - While the media anticipates brokered issues, the party's strategic avoidance necessitates skepticism. An inside view suggests a rapid consolidation around the endorsed candidate post-withdrawal.

6. **Conclusively Evaluating Error Risks**:
   - Overreacting to speculative discussions could lead us to overestimate the likelihood of a brokered convention. Conversely, overlooking the magnitude of Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement impact would be an error.

Given the combination of historical rarity, current indicators of consolidation, and planned convention outcomes, the potential for a brokered convention appears to remain low.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.50% being the most likely. Probability: 7.50%.
