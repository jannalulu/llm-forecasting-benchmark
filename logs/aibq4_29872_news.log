**US Oil and Gas Rig Count Holds Steady for Record Third Week – Baker Hughes**
The US oil and gas rig count has remained steady for a record third week in a row, according to Baker Hughes' data. The total rig count was 585 in the week to November 8, with oil rigs holding at 479 and gas rigs at 102. This is 31 rigs, or 5%, below the count at this time last year. The decline in rig count is attributed to a decrease in oil and gas prices, higher labor and equipment costs, and companies focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns. US oil futures are down 2% so far in 2024, while US gas futures are up 6%. US crude output is expected to rise to 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 13.5 million bpd in 2025, while US gas output is expected to slide to 103.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 bcfd in 2023.

The number of oil rigs decreased by two to 480 this week, while the number of gas rigs increased by two to 101. For the month, the total number of rigs for oil and gas decreased by two after increasing by four in September. The number of oil rigs decreased by four in October after increasing by one in September, while the number of gas rigs increased by two this month after increasing by four last month. The number of rigs for oil and gas fell by around 20% in 2023 after increasing by 33% in 2022 and 67% in 2021, due to the decline in oil and gas prices, the increase in labor and equipment costs due to inflation, and the fact that companies have focused on debt repayment and increasing shareholder returns rather than increasing production. Oil and gas futures contracts have remained stable so far in 2024 after falling 11% in 2023, while natural gas futures contracts have increased by around 1% so far in 2024 after falling 44% in 2023.

**Colombia's Oil Production Could Have Been Higher Without Blockades and Conflicts**
According to Campetrol, Colombia's oil production was 780,300 barrels per day between January and August of this year, a 0.6% increase from the same period last year. However, this production could have been higher if it weren't for the disruptions caused by blockades and conflicts, which affected the normal operation of the oil fields. Nelson Castañeda, president of Campetrol, stated, 'The production of hydrocarbons could be superior in the absence of the conflicts and blockades that are currently present in the operational areas. Without these impediments, Colombia would have the potential to reach a production of over 800,000 barrels of oil per day, contributing to the strengthening of energy sovereignty and generating more resources for the regions.' Additionally, the number of drilling rigs in the country has decreased by 30% since November 2022, resulting in an estimated loss of 25,025 jobs. 'In September 2024, there were 109 drilling rigs active in the country, 29 for drilling and 80 for reconditioning operations,' said the gremio. The production of gas in Colombia also decreased by 7.7% between January and August of this year, according to the National Association of Hydrocarbons (ANH). Meanwhile, oil exports increased by 1.7% to $10.27 billion between January and August of this year, according to the National Statistics Department (Dane).

**U.S. Drillers Cut Oil and Gas Rigs for Fourth Time in Five Weeks – Baker Hughes**
U.S. energy firms cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs for the fourth time in five weeks, according to Baker Hughes. The oil and gas rig count fell by one to 585, with 482 oil rigs and 99 gas rigs. This is 39 rigs, or 6%, below the total rig count from this time last year. The decline in rigs is due to lower oil and gas prices, higher labor and equipment costs, and companies focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns. U.S. oil futures are down 3% so far in 2024, while U.S. gas futures are 10% lower. Despite the decline in rigs, U.S. crude production hit a record high of 13.5 million barrels per day last week. The EIA forecasts U.S. crude output to rise to 13.2 million bpd in 2024 and 13.5 million bpd in 2025. On the gas side, the number of rigs has slumped by 18% this year, causing U.S. gas output to forecast a decline to 103.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

**US drillers cut oil and gas rigs for third week in a row - Baker Hughes - ET Auto**
US drillers have cut the number of oil and gas rigs for the third week in a row, according to Baker Hughes. The oil and gas rig count fell by 2 to 585 in the week to October 4, with oil rigs dropping to 479, their lowest since July 19. Despite higher oil prices, drillers have reduced spending on drilling activities, leading to a decline in US crude output. The EIA predicts US crude output will reach 13.7 million barrels per day in 2025, down from a record 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023. On the gas side, US gas output is expected to slide to 103.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 billion cubic feet per day in 2023. 'Those higher oil prices prompted drillers to boost U.S. crude output from a record 12.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023 to 13.3 million bpd in 2024 and 13.7 million bpd in 2025,' according to the EIA outlook.

**Drilling Activity in Colombia Continues to Decline**
The drilling activity in Colombia continues to decline, according to the monthly report of drilling and production presented by the Colombian Chamber of Petroleum, Gas and Energy (Campetrol). In August 2024, there were 108 active drilling rigs in the country, a 10.7% decrease compared to the same period in 2023, when the number was 121. The president of Campetrol, Nelsón Castañeda, stated that 'we are used to the price cycles of oil and prepare ourselves to recover when it goes down and have an activity in line with the profitability of the business. With prices above $80, I have never seen a decline of almost 30% in the last 22 months.' The drilling activity in Colombia has contracted by 30.3% since November 2022, with 47 fewer drilling rigs in operation, both in perforation and reconditioning. The sector has warned that this trend has had a negative impact not only on operational issues, but also on employment generation, with an estimated loss of 24,700 jobs.
