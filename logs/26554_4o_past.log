To forecast whether the next interstellar object will be discovered before September 30, 2024, we need to examine a combination of historical data, current trends, and developments in astronomical technology that could influence the likelihood of detection.

**Historical Data and Base Rates:**
1. **Previous Discoveries:** The first interstellar object 'Oumuamua was discovered in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. With two interstellar objects identified over approximately seven years, the frequency of such discoveries suggests a low but non-negligible probability of finding another interstellar object within any given year.
2. **Detection Challenges:** Discovering interstellar objects is difficult due to their small size, fast speeds, and often dim visibility.

**Current Trends and Developments:**
1. **Technological Advancements:** The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is noted in the news articles as being one of the groundbreaking developments set to revolutionize the detection of fainter and more numerous interstellar objects. Its operations starting next year could increase discovery odds.
2. **Astronomical Missions:** Efforts to design spacecraft and probes for tracking and studying interstellar objects, while promising for future insights, do not directly impact immediate object detection probabilities.
3. **Expert Predictions and Initiatives:** Scientists' optimism and ongoing research initiatives to identify and study interstellar objects show a growing capability and focus on discovering such objects.

**Recent News Articles:**
The articles primarily discuss other astronomical phenomena, such as comets and novae, and do not provide direct evidence pointing to an imminent discovery of a new interstellar object by September 2024. The focus is mainly on enhancing scientific capabilities for future detections.

**Assessment:**
- Given the technical challenges in detecting interstellar objects, the historical rarity of discoveries, and the expected boost from observatories like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, it is reasonable to consider a moderate probability of discovery within the timeframe.
- These factors, along with expert opinions hinting at improved detection in the near future, suggest there is potential for a discovery before September 2024, but it remains uncertain.

Combining these factors, my prediction is:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast the likelihood of a newly discovered interstellar object receiving the "I" designation from the IAU Minor Planet Center before September 30, 2024, I will analyze both historical patterns and the latest developments in the field of astronomy.

**Reference and Comparison Classes**:
1. **Historical Occurrence of Interstellar Discoveries**: The first interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017, and then comet 2I/Borisov followed in 2019, with a gap of about 2 years between each detection.
2. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to enhance our capability to detect such objects. The observatory is set to start operations, implying a greater chance of interstellar discoveries compared to past years.

**Recent Developments**:
1. **Technological Advancements**: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, once operational, is anticipated to significantly increase the rate at which interstellar objects are identified. 
2. **Current Trends and Research Focus**: There is ongoing interest and preparation for potential detections (e.g., software development for trajectory optimization), which could indicate readiness to identify new interstellar objects.

**Key Considerations**:
1. **Base Rate and Frequency**: Considering the past frequency of confirmed interstellar objects, with two discoveries in about five years, and the enhanced detection capabilities of the LSST, doubling the previous frequency presents a plausible base rate.
2. **Current Capacity and Readiness**: The articles indicate readiness and anticipation in the scientific community for the detection of interstellar objects, boosted by the upcoming operation of the LSST.
3. **Uncertainty in Space Discoveries**: There remains inherent uncertainty in astronomical observations, as factors such as position, speed, and brightness variability of potential new interstellar objects can impact detection.

Given these factors, a cautious probability estimate considering the exciting developments in detection capabilities and the historical context of discoveries is warranted. 

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 50.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To forecast whether the next interstellar object will be discovered before September 30, 2024, we need to examine several factors and break down the problem into more manageable parts.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: 
   - Historically, only two confirmed interstellar objects (I/O) have been observed: ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. This suggests an average of about 0.4 interstellar objects observed per year since interstellar objects started being detected.

2. **Technological Advancements**:
   - Since `Oumuamua was discovered, there has been an improvement in technology and observing capacity, notably with the promised capabilities of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is set to come online soon. However, this observatory isn't operational yet as of this specific date.

3. **Current Astronomical Activities and Expectations**:
   - There is high interest and active research in further exploring interstellar objects, as seen from plans to design spacecraft missions for future detections and the likely evolutionary technological advancements driven by interest in these subjects.
   - No other significant observatories or surveys have reported a new interstellar object observation by the current date.

4. **Limiting Factors**:
   - The nature of interstellar object discoveries is inherently probabilistic and challenging due to their speed and the vastness of space. There is not yet a dedicated system reliably detecting them frequently.

5. **Recent News**:
   - Current astronomical events, such as the comet (C/2023 A3) and the T Coronae Borealis nova, are major focuses, but neither is related to the discovery of interstellar objects. 

Given these insights, I will weigh the low historical frequency of discoveries due to their rarer nature and the potential advancement in technology and surveys against the effective limitations of current detection capabilities not being fully optimized for interstellar object discovery as of yet.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To accurately forecast whether a new interstellar object will be discovered and designated with an "I" designation before September 30, 2024, I will evaluate historical trends, current developments, and relevant scientific capabilities.

**Base Rate Evaluation:**

1. **Historical Frequency:** Historically, interstellar objects have been rare discoveries. The first, 'Oumuamua, was identified in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. This sets a low baseline frequency for such events. With only two confirmed interstellar objects within several years, the base rate for discovering a new interstellar object in any given year is quite low.

2. **Current Technological Developments:** The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, mentioned in multiple news articles, is set to become operational soon. This observatory is expected to significantly enhance our ability to detect faint interstellar objects, which could potentially increase the rate of discovery.

3. **Probes and Scientific Efforts:** While efforts are underway to engage more deeply with identified interstellar objects (e.g., missions planned for 'Oumuamua), the success of these missions does not directly increase the rate of future interstellar object discoveries before their formal launch and operational phases.

**Current Context and News Review:**

1. **Vera C. Rubin Observatory:** The articles suggest that the observatory will be operational within a year, which aligns well with the timeframe up to September 2024. It has the potential to discover many more interstellar objects given its advanced capabilities. However, since it may not start its operations until after September 2024, it may not contribute to discoveries in the immediate future.

2. **Infrastructure and Detection Software:** Development of new software and strategies to detect and track interstellar objects is ongoing, which could increase the likelihood of correctly identifying such objects more efficiently once they become operational.

3. **Recent Discoveries:** There have been no recent announcements of interstellar objects receiving "I" designations before the current date. This suggests that while the probability of discovery might be better now than in the past, it is still relatively low.

4. **Mitigating Factors and Time Constraints:** Regardless of enhanced detection capabilities, the specific criteria requiring the official "I" designation within this limited timeframe remain stringent. 

In synthesizing these insights, my approach balances the potential of technological improvements against historical rarity and time constraints.

**Conclusion:**

My forecast considers the low base rate, the potential increase in detection likelihood due to the forthcoming observatory and software improvements, but also the fact that these developments may not yield results by the target date of September 30, 2024.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.**

   - With two interstellar objects discovered over the past seven years (since 2017), the base rate is roughly one interstellar object every 3.5 years.

3. **Current Technological Developments:**
   - The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to go online soon and significantly enhance the detection capabilities of interstellar objects, potentially increasing the base rate of detection. 
   - No specific date for its operational start was specified, but it is a key factor that could sway the probability. 

4. **Time Constraint:**
   - The timeline is from now until September 30, 2024, approximately two months from the current date (July 24, 2024), leaving a relatively short window for a new discovery.

5. **Balanced Estimate:**
   - Given the historical base rate of detection (one discovery every 3.5 years) and the indication that new observatories could increase this rate, there is a moderate likelihood of a discovery within the given timeframe.
   - The short remaining window does decrease the probability slightly.

By weighing the existing data, historical base rates, new technological advancements, and the current timeframe, I've determined the likelihood of a new interstellar object discovery receiving an "I" designation before September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
