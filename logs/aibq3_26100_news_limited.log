**RFK Jr. Candidacy: A Controversial Figure in the 2024 US Presidential Election**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a candidate for the 2024 US presidential election, has a background in elite education and is an environmentalist and anti-vaccine activist. He has a law degree from Harvard University and a doctorate in law from the London School of Economics. Kennedy has been spreading misinformation about vaccines and immunizations since 2005. According to a political specialist, Kennedy is an 'outsider' with no chance of winning. He is considered a 'conspiracist' and has made false claims about vaccines, including comparing vaccination to a 'holocaust' and claiming that immunizations cause autism in children. Kennedy has also made bizarre claims, such as saying that a worm ate part of his brain and that he has no effects from the incident. He has also been suspended from Instagram for repeatedly sharing false information about COVID-19. His candidacy has been met with criticism from his own family, who disavowed him after he made comments comparing pandemic measures to Nazi Germany. Despite this, Kennedy has gained votes from dissatisfied voters who are looking for an alternative to the traditional party candidates.

**RFK Jr.'s campaign files petitions to get on presidential ballot in critical 2024 swing-state Pennsylvania**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, has filed paperwork to get on the ballot in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, six weeks before the August 1 deadline. To qualify, he must gather 5,000 signatures of registered voters. The campaigns of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump fear Kennedy could play a spoiler role in the election, especially in Pennsylvania, which has swung between parties in the last two presidential elections. Kennedy's petitions could be challenged in court by the major parties, and both campaigns have sought to portray him as an adversary.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Faces Deadline to Qualify for CNN Presidential Debate**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 US election, and a lawsuit filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may be his only hope. The CNN will broadcast the debate on June 27, after President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, Donald Trump, agreed to the confrontation last month. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the debate is midnight on Wednesday. Kennedy filed a complaint with the FEC in May, alleging that the CNN debate is an illegal campaign contribution to Biden and Trump because the media company is requiring him to meet 'different criteria' to participate in the debate. The campaign requested that the FEC take action by Thursday and prevent the CNN, Biden, and Trump from holding the debate on June 27 until they 'comply with the Federal Election Campaign Act', according to the complaint. The FEC declined to comment for this report. This election cycle presents a unique situation - since 1960, when the era of televised presidential debates began, it will be the first time that news organizations - first CNN, next week, and ABC, which will host a debate in September - will control the terms and parameters of the debates between candidates. Previously, the Commission on Presidential Debates sponsored the debates. CNN said that candidates qualified to participate must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election and receive at least 15% support in four separate national polls. After the debate announcement, Kennedy and his campaign complained. Kennedy said that Biden and Trump are 'trying to exclude me from the debate because they fear I will win'. On Saturday, CNN said it was 'not impossible' for Kennedy to qualify, but he has not yet met the criteria. He received at least 15% in three polls so far and qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 electoral votes, according to CNN. Kennedy's campaign did not comment further for this article. It is in the middle of an aggressive operation to gain access to electoral ballots across the US, with $15 million raised for the process.

**Trump Ignores Kennedy Jr.'s Debate Challenge**
Robert Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, has challenged Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for the US presidency, to a debate. However, Trump has ignored the invitation. The debate was proposed to take place at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington D.C. on May 24-26. The Kennedy campaign has not received a response from Trump's campaign. Trump has previously agreed to two rounds of debates with incumbent President Joe Biden, but has also expressed concerns about Biden's potential use of performance-enhancing substances. The first debate is scheduled for June 28, and the second for September 10. The US presidential election is set to take place on November 5, 2024.

**RFK Jr. Faces Midnight Deadline to Qualify for CNN Debate**
Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has less than 24 hours to qualify for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. Kennedy has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that CNN's debate criteria is unfair and amounts to a prohibited campaign contribution to the incumbent President Joe Biden and his Republican rival Donald Trump. The FEC has declined to comment. Kennedy's campaign is in the process of gaining ballot access across the US, with $15 million raised for the process. He has qualified for the ballot in six states and has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls. CNN has set criteria for candidates to participate in the debate, including appearing on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold and receiving at least 15% in four separate national polls. Kennedy's campaign has criticized the criteria, saying it is unfair and biased towards the presumptive nominees. Some experts have also questioned the criteria, saying it is 'nonsensical' and allows Biden and Trump to qualify for the debate as presumptive nominees. Having an independent candidate like Kennedy on stage may make for a more substantive debate, according to some experts.

**Why Robert F. Kennedy's Jr.'s Current Presidential Election may not last until November**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign has reached 15% or more in three approved national polls, meeting one of CNN's criteria to qualify for the June 27 debate with Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. However, it's unlikely that Kennedy's support will last until November. Historical data shows that third-party candidates often experience a decline in support as the election approaches. Research suggests that people are poor at predicting their future behavior, and voters may use their early support for a third-party candidate to express frustration with major party choices. The article also notes that Americans generally like the idea of a third party until details emerge, such as the party's policies and nominees. Additionally, third-party presidential candidates rarely get a substantial share of the votes, and early polls often look different from the actual vote in the general election.

**Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the Verge of Qualifying for US Presidential Debates**
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is close to qualifying for the US presidential debates, which could shake up the election. The debates have always been a key moment in US presidential elections, but this year's debates are expected to be particularly unpredictable. Kennedy Jr. is a popular independent candidate who has been gaining momentum in the polls. He has already met the first criteria for participating in the debates, which is to have at least 15% support in four national polls. However, he still needs to meet the second criteria, which is to be on the ballot in enough states to have a theoretical chance of winning the presidency. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign has submitted signatures to get on the ballot in five states, but he still needs to meet the deadline for the remaining states. If he succeeds, he will be the third candidate to qualify for the debates, following in the footsteps of Ross Perot and John B. Anderson. The debates will be held on June 27 and September 10, and will be broadcast on CNN and ABC respectively.

**Trump, Biden agree to two presidential debates in June and September**
US President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have agreed to two presidential debates in June and September. The debates were confirmed after months of speculation that the 2024 election would break the tradition of presidential debates. Trump has also accepted a third debate on Fox News, which Biden has not yet agreed to. The Biden campaign has sought to exclude third-party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., from participating in the debates. Kennedy has qualified for the debates, citing polls showing him above the 15% support threshold. The debates are seen as a high-risk, high-reward proposition for the Biden campaign, as simply staying alert and coherent could dispel concerns about his age and mental ability.

**Biden and Trump try to elbow Kennedy out of debates — and the 2024 race**
President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are trying to exclude independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from their one-on-one debates, citing concerns that he could play spoiler in the 2024 presidential election. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer and son of Robert F. Kennedy Sr., has been polling in the double digits and has ballot access in 11 states. The Biden and Trump campaigns have agreed to appear in two debates, one in June and one in September, but the terms set by the host networks, CNN and ABC News, could deny Kennedy a spot on the stage. Kennedy has accused the two candidates of colluding to exclude him from the debates and undermine democracy.
