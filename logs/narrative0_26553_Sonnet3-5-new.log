Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Hawaiian Electric Company."

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 78.5%. The parallels with PG&E were too strong to ignore. The Lahaina disaster, the massive lawsuits, and their August 2023 SEC filing showing they were already consulting restructuring advisors – all classic pre-bankruptcy indicators."

Nate: "The key signal was when they mentioned 'not restructuring' in that 8-K. In my experience, when companies explicitly deny bankruptcy plans, it often means the opposite."

Philip: "Exactly. The combination of potential liability exceeding their insurance coverage, plus their critical infrastructure status, made Chapter 11 almost inevitable. Just like PG&E, they needed the bankruptcy process to manage the wildfire claims while keeping the lights on."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."

Nate: "Phil, remember that Hawaiian Electric bankruptcy prediction? After the Lahaina fires?"

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 78.5%. The parallels with PG&E were striking – catastrophic fire, massive liability exposure, plummeting stock price. The August SEC filing about consulting restructuring advisors was particularly telling."

Nate: "The model caught that subtle shift in corporate language. When they said their 'goal is not to restructure,' it actually signaled desperation. Combined with the precedent of PG&E's bankruptcy after the Camp Fire..."

Philip: "Exactly. The liability estimates from over 100 deaths and widespread destruction made bankruptcy almost inevitable. The model recognized that utilities typically choose Chapter 11 to manage catastrophic liability while maintaining essential services."

[They both nod, marking another successful prediction in their ledger]

Nate: Well, Phil, our models were spot-on again about Hawaiian Electric Company.

Philip: Yes, the bankruptcy filing was practically inevitable after Lahaina. Our models had it at 87.5% likelihood.

Nate: The parallels with PG&E were striking. Both faced massive liability from fire damage, loss of life, and infrastructure destruction. The August 2023 statement about seeking restructuring advisors was a clear red flag.

Philip: Indeed. The combination of the class-action lawsuit, the 47% stock plunge, and their delayed response to the High Wind Watch conditions made it nearly impossible for them to survive without Chapter 11 protection.

Nate: Not to mention the precedent set by PG&E and Brazos Electric. Once the liability estimates exceeded their insurance coverage, bankruptcy became the most likely path forward.

Philip: Another validation of our probabilistic approach to forecasting.

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "The Hawaiian Electric bankruptcy prediction... looking back at what we knew in July 2024, our models were remarkably clear."

Tetlock: "Yes, given the precedent of PG&E's bankruptcy after the Camp Fire, combined with the devastating scale of the Lahaina tragedy, our models gave it an 83.7% probability."

Nate: "And we were right again. The liability exposure was simply too massive. Even with their initial resistance to restructuring, the parallels to PG&E were striking. The August 2023 statements about seeking restructuring advisors were a clear tell."

Tetlock: "The plunging stock price and the class-action lawsuits made it almost inevitable. Though I must say, the timing of their filing, just before the September deadline, had me checking our models twice."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting."
