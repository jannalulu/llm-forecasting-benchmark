Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] Phil, our models were spot on again about the Starliner situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the technical issues with Starliner's thrusters, Boeing's eagerness to recover the capsule, and NASA's tentative September 6th undocking date, our models had it at 85.20%.

Nate: [nodding] The autonomous undocking was successful, right on schedule. Even with all the helium leaks and thruster malfunctions, Boeing managed to execute the procedure before the deadline.

Philip: The early September target was crucial in our calculations. NASA's public statements about wanting to clear the port for upcoming missions added urgency.

Nate: [checking notes] And with SpaceX scheduled to rescue Wilmore and Williams later this month, there was really no reason to keep Calypso docked any longer.

Philip: Another win for superforecasting. The probability perfectly reflected the outcome.

Here's a 150-word script set on September 17, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with multiple monitors showing space telemetry data]

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the technical issues with Starliner's thrusters and Boeing's history of software challenges, our models had it at 15.20%."

Nate: "The autonomous undocking attempt was just too risky in that timeframe. With NASA's cautious approach after the helium leak..."

Philip: [interrupting] "And remember, we only had data up to September 4th, when they were still doing software validation. The complexity of an unmanned deorbit..."

Nate: "Exactly. The September 6th target was always optimistic. Now they're looking at late September for the attempt."

Philip: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the ones that recognize when something won't happen."

[Both nod knowingly as they watch ISS footage showing Starliner still docked]

Here's a 150-word script set on September 7, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their screens.]

Nate: *rubbing his temples* "The Starliner situation... our models had it at 85.20%."

Philip: *nodding* "And rightfully so. With NASA's public announcement of the September 6th target date and Boeing's desperate need to recover the capsule for analysis, the probability was strong."

Nate: "Though we only had data until September 4th, the technical readiness indicators were positive. The autonomous flight software had been extensively tested in simulations."

Philip: "Indeed. The early September timeline aligned perfectly with NASA's crew rotation plans. They needed to clear that docking port before Crew-9's arrival."

Nate: "Fascinating how our models captured the urgency of Boeing's engineering team to understand those thruster malfunctions and helium leaks."
