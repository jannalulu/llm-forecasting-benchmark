**Tomashovskiy: Ding Liren is in a broken state before the match for the world chess crown**
Eugeny Tomashovskiy, a two-time Russian champion and winner of the world team championship, believes that Chinese chess player Ding Liren is in a broken state before the match for the world chess crown. Tomashovskiy thinks that Ding Liren needs to recover 50-60% of his optimal state to have a chance to win. The match will take place from November 20 to December 15 in Singapore, with Ding Liren facing Indian player Dommaraju Gukesh. Tomashovskiy said, 'If Ding Liren remains in this broken state, he has no chances. If he returns to 50-60% of his normal state, or even 70-80% of his prime state, he will have decent chances.' The match will consist of 14 games with a time control of 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, then 60 minutes for the next 20 moves, and finally 15 minutes for the rest of the game with an additional 30 seconds per move starting from the 61st move. In case of a tie after 14 games, the world champion will be determined by a tiebreaker, where grandmasters will play rapid chess.

**Caruana Takes the Lead in SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia**
Fabiano Caruana is leading the SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz Croatia tournament with 15 points out of 18 possible, three points ahead of Wesley So, Levon Aronian, and five points ahead of Maxim Vachier-Lagrave, Jan Nepomniachtchi, and Alireza Firouzja. The tournament is not over yet, as there are 18 blitz games left, and Caruana is not strong in controlling the pace of the game. Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the tournament due to the sudden death of his mother, Sigurdur Ein. Caruana has been trying to match Carlsen's performance, winning three games in a row. He won against Anish Giri in the 8th round with a standard pawn break d6-d5. Caruana's rapid rating has increased by 39.1 points and he has moved up to second place after Carlsen. Gukesh Dommaraju, a contender for the world championship, had a big advantage in the 7th round, but Caruana not only held on but also won. Gukesh lost to Aronian in the next round. According to Garry Kasparov, the 13th world chess champion and the main organizer of the Grand Chess Tour, Gukesh still needs to learn to handle the pressure of playing at the highest level. Aronian replaced Carlsen at the last minute and is playing in his usual style. He won against Vidit Gujrathi, saying 'Not every day do the blacks allow the whites to put pawns on f6 and c6!' Nepomniachtchi did not realize his chances against Firouzja and Gukesh, but won against Gujrathi, who started an incorrect combination. Nepomniachtchi said, 'I've had so many good positions that I've never won that when the party finally comes to our street, it will be a celebration.'

**Gukesh's Quest for the World Championship Title**
The Superbet Rumania 2024 is the second event of the Grand Chess Tour, a series of five tournaments, two classical and three rapid. The first event, held in Warsaw in May, was won by Magnus Carlsen, who consistently demonstrates his superiority in all formats. The competition in Bucharest is played with a classical time control and features nine 'Supermasters' competing for the overall title. The defending champion is Fabiano Caruana, and notable absentees include world champion Ding Liren, Carlsen, and Nakamura. Gukesh, the challenger to Ding Liren, is the favorite to win the world championship, but his performance in this game suggests he may have problems. Deac, the top-ranked Romanian player, entered the tournament as a wildcard and played a Nimzo-Indian Defense. The game ended with a series of blunders, including a critical mistake on move 23, which led to a loss.

**Superbet Classic: Firouzja beats So, climbs to shared second place**
Alireza Firouzja has joined the top three at the Superbet Chess Classic after defeating Wesley So in the sixth round. Firouzja sacrificed a pawn to gain a strong initiative and converted his positional advantage into a 31-move win. The victory allowed him to catch up with Praggnanandhaa and Gukesh, who are now tied for second place, half a point behind leader Fabiano Caruana. Caruana remains the only player with a +2 score. The three youngsters, Firouzja, Praggnanandhaa, and Gukesh, have realistic chances of claiming overall victory in the Grand Chess Tour. Gukesh showed great defensive abilities to hold the balance in his game with black against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, while Firouzja put together a strong attack against So.

**Singapore to Host World Chess Championship Match Between Liren and Gukesh**
The World Chess Federation (FIDE) has announced that Singapore will host the World Chess Championship match between Chinese player Ding Liren and Indian player Dommaraju Gukesh from November 20 to December 15 this year, with a record prize fund of $2.5 million. The two Indian cities, New Delhi and Chennai, had also bid to host the event, attracted by Gukesh's presence, an 18-year-old prodigy. According to FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich, 'it's the first time a city like Singapore will host a World Championship, and it will surely be important for the development of international chess due to its celebrity.' The current champion, Ding Liren, won the title last year in Canada by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi, from Kazakhstan, in the tiebreaker matches, after Magnus Carlsen, the Norwegian world number one, declined to defend his title after a five-game winning streak. Gukesh earned his challenger status by winning the Candidates Tournament in April, with eight of the world's top 10 players participating in the event held in Toronto, when he was still 17 years old. The title will be decided in 14 games, although it can conclude earlier if one of the players reaches 7.5 points. If the score is tied at 7-7 after the 14 games, the title will be decided by rapid games.

Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu and Gukesh Dommaraju are tied for second place.

Kasparov emphasized the importance of preserving classical chess, saying 'The preservation of classical chess, I think, is very important for helping players to realize their full potential, to put on display what they can do.' Caruana explained his winning strategy, saying 'It's a very tricky kind of modern line.' Praggnanandhaa's win over Anish Giri was due to a single move, 19.b4!, which put Giri in trouble. Ian Nepomniachtchi and Wesley So drew, while Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave also drew. The tournament continues with the fifth round on Sunday, June 30.

**2024 Chess World Championship: Ding Liren to Defend Title Against Dommaraju Gukesh**
The 2024 Chess World Championship is approaching, and the question is whether current champion Ding Liren can defend his title. Magnus Carlsen has announced that he will not participate in the tournament. The most important information about the tournament, including the location, participants, and format, has been compiled by sport.de. The tournament has not been scheduled yet, but it will take place later than the 2023 tournament. The format will be the same as in 2023, with the winner being the first player to reach 7.5 points. If a winner is not determined after 14 games, a tiebreaker with a shortened thinking time will be played. The participants in the 2024 Chess World Championship are Ding Liren, the defending champion, and Dommaraju Gukesh, who qualified as the winner of the FIDE Circuit 2023. Gukesh could become the youngest world chess champion of all time if he wins.

**Shipov believes Russian chess players should have won the junior world championship**
International Grandmaster Sergey Shipov believes that Russian chess players should have won the World Chess Championship for players under 20 years old. Kazakhstan's Kazbek Nogerbek won the tournament with 8.5 points in 11 games. Russian players Alexey Gribnev and Rudik Makaryan finished 6th and 8th, respectively, with 7.5 points each. Shipov said, 'I would like to congratulate Kazakhstan, I know this guy, he's very talented and will only get better. Our guys didn't fail, they showed a good game, but it's a weak consolation.' He also added, 'In the absence of stars like Dommaraju Gukesh or Rameshbabu Praggnanandha, we should have taken gold. But something didn't work out, especially the penultimate round, where our guys lost with white.' Shipov also thinks that Gribnev and Makaryan are already ready to play against adults, as they need to focus on games with adults to avoid becoming ordinary or veteran players.'

**Nakamura Can Still Win Norway Chess Despite Consecutive Losses**
Hikaru Nakamura can still win the Norway Chess tournament despite his consecutive losses in the rapid games against Alireza Firouzja and Liren Ding. Nakamura needs to win the final round with the black pieces against Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and for Magnus Carlsen, the leader, to lose with the white pieces against Fabiano Caruana. Ding's victory in the tiebreaker can be bittersweet. The most significant thing is that Ding did not make any serious mistakes, neither in the classical nor in the rapid games. His blunders, typical of a low-level amateur, in previous games made it seem like he would give up the world title, which he must defend against 17-year-old Dommaraju Gukesh in November. The Norway Chess system also creates excitement in the women's tournament, where the final round pits the two Chinese players, Wenjun Ju and Tingjie Lei, against each other. If Anna Muzychuk gains a clear advantage in her game against Humpy Koneru, she will generate a lot of pressure in the duel between the two Chinese players.
