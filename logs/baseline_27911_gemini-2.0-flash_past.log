Okay, I understand the question and the resolution criteria. My task is to estimate the probability that Catalent, Inc. will file its 10-K annual report with the SEC before October 1, 2024. Today is September 4, 2024.

The resolution hinges on the presence of a Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, at the specified SEC Edgar link before October 1, 2024.

Given that today is September 4th, there are less than four weeks (27 days) remaining until the deadline. Companies typically file their 10-K reports within 60-90 days after their fiscal year-end. Since Catalent's fiscal year ended on June 30, the typical filing window has largely passed. The delay suggests potential issues. It could be anything from accounting irregularities to ongoing audits, or perhaps even something more serious relating to the company's financial health.

Given the delay and the potential for negative information being revealed, there is an increased likelihood of further delay. It is also entirely possible that the company will still file on time, so I will not put too low a probability on the event occuring. 

Considering these factors, I'll assign a probability range.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.
