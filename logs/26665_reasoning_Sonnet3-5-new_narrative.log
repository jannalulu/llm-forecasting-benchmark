Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: Well, Phil, another Apple announcement season has come and gone.

Philip Tetlock [looking at his phone]: Indeed. Our models had it at 15.25% for a portless iPhone announcement. The signals were there in the MacRumors leak about the potential Ultra model, but the timeline was just too aggressive.

Nate: Exactly. While Apple's been pushing wireless charging since the iPhone 8, completely eliminating ports is a massive leap. The infrastructure just isn't there yet.

Philip: The supply chain data didn't support it either. No significant changes in component orders that would suggest a portless design.

Nate: Though I must say, that MacRumors article about the iPhone 16 Ultra got everyone excited. But as our models showed, Apple tends to be more conservative with such radical design changes.

Philip: True. They'll get there eventually, but 2024 was just too early.

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: Well, Phil, another Apple announcement season has come and gone.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. You know, our models had it at 15.25% for a portless iPhone announcement. The signals were there with the MacRumors leak about the potential Ultra model, but the timing wasn't right.

Nate: The data suggested Apple wasn't ready to make such a dramatic shift. While they've been gradually moving toward wireless charging, completely eliminating ports was too aggressive for 2024.

Philip: Exactly. The supply chain indicators and Apple's historical pattern of incremental changes told us this was premature. They needed more time to perfect the technology and prepare the market.

Nate: The Ultra model rumors were interesting, but our models correctly identified that Apple would focus on other features first. Sometimes the most accurate predictions are about what won't happen.

[Both sip their coffee thoughtfully]

Nate Silver [stirring his coffee]: Well, Phil, another Apple event has come and gone.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models were spot on about the portless iPhone announcement - we had it at 15.20%.

Nate: The signals were there in those MacRumors reports about the potential iPhone 16 Ultra, but the timeline was always going to be tight.

Philip: True. While Apple's been pushing wireless charging since MagSafe, completely eliminating ports was a bigger leap than they were ready for. The regulatory pressures in the EU for USB-C standardization probably played a role too.

Nate: And let's be honest - the market research must have shown considerable consumer resistance. Going completely portless would've been a bold move, even for Apple.

Philip: Sometimes the absence of an event is just as informative as its occurrence. [takes sip of tea] At least our models caught those headwinds early.
