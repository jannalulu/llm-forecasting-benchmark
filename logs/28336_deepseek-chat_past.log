To forecast whether Prince Tom Iseghohi will win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this election.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: In Nigerian gubernatorial elections, incumbents or candidates from major parties (PDP, APC) typically dominate. Smaller parties like the Action Alliance (AA) rarely win. Historically, AA has not won any governorship elections in Nigeria.
- **Current Context**: Prince Tom Iseghohi, the AA candidate, has withdrawn from the race and endorsed the APC candidate, Monday Okpebholo. This significantly reduces his chances of winning, as he is no longer actively contesting.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Candidate Viability**: Is Prince Tom Iseghohi still a viable candidate? No, as he has withdrawn and endorsed another candidate.
2. **Party Strength**: How strong is the AA in Edo State? The AA is a minor party with limited influence and no history of winning elections in the state.
3. **Electoral Dynamics**: What is the current political climate? The election is highly contested between the PDP, APC, and Labour Party, with no significant support for the AA.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical patterns, minor parties like AA have a near-zero chance of winning gubernatorial elections in Nigeria.
- **Inside View**: Prince Tom Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race, making his victory impossible unless he re-enters, which is highly unlikely given the timing and his endorsement of the APC candidate.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The strongest evidence is Iseghohi's withdrawal and endorsement of the APC candidate. This makes his victory virtually impossible.
- Overreacting to minor factors, such as his initial candidacy or AA's grassroots structure, would be misleading given the decisive nature of his withdrawal.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Against Iseghohi**: Withdrawal from the race, endorsement of APC, AA's lack of electoral strength, and the dominance of major parties.
- **Forces For Iseghohi**: None significant, as he is no longer a candidate.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The trend is clear: Iseghohi is no longer in the race, and the AA has no path to victory.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is almost no doubt that Iseghohi will not win, given his withdrawal and endorsement of another candidate.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- It would be overconfident to assign any significant probability to Iseghohi winning, given the evidence.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- The only potential error would be if Iseghohi re-enters the race, but this is highly unlikely given the timing and his public endorsement of the APC candidate.

### Final Forecast
Given the overwhelming evidence, Prince Tom Iseghohi has no realistic chance of winning the election.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To forecast whether Prince Tom Iseghohi will win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this election.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- No specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus are available for this specific election. However, historical data on Nigerian gubernatorial elections shows that incumbents and major party candidates (PDP, APC) typically dominate, with smaller parties or independent candidates rarely winning.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Candidate Viability**: Assess Prince Tom Iseghohi's chances based on his party (Action Alliance), campaign strength, and endorsements.
2. **Political Landscape**: Analyze the dominance of PDP and APC in Edo State and the likelihood of a third-party candidate winning.
3. **Recent Developments**: Evaluate the impact of Iseghohi stepping down and endorsing the APC candidate, Monday Okpebholo.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, third-party candidates in Nigerian gubernatorial elections have a very low success rate. The Action Alliance is a minor party with limited resources and influence compared to PDP and APC.
- **Inside View**: Prince Tom Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race and endorsed the APC candidate, effectively ending his campaign. This significantly reduces his chances of winning.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The strongest evidence is Iseghohi's withdrawal and endorsement of the APC candidate. This is a decisive event that makes his victory highly unlikely.
- Overreacting to minor factors, such as his initial candidacy or campaign rhetoric, would be misleading given his withdrawal.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Against Iseghohi**: Minor party status, lack of resources, withdrawal from the race, and endorsement of a major party candidate.
- **Forces For Iseghohi**: None significant, as his campaign has effectively ended.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The trend in Nigerian politics is toward consolidation of power by major parties (PDP and APC). Third-party candidates rarely gain traction, and Iseghohi's withdrawal aligns with this trend.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is minimal doubt about Iseghohi's chances given his withdrawal and endorsement of the APC candidate. His victory is highly improbable.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While it is important to remain cautious, the evidence overwhelmingly points to Iseghohi's defeat. Overconfidence in his chances would be unwarranted.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical errors in forecasting Nigerian elections often stem from overestimating the influence of minor parties or underestimating the dominance of PDP and APC. This forecast avoids those errors by focusing on the decisive event of Iseghohi's withdrawal.

### Final Forecast
Given the overwhelming evidence, including Iseghohi's withdrawal and endorsement of the APC candidate, his chances of winning the election are effectively zero.

To forecast whether Prince Tom Iseghohi will win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique dynamics of this election.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: In Nigerian gubernatorial elections, incumbents or candidates from major parties (PDP, APC) typically dominate. Smaller parties like the Action Alliance (AA) rarely win, especially in highly contested states like Edo.

2. **Election Dynamics**: The election is highly contested between the PDP, APC, and Labour Party. The AA is not a major contender.
3. **Historical Precedents**: Smaller parties rarely win in Edo State, and endorsements typically consolidate votes for the endorsed candidate.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces Against Iseghohi**: Withdrawal from the race, lack of major party support, and historical trends favoring PDP/APC.
- **Forces For Iseghohi**: None significant, as he is no longer a candidate.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends
- The trend is clear: Iseghohi is no longer a candidate, and the election is a three-way race between PDP, APC, and Labour Party.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
- There is minimal doubt here. Iseghohi's withdrawal and endorsement of the APC make his victory impossible.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- While it is tempting to assign a 0% probability, I will leave a small margin for extremely unlikely scenarios (e.g., a last-minute reversal).

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical errors might include overestimating the impact of minor candidates. In this case, Iseghohi's withdrawal eliminates any such risk.

Given the overwhelming evidence that Prince Tom Iseghohi has withdrawn from the race and endorsed the APC, his chances of winning are effectively zero. However, to account for extreme uncertainty, I will assign a very low probability.
