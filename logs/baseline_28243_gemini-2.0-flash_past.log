Let's analyze this question. The key is whether a Form 4 will be filed before October 1, 2024, revealing that Trump sold shares of Trump Media.

First, consider the potential motivations for Trump to sell shares. He might need cash, or he might believe the stock is overvalued. However, selling shares would likely be interpreted negatively, potentially hurting the stock price and damaging his image. It's a balancing act.

Second, examine the constraints. Trump is heavily invested, both financially and politically, in the success of Trump Media. A large sale would signal a lack of confidence.

Third, assess the remaining time. From September 17 to October 1 is about two weeks. That's a relatively short window. Any sale would likely need to be planned and executed quickly.

Fourth, consider the information source. The resolution hinges solely on the Trump Media investor relations page. There's a risk, however small, that the page isn't updated promptly. We need to discount slightly for this.

Given these factors:
*   The short timeframe reduces the likelihood of a sale and associated Form 4 filing.
*   The negative optics of a sale make it less probable, even if Trump needs money, as other avenues exist.
*   The reliance on a single website introduces a small risk of non-resolution due to a lack of update.

Therefore, a relatively low probability is warranted.

My Prediction: Between 1.10% and 4.10%, but 2.60% being the most likely. Probability: 2.60%.
