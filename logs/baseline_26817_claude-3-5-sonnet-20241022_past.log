Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timing: The deadline is October 1, 2024, which is only about 2 months away from today (July 31, 2024).

2. Political Context:
- The two-child benefit cap is a controversial policy
- Labour has pledged to abolish it if they win the next election
- However, the next general election isn't required until January 2025
- The current Conservative government has shown no indication of planning to abolish this policy

3. Key Constraints:
- Must be a complete abolition, not just modifications
- Must be officially implemented, not just announced
- Very short timeframe (2 months)
- Current government would need to reverse their long-standing position

4. Analysis:
- The short timeframe makes this highly unlikely
- The current Conservative government has consistently defended this policy
- No significant legislative movement towards abolition is currently in progress
- The timing before a general election makes major welfare policy changes unlikely

Given these factors, especially the very short timeframe and current government's position, the probability is extremely low. While not completely impossible (hence not 0%), the circumstances would require an extremely unlikely sudden policy reversal.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
