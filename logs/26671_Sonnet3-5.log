To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current situation: Macron's Together coalition lost its majority in the June 2024 elections. The left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats (182), followed by Together (168) and the far-right National Rally (143).

2. Government formation: Macron has delayed appointing a new PM until after the Olympics (August 11, 2024). This suggests significant uncertainty and difficulty in forming a government.

3. Coalitions: No single bloc has a majority. Macron has called for a broad coalition, but the left-wing NFP has rejected working with him. This makes a Together PM less likely.

4. Timing: The forecast date (August 31) is just 20 days after the Olympics end. This is a very tight timeline to form a new government if major negotiations are needed.

5. Historical precedent: France has had "cohabitation" governments before when the president's party doesn't control parliament. This could happen again, potentially with a non-Together PM.

6. Macron's position: He remains president until 2027 and constitutionally appoints the PM. He could try to appoint a Together PM, but they may not survive a confidence vote without broader support.

7. Olympic factor: The delay until after the Olympics could work in Macron's favor by giving more time for negotiations, potentially increasing chances of a Together PM.

8. Public opinion: The election results suggest dissatisfaction with Macron's leadership, which could make it harder to justify a Together PM.

Balancing these factors, I assess that a Together PM is possible but not highly likely. The lack of a clear majority for any bloc, the rejection of cooperation by the largest bloc (NFP), and the public's apparent desire for change all work against it. However, Macron's constitutional power and the potential for post-Olympic negotiations provide some possibility.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current situation: Macron's "Together" coalition lost its majority in the June 2024 elections. The left-wing "New Popular Front" won the most seats (182), followed by Macron's coalition (168), and the far-right "National Rally" (143).

2. Prime Minister appointment process: The President appoints the Prime Minister, but they need support from the National Assembly. Without a majority, Macron will need to form alliances or appoint someone acceptable to other parties.

3. Timing: Macron has stated he won't appoint a new PM until after the Olympics (August 11, 2024). This gives time for negotiations but also increases uncertainty.

4. Coalition possibilities: Macron's coalition could potentially form an alliance with moderate elements of the left or right, but this seems difficult given the current political climate.

5. Alternatives: If Macron can't form a workable coalition, he might appoint a technocratic or compromise candidate not affiliated with any party.

6. Historical precedent: France has had periods of "cohabitation" before, where the President and PM are from different parties. This could happen again.

7. Political pressure: There will be strong pressure from the left-wing coalition to appoint one of their members as PM, given their plurality in the Assembly.

8. Macron's strategy: He seems to be delaying the decision, possibly hoping to negotiate a more favorable outcome or wait for political shifts.

9. Public opinion: The election results suggest dissatisfaction with Macron's policies, which could make it harder for him to appoint a PM from his coalition.

10. Economic and social factors: Ongoing economic challenges and social tensions could influence political negotiations and alliances.

Weighing these factors, it seems unlikely that Macron will be able to appoint a PM from his own coalition, but it's not impossible. The delay in appointment and the fluid political situation add significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully analyze the available information and consider several key factors:

1. Current political situation: The news articles indicate that France held parliamentary elections in June/July 2024, resulting in a fragmented parliament with no clear majority. Macron's "Together" coalition came in second place with 168 seats, behind the left-wing "New Popular Front" with 182 seats.

2. Prime Minister appointment process: In France, the President appoints the Prime Minister, but they typically need support from a parliamentary majority. 

3. Macron's statements: Macron has said he will appoint a new Prime Minister after the Paris Olympics, which end on August 11, 2024. This means a new PM will likely be in place by August 31.

4. Coalition dynamics: Macron has called for parties to work together to form a broad coalition, suggesting he may try to form a government that includes parties outside his own coalition.

5. Opposition stances: The left-wing coalition has proposed their own PM candidate, but Macron has rejected this. The far-right National Rally also seems unlikely to join a coalition with Macron.

6. Historical precedent: France has had periods of "cohabitation" before, where the President and PM are from different parties. However, this is less common since the shift to five-year presidential terms.

7. Timeline: There's limited time between the Olympics ending (August 11) and the date in question (August 31) to form a new government, which could favor maintaining the status quo.

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for a "Together" coalition PM:
- Macron still has the constitutional power to appoint the PM
- "Together" has the second-largest bloc of seats
- Limited time to negotiate complex coalition agreements
- Macron may prefer to maintain control rather than cede power

Arguments against:
- "Together" lacks a majority, making governing difficult
- Pressure to respect election results that put left-wing coalition first
- Potential backlash if Macron is seen as ignoring voters' wishes
- Possible need to compromise with other parties to form a government

Balancing these considerations, I believe there's a significant chance the PM will be from Macron's coalition, but it's far from certain. The fragmented parliament and Macron's calls for a broad coalition introduce substantial uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully consider the available evidence and political dynamics in France. Let's break it down:

1. Current situation: As of July 2024, Macron's "Together" coalition does not have a majority in the National Assembly. The left-wing "New Popular Front" coalition won the most seats (182) in the recent elections, followed by Macron's coalition (168), and then the far-right National Rally (143).

2. Government formation: Macron has stated he will not appoint a new prime minister until after the Paris Olympics, which end on August 11, 2024. This gives him about 20 days to form a government before the August 31 deadline in the question.

3. Political landscape: France is facing a fragmented parliament with no clear majority. Macron has called for a "grand coalition" and urged parties to work together.

4. Historical precedent: In similar situations of "cohabitation" in France, presidents have typically appointed prime ministers from the majority coalition in parliament.

5. Potential outcomes:
   a) Macron appoints a prime minister from his own coalition, maintaining control but risking political deadlock.
   b) Macron appoints a prime minister from the left-wing coalition, following historical precedent but ceding significant power.
   c) A compromise candidate is found, possibly from a centrist faction of the left or a moderate right-wing party.

6. Timing: The delay until after the Olympics could work in Macron's favor, giving him time to negotiate and possibly form new alliances.

7. Public opinion: The French public may prefer a compromise solution to avoid political gridlock, which could influence negotiations.

Weighing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance that Macron will not be able to appoint a prime minister from his own coalition. However, the situation is fluid and complex, with multiple possible outcomes.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

4. Historical precedent: In past "cohabitation" scenarios, the President has usually appointed a PM from the opposition majority.

5. Time pressure: With the Olympics ending August 11 and the question asking about August 31, there's limited time for complex negotiations.

6. Macron's stance: He's called for a "broad coalition" and emphasized stability, suggesting he may try to keep a PM from his alliance.

7. Opposition stance: The left-wing alliance has proposed their own PM candidate, indicating resistance to a Macron-aligned PM.

Weighing these factors:
- The election results make it less likely for Macron's coalition to retain the PM position.
- However, the fragmented parliament and Macron's emphasis on stability could lead to compromise.
- The short timeframe may favor maintaining some continuity in government.

Given these considerations, I estimate there's a moderate chance that the PM on August 31, 2024 will be from Macron's "Together" coalition, but it's more likely they won't be.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, with 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current situation: Macron's "Together" coalition lost its majority in the June/July 2024 elections. The left-wing "New Popular Front" won the most seats (182), followed by Macron's coalition (168), and the far-right "National Rally" (143).

2. Government formation: Macron has stated he will not appoint a new Prime Minister until after the Paris Olympics (ending August 11, 2024). This gives time for negotiations and coalition-building.

3. Potential outcomes:
   a) Macron forms a coalition with moderate left parties, keeping PM from his alliance
   b) Left-wing alliance forms government, new PM not from Macron's coalition
   c) Macron forms minority government, keeping PM from his alliance
   d) Grand coalition formed, PM could be from Macron's alliance or elsewhere
