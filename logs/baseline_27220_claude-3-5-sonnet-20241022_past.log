Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The question asks about Ukraine holding territory 5+ miles into Russia in Kursk Oblast AND at least one other oblast by October 1, 2024.

2. Current situation (August 2024):
- Ukraine has conducted some cross-border raids but hasn't held significant Russian territory
- Ukraine's counteroffensive has struggled against Russian defenses
- Ukraine is facing ammunition shortages and military constraints

3. Key factors to consider:
- Only ~6 weeks until resolution date
- Ukraine's current military capabilities are limited
- Russia has fortified border regions
- Ukraine's strategy has focused on defensive operations
- Taking and holding territory 5+ miles inside Russia would require significant resources
- Multiple oblasts requirement makes this more challenging

4. Constraints:
- Very short timeframe until October 1
- Need for both Kursk AND another oblast
- Must be 5+ miles deep
- Must be held/controlled (not just raided)

Given:
- The extremely short timeline
- Current military situation
- Multiple requirements that must ALL be met
- Ukraine's focus on defending its own territory
- Resource constraints

The probability must be very low, but not impossible given Ukraine's demonstrated ability to conduct some cross-border operations.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 2.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.
