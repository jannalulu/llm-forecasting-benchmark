Let's systematically analyze this forecasting question:

Key Observations:
1. Current Status (July 31, 2024):
- RFK Jr. currently has 1.3 million TikTok followers
- 2 months remain until resolution date (September 30, 2024)
- He's running an independent presidential campaign
- Uses social media strategically to reach younger voters

Trend Analysis:
- Trump gained 5.6M TikTok followers rapidly
- Biden has 360K followers
- RFK Jr. seems focused on social media engagement

Growth Potential Factors:
+ Independent candidate status might attract viral attention
+ Campaign likely to intensify social media efforts
+ TikTok's large youth user base (170M US users)
- Potential platform challenges/potential TikTok restrictions

Calculation Logic:
- Current followers: 1.3M
- Needed growth: 13.7M more
- Monthly growth required: ~6.85M/month
- Extremely high but not impossible with viral content/campaign push

Risk Factors:
- Potential TikTok ban/restrictions
- Platform algorithm changes
- Campaign dynamics

Bayesian Adjustment:
- Base rate of extreme social media growth: Low
- Unique campaign circumstances: Moderating factor

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 25.50%, but 12.75% being the most likely. Probability: 12.75%.

Let me carefully analyze this forecasting problem step by step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Current TikTok Follower Count
- RFK Jr. currently has 1.3 million TikTok followers (as of June 2024)
- This represents a significant but not massive base

2. Campaign Social Media Strategy
- RFK Jr. has explicitly used TikTok as part of his campaign strategy
- Article notes he's using social media platforms like TikTok to increase visibility
- Suggests intentional effort to grow digital following

3. Platform Dynamics
- TikTok has 170 million US users
- Young voter demographics are key target
- Political content can rapidly gain traction

4. Growth Trajectory
- Need to gain ~13.7 million more followers in ~3 months
- Requires approximately 4.6 million new followers per month
- Extremely aggressive growth requirement

5. Comparative Context
- Trump gained 5-9 million followers quickly
- Biden has ~350,000 followers
- Shows rapid follower acquisition is possible but not guaranteed

Probability Calculation Reasoning:
- Base probability of such extreme growth is low
- Campaign motivation and existing strategy provide upside
- Platform virality potential exists
- Significant hurdles to massive follower expansion

Adjustment Factors:
- Subtract for difficulty of massive follower growth
- Add for strategic social media focus
- Subtract for potential platform restrictions
- Add for Kennedy's media profile

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 15.00%, but 9.50% being the most likely. Probability: 9.50%.
