Nate Silver: [shuffling through papers] Well, Philip, another interesting case with the CDC's mpox risk assessment.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models were quite clear on this one. Based on the data available through August 23rd, we calculated only a 12.5% probability that the CDC would elevate their risk assessment above "Very Low."

Nate: The models considered several key factors: the limited spread in the US, high vaccination rates in vulnerable populations, and effective treatments available. Even with that concerning clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, it wasn't enough to trigger an elevation in risk level.

Philip: Correct. The CDC maintained their "Very Low" assessment through September. The combination of robust public health measures and learned experiences from the 2022 outbreak really kept this one in check.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the boring prediction is the right one.

[Both chuckle and return to their data analysis]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "So, about that mpox risk assessment prediction..."

Tetlock: "Ah yes, whether the CDC would raise it above 'Very Low' before October. Our models gave it a 15.5% probability."

Nate: "And we were right again. Despite that concerning spread in Sub-Saharan Africa they mentioned in August, the CDC maintained their 'Very Low' risk assessment through September."

Tetlock: "The key factors were clear: high population immunity from previous vaccination campaigns, limited transmission patterns, and effective treatments remaining accessible. Even with that July 8th note about updating their assessment, our models suggested they wouldn't escalate it."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Want to grab coffee?"

Nate: *shuffling through papers* Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again about the CDC's mpox risk assessment.

Philip: Indeed. Despite the concerning spread of clade I mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa that the CDC noted in August, our models gave only a 12.5% probability that they'd raise the risk level above "Very Low."

Nate: The key factors were there - high population immunity from previous outbreaks and vaccinations, limited transmission patterns, and effective treatments readily available. Even with that July 8th assessment update pending, the data didn't support escalation.

Philip: *nodding* The models accounted for historical CDC risk assessment patterns too. They rarely elevate risk levels without substantial evidence of increased transmission or severity in the US population.

Nate: No, our models had it at 12.5%. Another accurate forecast in the books.
