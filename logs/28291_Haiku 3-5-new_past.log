Let me analyze this systematically:

Base Rate Analysis:
1. This is a specific question about a company's SEC filing deadline
2. Many companies are struggling with SEC filing deadlines in 2024, as evidenced by multiple news articles about late filings

Key Evidence:
- Laredo Oil is a small OTC-traded company
- Most recent news about Laredo Oil (Sept 16, 2024) shows they're actively operating and acquiring assets
- No explicit warning signs about financial reporting problems
- No Nasdaq delisting notices found in the provided articles
- Fiscal year ends May 31, 2024 (giving them several months to prepare filing)

Risk Factors:
- Small companies often have more difficulty meeting regulatory filing deadlines
- OTC companies have less stringent immediate reporting requirements compared to NASDAQ/NYSE listed firms
- Current date is September 18, 2024 - very close to the October 1 deadline

Comparative Context:
- Many companies in 2024 have received filing delay notices
- But many are also successfully filing, just sometimes late

Balancing Considerations:
- They seem operationally active
- No explicit red flags about financial reporting
- Reasonable time since fiscal year end

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 85.00%, but 77.50% being the most likely. Probability: 77.50%.

Reference Class Analysis:
1. Looking at the provided articles, there's a clear trend of SEC filing delays in 2024:
- Multiple companies received Nasdaq non-compliance notices
- Several firms filed late 10-K/10-Q reports
- Extended filing deadlines seem common

Specific Laredo Oil Considerations:
1. Positive Signals:

- Company appears to be functioning and making business moves

2. Potential Risk Factors:
- No direct indication of filing status in provided materials
- Small OTC-traded company might have reporting challenges
- No explicit commitment to filing timeline visible

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Base rate for timely filing: ~70-80%
- Company-specific uncertainty: -10-15%
- Current market filing delays trend: -5-10%

Adjustment Factors:
- Small company size increases filing uncertainty
- No red flags suggesting catastrophic reporting issues
- Still time before October 1 deadline

Risk Balancing:
- Overconfidence risk: Underestimating filing challenges
- Underconfidence risk: Assuming worst-case scenario

Calibration Approach:
- Account for market trends
- Consider company's apparent operational stability

My Prediction: Between 62.50% and 77.50%, but 70.25% being the most likely. Probability: 70.25%.
