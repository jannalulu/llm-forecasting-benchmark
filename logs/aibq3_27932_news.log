**China On The Verge: Welfare State Crumbles, Explosion In Social Unrest As Youth Unemployment Soars, Strikes Surge**
China's economy is facing a severe slowdown, with youth unemployment soaring to a record 21.3% in August 2023, and the overall unemployment rate increasing to 5.2% in July 2024. The government has attempted to downplay the issue by changing the way unemployment data is reported, but experts believe that the numbers are being manipulated to hide the true extent of the problem. The rise in unemployment is particularly concerning among young jobseekers, with a record 11.79 million tertiary graduates entering the labor market in 2024. Many fresh graduates have had to scale back their salary expectations by a third due to the economic downturn. Labor strikes have increased by 3% in the first half of 2024, with 80% of incidents involving the property and manufacturing sectors. Worker unrest is a reflection of the growing pressures on the economy, with many workers facing long working hours, low wages, and limited social security coverage. The government has vowed to improve the social security system, but experts believe that this will be a difficult task, and that a stimulus bazooka may be necessary to address the issue.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Rises to 17.1%**
China's unemployment rate among youth has risen to 17.1% in July, the highest level this year, according to official data. The numbers show a significant increase in unemployment among young people, aged 16-24, compared to 13.2% in June. This rate peaked at 21.3% in June 2023, after around 12 million university graduates entered the job market in China, increasing competition in a difficult job market. China is facing increasing youth unemployment, as well as a real estate sector burdened with debt and trade issues with the West. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has called for listening to struggling companies and addressing their difficulties. 'We need to listen to the voices of struggling companies and help them overcome their difficulties,' Li said.

**Youth Unemployment in China Rises Sharply**
According to China's national statistics bureau, youth unemployment has risen significantly to 13.2% in the latest month, a substantial increase from the previous month's 13.2%. This surge in unemployment highlights the ongoing challenges facing the world's second-largest economy, including unrest in the real estate market, a trade war, and a decline in consumer confidence. The current numbers and previous trends show that youth unemployment has reached its highest point since the beginning of the year, when the statistics bureau introduced a new measurement method. This change in methodology, which excludes students from the youth unemployment figures starting from December 2023, has led to a decrease in reported youth unemployment rates. However, the actual numbers may be higher, as the previous record high of 21.3% in June last year is no longer reported separately due to the claimed improvement in the measurement method.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Rises to 17.1% in July**
China's youth unemployment rate has risen to 17.1% in July, according to official data, the highest level this year. The country is facing increasing headwinds, including rising youth unemployment, a real estate sector burdened with debt and commercial issues with the West, according to AFP. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called on struggling companies to 'seriously address their difficulties', according to state news agency Xinhua. The data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed a significant increase in the youth unemployment rate among those aged 16-24, compared to 13.2% in June. The rate had peaked at 21.3% in June 2023, before the authorities stopped releasing the data and changed their methodology, excluding students. Approximately 12 million students graduated from university in China in June this year, leading to increased competition in a tough job market, which may explain the sharp rise in unemployment in July. President Xi Jinping had announced in May that fighting youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The data is disappointing, with the youth unemployment rate among those aged 25-29 rising to 6.5% in July, compared to 6.4% in the previous month. The overall unemployment rate was 5.2%. However, the statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics do not provide a complete picture of the employment situation in China, as they only consider urban areas. The new unemployment data comes after other disappointing Chinese economic data, including industrial production figures that show a decline, despite recent government measures to boost growth. Trade barriers are also increasing, with industrial production growth slowing to 5.1% in July, compared to 5.3% in June, and below expectations. Major cities in China have also seen a further decline in property prices last month, indicating a slowdown in demand. Additionally, demand for bank loans has fallen for the first time in around 20 years, according to official data released earlier this week.

China's youth unemployment rate has risen to 17% in July, according to official data, reaching its highest level this year. The country is facing increasing winds of adversity, including rising youth unemployment, a real estate sector burdened with debt, and commercial problems with the West.

The data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed a significant increase in the youth unemployment rate, compared to 13.2% in June. The rate had peaked at 21.3% in June 2023 before the authorities stopped releasing the data and changed their methodology, excluding students.

However, the statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics only provide a partial picture of the employment situation in China, as they only consider urban areas. The new unemployment data comes after other disappointing Chinese economic data, including industrial production figures that show weakness, despite recent government measures to boost growth. Industrial production growth slowed to 5.1% in July, compared to 5.3% in June, falling short of analysts' expectations. Major cities in China also saw a decline in property prices last month, indicating a slowdown in demand. Additionally, demand for bank loans declined for the first time in about 20 years, according to official data released earlier this week. The country is facing increasing international challenges, including increased trade barriers imposed by the European Union and the United States to protect their markets from Chinese low-cost products and what they consider unfair competition.

**How China's growing unemployment has given rise to ‘rotten tail kids'**
China is facing a severe economic issue with millions of youth remaining jobless. This has given rise to the term 'rotten tail kids', a term popularized on social media. The youth unemployment rate has exceeded 20% with over 100 million youth between the ages of 16-24 years jobless for the first time in April last year. Despite government efforts to create more job opportunities, the outlook remains uncertain, leading to widespread pessimism among young job seekers. Many college graduates are accepting low-paying work or relying on their parents' pensions. Some have even turned to crime. As one graduate, Zephyr Cao, said, 'If I worked for three or four years after my undergraduate studies, my salary would probably be similar to what I get now with a master's degree.' The root cause of the problem is the supply of graduates exceeding job demand, which is expected to continue until 2037. According to a study, the supply of tertiary students will exceed demand from 2024 through 2037, and new college graduates will likely peak at around 18 million in 2034.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits 17.1% in July**
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the youth unemployment rate in China has risen to 17.1% in July, the highest level of the year. This is a significant increase from June, when the rate was 13.2%. Although this is still lower than the peak of 21.3% in June 2023, it is more than three times the overall unemployment rate. As reported by Cip, this data is still a concern, especially considering the authorities' decision to suspend the publication of monthly updates on youth unemployment.

**China's Economic Woes Deepen With Sky-High Youth Unemployment**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached 17.1 percent, the highest since the country resumed reporting on the metric earlier this year. According to the Chinese Statistics Bureau, this is a 3.9 percent jump from June and a significant increase from the 21.3 percent rate reported in June 2023. The new methodology, which excludes students, rural unemployed, and those who have given up looking for a job, has resulted in a slightly lower but still double-digit figure. Chinese President Xi Jinping has stated that boosting youth employment should be a 'top priority' for the country. The nearly 12 million college students who graduated in June have intensified competition, with many young Chinese struggling to find work amid intense competition and the post-pandemic malaise in the country. As Steve Tsang, director of SOAS University of London's China Institute, noted, putting money in the hands of younger Chinese citizens would be an effective form of economic stimulus, given their propensity to spend and the low consumer confidence in the country.

**China's Youth Unemployment: The Rise of 'Rotten-Tailed Children'**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached 20%, affecting millions of university graduates. Some are forced to accept low-paying jobs, while others rely on their parents' retirement pensions. This has created a new class of workers known as 'çürük kuyruklu çocuklar' (rotten-tailed children). According to Reuters, the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds in China has exceeded 20% for the first time in April last year, reaching a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. However, the Chinese government has made changes to the way it calculates unemployment rates, which has led to a revised rate of 17.1% in July this year. The situation is further complicated by the fact that 12 million university students will graduate this summer and the economy is still struggling with a housing crisis. Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized the importance of finding jobs for young people, and the government has called for more channels for young people to access potential employers and has implemented supportive employment policies to help increase employment. According to Yun Zhou, a sociology assistant professor at the University of Michigan, 'For many Chinese university graduates, the expectation of better jobs, upward social mobility, and a brighter life is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve.' Many young people are returning to their hometowns and relying on their parents' retirement pensions and savings. Even those with advanced degrees are not immune to this situation. The 'çürük kuyruklu çocuklar' phenomenon highlights the difficulties faced by educated young people in the job market. The government's measures have not been enough to solve the problem, and the situation is expected to worsen in the coming years, posing a critical challenge to China's economic and social stability.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Rises for the First Time Since February**
According to data released by the Chinese Bureau of Statistics, the youth unemployment rate in China has increased significantly for the first time since February. The data shows that the unemployment rate among 16-24 year olds rose to 17.1% in July, compared to 13.2% in June. The bureau attributed this increase to the graduation season, where 11.8 million new graduates joined the workforce this year, a 2% increase from 2023. Meanwhile, the data also shows that the urban unemployment rate rose to 5.2% in July, up from 5.0% in June.

**China's youth unemployment reaches a record high of over 17% in July under the new system introduced in December**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 17.1% in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This is the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December. The unemployment rate for people ages 16 to 24, and not in school, rose from 13.2% in June. Statistics bureau spokesperson Liu Aihua attributed the rise in the urban jobless rate in July to graduation season, while acknowledging pressure on employment overall. The urban unemployment rate across all age categories ticked higher to 5.2% in July versus 5% in June. Liu Aihua said, 'The rise in the urban jobless rate in July is largely due to graduation season.'

**Youth Unemployment in China Rises to 17.1%, Highest Level This Year**
China's youth unemployment rate rose to 17.1% in July, the highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This is an increase from 13.2% in June and is likely an underestimation due to the government's history of manipulating unemployment data. The unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds is almost triple the rate for 25 to 29-year-olds and well over triple the general unemployment rate. Experts warn that this is a gloomy harbinger of times to come as the largest group of university graduates in China's history is about to enter the job market. Business Standard noted that Chinese industries are reluctant to hire more staff due to low consumer demand, and job creation in the service sector appears to be healthier than in manufacturing. Analysts also pointed out that demand for bank loans contracted for the first time in nearly 20 years, indicating a decline in economic growth.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**
The unemployment rate among young people in China has surged to 17.1% in July, according to official data, reaching the highest level this year. This is due to increased competition on the job market, exacerbated by the high unemployment rate among young people, a credit bubble in the housing market, and escalating trade tensions with the West. Premier of the State Council of China, Li Qiang, has called for listening to companies facing difficulties and addressing their problems. The unemployment rate among people aged 16-24, published by the State Statistics Bureau, has significantly increased compared to 13.2% in June. The recent graduation of nearly 12 million students from Chinese universities has further intensified competition on the already complex job market, likely explaining the sharp jump in unemployment in July. Earlier, President Xi Jinping stated that combating youth unemployment should be given top priority. The unemployment rate for 25-29-year-olds in July was 6.5%, up from 6.4% in the previous month, while the overall labor force rate was 5.2%.

**China Youth Unemployment Jumps To 17.1% In July**
China's youth unemployment rate jumped to 17.1 percent in July, the highest level this year, according to official figures. Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for struggling companies to be 'heard' and 'their difficulties truly addressed'. The unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds was up from June's 13.2 percent, with nearly 12 million students graduating from Chinese universities in June, heightening competition in the job market. The unemployment rate among 25- to 29-year-olds was 6.5 percent, and for the workforce as a whole, it was 5.2 percent. However, the figures only account for urban areas, and other economic data from Beijing is also disappointing, including industrial production growth weakening to 5.1 percent in July. International challenges are also mounting, with the European Union and the United States imposing trade barriers to protect their markets from low-cost Chinese products.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**
The youth unemployment rate in China has risen to a record 17.1% in July, according to AFP. This is a 4 percentage point increase from June, when the rate was 13.2%. The rate was previously at a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, but the authorities stopped publishing the data, citing the need for 'continuous improvement' in statistical work. The recent increase is attributed to the 12 million graduates who entered the workforce, according to journalists. This is in addition to the decline in investments in the real estate sector, which fell by 10.2% in the first seven months of the year, and the decrease in the total area of buildings completed, which dropped by 21.8% and 12.7% in the residential and construction sectors, respectively.

**China's Graduate Flood**
China's young generation is facing frustration due to high unemployment rates. According to the data, the unemployment rate for people aged 16 to 24 in cities reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. Graduates from universities and vocational colleges accounted for 70% of the unemployed young in 2022, a significant increase from 9% two decades ago. Experts note that graduates from elite universities earn roughly a third more from their first job compared to those from second-tier universities. However, students from poor counties in China are seven times less likely to attend university and 11 times less likely to get into an elite one compared to their urban counterparts. The overall official unemployment rate in China stood at 5.2% in the first quarter of 2024.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Rises Amid Economic Challenges**
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the youth unemployment rate in China has increased significantly from 13.2% in June to 21.3% in June 2023, before the authorities revised their methodology and excluded students from the figures. This year's increase is partly attributed to the approximately 12 million university graduates who entered the job market in June, making it even harder for young people to find employment. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the need for government support during economic downturns and called for recognition and addressing of businesses' struggles. The overall unemployment rate remained at 5.2%, but this statistic does not account for rural job markets, potentially downplaying the full extent of the employment crisis. China's economic challenges extend beyond the job market. The latest data also shows a slowdown in industrial production growth, which decreased from 5.3% in June to 5.1% in July, below analyst expectations. The real estate sector continues to struggle, with another decline in property prices in major cities. International pressures are also exacerbating these internal issues. The European Union and the United States are increasingly imposing trade restrictions on low-cost Chinese products, citing concerns over unfair competition. These external factors have contributed to the decline in demand for bank loans, which has been declining for the first time in nearly 20 years. President Xi Jinping stressed the urgency of addressing youth unemployment, highlighting the need to alleviate the economic pressures faced by the younger generation. As China navigates these complex challenges, the government's response will be critical in stabilizing both the job market and the broader economy.

**Unemployment among Chinese Youth Reaches Record High**
The unemployment rate among Chinese youth aged 16-24 reached a record high of 17.1% in July, according to data from the National Statistics Bureau of China, cited by Reuters. This is the highest level since the beginning of the year, significantly exceeding the 13.2% recorded in June. The record unemployment rate among young people was set in June 2023 at 21.3%. In response, the Chinese authorities temporarily suspended the publication of such data and changed the methodology for calculating it, excluding students from the category. In the July 2024 statistics, students are not taken into account; however, as Reuters notes, the July figures may be related to the fact that almost 12 million graduates entered the labor market in June, making it more difficult for young people to find employment. The unemployment rate among people aged 25-29 in July was 6.5%, slightly higher than the 6.4% recorded in June. The overall unemployment rate in China is 5.2%.

According to the National Statistics Office, China's youth unemployment rate increased significantly in July, reaching 17.1%, the highest level since the beginning of the year. This is up from 13.2% in the previous month. In contrast, the overall unemployment rate for the population was 5.2% in July. The youth unemployment rate, which only accounts for the urban population, peaked in June 2023 at 21.3%, but was suspended by authorities and revised due to changes in methodology to exclude students. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, stated in May that combating youth unemployment should be a top priority in the country. The high youth unemployment rate is one of the main problems facing China, along with the severe housing market debt crisis, low consumption, and trade tensions with the West.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Highest Level Since Beginning of Year**
China's youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level since the beginning of the year, with 17.1% of 16-24 year olds unemployed in July, according to official Chinese statistics. This is one of the symptoms of an economy whose growth, while positive, is not as dynamic as expected. The Chinese economy is slowing down, and millions of young graduates are struggling to find work. The government notes that July coincides with the period when young graduates enter the job market, which partly explains the poor results. However, the government has been urged to make tackling youth unemployment a priority, with President Xi Jinping calling for this in May. Young Chinese graduates are looking for more qualified jobs, and Chinese factories are still struggling to find suitable candidates.

**China youth unemployment soars to 17.1%**
China's youth unemployment rate soared to 17.1% in July, the highest level this year, according to official figures. Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for struggling companies to be 'heard' and 'their difficulties truly addressed', according to Xinhua. The unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds increased from 13.2% in June, with nearly 12 million students graduating from Chinese universities this June, heightening competition in the already tough job market. The unemployment rate among 25- to 29-year-olds stood at 6.5% for July, and for the workforce as a whole, it was 5.2%. However, the figures only account for urban areas and do not provide a complete picture of China's employment situation. The new unemployment figures come on the heels of other disappointing economic data, including dampened industrial production and a decline in real estate prices. Demand for bank loans also contracted for the first time in nearly 20 years. International challenges are mounting, with the European Union and the United States imposing trade barriers to protect their markets from low-cost Chinese products and perceived unfair competition.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Rises to 17.1%**
China's youth unemployment rate has risen to 17.1% in July, the highest level this year, according to official data. The country is facing increasing unemployment among young people, a real estate sector burdened with debt, and trade issues with the West. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for 'listening' to struggling companies and 'addressing their difficulties seriously', according to the official Xinhua news agency. The numbers released by the National Bureau of Statistics show a significant increase in the unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24, compared to 13.2% in June. The rate had peaked at 21.3% in June 2023 before the authorities stopped releasing the numbers and changed their methodology, excluding students. Approximately 12 million university graduates in China finished their studies in June, increasing competition in a tough job market, which may explain the sharp rise in unemployment. Chinese President Xi Jinping had announced in May that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among young people aged 25-29 was 6.5% in July, compared to 6.4% in the previous month. The overall unemployment rate was 5.2%. The new unemployment numbers come after other disappointing Chinese economic data, including industrial production numbers that show a decline, despite recent government measures to boost growth. The key indicators are: Industrial production growth slowed to 5.1% in July, compared to 5.3% in June, falling short of analysts' expectations. Major Chinese cities have seen a further decline in property prices last month, indicating a slowdown in demand. For the first time in about 20 years, demand for bank loans has fallen, according to official numbers released earlier this week. The country is facing increasing international challenges, including the EU and US imposing increasing trade barriers to protect their markets from Chinese low-cost products and what they see as unfair competition.

**Youth Unemployment in China Rises Sharply**
According to China's national statistics bureau, youth unemployment has risen significantly to 13.2% in the latest month, a substantial increase from the previous month's 13.2%. This surge in unemployment highlights the ongoing challenges facing the world's second-largest economy, including unrest in the real estate market, a trade war, and a decline in consumer confidence. The current numbers and previous trends show that youth unemployment has reached its highest point since the beginning of the year, when the statistics bureau introduced a new measurement method. This change in methodology, which excludes students from the youth unemployment figures starting from December 2023, has led to a decrease in reported youth unemployment rates. However, the actual numbers may be higher, as the previous record high of 21.3% in June last year is no longer reported separately due to the claimed improvement in the measurement method.

China's youth unemployment rate has risen to 17.1% in July, the highest level since the beginning of the year, according to official statistics. This is an increase from 13.2% in June, as reported by the Chinese Statistical Bureau. The youth unemployment rate is one of the biggest economic problems in the country.

However, the official statistics only provide an incomplete picture of unemployment in the country, as they only account for urban areas and exclude students from the youth unemployment rate. The Chinese authorities had previously reported a record youth unemployment rate of 21.3% in June last year, but then stopped publishing this specific figure. They only resumed reporting it after adjusting their calculation method in December. China is also facing a severe crisis in the real estate sector and trade disputes with the West, and the economic recovery after the end of the strict COVID-19 measures has been slow. 'The youth unemployment rate is a major concern for us,' said an unnamed official. 'We need to take targeted measures to address this issue and help young people find employment.'

The government has announced a plan to stimulate consumption, including measures such as increasing the offer of elderly care services, developing childcare services, and reducing taxes on income.

'The fight against youth unemployment is our absolute priority,' said President Xi Jinping in May. The government is trying to reverse the trend by cutting interest rates and implementing economic stimulus measures.

**China's youth unemployment hits new high amid economic challenges**
China's youth unemployment rate has hit a new high of 17.1% in July, up from 13.2% in June, according to the country's statistics bureau. This sharp increase reflects a broader slowdown in the economy, with employers hesitant to hire due to various economic challenges. The employment landscape has become increasingly competitive, with 12 million students graduating this summer and top universities' candidates vying for remote rural area roles. The July rate is the highest recorded since December 2023, when officials adjusted the methodology. In contrast, the services sector provided a glimmer of hope, with employment rising at its fastest pace in 11 months, according to the Caixin/S&P Global services purchasing managers' index survey. However, concerns persist about the impact of youth unemployment on the broader economic stability and the Communist Party's leadership.

China's youth unemployment rate has increased significantly, with 17.1% of 16- to 24-year-olds without a job in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches 17.1% in July**
China's youth unemployment rate reached 17.1% in July, according to the country's statistics bureau. This increase occurred during a time of economic challenges, including a trade war, a prolonged real estate crisis, and cautious consumer sentiment, which have slowed hiring. The job market has become increasingly competitive for young people, especially with around 12 million students graduating this summer. Even the best university graduates are now showing interest in rural jobs, highlighting the severity of the employment situation. The youth unemployment rate was previously recorded at 21.3% in June last year, but this figure was suspended due to a change in methodology that excluded students still in school. The July unemployment rate is the highest since December 2023. The unemployment rate for 25-29 year olds was 6.5% in July, while it was 3.9% for 30-59 year olds, excluding university students. A recent survey of factory managers showed that they remain hesitant to hire new workers in the manufacturing sector, which has been stagnant since February 2023. However, the Caixin/S&P Global service purchasing managers' index survey showed that the service sector experienced the fastest employment growth in 11 months in July, providing a glimmer of hope. This increase may bring some optimism to officials concerned about the potential economic and social impacts of high youth unemployment rates.

**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Continues to Decline**
The unemployment rate among young people in China has decreased for the third consecutive month, according to the State Statistical Bureau. In June, the unemployment rate among people aged 16-24 was 13.2%, down 1 percentage point from the previous month. The unemployment rate among those aged 25-29 was also 13.2%, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. The unemployment rate among these age groups has been declining for three months. The State Bureau of Statistics of China suspended the publication of data on youth unemployment in June last year after the rate reached a record high of 21.3%. In January, publication resumed with a new approach, excluding students from calculations, according to The Wall Street Journal. China reported a 5% economic growth for the first half of 2024. Economists say that finding a job for Chinese youth will become a challenging task this year, as a record number of graduates, around 12 million, will enter the labor market. The problem lies in the structural imbalance on the labor market, leading to a shortage of high-paying jobs that young people are looking for. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solving the problem of youth unemployment should be a top priority. China also reported a 5% economic growth for the first six months of the year, with GDP reaching 61.68 trillion yuan (approximately $8.65 trillion). The growth rate has slowed down, with a 1.6% growth rate in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.
