To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical context:
The last confirmed Clade I mpox case in the US was in 2021, involving a traveler from Nigeria. Since then, there have been no reported Clade I cases in the US.

2. Current situation:
- A new, more transmissible Clade Ib strain is causing outbreaks in Africa, particularly in the DRC.
- Cases have increased by 160% in Africa in 2024 compared to 2023.
- The WHO is considering declaring a public health emergency of international concern.

3. Factors increasing probability:
- Increased cases and spread in Africa could lead to more potential exposures.
- The new strain appears more transmissible, potentially increasing the risk of spread.
- Increased global travel post-pandemic may facilitate virus movement.

4. Factors decreasing probability:
- The CDC states the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the US is "very low" due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected countries.
- Existing surveillance and health measures in the US may detect and contain potential cases quickly.
- The timeline is relatively short (about 10 months from now until August 23, 2024).

5. Comparative analysis:
During the 2022 global mpox outbreak (Clade II), it took several months for cases to spread widely outside Africa. Given the shorter timeframe and current travel patterns, a Clade I case in the US seems less likely but not impossible.

6. Expert opinions:
Health authorities are concerned about the spread but haven't indicated a high likelihood of cases outside Africa in the immediate future.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a low but non-negligible chance of a confirmed Clade I mpox case in a US resident before August 23, 2024. The increased transmissibility of the new strain and the ongoing outbreak in Africa provide some risk, but the limited travel connections and existing health measures in the US significantly reduce this risk.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 8.00%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical context: The CDC has not confirmed any Clade I mpox cases in US residents to date. This suggests a low base rate.

2. Current outbreak: There's an ongoing Clade I mpox outbreak in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This increases the risk of potential spread.

3. Transmission dynamics: Clade I mpox is more severe and transmissible than Clade II, which could increase the likelihood of cases reaching the US.

4. Time frame: We have about 10 months until the resolution date, providing ample time for potential cases to occur and be confirmed.

5. Travel patterns: There are no direct flights between the US and DRC, which reduces the risk of importation. However, indirect travel is still possible.

6. Vaccination and awareness: The US has stockpiles of effective vaccines, and there's increased awareness among healthcare providers, which could help prevent or quickly identify cases.

7. CDC vigilance: The CDC has issued alerts to clinicians, indicating they're actively monitoring the situation.

8. Previous global spread: In 2022, Clade II mpox spread globally, showing that international transmission is possible.

Balancing these factors:

Lower estimate factors:
- No historical Clade I cases in the US
- Limited direct travel from affected areas
- Existing vaccine stockpiles and awareness

Higher estimate factors:
- Ongoing outbreak in Africa with increased transmissibility
- Long time frame for potential cases to occur
- Previous experience with global mpox spread

Given these considerations, I believe there's a low but non-negligible chance of a Clade I mpox case being confirmed in a US resident before August 23, 2024. The lack of historical cases and limited direct travel suggest a low probability, but the severity of the current outbreak and the extended timeframe prevent me from ruling it out entirely.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 8.00%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical context:
The 2022 global mpox outbreak was primarily caused by Clade II. There's no mention of Clade I cases in the US during that time.

2. Current situation:
- A new, more virulent Clade I strain (Clade Ib) is causing outbreaks in Africa.
- As of August 2024, no Clade I cases have been reported in the US.
- The CDC considers the risk of Clade I importation to the US "very low".

3. Factors increasing probability:
- Ongoing outbreaks in Africa could lead to spread to other continents.
- International travel, though limited from affected areas, still occurs.
- The WHO is considering declaring a public health emergency of international concern.

4. Factors decreasing probability:
- Limited direct travel between affected African countries and the US.
- Heightened awareness and surveillance by health authorities.
- Previous experience with containing mpox outbreaks.
- Short timeframe (about 10 months) until the resolution date.

5. Vaccine and treatment availability:
The Jynneos vaccine is effective against both Clade I and II, which could help prevent spread if a case is imported.

6. Historical precedent:
During the 2022 outbreak, mpox spread globally within months. However, that was Clade II, and the current situation with Clade I seems more contained so far.

Balancing these factors:

The risk appears low but not negligible. The CDC's assessment of "very low" risk suggests a probability below 10%. However, given the virulence of the new strain and the potential for unexpected spread, we shouldn't rule out the possibility entirely.

The short timeframe (10 months) and current containment in Africa are significant limiting factors. However, the unpredictable nature of infectious diseases and the potential for undetected spread mean we should allow for some possibility of occurrence.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 8.00%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.

- A new, more virulent Clade Ib strain has emerged in Africa, particularly in the DRC.
- Cases have increased by 160% in Africa in 2024 compared to 2023.
- The outbreak has spread to neighboring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.

3. Risk of spread to the US:
- The CDC states the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the US is "very low" due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected countries.
- However, international travel does occur, so the risk isn't zero.

4. Time frame:
We have until August 23, 2024, which is about 10 months from now. This provides time for potential spread but also for containment efforts.

5. Detection and confirmation capabilities:
The CDC has the capability to test for both Clade I and II mpox, suggesting they're prepared to detect and confirm cases if they occur.

6. Preventive measures:
- The US likely has heightened awareness and surveillance given the recent alerts.
- Vaccines effective against both clades are available in the US, which could help prevent spread if a case is imported.

Balancing the evidence:

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The CDC's assessment of "very low" risk.
- Lack of direct flights from affected areas to the US.
- No historical precedent of Clade I cases in the US.
- Available vaccines and heightened awareness in the US.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- The significant increase in cases in Africa (160% rise).
- Spread to multiple African countries beyond the initial outbreak area.
- The long time frame (10 months) allows for potential spread.
- International travel, while limited, still occurs.

- US vaccine uptake is relatively low.
- Increased vigilance may lead to better detection if a case does occur.

Considering these factors, I believe there is a small but non-negligible chance of a Clade I mpox case being confirmed in a US resident before August 23, 2024. The primary risk would be from international travelers, despite limited direct travel.

My Prediction: Between 1.50% and 8.00%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Historical context:
The 2022 global mpox outbreak was primarily caused by Clade II. There's no mention of Clade I cases in the US during that outbreak.

2. Current situation:
- A new, more virulent Clade Ib strain is spreading in Africa, particularly in the DRC.
- Cases have increased by 160% in Africa in 2024 compared to 2023.
- The outbreak has spread to neighboring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.

3. Risk of spread to the US:
- The CDC states the risk of Clade I mpox importation to the US is "very low" due to limited travel and lack of direct flights from affected countries.
- However, international travel does occur, and the virus has crossed borders within Africa.

4. Time frame:
We have about 10 months until the August 23, 2024 deadline.

5. Detection capabilities:
- The US has the capability to test for both Clade I and II mpox.
- The CDC has issued alerts to doctors to watch for this strain.

6. Preventive measures:
- The Jynneos vaccine is effective against both Clade I and II.
- However, vaccine uptake in the US is relatively low, with less than 25% of high-risk individuals fully vaccinated.

Balancing the evidence:

Arguments for a lower probability:
- The CDC assesses the risk as "very low."
- There are no direct flights from affected countries to the US.
- No Clade I cases have been reported outside Africa so far.

Arguments for a higher probability:
- The new strain is more virulent and spreading rapidly in Africa.
- It has already crossed borders within Africa.
- The timeframe of 10 months allows for potential spread.
- US vaccine uptake is relatively low.
- Increased vigilance may lead to better detection if a case does occur.
