**Hey, Siri! Let's talk about how Apple is giving you an AI makeover.**
Apple is set to unveil a new version of its talking assistant, Siri, at its annual developer conference on June 10. The new version will be powered by generative artificial intelligence, which will allow Siri to have more conversational and versatile interactions with users. Apple has partnered with OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot, to bring this technology to the iPhone. The new Siri will be able to answer questions, create images, and write software code, and will be marketed as Apple Intelligence. The move is seen as a major shift for Apple, which has been slow to adopt AI technology. The company has a history of transforming markets, and this move could be a significant one for the tech industry.

**Why AI Models Like ChatGPT Struggle with Math and Logic**
Artificial intelligence models like GPT struggle with mathematics and logical thinking. However, these skills are considered a promising path to general artificial intelligence. KI-chatbots still need help with math. There is no published study, no preprint paper, nor official confirmation of its existence. Nevertheless, a KI-model called Q* (Q-Star) made waves in November 2023. Developed by OpenAI, Q* is allegedly capable of solving mathematical problems at the school level with almost 100% accuracy. According to Reuters, insiders at OpenAI see Q* as a breakthrough on the path to general artificial intelligence (AGI). This refers to a KI that, according to a general definition, 'has the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human can perform.'

**Microsoft Demands Profit-Sharing from OpenAI Amid Apple Collaboration**
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has reportedly asked for a profit-sharing agreement with OpenAI, a company that is working with Apple to bring artificial intelligence to iPhones. The collaboration aims to upgrade Siri with OpenAI's AI models. Microsoft has invested around $13 billion in OpenAI and has several projects planned with the company, including the Stargate supercomputer. Microsoft is concerned that the increased demand for servers to process AI requests could lead to a significant increase in costs. The company is hosting ChatGPT on its Azure servers and would need to provide more resources to maintain the services, including its own AI assistant Copilot. The exact percentage of profit-sharing is unknown, but a deal needs to be reached quickly as Apple's WWDC 2024 conference, where the new AI features for iOS 18 will be presented, is scheduled for June 10.

**Mathematics: KI Needs Urgent Help**
A KI model called Q* has been developed by OpenAI, which is capable of solving mathematical problems at a school level with almost 100% accuracy. This has sparked excitement among experts, as it could be a breakthrough on the path to general artificial intelligence (AGI). However, experts point out that current language models like GPT are not yet suitable for solving mathematical problems, as they are limited to statistical predictions and can produce logical errors. To overcome these limitations, researchers are exploring new approaches, such as chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is encouraged to provide step-by-step explanations for its answers, and symbolic artificial intelligence, which involves representing human knowledge in a formal and machine-readable form. These approaches have shown promising results in improving the performance of language models in mathematical tasks.

**Hackers Gain Access to OpenAI's Internal Systems, Steal AI Secrets**
In 2023, a hacker gained access to OpenAI's internal messaging systems and stole details about the company's artificial intelligence technologies. The hacker only breached the internal forum, not the central systems that power OpenAI's algorithms and artificial intelligence framework. OpenAI informed employees about the incident during a general meeting in April 2023, but did not share the information publicly. The company did not report the incident to the FBI or any other law enforcement agency. According to The New York Times, OpenAI did not consider the incident a national security threat because they believed the hacker was an individual with no known ties to a foreign government. However, some employees expressed concerns that adversaries in China could have stolen parts of OpenAI's artificial intelligence secrets, posing a threat to national security in the US. Leopold Aschenbrenner, the leader of OpenAI's superalignment team, was fired in early 2024 for sharing an internal document with external researchers. He claims his dismissal was unfair and that it is normal for OpenAI employees to seek outside opinions. The article also mentions that studies by Anthropic and OpenAI show that current AI is not more dangerous than search engines like Google, but companies must ensure strict security measures. The Biden administration is planning to introduce regulations to impose heavy fines on AI companies that cause social harm.

**OpenAI hacked in 2023, but never told the public**
In January 2023, an unknown hacker breached OpenAI's internal messaging system, stealing details about the company's technology from employee chats. Although the hacker did not access the systems hosting OpenAI's key AI technologies, the incident raised significant concerns within the company and the US government. The breach occurred during an online forum where employees discussed the latest OpenAI technologies. Although OpenAI's systems, where training data, algorithms, results, and customer data are stored, were not compromised, sensitive information was exposed. OpenAI's executives informed employees and the board of directors about the incident in April 2023 but chose not to make it public, citing that no customer or partner data was stolen and that the hacker was likely an individual acting alone without government ties. The incident raised doubts about the security of the company's data. Leopold Aschenbrenner, a technical program manager at OpenAI, criticized the security measures, saying they were inadequate to prevent foreign enemies from accessing sensitive information. Aschenbrenner was later fired for revealing information, which he claims was politically motivated. OpenAI denies that his termination was related to his concerns about security. The incident has heightened fears about potential connections with foreign competitors, particularly China. However, OpenAI believes its current technologies do not pose a significant threat to national security. Nevertheless, the disclosure of such information to Chinese experts could help them progress faster in their AI technologies. In response to the incident, OpenAI has strengthened its security measures, adding 'guardrails' to prevent misuse of AI applications and establishing a Security and Protection Committee, which includes former NSA head Paul Nakasone, to address future risks.

**Why AI Models Like ChatGPT Struggle with Math and Logic**
Artificial intelligence models like GPT struggle with mathematics and logical thinking. However, these skills are considered a promising path to general artificial intelligence. KI-chatbots still need help with math. There is no published study, no preprint paper, nor official confirmation of its existence. Nevertheless, a KI-model called Q* (Q-Star) made waves in November 2023. Developed by OpenAI, Q* is allegedly capable of solving mathematical problems at the school level with almost 100% accuracy. According to Reuters, insiders at OpenAI see Q* as a breakthrough on the path to general artificial intelligence (AGI). This refers to a KI that, according to a general definition, 'has the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human can perform.'

**OpenAI Publishes GPT Model Specification for Fine-Tuning Behavior**
OpenAI has published the Model Spec, a document outlining the rules and objectives for the behavior of their GPT models. The spec is intended for data labelers and AI researchers to create data for fine-tuning the models. The spec includes objectives, rules, and defaults that define desirable model behavior, address high-stakes situations, and provide basic style guidance for responses. OpenAI aims to use the Model Spec as guidelines for researchers and AI trainers and explore how models can learn directly from it. The spec is also intended to guide human labelers in ranking outputs and automate the instruction-tuning process. The rules and defaults in the Spec address common abuses of LLMs, such as preventing the model from ignoring previous instructions or refusing to perform a task.

**Mathematics: KI Needs Urgent Help**
A KI model called Q* has been developed by OpenAI, which is capable of solving mathematical problems at a school level with almost 100% accuracy. This has sparked excitement among experts, as it could be a breakthrough on the path to general artificial intelligence (AGI). However, experts point out that current language models like GPT are not yet suitable for solving mathematical problems, as they are limited to statistical predictions and can produce logical errors. To overcome these limitations, researchers are exploring new approaches, such as chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is encouraged to provide step-by-step explanations for its answers, and symbolic artificial intelligence, which involves representing human knowledge in a formal and machine-readable form. These approaches have shown promising results in improving the performance of language models in mathematical tasks.

**Eat a rock a day, put glue on your pizza: how Google's AI is losing touch with reality**
Google has released a new AI-powered search feature called 'AI Overviews' that generates summaries of search results using generative AI. While it provides useful information on topics like keeping bananas fresh, it can also provide inaccurate or dangerous information, such as recommending eating rocks or putting glue on pizza. The issue is that generative AI tools don't know what is true and are trained on a large chunk of the web, including biased and false information. This raises concerns about the future of search and the potential for AI-generated content to spread misinformation. Google is playing catch-up with OpenAI and Microsoft in the AI race, but its rush to release new technology may put its reputation at risk.
