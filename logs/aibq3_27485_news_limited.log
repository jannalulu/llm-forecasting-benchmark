**Traders now betting on smaller Fed rate cut in September**
The likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at the September 2024 meeting is certain, but traders are now betting on a smaller 25 basis points (bps) cut rather than a jumbo 50 bps cut. According to the latest CME futures prices, the probability of a 50 bps cut has decreased to 32% from 53% last week, while the odds of a 25 bps cut have risen to 68% from 47%. This shift is driven by recent economic data, including positive inflation readings from the PPI and CPI, and stronger-than-expected retail sales data, which supports the view of a soft landing and a smaller cut. As a result, stocks have bounced back strongly after a recent sell-off, with the soft landing theory gaining steam. As Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, said, 'The Federal Reserve uses interest rate adjustments as a tool to control inflation and stabilize the economy. A rate cut can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, while a rate hike can slow down an overheating economy and keep inflation in check.'

**Traders now betting on smaller Fed rate cut in September By Investing.com**
Investors are now betting on a smaller Federal Reserve interest rate cut of 25 basis points (bps) at the September 2024 meeting, rather than a jumbo 50 bps cut. According to the latest CME futures prices, the odds of a target rate of 5.00 - 5.25, representing a 25 bps decrease, have risen to 68% from 47% the previous week. The probability of a 50 bps cut has decreased to 32% from 53%. This shift is driven by recent economic data, including positive inflation readings from the PPI and CPI, and stronger-than-expected retail sales data, which supports the view of a soft landing.

**US Fed must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September or risk recession: Experts | Mint**
Wall Street experts believe that the US Federal Reserve must implement a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a potential recession. The Fed has maintained the benchmark interest rate at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with market expectations. As the US central bank has kept borrowing rates steady for 12 months to combat inflation, experts warn that a more substantial rate cut is necessary to mitigate the looming economic storm.

**Fed expected to cut rates by 25 bps at September meeting: economist survey**
A recent survey of 51 economists by Bloomberg found that most expect the Federal Reserve to cut their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at their next meeting in September, contrary to calls for a 50-bp cut or an inter-meeting move. The economists' view aligns with Fed officials' statements that the central bank will be deliberate and patient in setting policy. Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said, 'We think financial markets might force the Fed to cut inter-meeting but otherwise don't think last week's data is enough of a reason.' The survey found that 60% of economists described the labor market as solid, though somewhat softened, while 24% called it significantly weakened but likely to stabilize. Traders, however, are leaning toward a 50-bp cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, giving that outcome a 54.5% probability vs. a 45.5% probability for a 25-bp reduction.

**What a U.S. Rate Cut Is Nearly Guaranteed**
A 25 bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September is 'nearly guaranteed', according to market expectations. Bank stocks, such as JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, have already been trading at a high level for the year. However, official government reports, including job growth figures, have been found to be inaccurate. The Labor Department reported that total payroll employment from April 2023 to March 2024 was overstated by 818,000, which would change the figure by 0.5%. Despite this, private education, health services, and government added jobs. The Fed's decision to cut interest rates may be delayed if August's inflation report shows that price hikes are not moderating, potentially leading to a rate cut in November or December.

**USD/CAD remains on the defensive below 1.3650 ahead of FOMC Minutes**
The USD/CAD pair remains on the defensive, trading near 1.3620, as markets expect a 25 bps rate cut in September. The US Federal Reserve's (Fed) dovish comments and expectations of a rate cut have weakened the US Dollar. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the US economy does not show signs of overheating, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggested discussing a potential US interest rate cut in September due to concerns about the weakening labor market. Meanwhile, the softer Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reports support the case for another rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC), with traders fully pricing in a 25 bps cut in September and an additional 50 bps of easing for the final two meetings of the year. This might drag the Loonie lower and cap the downside for USD/CAD.

**U.S Fed Officials Signal Possible Interest Rate Cuts in September**
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers are considering a rate decrease in September, shifting gears from maintaining rates constant to cutting rates. According to Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, September is a suitable time to discuss potential Fed rate decreases. The CME FedWatch tool predicts a 25 bps decrease in September with a 75.5% chance. Kashkari's statement suggests a potential shift in Fed policy, which could have significant implications for the US economy.

**US Interest Rate Cut Probability Returns to Majority Scenario**
The probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting US interest rates by 100 basis points (bp) in 2024 has returned to being the majority scenario, according to the CME Group's monitoring. The chance of rates ending the year between 4.25% and 4.50% is now 43.3%. The probability of a smaller cut, of 75 basis points, is 39.4%. For the September meeting, there was a slight increase in the probability of a 50 basis point cut, now at 27.5%. However, the majority view still favors a minimum reduction of 25 bp, with a 72.5% chance. The bets for a larger interest rate cut followed the release of US housing starts data, which fell well above market expectations and raised doubts about the strength of the US economy.

**US Federal Reserve ‘must go big with 50 bps interest rate cut in September' or risk recession: Experts**
The US Federal Reserve has maintained its benchmark interest rates at 5.25-5.50% for the eighth consecutive meeting, in line with Wall Street estimates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has set the stage for a potential rate cut in September, citing progress toward lower inflation and a cooler job market. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, warns that the Fed must 'go big' with a 50 basis point interest rate cut in September to avoid a looming economic storm. Consumer prices in the US rose modestly in July, fueling expectations of a rate cut. Powell said, 'a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table' when the Fed next meets in September.

**The Fed confirmed a rate cut coming in September**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has hinted at a potential rate cut in September, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating that '...a reduction in the policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.' Powell emphasized that the decision will depend on inflation data, but set a relatively low threshold for incoming data. He also rejected the idea of starting with a 50 bps cut. As a result, mortgage rates are expected to decline in the near to medium term, with rates already decreasing from 7.10% to 6.70% in the past month. This has led many buyers to wait for further declines, although this tactic is considered risky.

**Fed Opens Door to Rate Cut in September, Citing Rising Unemployment**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) has maintained its interest rates at their highest level in 20 years, but has opened the door to a potential cut in September, as it is now concerned about rising unemployment rather than just inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, 'If the conditions are met, the rate cut could occur as early as the September meeting.' He added, 'The general sentiment within the committee is that the economy is approaching the time when it will be appropriate to reduce our rates.' This would be the first rate cut since March 2020, when the COVID-19 crisis forced the Fed to lower interest rates to zero. The Fed is now considering a rate cut as the US economy is showing signs of slowing down, and the unemployment rate is expected to rise. The Fed's decision to maintain interest rates at 5.25-5.50% was made unanimously. The Fed is also concerned about the risks of inflation and unemployment, and is trying to balance these two aspects of its mandate. The Fed's next meeting is scheduled for September 17-18, and Jerome Powell is expected to provide more details on the potential rate cut.

**Traders see Sept start to Fed easing, with 25 bps rate cut**
Traders are predicting a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, followed by two more rate cuts in November and December. This comes after the Fed acknowledged 'some further progress' towards its 2% inflation goal. Interest-rate futures contracts were initially pricing in an 89% chance of a 25-basis point reduction in September, but now reflect a 95% chance of a 25 basis-point cut. The balance of bets has shifted from a bigger 50-basis point cut.

**Fed Meeting: Will Interest Rates Be Cut in September?**
The Federal Reserve's (Fed) Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting on Tuesday to determine the US monetary policy, with analysts watching for a possible interest rate cut in September due to the persistent but moderate improvement in inflation. Most analysts expect the Fed to keep interest rates between 5.25% and 5.5%, their highest level since 2001. The focus will be on the press conference by Fed President Jerome Powell, who may provide hints about a possible first cut in September, marking the start of the new semester after the summer. This 0.25 percentage point cut would be in line with the conclusions of most Fed governors, who expect a cut before the end of the year if the data monitored by the issuer - inflation, GDP, and employment - remains on an appropriate track. According to Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, 'a modest 25 basis point cut in September seems probable, and if everything goes well, we could see an additional cut before the end of 2024.' James Knightley, chief economist at ING, notes that analysts should be paying attention to changes in the language of the Open Market Committee's statement, which would be an indicator of a cut in September, something that the data appears to support.

**Fed Meeting May Signal Future Interest Rate Cut**
The Federal Reserve (Fed) is set to hold a meeting today, which may signal a future cut in interest rates to combat high inflation. The Fed has kept interest rates high since last year, ranging from 5.25% to 5.50%, making credit more expensive for Americans. The institution is considering lowering rates in the coming months, but wants to ensure that price increases continue to slow down. The inflation rate has slightly decreased to 2.5% in June, down from 2.6% in May, according to the PCE index. Analysts at BPI expect the Fed to keep interest rates between 5.25% and 5.50% at the July meeting, with a potential first cut of 25 basis points after the summer. Ryan Sweet, chief economist at Oxford Economics, predicts that the Fed will use this meeting to prepare for a potential first rate cut in September. Nathan Sheets, chief economist at Citi, notes that the process of disinflation is underway and suggests that the Fed should start the cycle of rate cuts in September. The September meeting is the last before the US presidential elections, which have recently seen a significant shift after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Despite high interest rates, the US economy remains solid, with the GDP growing at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate rising slightly to 4.1% in June, remaining among the lowest in the past 50 years.
