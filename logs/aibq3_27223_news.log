**Ukraine Invasion Day 899: Incursion operations continue as the fog of war rolls in**
The situation in Ukraine continues to unfold as Russian forces conduct drone and missile strikes against Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have reportedly struck a Russian military convoy east of Rylsk, and there are conflicting reports about the extent of Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast. The Russian military command appears to be relying on existing units to address the ongoing Ukrainian incursion, but may be transferring more experienced units from elsewhere in the theater. Ukrainian forces have also conducted strikes against Russian military targets in occupied Crimea and Donetsk Oblast. The US military is reportedly advocating for a 'hold and build' strategy, where Ukraine focuses on holding territory and building its ability to produce weapons, with the goal of creating a credible threat to Russia and potentially leading to negotiations in 2025.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 9, 2024**
Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces advanced further east in Kursk Oblast, but are likely no longer operating as far north or as far west as previously claimed. Ukrainian forces reportedly struck a Russian military convoy east of Rylsk near Oktyabrskoye, Kursk Oblast. The Russian military command is relying on existing units and readily available forces to address the Ukrainian incursion, but may be transferring more experienced units from eastern or southern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces also conducted strikes against a Russian military airfield in Lipetsk Oblast and other Russian military targets in occupied Crimea and Donetsk Oblast. The Russian military command is increasing the use of chemical agents in Ukraine, violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. The US Department of Defense announced a new military assistance package worth $125 million for Ukraine. Russian authorities have passed several laws aimed at preventing Russians from using telecommunications services or anonymously operating prominent social media channels. Roskomnadzor blocked the Signal encrypted messaging service for violating Russian law.

**Rylsk District Head Announces Evacuation, Then Deletes Post**
The head of the Rylsk district in Kursk Oblast, Andriy Belyusov, initially announced a voluntary evacuation of residents due to security concerns, but later deleted the post. Belyusov stated that the Kursk Oblast administration had made the decision to evacuate residents from border areas for safety reasons. He noted that residents could leave voluntarily using their own transportation or buses provided by the administration, and that they should notify the authorities by calling '112'. Belyusov also mentioned that temporary accommodation centers have been set up in safe areas of the region, and that residents should bring essential documents and valuables. However, the situation is unclear, as some people are searching for transportation to Kursk, while others are advising them to flee to Orel, Kaluga, Smolensk, or Bryansk. It is worth noting that the Ukrainian side has not commented on the situation, while Russian media are reporting that Ukrainian forces have taken control of several settlements in the Sudzhansky district of Kursk Oblast. According to reports, Ukrainian forces have captured over 350 square kilometers of Russian territory and taken dozens of soldiers prisoner in just two days, surpassing the territory captured during the entire counterattack in 2023.

**Russian Expert: Ukrainian Attack on Kursk Region Aims to Take Rylsk**
Russian military expert Vasily Shurygin believes that the main goal of the Ukrainian attack on the Kursk region is to take the city of Rylsk. According to Shurygin, this would allow the Ukrainian forces to claim that they have captured a third of the region and improved their negotiating position. Shurygin thinks that the Ukrainian army has the capability to deploy up to three brigades in the area, but notes that this would leave them with at least two brigades that could be used to reinforce or not, depending on NATO's strategy and Ukraine's tendency to advance along roads for logistical purposes. Shurygin also predicts that the Ukrainians will attempt to increase their efforts and try to break through to Russian territory in the coming days, as they have a significant number of forces committed to supporting the attack.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance Deep into Russian Territory in Kursk Oblast**
On August 6, 2024, the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) entered the territory of Russia in the area of the city of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast. The scale of the operation remains unknown. According to reports, several battalions of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade of the VSU, supported by special forces and air defense systems, crossed the border and by the evening of August 7, had advanced deep into Russian territory. They were met by weak forces, including border guards and infantry from a 'polk prikrytiya granitsy' (a border protection unit) created in 2023, which was largely composed of conscripts. The VSU was able to push through the Russian defenses, despite being hit by Russian air strikes and 'Iskander' missiles. At least one Russian helicopter was shot down. By the evening of August 7, the VSU had achieved several successes, including capturing the 'Sudzha' border crossing and taking several dozen Russian border guards prisoner. They also captured a gas measurement station near the border crossing. The VSU advanced west of the border crossing, reaching the road from Rylsk to Sudzha in the area of Sverdliovo, where they were hit by Russian air strikes and operational-tactical missiles. The main part of the VSU group turned towards Rylsk along the road, capturing the villages of Leonidovo and Zeleny Shlyakh. However, it is unclear if the VSU has entered the city of Sudzha itself, although they have approached it from the west and possibly from the south. The city's quarters have been heavily damaged by Ukrainian shelling, and many civilians remain in the area.

**Russian Forces Thwart Ukrainian Plans to Capture Kursk Nuclear Power Plant**
Russian forces have thwarted the plans of the Ukrainian military to capture the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by August 11. According to General Apty Alaudinov, the Ukrainian forces, which included over 11,000 soldiers, failed to achieve their goal. The Russian military has completed the blockade of the Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region, and the Ukrainian forces are now trying to hold their positions. The Ukrainian forces are also trying to transfer their reserves to the Rylsk area, but the Russian military has taken control of the routes and is preventing them from doing so. The Russian forces have also destroyed three Ukrainian drones and a tank, and have taken control of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. The Ukrainian forces have suffered significant losses, with over 270 soldiers and 16 tanks destroyed in the past day. The Russian military has also stated that they will continue to press the Ukrainian forces and will not allow them to hold onto the Kursk region. The Western countries, including NATO, are skeptical about the Ukrainian forces' ability to hold onto the Kursk region, and believe that the Russian forces will eventually defeat them. The United Nations has also requested access to the Kursk region to investigate allegations of human rights violations by the Ukrainian forces. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our soldiers and the dedication of our people,' said a Russian military spokesperson. 'We will not allow the Ukrainian forces to hold onto the Kursk region, and we will continue to press them until they are defeated.'

**Futurecast .. Ukraine Likely Intends Bryansk and Kursk Oblasts in Russia as Major Locus of the War**
This article speculates on Ukraine's intentions in invading Russia, suggesting that they may be targeting Bryansk and Kursk Oblasts. Recent Ukrainian advances in Korenevo and Rylsk have put them at the doorstep of Bryansk Oblast, which some analysts believe is less well-defended than Kursk Oblast. With secure supply lines from Chernihiv and Sumy, Ukrainian forces can move quickly and easily through the sparsely populated agricultural regions of Russia. The article notes that Russia's slow and bureaucratic military practices will play to the strengths of the fast-moving Ukrainian forces. It also suggests that Russia may retaliate with massive bombing of Ukrainian cities, but notes that this could backfire and harm their own interests. The article concludes by quoting the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, who claimed that the main reason for Russia's invasion of Ukraine was plunder by Russian oligarchs. The author expresses support for Ukraine, saying 'SLAVA UKRAINI! UKRAINI SLAVA!'

**Russia's Response to Ukraine's Advance: A Military Analysis**
According to Colonel Roman Svitana, a military expert and instructor, the Russians have started to try to stop the Ukrainian military's advance in the Kursk region. Svitana believes that the operation will lead to the capture of Rylsk, Lgov, and Kurchatov, and will also aim to disable the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant from the energy grid, which would be a significant blow to Russian military targets. Additionally, the operation may attempt to disrupt Russian forces from the Eastern direction, which is already being done. Svitana stated that after the recent defeat of Putin, a decision was made to transfer a small part of the troops from the Eastern and Zaporizhzhia fronts, 'They have taken a few units from the Robotyne and Chasiv Yar and Toretsk areas,' he said. 'So, they are trying to somehow stop our movement in Kursk.' Svitana also believes that the main driving force behind the decision to allow US strikes on Russian territory will be the British, who are actively promoting the necessary narratives and have influence on the US Congress.

**Ukrainian Operation in Kursk Region: A Tactical Masterstroke**
The Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region of Russia is based on the concept of the operational mobile group, a tactic used by the Soviet army during World War II. According to Sergey Zgurits, director of Defense Express, this tactic has proven to be highly effective. 'The Russian army has forgotten this theory, but Syrskyi has well-studied the history of World War II and adapted it to modern technological advancements,' Zgurits said. In just seven days, Ukrainian forces have taken control of approximately 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. The operation is developing on four fronts: two are advancing deep into enemy territory, targeting Lgov and Kursk, while the other two are expanding the flanking positions, with Rylsk being a key location and the right flank covering the area east of Sudzha. 'The enemy is trying to bring in reserves, but these reserves are being destroyed on the approach,' Zgurits explained. The second echelon of the Ukrainian forces is tasked with securing positions that are advantageous for defense. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that Ukraine is achieving its goals in Kursk and will continue to do so, but is not interested in capturing Russian territory, and the operation is being conducted to protect its territory and population from enemy attacks.

**Russian Military Deploys 810th Marine Brigade to Kursk Region, Creating New Target for HIMARS**
The Russian military has sent 10 KamAZ trucks carrying soldiers from the 810th Marine Brigade to the Kursk region, creating a new target for HIMARS. However, the Ukrainian army is aware of the movement and can strike. According to the 'Atesh' group of Crimean partisans, the 810th Marine Brigade has been redeployed from the Donetsk region to the Kursk region. Video footage of the redeployment was shared in the 'Atesh' Telegram channel. The partisans note that the marine brigade is attempting to close a gap in the Kursk region's border, exposing other areas on the front line. The 810th Marine Brigade was previously redeployed from the Kherson region to Pokrovsk. It is worth noting that trucks carrying soldiers from the 810th Marine Brigade were hit by HIMARS rockets near Rylsk on August 9. The brigade has a significant manpower shortage, with a lack of officers, sergeants, and platoon commanders, as reported on July 28. Given this, it is likely that the brigade has undergone a major overhaul. The 810th Marine Brigade has suffered the most losses during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with the main core of the brigade being destroyed on October 23, 2023, during a celebration of the Russian Artillery Day in the Kherson region, as reported by Dialog.UA.

**Ukrainian Military May Launch Attack on Kursk Region from Rylsk Area**
A former special forces operative, Alexander Arutyanov, has revealed that the Ukrainian military may be planning to attack the Kursk region from the Rylsk area. According to Arutyanov, the enemy has a reserve group in the Rylsk area, which could be activated if the attack on the Korenevo region is successful. Arutyanov stated, 'Rylsk is a border town, just like Sudzha. There are grounds to believe that there is a group opposite Rylsk, ready to take action on our territory. I think it's not acting because it's waiting for a breakthrough in the defense of the attack on Korenevo. When the group from Korenevo goes to Rylsk, the second group will also go to Rylsk. This will create tension on the forces and means that are currently defending the city.' The situation in the Korenevo region is currently stable, with reinforcements being sent to the area and defenses being built.

**Russian Forces Make Significant Gains in Ongoing Special Military Operation**
Russian forces have made significant gains in the ongoing special military operation (SVO) on the Ukrainian front. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, Russian forces have not allowed the Ukrainian military to regroup in the 'Dnipro' area, and have successfully destroyed Ukrainian drones, artillery, and other equipment. In the Kakhovka direction, Russian forces have ensured control over the island zone of the Dnipro River and have prevented Ukrainian forces from regrouping. In the Kharkiv region, Russian forces have made significant gains, with the 110th Motorized Rifle Brigade raising the Russian flag on the western outskirts of Nevsky. In the Kherson region, Russian forces have destroyed a Ukrainian military base and are continuing to advance on the islands. In the Donetsk region, Russian forces have made gains in the town of Maximilianovka, and are continuing to advance in the town of Druzhba. In the Luhansk region, Russian forces have made gains in the town of Sudzh, and are continuing to advance in the town of Rylsk. Ukrainian forces have been using drones extensively in the Volchansk area, but Russian forces have been able to counter this with their own drone capabilities. The Russian Ministry of Defense has reported that Ukrainian forces have suffered significant losses, with 95 soldiers killed and 7 pieces of equipment destroyed. A local resident in the Kursk region has also reported that they have detained and handed over a Ukrainian soldier who had deserted their unit. The Ukrainian government has announced that they will be evacuating residents from 50 villages in the Kherson region, and have also reported that they have evacuated over 18,000 residents from border regions since the start of 2024. Russian forces have also successfully destroyed a Ukrainian tank in a mine trap on the Gorlovka front.

According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which analyzed Russian and Ukrainian sources as well as videos, the attack resulted in significant damage to the convoy and the deaths of numerous Russian soldiers. The attack allegedly took place on Friday near the city of Rylsk. The extent of the damage is still unclear, but the incident is seen as a major setback for the Russian military.

**Ukrainian Forces Achieve Operational Surprise in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian forces, known as the 'Sil obrony', have successfully achieved operational surprise in the Kursk region. They have captured the city of Sudzha and advanced towards the city of Rylsk, with a total of 58 km of the front line under their control. The forces have also taken control of several villages, including Snagost, Korenevo, and Kromskie Biki. The Ukrainian forces have been using a new tactic, where they first clear the skies of Russian drones, then use light and mobile groups to advance quickly into the enemy's territory, followed by the deployment of artillery and air defense systems to secure the area. The Russian forces have been trying to respond, but their efforts have been hindered by the Ukrainian forces' use of HIMARS rocket systems, which have destroyed 14 Russian vehicles and an estimated 200-250 Russian soldiers. The Ukrainian forces have also taken control of around 300 Russian soldiers. The Russian forces are now trying to regroup and respond to the Ukrainian advance, but it remains to be seen how they will do so. The Ukrainian forces' goal is not yet clear, but it is believed that they may be trying to create a threat to the Russian forces' right flank, which could lead to a weakening of their position in the Kharkiv region. The situation is complex and fluid, and it is difficult to predict what will happen next.

**Russians are embattled near the Russian cities of Sudzha and Rylsk**
Ukrainian forces have made significant gains near the Russian cities of Sudzha and Rylsk, according to reports. The Ukrainians took Sudzha and then pushed northwards, taking Rylsk, but the Russians attempted to retake it. However, Ukrainian forces, likely only facing local defense units, were able to hold their ground, with the help of HIMARS, which caused significant losses among Russian Kamaz transports and personnel. The CBC report states that Sudzha is 'somewhat lost', and the blogger notes that the Russians failed to defend Rylsk, resulting in a 35km incursion zone into Russia. This contradicts Putin's claims that Ukraine is not expansionist, and highlights the Russians' problems with reinforcements, armored carriers, and leadership. As one blogger noted, the Russians are 'getting all the problems again'.

**Ukrainian Forces Shift Tactics in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian forces have shifted their tactics in the Kursk region, opting for maneuver warfare to outflank Russian positions. According to military correspondent Alexander Kots, Ukrainian forces are attempting to encircle Russian positions, but their efforts have been unsuccessful. 'What they're calling the encirclement of Sujeh and the capture of Martynovka is actually the action of small mobile groups that pop out onto the roads leading to the villages and mark their presence. The main forces aren't following them yet,' Kots explained. Ukrainian forces are trying to reach the highway from Kursk to Rylsk, and the Rylsky district is being shelled using American HIMARS rocket systems. 'I've seen helicopters and planes all day. Our air defense is working actively,' Kots said. The head of the Rylsky district in Kursk region announced a voluntary evacuation on Friday, with 14 buses evacuating 560 residents by the evening of August 9, out of a total of 30,000 residents. Over half of the residents had evacuated on their own.

**Ukraine's Invasion of Kursk Region May Have Another Goal: Capturing Russian Soldiers for Exchange**
According to Bild, Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region may have another goal - to capture as many Russian soldiers as possible to exchange them for Ukrainian prisoners of war. The Ukrainian leadership has not yet commented on the advancement of the Ukrainian army on Russian territory. However, in his evening address on August 9, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the soldiers who took Russian soldiers prisoner, stating that it is 'extremely important' and 'especially effective over the past three days.' As Bild notes, 'If the exchange fund is replenished, it will be possible to release even more Ukrainian prisoners. Several videos have appeared showing groups of Russian soldiers surrendering, including border guards.' The situation in the Kursk region is as follows: Ukraine has already sent five brigades to the region, including four armored mechanized brigades and one brigade from the independent storm aviation forces. They have occupied approximately 400 square miles of the Kursk region and taken dozens of Russian soldiers prisoner, with no signs of slowing their attacks. Additionally, it was previously reported that a column of Russian military near Rylsk in the Kursk region was destroyed, with Russia potentially losing up to 500 soldiers in the attack.

**Kursk Breakthrough: 'Gray Zone' Maps on August 10**
Fighting continues in the Kursk region of Russia for the fifth day. Ukrainian forces have allegedly taken control of the city of Sudzha and entered the Belgorod region of Russia. According to Russian propaganda channels, Ukrainian forces have advanced further east in the Kursk region. However, some Russian sources claim that the situation has not changed significantly. Ukrainian forces are reportedly consolidating their positions in occupied villages and forests, and preparing engineering works. The area of the so-called 'gray zone' in the border regions of the Kursk region is approximately 73 square kilometers, according to the Deepstate service. The main focus of the fighting remains the city of Sudzha. Russian 'war correspondents' have conflicting reports on the situation in Sudzha, with some claiming that the city is not under Ukrainian control, while others say that Ukrainian forces are slowly encircling it. Ukrainian forces allegedly will not take control of Sudzha, but will try to capture the road to Rylsk, passing through the outskirts of the city. A video appeared in the network, in which a military representative presents himself as a soldier of the 61st Separate Mechanized Steppes Brigade. The military claims that the VSVU allegedly established control over the city and the strategic object 'Gazprom'. However, the VSVU officially did not confirm this information. Ukrainian forces have allegedly entered the village of Poroz in the Belgorod region, which is just over three kilometers from the border with Ukraine in the Sumy region.

**Russian Military Command Resists Troop Redeployment to Avoid Disrupting Offensive Operations**
The Russian military command is resisting the redeployment of troops from other operational directions to avoid disrupting their offensive operations in eastern Ukraine. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Russian military command is relying on existing units stationed near the border and reserve forces in the rear, mostly composed of conscripts and irregular formations, to respond to the situation in the Kursk region. These units are likely to be the first to respond, even if the Russian military command decides to redeploy more experienced units from other parts of the theater of operations. The ISW notes that a more significant redeployment of Russian troops from the rear areas will be slower, and more combat-capable frontline units may begin to arrive in the Kursk region in the coming days. Ukrainian forces have reportedly advanced further east in the Kursk region, but it is likely that they have not advanced as far north or west as previously claimed by Russian sources. Ukrainian forces have also struck a Russian military column east of Rylsk near the village of Oktyabrskoye in the Kursk region. 'The Russian military command may be redeploying more experienced and better-equipped frontline units from eastern or southern Ukraine to the Kursk region, but it will likely take additional time for these units to arrive.'

**Russia does not want to redeploy forces to Kursk to avoid disrupting their offensive**
The Russian military command is resisting redeploying forces from other operational fronts to Kursk Oblast to avoid disrupting their offensive operations in Ukraine's east. Instead, they are relying on existing units, including conscripts and irregular forces, to address the Ukrainian incursion. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Russian military command may be transferring more experienced frontline units from eastern or southern Ukraine to Kursk Oblast, but this would take additional time. A Russian military blogger reported that units from the 44th Army Corps are operating near Rylsk, Kursk Oblast, and it is speculated that the Russian military command might be redeploying forces initially gathered for an offensive in Ukraine's northern Kharkiv Oblast. A broader redeployment of Russian forces is expected to be more gradual, with more capable frontline units likely to arrive in Kursk Oblast over the next few days.

**Russia Transfers Troops to Kursk Region Amid Ukrainian Breakthrough**
Russia has begun to transfer its troops from other fronts to the Kursk region in an attempt to defend against the Ukrainian breakthrough. According to Russian sources, the troops were transferred from the Belgorod and Donetsk regions. However, not all of the columns were able to reach their destination, with one being destroyed near the town of Rylsk. Ukrainian military analysts believe that this transfer of troops may weaken the Russian army's pressure on certain fronts, allowing the Ukrainian forces to gain an advantage. As explained by military analyst Alexander Musiyenko, 'This strategy of diverting Russian reserves to the Kursk region is working and is clearly a good story for our defense on the East.' However, the Russian government continues to claim that they are in control of the situation, despite their own military leaders being confused and contradicting each other. Musiyenko believes that this is an attempt to reassure the Russian public, but that the situation is actually dire for the Russian army.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance Towards Russian Nuclear Power Plant**
Ukrainian forces are reportedly advancing towards the Russian nuclear power plant in Kursk, with reports of drone attacks and artillery strikes on Russian military convoys. According to a video taken from a car, a Russian truck convoy was heavily damaged, with at least a dozen vehicles hit and soldiers' bodies lying on the ground. Military experts from the Russian think tank Rybar confirmed two Ukrainian drone attacks on military convoys near the town of Rylsk in the Kursk region. The region has seen a buildup of Russian troops from the North Group and 20th Army since Thursday, aimed at stopping the Ukrainian advance. Ukrainian forces had successfully launched a surprise attack on Russian territory from the Sumy region on Tuesday, advancing up to the strategic location of Kromskie Byki, 25 kilometers east of the state border, by Friday.

**Kursk Region Update: Russian Military Presence and Ukrainian Forces**
Nikolay Ivanov, a State Duma deputy from the Kursk region, stated that approximately 3-5 thousand people from the second brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) are stationed near Rylsk. He noted that the Ukrainians have 'brought heavy equipment and are starting to make fortifications.' Ivanov also reported that regular units of the Russian Armed Forces (VSF) are being deployed to the Kursk region. 'Wagner Group, 'Akhmat', and other units are arriving, but the breakthrough has not been eliminated yet. The VSU equipment is being destroyed, but from a distance, as a well-armed brigade with a PVO system has entered,' Ivanov said. Meanwhile, Ramzan Kadyrov promised 'good results' in the Kursk region within 2-3 days. He shared his predictions with the publication 'Chechnya Today.' 'Wait two or three days, there will be good results,' Kadyrov said. Yesterday, Apty Alaudinov, the deputy head of the main military-political administration of the Ministry of Defense, stated that one of the 'Akhmat' special forces units is located in the Kursk region. He noted that the Russian military has sufficient forces and means to stop the VSU advance.

**Ukraine Gains Advantage in Kursk Region Ahead of Negotiations with Russia**
A Ukrainian military officer from the 47th Mechanized Brigade, Alexander, stated that the operation in the Kursk region will give Ukraine an advantage during negotiations with Russia. He also noted the information silence surrounding the operation. 'We have big hopes for what I've seen. It's good that there's information silence about the operation on the Kursk direction. I think it will improve our position. We can not only hold off the enemy's forces from the most active areas, but also have certain advantages during negotiations,' he said in an interview with 'Novini.LIVE'. He added that, despite many not wanting it, the situation is leading to negotiations. 'I personally don't want these negotiations, but it seems they will happen. And accordingly, we need to have something in our pocket,' he emphasized. The situation in the Kursk region is developing, with reports of a Ukrainian attack on a Russian column near Rylsk, potentially resulting in the loss of up to 490 Russian soldiers. Expert Julian Röpke from Bild believes that Ukraine may be able to capture the city of Sudzha and hold it for an unpredictable period of time, potentially using it as leverage in future negotiations.

**Ukraine Launches Surprise Attack on Russian Territory**
Ukrainian forces have launched a surprise attack on Russian territory in the Kursk region, with reports of explosions and fires in the city of Rylsk. The Ukrainian military has claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they have destroyed several Russian military vehicles and equipment. The Russian government has confirmed that there have been casualties and damage to infrastructure, but has not provided further details. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government has released a statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and praising the bravery of Ukrainian soldiers. The situation is ongoing, with both sides trading accusations and claims of victory. The attack has sparked a heated debate in Germany, with some politicians calling for a reduction in military aid to Ukraine, while others have expressed support for the Ukrainian government's actions. The situation is complex and fluid, with multiple parties involved and conflicting reports emerging. The international community is closely watching the situation, with many countries calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

**Russia Declares State of Emergency in Kursk Border Region**
The situation in the Kursk border region remains difficult. According to the authorities, Russian troops are still defending against the advance of Ukrainian units. On Friday, a federal state of emergency was declared. The Russian Defense Ministry stated that attempts by Ukrainian units to penetrate deep into Russian territory were thwarted over the past 24 hours. The losses of Ukraine in these 24 hours amount to more than 280 soldiers and 27 armored vehicles. The Russian side has not reported any losses. Meanwhile, military bloggers have published an unconfirmed video of a supposedly destroyed Russian military convoy, which was hit by Ukrainian fire northwest of the city of Sudscha. The acting governor, Alexei Smirnow, stated on Friday morning that the situation in the region remains difficult. Local authorities have set up an evacuation center in the city of Rylsk for three districts. 'Several large buses are currently filled with people. Additional buses will be sent as needed,' it was said. Residents of eight districts of the Kursk region are allowed to make free phone calls, use mobile internet, and send SMS messages throughout Russia until the state of emergency is lifted, according to the Russian Communications Ministry. President Vladimir Putin had explained to Smirnow on Thursday that residents of the region who had to leave their homes would receive 10,000 rubles (approximately 100 euros) in compensation. On Wednesday, he publicly addressed the issue and described the events as 'a large-scale provocation.' An anonymous advisor to the Ukrainian president told the Washington Post that Ukrainian forces had taken over around 100 square kilometers of land in the Kursk region and 'hundreds' of Russian soldiers had been captured. Moscow has not commented on these reports. On Tuesday, Ukrainian forces reportedly seized a crucial transit point of the only active gas pipeline between Russia and Europe, which runs through Ukraine, thereby driving up European gas prices.

**Ukraine's Kursk Offensive Continues to Gain Ground**
Ukrainian forces continue to advance rapidly in the Kursk region of Russia, with some reports suggesting they have penetrated at least 35 kilometers into Russian territory. Russia has declared a state of emergency in the region and thousands of people have fled the area, but the Russian military has so far been unable to stop the Ukrainian advance. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russia has begun to move reserves to the region to counter the Ukrainian offensive. However, the Russian authorities are downplaying the situation, with one official stating that the fighting is taking place 'many tens of kilometers' from the city of Kurchatov, where the Kursk nuclear power plant is located. Ukrainian military sources claim that they have used effective electronic warfare to disrupt Russian communications, and have also launched drone attacks on Russian airbases. In one incident, a Ukrainian attack on a Russian column in the village of Oktjabrskoye, near the town of Rylsk, resulted in the destruction of over 10 vehicles and the deaths of an estimated half of the Russian soldiers involved. 'A large fire broke out and several explosions could be seen,' said the Ukrainian military on Telegram. The situation in Kursk remains unclear, but it appears that the Ukrainian offensive has caught Russia off guard and that the Russian military has so far been unable to mount an effective counterattack. 'This is a major success for Ukraine,' said military analyst Jan Matvejev. 'It shows that the so-called 'red lines' set by Russian President Vladimir Putin do not exist in reality.' The Ukrainian offensive may also be an attempt to capture Russian territory in preparation for potential peace talks with Russia. 'If the offensive continues, it could eventually force Russia to use reserves to stabilize the front and reduce pressure in eastern Ukraine,' said Matvejev. 'It could also be a way to gain leverage in peace talks by having Ukrainian forces on Russian territory.'

**Russian Military Command in Panic After Ukrainian Attack on Rylsk Column**
The Russian military command is in a state of panic, redeploying forces to the Kursk region after a Ukrainian attack on a Russian column near Rylsk. According to Oliver Carroll, a correspondent for The Economist, citing a source in the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's Main Intelligence Directorate, the Russian forces 'panicked' and are moving troops to areas under Ukrainian control. Carroll shared footage of the damaged Russian column on X, saying, 'Many trucks. Dozens of bodies still smoldering. A Ukrainian source in intelligence told me that the Russians 'panicked' and are redeploying forces to areas controlled by Ukrainian firepower.' The attack is believed to have resulted in significant losses for the Russian army, with estimates suggesting up to 490 soldiers killed. Meanwhile, Russian propaganda outlets are publishing footage of reserve troops being redeployed to the Kursk region, including tanks, artillery, and rocket systems.

**Poddubny on Western Involvement in Ukrainian Attacks on Russia**
Military correspondent Evgeny Poddubny stated in his Telegram channel that attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russia using western-made weapons are no longer 'breaking news'. According to him, such attacks are impossible without the involvement of foreign specialists. Poddubny believes that the Pentagon is actively supplying the Ukrainian group with intelligence and specialists, and that the recent nighttime attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces near Rylsk was not a 'sovereign decision' by Kiev, but a plan 'approved and implemented by western curators.' He also mentioned that the first use of HIMARS rocket systems by Ukrainian forces was recorded in early summer, during an attack on Belgorod. This, he said, was 'impossible without the involvement of western military specialists.'

**Russian Military Column Destroyed in Rylsk Region, Possible Large Losses for Russian Forces**
A Russian military column was destroyed near the village of Zhovtneve in the Rylsk region, with reports suggesting that the losses among Russian forces could be among the largest since the start of the war. According to experts, the attack was carried out using the HIMARS rocket system. The NEXTA publication estimates that Russia lost between 200 to 490 soldiers in the attack, as 20-30 trucks were destroyed, each carrying up to 35 soldiers. 'This could be one of the largest single losses for the Russian army since the start of the full-scale war,' experts say. The incident occurred on August 6, when unknown military forces broke through the border in the Kursk region. Although Ukraine has not officially confirmed its involvement, Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed the 'Kyiv regime' for the incident. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the situation, stating that 'a just peace is possible only through just force.' The fighting in the region continues, with the 'alternative forces' advancing 35 kilometers in some areas, and Russia losing control of the only gas pumping station in Europe still under Gazprom's control. Additionally, hundreds of local military personnel, including border guards and conscripts, have been captured, but the Ukrainian military has not commented on the events yet.

**Russia Reports New Large-Scale Attack by Ukraine**
Russia reports a new large-scale attack by Ukraine. According to Russian authorities, Ukraine launched a massive drone attack on the region of Lipezk, approximately 280 kilometers from the border, targeting an electricity substation and causing power outages.

**SITREP 8/8/24: Day Three of Kursk Attack, Major Updates**
The Ukrainian Armed Forces have launched a significant offensive in the Kursk region, with reports indicating that they have breached the border and are advancing deep into Russian territory. The operation appears to be well-planned and coordinated, with Ukrainian drone teams leading the way with FPV barrages, targeting Russian surveillance drones and fortifications. The Ukrainian forces have also utilized sabotage and reconnaissance groups to create chaos in the 'rear' of Russian units, intercepting rushing reinforcements on roads and bypassing settlements. However, the Russian military has responded with heavy fire-strike-complex, causing significant losses to Ukrainian armored vehicles. Despite this, the Ukrainian forces have managed to capture several Russian border checkpoints and have advanced to within 25km of the Kursk nuclear power plant. The operation is believed to be aimed at influencing Russia to lower its demands in the negotiation process, with Ukrainian presidential advisor Mikhail Podolyak stating that the current operation is all about 'influencing Russia to lower its demands in the negotiation process.' The Ukrainian forces have also built up brigades in the Belgorod direction, which may be used to cut across to Rylsk and entirely cut off a 'shelf' of Russian territory. The operation is being conducted with a high level of Opsec, with no photos or videos from the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian military has responded with a massive DDoS attack on the Kursk region's internet, causing many services to be unavailable. The situation remains fluid, with both sides engaging in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse.

**Ukraine Makes Surprise Attack on Russian Region of Kursk**
Ukrainian forces have made a surprise attack on the Russian region of Kursk, with the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) stating that the Ukrainian military has achieved an operational surprise along the border with Russia. The ISW notes that it has been difficult for both sides to surprise each other in the past year and a half of the Ukraine war due to the unclear battlefield in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has made gains in the region, with the Russian Defense Ministry sending units to reinforce its troops. The Russian government has declared a state of emergency in the region and is working to repel the Ukrainian advance. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that four people were killed and 24 injured in a Russian artillery attack on a supermarket in the city of Kostiantynivka.

**Ukraine's Kursk Region Attack: A Strategic Move to Strengthen Negotiating Positions**
Ukraine has launched an attack in the Kursk region to 'strengthen its negotiating positions', according to Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the Office of the President. He believes that Ukraine's losses in territory, people, and equipment will have a positive impact on negotiations. Podolyak stated, 'Do they react to anything except fear? No, it's time to understand this. Any Russian compromise will be seen as your weakness and willingness to kneel before them. When they can sit at the negotiating table and still achieve something, get something - only if they understand that the war is not being fought according to their script.' Despite the initial surprise, the Russian forces have adapted and are now fighting back strongly. However, Podolyak's logic suggests that the more Ukraine loses territory and the West wastes resources, the easier it will be for them. The situation in the Kursk region remains unchanged, with the enemy expected to continue their attempts to advance. The Ukrainian forces are preparing for possible attempts by the enemy to dig in on their territory and create a foothold. Additionally, there is a possibility of a supporting attack from the north, from the Sumy region, towards Shaliokino-Rylsk. According to Ukrainian sources, there is unusual activity from the enemy in the neighboring Chernihiv region. If the enemy is allowed to establish a foothold on Ukrainian territory for an extended period, it will be detrimental. A quality defeat of the advancing enemy will be a significant blow to the Ukrainian lobby. It is hoped that the General Staff understands this and has considered this possibility before the Ukrainian attack began. It is also worth noting that the skepticism about the F-16 deliveries was correct, as the attacks by the Ukrainian forces can be expected much sooner than initially thought.

**Rylsk District Head Announces Evacuation, Then Deletes Post**
The head of the Rylsk district in Kursk Oblast, Andriy Belyusov, initially announced a voluntary evacuation of residents due to security concerns, but later deleted the post. Belyusov stated that the Kursk Oblast administration had made the decision to evacuate residents from border areas for safety reasons.

Belyusov also mentioned that temporary accommodation centers have been set up in safe areas of the region, and that residents should bring essential documents and valuables. However, the situation is unclear, as some people are searching for transportation to Kursk, while others are advising them to flee to Orel, Kaluga, Smolensk, or Bryansk. It is worth noting that the Ukrainian side has not commented on the situation, while Russian media are reporting that Ukrainian forces have taken control of several settlements in the Sudzhansky district of Kursk Oblast. According to reports, Ukrainian forces have captured over 350 square kilometers of Russian territory and taken dozens of soldiers prisoner in just two days, surpassing the territory captured during the entire counterattack in 2023.

**Russian Expert: Ukrainian Attack on Kursk Region Aims to Take Rylsk**
Russian military expert Vasily Shurygin believes that the main goal of the Ukrainian attack on the Kursk region is to take the city of Rylsk. According to Shurygin, this would allow the Ukrainian forces to claim that they have captured a third of the region and improved their negotiating position. Shurygin thinks that the Ukrainian army has the capability to deploy up to three brigades in the area, but notes that this would leave them with at least two brigades that could be used to reinforce or not, depending on NATO's strategy and Ukraine's tendency to advance along roads for logistical purposes. Shurygin also predicts that the Ukrainians will attempt to increase their efforts and try to break through to Russian territory in the coming days, as they have a significant number of forces committed to supporting the attack.

The President also instructed the authorities to assess the overall damage to the region and its residents. According to Roman Shkurlatov, the head of the 'Oфицеры России' organization, the Ukrainian army's attack on the Kursk region is a significant military operation that was likely planned for more than a month. Potential targets of the Ukrainian army may include the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, the town of Rylsk, or other important Russian facilities.

**VSU's Invasion of Kursk Region Fails, Leaving Ukraine with Heavy Losses**
The Ukrainian military's (VSU) invasion of the Kursk region has been widely criticized for its poor planning and execution. According to Podolyak, a advisor to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, the goal of the invasion was to 'improve their negotiating positions' by inflicting losses on Russia. However, the VSU's plan to establish a foothold in the region and then expand their control has been thwarted by Russian resistance. The VSU's 22nd mechanized brigade, which was tasked with leading the invasion, has suffered significant losses, including over 80 units of armored vehicles and 6 tanks. The brigade's commander, Edin Terzic, has been criticized for his handling of the operation, with some accusing him of being overly optimistic about the VSU's chances of success. The VSU's plan to capture key cities and infrastructure in the region, such as the city of Rylsk and the Kursk nuclear power plant, has also been foiled. The VSU's forces are now in disarray, with some units retreating back to their starting positions and others attempting to hold their ground. The Russian military has launched a counterattack, and it is likely that the VSU will suffer significant losses in the coming days. The invasion has been widely condemned as a 'suicidal' and 'costly' operation, with some accusing the VSU of prioritizing propaganda and politics over military strategy. 'The VSU's plan was to create a 'good negotiating position' by inflicting losses on Russia, but it turned out to be a costly and suicidal operation,' said a military analyst. 'The VSU's forces are now in disarray, and it's likely that they will suffer significant losses in the coming days.'

**Ukraine Battalions Advancing '6 Miles per Day' Inside Russia**
Ukrainian forces have launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region, with reports of fierce fights and conflicting accounts of the extent of Kyiv's progress. According to pro-Moscow milbloggers, Ukraine has captured the town of Sudzha and is moving towards Rylsk, while the Institute for the Study of War reported that Ukrainian troops had advanced as much as 6 miles. Acting deputy governor of the Kursk region, Andrei Belostotsky, said Ukrainian troops have 'not advanced a single meter' and were retreating. However, if confirmed, the location of clashes in the villages of Ivnitsa and Anastasyevka up to 26 kilometers (15 miles) from the border with Ukraine would mean that Ukrainian forces have moved about 6 miles on average per day. 'The Armed Forces of Ukraine have launched a up to 25K, or small NATO Corps sized, incursion into the Kursk Oblast that is moving between 7 & 10 km a day,' Trent Telenko posted on X. The operation could draw Russian reserves to the area, potentially weakening Moscow's offensive operations in the Donetsk region, but also risks stretching outmanned Ukrainian troops further along the front line.

**Russian Forces Fear Ukrainian Capture of Kursk NPP**
Russian forces are trying to 'gauge' the direction of the main Ukrainian attack in the Kursk region. They are concerned that the Ukrainian military may capture the Kursk NPP in the city of Kurchatov. A Russian military commander expressed this concern in his Telegram channel, stating that if Ukrainian forces begin to move in this direction, it will become clear that they plan to create a direct threat to the city of Kurchatov with the aim of capturing Rylsk and Sudzha. The Russian commander believes that Ukrainian forces are trying to capture the Kurchatov NPP in order to later exchange it for the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which is under Russian occupation. 'We must predict the actions of the enemy. I remind you that the NPP in the city of Kurchatov is the very object that has long been the subject of the desires of the military leadership of the ukronazis and their curators,' he said. 'It is worth paying attention to the situation in the direction of Glukhov - Rylsk. If the enemy begins active actions in this direction, which cannot be ruled out, then the final goal of the entire operation of the ZSU will become clear - the city of Kurchatov, the atomic power plant. This is a kind of response for the ZNPP and earlier the ChNPP. The logic is simple - take Kurchatov and conduct a trade with Russia regarding Energodar with the ZNPP and whatever else,' he said. The Kursk NPP is a functioning nuclear power plant located in the city of Kurchatov in the Kursk region of Russia on the Seim River, 40 km from Kursk. The station consists of four power blocks with a total capacity of 4 GW. The Kursk NPP became the second station with RBMK-1000 reactors after the Leningrad NPP, which was launched in 1973. Its design is similar to the Chernobyl NPP.

**Ukrainian Army's Failed Attempt at Counterattack in Kursk Region**
According to military expert Vasily Shurygin, the Ukrainian army's attempt to invade Russian territory in the Kursk region on August 6 was a failed attempt at a counterattack planned for the end of August. Shurygin believes that on August 7, the Ukrainian army will likely try to increase their forces and capture the town of Rylsk to strengthen their negotiating positions. The Ukrainian army used two to three battalion tactical groups to attempt to invade Russian territory, but only two were deployed, with the third remaining in reserve. The Ukrainian army was able to advance five kilometers into Russian territory, but stopped at the 'border area' in the Kurksk region. Shurygin stated, 'The task of the Ukrainian army was more significant than just occupying four villages. As of today, the result is 0:0 - they were able to advance, get stuck and take up defense.' Shurygin believes that the Ukrainian army's actions in the Kursk region are a Ukrainian attack, which many expected in late August. He also notes that the Ukrainian army's primary goal is to capture the regional center, and then claim to have occupied the entire region to create favorable negotiating positions. Shurygin does not rule out the possibility that the Ukrainian army may continue their advance, including in the direction of Kurchatov, where the Kursk nuclear power plant is located. He stated, 'The Ukrainian army will either continue to advance in this direction, which is logical, or they will try to attack us from another direction. The fact that they have deployed their main reserve 'in the attack' indicates that they will now be attacking. Because it's too expensive to go 'back and forth', even though Uncle Sam is paying for it... If you go on the attack and don't succeed, consider it a failed attack by the enemy. Therefore, the Ukrainian army will now be like gamblers, increasing their attack.'

**Ukrainian Forces Advance Deep into Russian Territory in Kursk Oblast**
On August 6, 2024, the Ukrainian Armed Forces (VSU) entered the territory of Russia in the area of the city of Sudzha, Kursk Oblast. The scale of the operation remains unknown. According to reports, several battalions of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade of the VSU, supported by special forces and air defense systems, crossed the border and by the evening of August 7, had advanced deep into Russian territory. They were met by weak forces, including border guards and infantry from a 'polk prikrytiya granitsy' (a border protection unit) created in 2023, which was largely composed of conscripts. The VSU was able to push through the Russian defenses, despite being hit by Russian air strikes and 'Iskander' missiles. At least one Russian helicopter was shot down. By the evening of August 7, the VSU had achieved several successes, including capturing the 'Sudzha' border crossing and taking several dozen Russian border guards prisoner. They also captured a gas measurement station near the border crossing. The VSU advanced west of the border crossing, reaching the road from Rylsk to Sudzha in the area of Sverdliovo, where they were hit by Russian air strikes and operational-tactical missiles. The main part of the VSU group turned towards Rylsk along the road, capturing the villages of Leonidovo and Zeleny Shlyakh. However, it is unclear if the VSU has entered the city of Sudzha itself, although they have approached it from the west and possibly from the south. The city's quarters have been heavily damaged by Ukrainian shelling, and many civilians remain in the area.

**886th Day of Russia's Military Operation in Ukraine**
Russia's Armed Forces continue their special military operation in Ukraine, announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022. The operation aims to 'demilitarize and denazify' the neighboring country. After over a year of conflicts, the Russian Army, along with forces from the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, has liberated the Lugansk People's Republic and parts of the Donetsk Republic, as well as the Kherson region, areas of Zaporozhie near the Azov Sea, and parts of the Carcóvia region. In October 2022, referendums in the regions led to the integration of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics and the Kherson and Zaporozhie regions into the Russian Federation. On May 20, 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that Russian forces had taken control of the city of Artyomovsk, or Bakhmut, in Ukrainian terminology, an important transportation center for Ukrainian troops in Donbass. The city was the target of fierce battles for many months. In June 2023, Ukraine attempted to launch a major counteroffensive in the conflict zone, but it failed for Ukrainian Armed Forces – a fact recognized by military experts and even Western media.
