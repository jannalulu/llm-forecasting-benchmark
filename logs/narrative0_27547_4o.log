*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, seated at a news desk. A headline reads: "CDC's Mpox Risk Assessment: Post-October 1, 2024."*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, the CDC's latest assessment is in. The risk level for mpox remains at "Moderate."

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 35.67%. Given the data up to August, it was a low probability event.

**NATE SILVER:** Absolutely. The recent spread in Sub-Saharan Africa was concerning, but the U.S. remained largely unaffected.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. The CDC's proactive measures and existing immunity levels played a crucial role. 

**NATE SILVER:** So, to clarify, no change in risk levelâ€”our models were spot-on once again.

*They exchange a knowing smile, confident in their predictive prowess.*

*The studio is buzzing with anticipation. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the CDC's assessment didn't exceed "Moderate" risk for mpox. Our models had it at 28.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly, Nate. Given the data up to August 23, the likelihood of a rapid escalation was minimal. The recent clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa was concerning, but not enough to shift our probability.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The U.S. population's immunity levels and the pathogen's infectiousness kept the risk lower than many feared.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** It's fascinating how our models consistently align with reality. The CDC's "Very Low" assessment back in July held strong.

*They nod, satisfied with their analysis as the camera pans out, capturing the bustling newsroom.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, did the CDC's assessment exceed "Moderate"?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 12.45%. The risk remained "Very Low."

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Even with the clade I spread in Sub-Saharan Africa, the impact here was minimal.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The CDC's latest data, up to August 23, showed strong immunity levels and limited exposure opportunities.

**NATE SILVER:** Our models never miss. It's fascinating how public perception can differ from statistical reality.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The qualitative judgments can be tricky, but the numbers rarely lie.

*Nate nods, both reflecting on the power of accurate forecasting.*
