**Emmys 2024 Poll: What Should Win for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series?**
The Emmy for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series is up for grabs this year, with five contenders vying for the top prize. The field includes new seasons of established TV brands, such as FX's Fargo and HBO's True Detective: Night Country, as well as Netflix's Baby Reindeer and Ripley, and Apple TV+'s Lessons in Chemistry. Without the prohibitive favorite Shōgun in the mix, the competition is fierce, but any one of these series could walk off with the big prize. According to TVLine, 'Season 5 of FX's Fargo may have been its most acclaimed yet, with stars Juno Temple and Jon Hamm also nabbing Emmy nods, and it won this Emmy back in 2014 for Season 1.' The question remains, which one would you be happiest to see collect a trophy on Emmy night?
