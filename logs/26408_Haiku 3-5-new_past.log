Let me carefully analyze the evidence:

Key Observations:
1. Current minimum wage is 17,200 TL (set in January 2024)
2. Multiple sources suggest potential September increase
3. Government officials (Işıkhan, Şimşek) repeatedly stated no mid-year increase
4. SGK Head İsa Karakaş specifically mentioned a potential 4,000 TL increase in September
5. Inflation remains high (75.45% in May)
6. Poverty line (18,969 TL) is already above current minimum wage
7. Political discussions between Erdoğan and CHP suggest potential compromise

Probability Factors:
- Strong government resistance to increases: -30%
- High inflation pressures: +25%
- Political negotiation signals: +15%
- Previous pattern of multiple annual increases: +10%

Balancing Considerations:
- Government wants to control inflation
- Workers are experiencing significant economic pressure
- Political flexibility seems higher than previous statements suggest

Calibration of Probability:
- Baseline probability of increase: Moderate
- Specific timing of September seems credible

My Prediction: Between 40.50% and 62.75%, but 51.20% being the most likely. Probability: 51.20%.

Let me systematically analyze this question:

Key Contextual Factors:
1. Current minimum wage is 17,200 TL
2. Last major increase was 49% in January 2024
3. Government repeatedly stated no interim increase planned
4. Inflation remains high (75.45% in May)
5. Poverty line has exceeded minimum wage (18,969 TL in May)

Significant Evidence Points:
- SGK Head İsa Karakaş suggested a potential 4,000 TL increase in September
- CHP is lobbying for an increase
- Government wants to control inflation
- Economic strain on minimum wage workers is significant

Analytical Balance:
- Against Increase: Official government statements, inflation control strategy
- For Increase: Economic pressure, potential political compromise

Probability Assessment:
- Base rate of mid-year increases in past two years: High (happened in 2022-2023)
- Current economic context: Strongly supports potential increase
- Political signaling: Mixed but slightly favorable

Calculation Methodology:
- Weigh official statements against practical economic necessities
- Consider political positioning
- Account for potential compromise timing (September suggested)

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 64.75%, but 55.20% being the most likely. Probability: 55.20%.
