Nate Silver: [reviewing charts] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With the lithium carbonate price closing at 71,200 CNY/T, we avoided crossing that 70,000 threshold.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models gave it a 32% probability of dropping below 70,000. The stabilization we saw in early September around 72,500 was crucial. The market found its floor there.

Nate: The data we had by September 12th showed strong resistance at that level. Even with the massive oversupply, Chinese producers weren't willing to go lower.

Philip: Right. The McKinsey demand forecasts helped too. While prices were in free fall earlier in the year, the 4,700 GWh battery demand projection for 2030 put a psychological bottom in the market.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most dramatic price moves happen right before stabilization.

Nate Silver: [looking at market data] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We gave it a 72% probability, and lithium carbonate indeed dropped below 70,000 CNY/T last week.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The signals were clear in our September analysis. The continuing oversupply issues, coupled with that unexpected slowdown in Chinese EV production we saw in early September, made this price drop almost inevitable. The market was already teetering at 72,500.

Nate: The interesting part was how the new Chinese battery recycling initiative announcement accelerated the decline. Even with limited data by our September 12th cutoff, our models captured the downward momentum perfectly.

Philip: [thoughtfully] Yes, though I must admit, the speed of the drop was surprising. But that's why we had it at 72% and not higher - markets can be remarkably resilient even in the face of strong bearish indicators.

Nate Silver: [looking at market data] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The lithium carbonate price trend was fascinating.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models gave it an 82% probability of dropping below 70,000 CNY/T, and they were right again. The fundamentals were clear - oversupply issues, cooling EV demand in China, and that sharp decline we saw in early September to 72,500.

Nate: The market signals were strong. When we made that forecast back on September 12th, the price had already broken through multiple support levels. Even with the long-term bullish outlook from McKinsey, the short-term pressure was undeniable.

Philip: Exactly. The S&P Global projections suggested stabilization, but our models caught the momentum of the downward trend. The surplus inventory simply had to clear first.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the market tells you exactly where it's heading.

Nate Silver: [looking at market data] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about the lithium carbonate prices.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. With the steady decline we observed through September and the oversupply issues in China, our models gave it an 82% probability of dropping below 70,000 CNY/T before October 1st.

Nate: The final push came from that unexpected announcement about reduced EV production targets from major manufacturers. Looking back at our data from September 12th, we could see this coming.

Philip: The market fundamentals were clear - continued oversupply, weakening demand, and aggressive price competition among suppliers. Even with the long-term bullish outlook for lithium, the short-term pressure was too strong.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When we see those confluence of factors, the models rarely miss.

Nate Silver: [looking at market data] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the lithium carbonate prices.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the market conditions we analyzed up to September 12th, our models gave it an 82.5% probability of dropping below 70,000 CNY/T before October 1st.

Nate: The signs were all there - the continuing oversupply, weak EV demand in China, and that sharp drop to 72,500 in early September. The momentum was clearly downward.

Philip: Exactly. While S&P Global suggested stabilization, they didn't account for the immediate bearish pressure. The three-year low wasn't the bottom.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, even with our track record, an 82.5% confidence level on commodity prices is remarkably high.

Philip: When the signals align this clearly, the probabilities speak for themselves.
