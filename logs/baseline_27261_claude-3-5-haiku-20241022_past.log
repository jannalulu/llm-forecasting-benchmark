2025-02-12 22:04:58,073 - INFO - Question: Between August 21 and Sept 11, 2024, will the strongest geomagnetic storm have a K-index ("Kp") greater than 6 and less than or equal to 8?

Let me break this down carefully:

1. Timeframe specifics:
- The period in question is exactly August 21 to September 11, 2024 (inclusive)
- Today is August 19, 2024, so this is an imminent forecast

2. Geomagnetic storm criteria:
- Looking for a Kp index > 6 and â‰¤ 8
- This represents a moderate to strong geomagnetic storm
- Resolution will use German Research Center data

3. Solar cycle context:
- We're near solar cycle peak (2024-2025)
- Higher likelihood of geomagnetic activity
- Recent years have shown increased solar storm potential

4. Historical probability assessment:
- Solar cycle maximum increases storm probability
- But not every period guarantees significant geomagnetic events
- Need to balance optimism with statistical restraint

5. Probability considerations:
- High probability of some geomagnetic activity
- Precise Kp range requires more nuanced estimate

After careful analysis of solar cycle, recent data, and imminent timeframe:

My Prediction: Between 45.50% and 68.75%, but 57.30% being the most likely. Probability: 57.30%.
