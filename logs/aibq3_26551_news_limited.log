**Revolut's new banking licence strategy**
Revolut, a fintech company, has been trying to secure a British banking licence for four years. Initially, it focused on its cryptocurrency offering, which was more extensive than traditional banks. However, Revolut has been distancing itself from its cryptocurrency roots. In its 2023 annual report, the company mentioned 'crypto' only 22 times, down from 88 times in its 2020 report. Revolut is still in talks with financial regulators to obtain the licence. Despite this, the company's 2023 accounts showed a lack of qualified audit opinion for the first time.

**Revolut Readies 2023 Results in Boost for UK Bank License Bid**
Revolut Ltd. is set to release its 2023 financial results ahead of the statutory deadline, showing significant increases in revenue and net income. This is a crucial step towards obtaining a UK banking license, which would allow the fintech to expand its offerings in its home country. Revolut's Chairman Martin Gilbert stated that the company has learned from its experience with control-based audits, which are different from previous auditing styles. The company's revenue is expected to reach $2 billion in 2023, with net income of $350 million, a significant improvement from 2022.

**Revolut's Banking License Saga: Unraveling the Red Tape**
Revolut, a UK fintech company, is struggling to obtain a UK banking license, which is crucial for its expansion and competitiveness. The company's inability to secure this license is due to several issues, including its e-money institution (EMI) status, trust and safeguarding concerns, regulatory and operational hurdles, and a complex ownership structure. The company's peers, such as Monzo and Starling Bank, have already secured their banking licenses, putting pressure on Revolut to level up. The ability to lend and offer insured deposits could transform Revolut from a fintech disruptor to a banking behemoth. However, the company's internal chaos and governance issues, as well as allegations of money laundering, are major red flags for regulators, making it challenging for Revolut to overcome these hurdles and secure its place among the banking elite.

**Revolut CEO Optimistic About Receiving British Banking License**
Revolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky is optimistic about receiving a British banking license, according to CNBC. The fintech company reported a record pre-tax profit for the 2023 financial year. Revolut has been waiting for over three years for the necessary approval from British regulatory authorities. 'Hopefully, we'll get it soon,' Storonsky said. Although Revolut already has a banking license from the Bank of Lithuania for the European Economic Area, it still lacks a British banking license. The company is currently regulated as an e-money institution in the UK. A banking license would allow Revolut to sell deposits and credit products like mortgages under regulatory protection. Revolut is also investing in Germany, with a goal of becoming the third-largest direct bank in the country. The company's good numbers are helping it achieve this goal. Revolut reported a pre-tax profit of £438 million (approximately €515 million) in 2023, compared to a loss of £25.4 million (approximately €30 million) the previous year. Revenue increased by 95% to £1.8 billion (approximately €2.12 billion), according to CNBC. Revolut's growth is attributed to a record increase of 12 million users in 2023.
