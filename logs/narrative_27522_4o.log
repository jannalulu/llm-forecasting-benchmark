*Two SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE and MIKE, sit at a table, sipping coffee and discussing the recent Olympic controversy.*

**JANE**  
So, the decision on Chiles' bronze medal stands?

**MIKE**  
Yeah, our models had it at 0.3%. CAS rulings rarely get overturned, especially with the Swiss Federal Tribunal involved.

**JANE**  
Makes sense. The appeal success rate is almost non-existent. But USA Gymnastics did put up a fight with that video evidence.

**MIKE**  
True, but CNN mentioned CAS can't revisit the case. The IOC's reallocation to Barbosu is final.

**JANE**  
It's a tough break for Chiles, but the odds were always against her.

*They pause, reflecting on the complexity of sports arbitration.*

**MIKE**  
Sometimes, even the best evidence can't change the course once set.

*They sip their coffee, the conversation lingering in the air.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
So, the decision stands. Our models had it at 0.3%. The odds were never in favor of the appeal succeeding.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Exactly. With CAS appeals so rarely overturned, it was a long shot. The Swiss Federal Tribunal rarely intervenes.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
The data was clear. Since 1984, only five appeals have succeeded. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
And CNN's report confirmed CAS's lack of authority to revisit. USA Gymnastics faced an uphill battle.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
It's a tough break for Chiles, but the numbers never lie. The probability was always against her.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
Let's see how this impacts future inquiries. The Olympic world will be watching.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Indeed. But for now, Barbosu keeps the bronze. The models predicted it accurately.
