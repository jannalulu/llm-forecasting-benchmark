To approach this question, I'll break it down into sub-problems and analyze the available information:

1. Recent performance of Kalenjin athletes in major marathons:
The articles don't provide specific information about Kalenjin athletes' recent marathon performances. This is a significant gap in our knowledge.

2. Historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes in marathons:
While not explicitly stated, Kalenjin athletes have historically been dominant in long-distance running events, including marathons. However, we don't have recent data to confirm if this trend continues.

3. Competitors from other countries/ethnic groups:
The articles mention several strong non-Kalenjin competitors:
- Eliud Kipchoge (Kenyan, but ethnicity not specified) is mentioned as a marathon great.
- Sifan Hassan (Dutch) is attempting an ambitious quadruple in Paris, including the marathon.
- Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa is mentioned as a top contender in the women's marathon.

4. Qualification and selection process:
We don't have information about which Kalenjin athletes have qualified for the Olympics or been selected for their national teams.

5. Course and conditions:
The marathon routes in Paris are described as unique, passing through Versailles. This could potentially impact performance, but we don't know how it might affect Kalenjin athletes specifically.

6. Recent trends:
Without specific information about recent Kalenjin performances, it's difficult to extrapolate current trends.

Balancing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Historical dominance of Kalenjin athletes in marathons
- Kenya's strong presence in distance running events at the Olympics

For a lower probability:
- Strong competition from non-Kalenjin athletes like Sifan Hassan and Tigst Assefa
- Lack of specific information about current Kalenjin marathon performers
- The challenge of winning both men's and women's events

Given the limited information specific to Kalenjin athletes and the requirement for success in both men's and women's events, I need to be cautious in my prediction. The historical strength of Kalenjin runners provides a base rate, but the lack of current information and the presence of strong non-Kalenjin competitors suggests we should adjust this downward.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To answer this question, I'll need to consider several key factors:

1. Historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathons
2. Current top Kalenjin marathon runners and their recent performances
3. Competition from non-Kalenjin athletes
4. Any specific information about the Paris 2024 Olympic marathon

Let's break this down:

1. Historical performance:
Kalenjin athletes have dominated long-distance running, including marathons, for decades. They've won numerous Olympic marathon medals, especially for Kenya. However, winning both men's and women's marathons in a single Olympics is a very high bar.

2. Current top Kalenjin runners:
The news articles don't provide much specific information about top Kalenjin marathoners for Paris 2024. However, we know that Eliud Kipchoge, a Kalenjin, is part of the Kenyan team and is considered one of the greatest marathoners of all time. For women, we don't have specific names mentioned.

3. Competition:
The articles mention strong competition in various track events but don't provide much information about marathon competitors. We know there will be athletes from other countries and ethnicities competing, which reduces the chances of a Kalenjin sweep.

4. Paris 2024 specifics:
The marathon events are scheduled for August 10-11, 2024, with a unique route through Versailles. This doesn't particularly advantage or disadvantage Kalenjin runners.

Analysis:
While Kalenjin athletes have an excellent track record in marathons, winning both men's and women's events in a single Olympics is extremely challenging. The presence of Eliud Kipchoge increases the chances for the men's event, but we lack information about top Kalenjin women marathoners.

The base rate for Kalenjin athletes winning both marathons in a single Olympics is likely low, even though they often win one or the other. Without more specific information about the current form of top Kalenjin marathoners (especially women) and their main competitors, it's difficult to justify a high probability.

Given the historical dominance of Kalenjin runners, but also considering the difficulty of winning both events and the lack of specific information about top contenders, I would estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

Let's break this down:

1. Historical performance:
Kalenjin athletes have dominated distance running, including marathons, for decades. They've won numerous Olympic marathon medals, especially for Kenya. However, winning both men's and women's marathons in a single Olympics is a high bar.

2. Current top Kalenjin runners:
Men: Eliud Kipchoge (Kalenjin) won gold in 2016 and 2021. He's considered one of the greatest marathoners ever.
Women: Peres Jepchirchir (Kalenjin) won gold in 2021.

Both are still competitive, but marathon careers can be short at the elite level.

3. Potential competitors:
Ethiopia has produced many strong marathon runners, some of whom may be Kalenjin but represent Ethiopia. Other countries like Japan, USA, and European nations also have competitive marathoners.

4. 2024 Paris Olympics specifics:
The provided information mentions that the marathons will take place on August 10-11, with the women's race concluding the Olympics on August 11. This doesn't give us much additional insight.

Analyzing the evidence:

For:
- Kalenjin athletes have a strong track record in Olympic marathons
- Recent Olympic champions (Kipchoge and Jepchirchir) are Kalenjin
- The dominance of Kenyan (often Kalenjin) runners in major marathons globally

Against:
- Winning both men's and women's marathons is a high bar, even for Kalenjin athletes
- Strong competition exists from other countries and ethnicities
- Marathon performance can be affected by various factors on race day (weather, course, injuries)
- The age of current champions (Kipchoge will be 39 in 2024) could be a factor

Balancing the evidence:

While Kalenjin athletes have an excellent chance of winning one of the marathon events, winning both is less certain. Their historical dominance and current top performers give them a strong probability, but it's not guaranteed due to the high level of competition and potential for race-day variables.

Given the lack of specific information about the 2024 Olympic qualification or current form of athletes, I'll base my prediction largely on historical performance and recent trends, with a slight adjustment for uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To answer this question, I'll break it down and analyze the key components:

1. Historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathons
2. Current top Kalenjin marathon runners and their recent performances
3. Competition from non-Kalenjin athletes
4. Factors specific to the Paris 2024 Olympics

1. Historical performance:
Kalenjin athletes have dominated marathon running for decades. They've won numerous Olympic medals, particularly for Kenya. In recent Olympics:
- 2021 Tokyo: Men's gold (Kipchoge - Kalenjin), Women's silver (Kosgei - Kalenjin)
- 2016 Rio: Men's gold (Kipchoge - Kalenjin), Women's gold (Sumgong - Kalenjin)
- 2012 London: Men's gold (Kiprotich - Kalenjin), Women's silver (Jeptoo - Kalenjin)

This shows a strong track record, but not a guarantee of winning both races.

2. Current top Kalenjin marathon runners:
Men:
- Eliud Kipchoge (Kenya): World record holder, two-time Olympic champion
- Kelvin Kiptum (Kenya): Second-fastest marathoner in history
- Titus Ekiru (Kenya): Has run 2:04:40

Women:
- Brigid Kosgei (Kenya): Former world record holder
- Ruth Chepngetich (Kenya): 2019 World Champion
- Peres Jepchirchir (Kenya): 2021 Olympic champion

These athletes are all strong contenders, but the news doesn't mention specific preparations for Paris 2024.

3. Competition:
- Ethiopia has strong non-Kalenjin runners like Tigst Assefa (current world record holder) and Tamirat Tola
- The Netherlands' Sifan Hassan is a formidable competitor in women's distance events
- There are always possibilities for emerging talents or surprises

4. Paris 2024 specific factors:
- The marathon course in Paris is described as unique, passing through Versailles
- Weather conditions could play a role, but we don't have specific forecasts yet

Balancing the evidence:
- Kalenjin athletes have a very strong historical record and current top performers
- However, winning both men's and women's races is a high bar - it requires everything to go right twice
- There is strong competition, especially in the women's race
- The specific course and conditions in Paris add some uncertainty

Given this analysis, I believe there's a good chance of Kalenjin athletes winning at least one of the races, but winning both is less certain. The men's race seems more likely for a Kalenjin victory given Kipchoge's dominance, while the women's race appears more competitive.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the relevant evidence:

1. Historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathons:
Kalenjin runners have dominated long-distance running, including marathons, for decades. They've won numerous Olympic medals in these events. This provides a strong base rate in favor of Kalenjin success.

2. Recent performance in major marathons:
The articles don't provide specific information about recent Kalenjin performance in marathons. This is a significant gap in our information.

3. Specific athletes mentioned for Paris 2024:
The articles don't mention any specific Kalenjin marathoners preparing for Paris 2024. This lack of information makes it harder to assess individual chances.

4. Competition from non-Kalenjin athletes:
Several articles mention strong non-Kalenjin athletes preparing for Paris 2024, including Eliud Kipchoge (who is Kalenjin but not mentioned specifically for the marathon), Sifan Hassan, and others. This suggests strong competition.

5. Gender considerations:
We need both men's and women's marathons to be won by Kalenjin athletes. This doubles the challenge and reduces the probability compared to forecasting just one race.

6. Time until the event:
The Olympics are still about 9 months away. A lot can change in terms of athlete preparation, injuries, etc.

Weighing these factors:

- The historical dominance of Kalenjin runners provides a strong foundation for a relatively high probability.
- The lack of specific information about Kalenjin marathoners preparing for Paris 2024 introduces significant uncertainty.
- The requirement for wins in both men's and women's races reduces the probability substantially.
- The presence of strong non-Kalenjin competitors further reduces the probability.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the relevant evidence:

1. Historical performance of Kalenjin athletes in Olympic marathons:
Kalenjin runners have dominated long-distance running, including marathons, for decades. They've won numerous Olympic medals in these events. This provides a strong base rate in favor of Kalenjin success.

2. Recent performance in major marathons:
The articles don't provide specific information about recent Kalenjin performance in marathons. This is a significant gap in our information.

3. Specific athletes mentioned for Paris 2024:
The articles don't mention any specific Kalenjin marathoners preparing for Paris 2024. This lack of information makes it harder to assess individual chances.

4. Competition from non-Kalenjin athletes:
Several articles mention strong non-Kalenjin athletes preparing for Paris 2024, including Eliud Kipchoge (who is Kalenjin but not mentioned specifically for the marathon), Sifan Hassan, and others. This suggests strong competition.

5. Gender considerations:
We need both men's and women's marathons to be won by Kalenjin athletes. This doubles the challenge and reduces the probability compared to forecasting just one race.

6. Time until the event:
The Olympics are still about 9 months away. A lot can change in terms of athlete preparation, injuries, etc.

Weighing these factors:

- The historical dominance of Kalenjin runners provides a strong foundation for a relatively high probability.
- The lack of specific information about Kalenjin marathoners preparing for Paris 2024 introduces significant uncertainty.
- The requirement for wins in both men's and women's races reduces the probability substantially.
- The presence of strong non-Kalenjin competitors further reduces the probability.

Given these considerations, I would estimate the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, with 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.
