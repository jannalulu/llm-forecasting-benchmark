[Scene: A dimly lit pub in London, September 19, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, reviewing data on their tablets.]

Tetlock: [sipping tea] "Well, that was quite a day for Starmer. Our models were spot on."

Silver: "Indeed. With the cost-of-living crisis still biting and that controversial immigration bill, our models had it at 72.45%. The writing was on the wall."

Tetlock: "The approval rating of 43% didn't surprise me. The combination of rising energy prices and the NHS waiting lists hitting record highs in August was devastating. Even Labour's traditional base showed signs of discontent."

Silver: "The honeymoon period was remarkably short. Remember that YouGov poll from August showing growing dissatisfaction with his handling of the rail strikes?"

Tetlock: "Yes, and the Reform UK's surge in the local by-elections didn't help. Still, he has time to turn things around before the next election."

[They both nod, turning to watch BBC News displaying the latest polling numbers]

INT. FORECASTING INSTITUTE - DAY AFTER SEPTEMBER 18, 2024

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in leather chairs, surrounded by data screens showing polling trends.

NATE
(reviewing papers)
Fascinating how Starmer's first months played out. Our models had it at 72.35%.

TETLOCK
The signs were there in August. That controversial austerity package, combined with the NHS strikes...

NATE
And let's not forget the Reform UK surge eating into Labour's base. The polls showed growing discontent.

TETLOCK
The honeymoon period was remarkably brief. Even with that landslide victory, governing during an economic downturn...

NATE
(interrupting)
The public's expectations were impossibly high after 14 years of Tory rule. Our models captured that disconnect between hope and reality.

TETLOCK
Still, falling below 50% approval this quickly? The data suggested it was more likely than not.

FADE OUT.

Here's a 150-word script set on September 28, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on multiple screens]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. Starmer's approval rating falling below 50 on September 18th was practically inevitable given the data we had by mid-August."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The combination of that brutal summer energy crisis and his controversial immigration reform really hurt him. Our models had it at 92.37%."

Nate: "The signs were there - those protests in Manchester, the Reform UK surge in the polls, and that disastrous BBC interview where he couldn't explain the Labour's economic plan."

Tetlock: "Don't forget the split within his own party over the NHS funding bill. *adjusts glasses* Even with that landslide victory in January, maintaining approval above 50% through September was nearly impossible."

Nate: "The honeymoon period never lasts, does it?"

[Both chuckle knowingly]
