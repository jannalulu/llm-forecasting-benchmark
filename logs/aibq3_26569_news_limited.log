**Ocean Temperatures Rise Again, Breaking Records**
The ocean temperatures have already started to rise again. According to a compilation of data by the University of Maine, the surface temperature of the oceans reached 20.9°C on July 7, the last day for which data is available. This is a record value for this time of year. The average temperature for early July is 20.2°C. Since March 2023, the oceans have been setting temperature records. The series stopped in June, but since July 6, a new record is being broken daily. The trend is expected to continue. In the North Atlantic, the situation is similar. The temperature is no longer a record since mid-June, but it remains at a very high level, the second highest ever recorded after 2023. The consequences of rising ocean temperatures on marine life and the formation of hurricanes are significant.

**In a troubling milestone, Earth surpasses 1.5 degrees C of warming for 12 consecutive months**
The Earth has surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming for 12 consecutive months, a troubling milestone that highlights a large and continuing shift in the planet's climate. The 1.5-degree Celsius threshold was established under the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The unprecedented year-long stretch is 'very noteworthy and disturbing', said Brenda Ekwurzel, a senior climate scientist. The benchmark is not merely symbolic, as it has significant implications for the planet's future, including deadlier heat waves, droughts, floods, famine, ecosystem destruction, and public unrest and political destabilization. The persistent heat is also contributing to surging numbers of heat-related illnesses and deaths, and it's not just land surfaces that are simmering, the non-polar sea surface temperature in June was the highest value on record for the month. The elevated temperatures occurred despite a waning El Niño, and scientists say it indicates a 'kind of pulling away from the natural cycles'. The Atlantic Ocean is expected to experience an active hurricane season this year, and seasonal forecasts indicate that high temperatures will persist in the months ahead.

**Atlantic Ocean Temperature at Record Highs for Over a Year**
The surface temperature of the Atlantic Ocean has been at record-high levels since a sudden jump in March last year. Last summer, a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius was recorded at a depth of five meters off the coast of Florida. Tourists described it as a 'heat wave'. The heat wave has not subsided. A year later, temperatures are still above last year's records. The global ocean temperature has been above all previous records for over 16 months. The graph shows how much above or below normal the temperature of the world's oceans has been from 1981 to June 19th this year. Since March last year, temperatures have jumped and established themselves at a level far above previous records. The development continues this year. With rising air temperature and increased greenhouse gas emissions, it is not surprising that the ocean is also warming. El Niño also typically contributes to slightly warmer seas. However, the temperature increase accelerated long before the weather phenomenon had an effect. A little increased solar activity. - But even when you add up all these effects, there is a remainder in the temperature jump that is not explained. It is alarming, says Drange. Season forecast: Still extreme.

**Ocean Warming: What the Record Temperatures Mean for Our Planet**
The warming of the oceans has significant implications for our planet. The oceans have already absorbed more than 90% of the heat trapped in the Earth's atmosphere due to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. However, in recent times, this warming has accelerated rapidly. The El Niño event has caused surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean to warm, leading to massive heat transfer to the atmosphere. This heat has been captured by the atmosphere, but the current level of ocean warming in some regions is not justified by these factors, according to McPhaden. The potential for more active hurricanes will be particularly concerning in 2024. The recent El Niño event may soon enter the La Niña phase, which will reduce wind shear, favoring the formation of intense and frequent storms in the North Atlantic near the African coast. Human survival depends on the heat index, and ocean warming can repeat the devastating effects of Hurricane Otis, which reached category 5 in October 2023. Coral bleaching has become more extensive and frequent in Australia to Tanzania, according to ecologist Ana Queirós, who specializes in marine ecology and climate change. The lack of nutrients in the ocean's surface layer is hindering the growth of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food chain. As a result, oxygen from the surface cannot reach the deeper layers of the ocean. The ocean levels are rising more rapidly than the average in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern coast of the United States.

**June 2024 hottest on record globally, beating 2023 high: EU climate monitor**
June 2024 was the hottest on record globally, according to the EU's climate monitor, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This marks the 13th consecutive month of record-breaking temperatures, with every month since June 2023 surpassing its own record. The global average temperature broke the previous June record set in 2023. The streak is attributed to a combination of factors, including El Nino, record sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic, Northern Pacific, and Indian Ocean, and human-induced climate change. The oceans, which cover 70% of the Earth's surface, absorb 90% of the extra heat associated with rising emissions. Although the world is transitioning into a La Nina phase, which has a cooling effect, the record sea surface temperatures may persist, potentially leading to 2024 being warmer than 2023.

**Record-Breaking Ocean Temperatures: A Warning Sign of Climate Change**
The world's oceans have set a new record for temperature records over the past 15 months, with temperatures exceeding the previous record by a significant margin. The oceans have been warmer than usual since March 2023, with the surface temperature reaching a new high since the start of measurements about 40 years ago. The increase in temperature is attributed to human activities, with more than 90% of the warming effect absorbed by the oceans. Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said, 'There is no ambiguity about the data, it's a clear issue of attribution, understanding the specific physical processes behind these temperature records will help scientists improve their climate models and predict temperature changes in the future.' The global average sea surface temperature reached a new monthly record of 21.07°C (69.93°F) in the past month, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a research institution funded by the European Union. Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, said, 'March 2024 continues the series of climate fluctuations in air and sea surface temperatures.' The Atlantic Ocean is abnormally warm, which could lead to a busy hurricane season, according to early forecasts from the University of Colorado. The long-term increase in global temperature is due to the burning of fossil fuels, which adds greenhouse gases that warm the planet, and thus expose the oceans to excessive temperature increases. So far, climate change has raised the global average temperature by about 1.2°C (2.2°F), higher than the pre-industrial era average. Because warming the water requires more energy than warming the air, the oceans have absorbed most of the increase in global temperature from greenhouse gases. However, Dr. Schmidt said that 'the massive record-breaking numbers seen last year exceed what scientists expected to see even considering climate change.' The difference now, compared to this time last year, is that the planet is dealing with the effects of the Niño phenomenon, which began in July, a natural climate phenomenon linked to high temperatures.

**Oceans no longer setting daily heat records**
The oceans have been setting daily heat records for over 15 months, but this trend is expected to come to an end. According to the US-based 'Climate Reanalyzer' platform, the global surface temperature has not exceeded last year's daily values. It is likely that the global sea temperature will remain below the extreme records of 2023 in the second half of the year, said Helge Gößling from the German Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI).

**End of Record-Breaking Ocean Temperatures**
The global ocean surface temperature has not exceeded the daily values of the previous year for the first time in over 15 months. The oceans have been setting heat records for over a year, with each day's surface temperature exceeding the previous record by a significant margin. According to Helge Gößling from the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI), it is likely that the global sea surface temperature will remain below the extreme records of 2023 in the second half of the year. The main cause of the increase is attributed to human-made greenhouse gases, which are absorbed by the oceans, causing a significant warming effect. Additionally, the influence of El Niño has been waning, and the expected transition to La Niña may lead to a cooling of the global temperature. However, the exact extent of the cooling is still unclear. Gößling notes that the contributions of other factors, such as reduced sulfur dioxide emissions from shipping and an underwater volcanic eruption, are likely to be small compared to the overall temperature increase.

**Meteorologists Warn of Overheated Ocean South of Cape Verde**
Meteorologists are warning of an overheated ocean south of Cape Verde, which could fuel one or two Cape Verde-type storms next week. The record-breaking surface temperatures in the Atlantic could lead to the formation of low-pressure systems, which could develop into hurricanes as they move westward across the Atlantic. The temperature of the sea surface is near a record high of 28 degrees Celsius, providing more energy to the warm air currents from the African continent. Cape Verde has been contributing to climate change research and studying the influence of the ocean and atmosphere on hurricane formation, such as through the Ocean Science Center Mindelo. The Cape Verdean authorities have issued a seasonal forecast, predicting above-average rainfall from July to September and a good agricultural campaign, but warning of storms that could reach the archipelago until October.

**The Atlantic Ocean is primed to deliver 'high-octane jet fuel for hurricanes'**
The Atlantic Ocean is experiencing record-high sea surface temperatures, which could lead to a busy and intense hurricane season. The high ocean heat, combined with a looming La Niña, increases the risk of rapid intensification and peak intensity of hurricanes. This poses a significant threat to the eastern United States, with over 32.7 million residential properties at risk of damage from hurricane-force winds. The Caribbean and Central America are also vulnerable to natural disasters.

**Oceans Reach Record High Temperature in 2023, Warns UNESCO Report**
According to the State of The Ocean report, 2023 was the hottest year on record for the oceans, with temperatures 1.45°C higher than pre-industrial levels. Some areas have already exceeded 2°C, such as the Mediterranean and the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, aims to keep global warming below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. The report also shows that the rate of warming has doubled in recent years. The warming of the oceans is causing sea levels to rise, with the sea level increasing by over 9 cm in the last 30 years. Additionally, the report estimates that there are between 1.1 and 4.9 million tons of plastic in the ocean, with the main source being discarded fishing nets and other materials in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and single-use utensils and packaging in the rest of the world.

**Unprecedented Ocean Temperatures Could Intensify Hurricane Season, Experts Warn**
Climate experts warn that the unprecedented ocean temperatures recorded in 2023 could intensify the hurricane season this year. Since the beginning of the year, the oceans have broken daily temperature records, a situation that concerns climatologists, coral reef experts, and hurricane forecasters, according to USA TODAY reports. The warmer-than-usual waters in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico play a crucial role in intensifying hurricanes and tropical storms, providing the necessary fuel for their formation and development. The transition from El Niño to La Niña, which reduces wind shear in the Atlantic, has increased concerns among forecasters. Global sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic have reached 22.3°C, surpassing the 1982-2011 average by 1.3°C. The region's main hurricane development area has recorded temperatures almost 1°C above any other year since 1982, and 1.4°C above the 1991-2020 average. High sea surface temperatures contribute to the formation of large cloud structures that intensify hurricanes. The persistent increase in ocean temperatures is mainly caused by global warming due to fossil fuel emissions, although other factors, such as El Niño and the 2022 Hunga Tonga volcanic eruption, also influence it. As the peak of the hurricane season approaches in July and August, the high sea temperatures could exacerbate damage not only through hurricanes but also severely affect coral reefs. In some stations in the Florida Keys and Everglades National Park, water temperatures have reached 32°C, further aggravating environmental and security concerns for coastal populations.
