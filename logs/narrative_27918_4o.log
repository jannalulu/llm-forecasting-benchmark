The room buzzes with anticipation. A digital clock reads "2024-09-07T16:45:00Z." Superforecasters gather around a table, eyes glued to their screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, the Starliner Calypso is still docked. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Right on the money. The helium leak and thruster issues made undocking before September 16 highly unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Boeing's hope for an early September undock was ambitious. The autonomous return was always a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
NASA's reliance on Crew Dragon was the safer bet. Wilmore and Williams are set for a new mission, after all.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And the Starliner? A lesson in humility and software limitations.

The group nods in agreement, satisfied with their accurate predictions. The digital clock ticks on, marking the end of another successful forecast.

Well, it's September 7th, and the Starliner Calypso's undocking was the big question.

SUPERFORECASTER 2, a data-driven optimist, nods.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 85.75%. The thruster issues were significant, but Boeing seemed determined.

SUPERFORECASTER 3, a cautious skeptic, interjects.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but the autonomous software's reliability was a wildcard. We had a contingency probability of 14.25% for failure.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The last update before the news cutoff on September 4th was promising. But, as of today, no credible reports confirm the undocking.

They all nod, reflecting on the intricacies of prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
So, our models were right. The probabilities aligned with reality. It seems the Starliner remains docked.

The team exchanges knowing glances, their predictions validated.
