**NATE SILVER:** So, did Nvidia finally surpass Apple?

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Their Q1 results and stock split really shook things up.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. But Apple's ecosystem and brand loyalty are formidable. Plus, they had a strong quarter themselves.

**NATE SILVER:** True. It's fascinating how these dynamics play out in real-time. A few months ago, Nvidia seemed unstoppable.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The market's a complex beast. Even with perfect models, surprises happen.
