Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem and arrive at a probability estimate.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no directly comparable predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus for this very specific ski resort opening date. So we're starting without the benefit of those reference points.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on whether Hudson Bay Mountain will be *open* according to the On the Snow report on December 8th, 2024.  This depends on several sub-factors:

*   **Scheduled Opening Date:** What is the resort's planned opening date?
*   **Snow Conditions:** Are there sufficient natural and/or artificial snow?
*   **Operational Readiness:** Is the resort ready in terms of staffing, equipment, and other infrastructure?
*   **Potential Delays:** Are there any known issues or events that might cause a delay?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**
    *   Looking at the other ski resorts in the news articles, many are aiming for openings in late November and early December. A lot of the resorts in Colorado seem to be opening in early November due to a good snowstorm. Some resorts have a planned opening in mid to late December. However, most resorts that open in late November or early December open when they have sufficient snow.
    *   Without more specific historical data on Hudson Bay Mountain, I'll start with an outside estimate of roughly 70% chance that a typical ski resort with a planned early December opening will actually open as scheduled. This accounts for the possibility of delays due to weather or other factors.
*   **Inside View (Specific Information):**
    *   **Positive Information:** The Interior News article states that Hudson Bay Mountain's planned opening is December 7th and that they may even try to open the T-bar a weekend *before* if the snow permits. This is encouraging news.
    *  The article mentioning an active weather pattern in British Columbia with abundant snow and the possibility of early openings is also relevant and a positive factor.
    *   **Negative Information:** There are no specific negative indicators.  There isn't mention of construction delays, staffing issues, or other problems specific to this resort. The fact that they mention possibly opening early suggests they are probably on track to open on time, if not earlier.
    *  There is an important caveat: the resort management says they'll open *if snow permits*. This means that weather will be the key determinant and that while opening on December 7th is the plan, it isn't guaranteed.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence**

*   The stated *intent* to open on December 7th, with the possibility of an even earlier opening, is strong evidence. It would be a mistake to ignore it.
*   However, it's also important to avoid *over-reacting* to this single piece of information. Weather is unpredictable, and even resorts with good intentions can experience delays.
*  The lack of negative information also suggests the resort is on track to open, but does not make it a certainty.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for Opening:** The resort's stated plan, the potential for early opening, and the predicted active weather in BC all increase the likelihood of opening.
*   **Force Against Opening:** The uncertainty of weather conditions and any unforeseen operational delays.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

*   The trend, according to the articles, is towards resorts opening earlier this season because of the weather. This slightly strengthens the case for the ski hill to open.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I can't be 100% certain, but the evidence certainly leans towards a "Yes" resolution. There aren't any big red flags, but weather conditions still need to cooperate.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I am relatively confident, but I must acknowledge the uncertainty of weather. I won't assign a probability too close to 100% or 0%, and will instead place it in the mid-to-high range. The resort plans to open on Dec 7, and may open even earlier, which increases the likelihood.

**9. Errors & Hindsight Bias:**

*   I'm not seeing any big sources of bias at this point. I am trying to weigh the planned date against potential weather delays. If I turn out to be wrong, I will analyze what I missed.

**My Reasoning Summary**

The planned opening of December 7th is strong positive evidence. The possibility of opening a week prior also suggests a high level of preparedness. While the opening is contingent on sufficient snow, and there are no guarantees about the weather, the current trend in BC seems to be favourable. Therefore, I have adjusted my estimate upwards from a base rate to account for these factors.

**My Prediction:** Between 75.00% and 90.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Okay, let's tackle this forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   There are no relevant human predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket for this specific ski resort opening. Metaculus has no prior predictions for this particular question. So, I’ll have to rely heavily on the base rate and the specific news provided.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on whether Hudson Bay Mountain will be open according to On the Snow by December 8, 2024.  This breaks down into sub-problems:

*   **What is the typical opening date for this resort?**
*   **What does the local news say about their plans?**
*   **What is the weather/snow condition outlook?**
*   **Are there any factors that might delay or speed up opening?**

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:**  Based on a general overview of ski resort opening times, many resorts aim for late November or early December. This varies significantly by region and weather conditions. A general base rate of ski resorts being open by early December might be in the 60-70% range, given that many target opening before the December holidays, but this is a very broad outside view and needs more specific information to be useful.
*   **Inside View:**  The most relevant article directly mentions Hudson Bay Mountain: "Hudson Bay Mountain Resort is preparing for the upcoming ski season, with a planned opening date of December 7. However, ski hill manager Lex Rei-Jones mentioned that if the snow permits, they may try to open the T-bar a weekend before their scheduled opening date." This gives a strong inside view. There is also a suggestion that multiple weather systems in British Columbia may allow for early openings of other ski resorts in the region.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

The key evidence here is the resort's stated *planned* opening date of December 7th. It's crucial to avoid overreacting to this. Plans can change. The fact that they *might* open earlier is a secondary consideration. We also need to consider that weather variability plays a role.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:**
    *   The resort has a *planned* opening date of December 7th which is one day before the resolution date.
    *   The possibility of an even earlier opening.
    *   Multiple weather systems in British Columbia bringing snow and moisture to the region, which suggests good conditions for opening at the planned date and even earlier.
    *   The general trend that many resorts are opening earlier than usual
*   **Negative Forces:**
    *   The caveat “if snow permits” in the local news implies the planned opening is weather-dependent.
    *   Weather is inherently unpredictable, so a late start to the snowfall or lack of sufficient snowfall could delay the opening.
    *   The resort might face operational challenges despite having enough snow.
    *   The local news about Hudson Bay Mountain is a bit vague. It says that if snow permits they may try to open the T-bar a weekend before, but it's not clear when that would be. It could mean opening earlier for only a short time, and not being consistently open.
    *   The ski resort might make a decision to be open but not have updated their On the Snow page to indicate they are open (which is where the question will resolve.)

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

There is a mix of positive and negative forces, and no clear trend to extrapolate apart from the resort's target opening date which is very close to our target resolution date of December 8th.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

There's clearly a range of possibilities. It's unlikely it's a certainty, but it's not improbable either. The "if snow permits" condition leaves reasonable room for doubt. We have some idea of the chances because we know the target opening date for this resort is very close to the resolution date.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

Given that the planned date is *so close* to the question's resolution date, I should not be overly cautious. But the fact that it is not a certain opening date, and relies on weather conditions, should temper any overconfidence. This is not a "sure thing."

**9. Look for Errors:**

My potential error here is over-relying on the planned opening date. I could be underestimating the effects of bad weather, operational delays, or changes to snow conditions. I need to be cautious not to make the mistake of seeing the planned date and assuming the opening will occur as planned.

**Balancing the Evidence:**
The single most important piece of evidence is that Hudson Bay Mountain is planning to open on December 7, 2024 - one day before the resolution date. The positive and negative forces are fairly even overall. This means the probability must be fairly high, but not too high.

**My Prediction:** Between 60.00% and 90.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Hudson Bay Mountain's opening status on December 8, 2024.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   There are no human predictions from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus available for this specific question. This means I'll have to rely entirely on the available news articles and my own analysis.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To determine the probability of Hudson Bay Mountain being open on December 8th, I need to consider several sub-problems:

*   **Planned Opening Date:** What is the resort's target opening date?
*   **Early Opening Probability:** What is the likelihood they open earlier than planned?
*   **Weather and Snow Conditions:** Are current and forecasted conditions favorable?
*   **Operational Readiness:** Are there any known operational challenges?
*   **Historical Data:** Do past seasons provide clues on early/late openings?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** It's difficult to obtain specific historical opening data for this resort. Generally, ski resorts are dependent on weather, so looking at generic base rates of on-time openings may be too simplistic. However, I can use the provided articles to look at what proportion of resorts open on time or early, to provide a weak base rate. I am also aware that resorts in different locations are different. 
*   **Inside View (Specific Evidence):** The news articles provide specifics about Hudson Bay Mountain and its planned opening, as well as a picture of the broader situation for other resorts.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I need to avoid being overly influenced by either optimistic or pessimistic news, and to focus on the specific evidence available. 
*   I also need to avoid the bias of thinking that what has happened in other regions will necessarily be repeated here.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Positive Forces:** The resort has a planned opening date of December 7th, indicating an intention to open. The manager said they *might* open the T-bar a weekend *before* the scheduled opening if conditions allow.
*   **Negative Forces:** Weather and snow conditions are always an unknown. There's no specific information saying that snow conditions are favorable enough to open early, or that they will not be ready to open on time. There may be operational challenges or unforeseen delays not mentioned in the articles.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   There is no reliable "trend" I can extrapolate because this is a single, specific event in time.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I can certainly be more precise than "likely" or "unlikely." I will assign a specific probability range and most likely percentage.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I need to avoid extreme probabilities (near 0% or 100%) as this is a complex event with some uncertainty.

**9. Error Analysis (Avoiding Hindsight):**

*   I need to be aware of the risk of overemphasizing specific news and hindsight bias once the event resolves.

**Analysis of News Articles:**

*   **Hudson Bay Mountain Specifics:** The most critical article is the one stating the planned opening date is December 7th and that if conditions permit they *may* try to open the T-bar a weekend before. This suggests a high probability of opening on December 7th.
*   **Regional Comparisons:** Other BC ski resorts like Sun Peaks, Silver Star, and Big White are opening late November.  This indicates that early openings in BC are possible, but that late November is a common opening time.
*   **General Trend:** Many ski resorts globally are opening in late November and early to mid-December. Some resorts have already opened early in November, but these are primarily in Colorado and Utah. The article about multiple weather systems sweeping through BC which may help resorts open early is also helpful here.
*   **Artificial Snow:** The article mentions no reliance on artificial snow for Hudson Bay, which suggests a greater reliance on natural snowfall. Other resorts have invested heavily in artificial snow, which reduces weather uncertainty.
*   **Uncertainty:**  Many of the articles emphasize that opening dates are "subject to change based on weather conditions". So while resorts have target dates, those are not guaranteed.

**Synthesis and Forecast:**

The strongest piece of evidence is the Hudson Bay Mountain article stating their planned opening of Dec 7th and the potential to open earlier if snow permits. Given the timing of the question (Dec 8th) I must take into account the high likelihood that the resort will be open if it plans to be open the previous day, as well as the chance that it might open even earlier.

I will use a fairly strong inside view here due to the specificity of the local article on Hudson Bay. A weak base rate derived from the articles suggests about 50% of resorts will open either on their target date or earlier in the season, but there is too much location variation to use this as a strong outside view. I will therefore move the probability significantly higher than the generic base rate due to the stated planned opening date of December 7th, while still leaving some room for an unanticipated delay.

**My Prediction:** Between 80.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To assess the likelihood of Hudson Bay Mountain being open by December 8, 2024, we need to consider:
    *   **Base Rate:** What is the typical opening rate for ski resorts by early December?
    *   **Hudson Bay Mountain Specifics:** What is their planned opening date, and what factors might cause them to deviate from that?
    *   **Current Conditions:** How are current weather conditions in the region?
    *  **Regional Opening Trends:** What are the opening patterns for other resorts in similar climates and regions?
    *  **On The Snow Reliability**: How reliable is the On The Snow reporting for this resort?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Looking at a large number of ski resorts, most will be open by early-to-mid December in regions where they tend to operate. However, it is difficult to obtain good base rate data for *this specific date* across all ski resorts, as opening dates vary widely according to local conditions, snow-making technology, and other factors.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):** This includes focusing on specific details about Hudson Bay mountain and any local trends that might be relevant.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** Discounting the resort's stated opening date or neglecting relevant details about the resort's specific circumstances.
*   **Overreacting:** Becoming overly influenced by the most recent news about other resorts, or allowing early openings at other locations to sway me excessively.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Opening:** The resort's planned opening date is December 7, and the desire to cater to skiers and generate revenue is a strong incentive to open on time. Moreover, the mountain manager did say they might open the t-bar even earlier, given the right conditions.
*   **Forces against Opening:** Unfavorable weather, lack of snowfall, equipment issues, staffing shortages, or any other logistical issues could cause a delay.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   Most ski resorts mentioned in the news are opening from late October through December. The news also notes that British Columbia resorts are seeing favorable conditions this year. There's a general trend of early openings in many areas and good snow reports from other regions.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question can be broken down into broad likelihood ranges but it's useful to add granularity to capture the nuanced probabilities.

**8. Under- vs. Overconfidence:**

*   I will aim for a balance between certainty and acknowledging uncertainty. I do not want to be too confident or too hesitant given all of these factors.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

*   I will try to avoid making assumptions based on how similar situations have turned out in the past, recognizing the need for flexibility. I will also be mindful of the potential for hindsight bias when this forecast resolves.

**Analysis of the News Articles:**

*   **Hudson Bay Mountain's Planned Opening:** The most crucial piece of information is that Hudson Bay Mountain has a planned opening date of December 7th. They have also indicated a willingness to open earlier if conditions permit.
*   **BC Ski Conditions:** There are multiple articles indicating an active weather pattern in British Columbia and that this year may be similar to 2022 when many resorts opened earlier. Whistler has received 38cm of snow and other resorts in the area have similar snow totals. Sun Peaks, another BC resort, opened on November 23, with others opening Nov 28-30th. This is a strong argument in favour of the resort opening on time.
*   **Other Resort Openings:** Many resorts in North America and Europe are opening earlier than normal. This is a positive sign for early-season conditions generally. However, it is important to recognize that these are spread across a large number of locations, and conditions in those locations may differ from Hudson Bay mountain.
*   **Snowmaking:** The article about Holiday Mountain notes that snowmaking can often be relied upon to get some hills open, even with mild weather, though this technology is not always able to overcome substantial deficits in natural snowfall.
*   **El Nino:** The article about Blue Mountain notes an expected El Nino winter, which could bring more snowfall. This may be a positive factor for the ski season in BC as well.
*   **No Mention of Problems:** No articles mentioned specific problems or delays for Hudson Bay Mountain. This is a tentative positive sign for the scheduled opening.

**Weighing the Evidence:**

*   The main piece of evidence pointing towards a "Yes" is the resort's planned December 7th opening and their potential willingness to open the T-bar early. Additionally the weather pattern in BC suggests plentiful moisture for the area, and many resorts in BC have opened prior to Dec 7th.
*  The risk of a "No" stems primarily from the general uncertainty around weather. If conditions are significantly less favorable than expected, then it may not open.
*   I will slightly discount the fact that many other resorts in other parts of the world are opening early, as those conditions are not directly correlated with the conditions at Hudson Bay Mountain.
* The on-the-ground reality is uncertain and my forecast must reflect the uncertainty.
* Given the planned opening of December 7th, the favourable BC conditions and no mentioned problems, I can say a "Yes" is more likely than a "No".

**Forecast:**

Given the combination of factors above, I believe it is likely that the resort will be open by December 8, 2024. However, there are still some weather related uncertainties that prevent me from assigning too high of a percentage to "Yes". I will therefore assign a higher chance to the "Yes" than to a "No" but with some consideration to the alternative possibility. I will use a somewhat wide range to reflect some of the uncertainties about this scenario.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using the principles of superforecasting.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no existing predictions for this specific question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket. Metaculus also currently has no predictions available. Therefore, I will need to rely on a combination of base rates, specific information about the Hudson Bay Mountain Resort, and information from news articles about opening dates for other resorts.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether the Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort will be listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow's Ski Report on December 8, 2024. To answer this, we need to consider:

*   **Scheduled opening date:** What is the planned opening date for Hudson Bay Mountain Resort?
*   **Weather conditions:** Are conditions (snowfall, temperature) likely to be favorable for opening on or before December 8th?
*   **Resort readiness:** Is the resort in a state of readiness (snowmaking, staff, etc.) for the opening?
*  **Contingency plans** Are there any backup plans or potential alternative scenarios if there isn't enough snow on Dec 8?
*   **Historical precedent** Has the resort opened before its scheduled opening date before? How does this year compare to previous years?
*   **Opening dates for similar resorts** Can we use other resort opening dates as a useful base rate for this event?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate of ski resorts opening as scheduled is difficult to quantify precisely, but anecdotally, many resorts plan their openings carefully and typically manage to open close to their projected date. This is a moderate probability to begin with. We can also look at other resort opening dates in this analysis.
*   **Inside View:** We will be reviewing specific information for the Hudson Bay Mountain resort and see what we can derive from the available information.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   We will need to ensure that the information is being carefully reviewed without being too optimistic or too pessimistic about the likelihood of the resort being open. We will also need to consider the chance that the information that is available to us is incomplete.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing towards opening:** The desire of the resort to open on time, marketing efforts, the need to serve customers, planned events.
*   **Forces pushing against opening:** Insufficient snowfall, warm temperatures, mechanical problems, lack of staffing.

**6. Linear Extrapolation of Trends:**

*  There are not significant trends to extrapolate from a weather perspective except to note that this is mid-November and there are still a few weeks until the resolution date.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Hudson Bay Mountain Specifics:** The Interior News article states that the *planned* opening date for Hudson Bay Mountain Resort is December 7. However, it also mentions that the ski hill manager stated they might try to open the T-bar a weekend *before* that date if snow permits. The article was published on November 6th so this is the most recent and specific information available regarding the resort's opening. This shows there is a chance they may open earlier than December 7, which is positive for our target date of December 8.

2.  **Weather Conditions:** The articles discuss snowfall in Colorado, the Pyrenees, and other locations. There is mention of an active weather pattern bringing moisture and snow to British Columbia's alpine areas, which is the location of Hudson Bay Mountain. However, there is no specific mention of snowfall or conditions *at* Hudson Bay Mountain. This means there is still some uncertainty regarding the quality and quantity of snow, even with favorable regional weather patterns. The article about Blue Mountain Resort notes that they need -2C temperatures to enable snow making, which means the temperatures at Hudson Bay will be a consideration.

3.  **Resort Readiness:** The article says that the resort is "preparing for the upcoming ski season". This is a neutral point as resorts would usually be preparing for the season. The ski resort is also hosting a number of events. The presence of these events, and especially the U14 provincials, suggests a degree of organizational readiness at the resort. The mention of the T-bar being a possible early opening also suggests that the resorts priority will be getting the main lift open for skiing. The new information center to open on Elbrus, for example, does not directly contribute to whether the ski slope can open.

4. **Contingency Plans:** There are contingency plans in place to possibly open earlier than the scheduled Dec 7 date, which is a positive signal, however this depends on conditions.
    
5.  **Historical Precedent**: There is no information about whether the resort has opened before the scheduled date in the past. This means that there is no strong historical precedent on either side of the argument.

6.  **Opening Dates of Similar Resorts:**
    *   Many resorts in the US and Europe are opening in late November and early December. For example, resorts such as Brian Head Resort in Utah opened on November 8, with many other Colorado resorts opening around the same time. In BC, Sun Peaks opened on Nov 23, Silver Star on Nov 29, and Big White on Nov 28. Revelstoke will open on Nov 30. Given that several BC resorts are opening either just before or just after the target date, this should lead to a moderate probability for the Hudson Bay Mountain opening date.
    *   Many European resorts are also opening in late November and early December.
    *  There are no other resorts listed in BC that have a target opening date of Dec 8, so Hudson Bay Mountain would be quite delayed relative to the other BC resorts if it is not open by December 8.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

*   The planned opening date is December 7, which is very close to the resolution date of December 8.
*   The resort has made mention of potentially opening earlier if snow conditions permit.
*   The weather forecast for British Columbia is favorable, however the specific conditions at Hudson Bay Mountain are still unknown.
*   There is no direct statement stating that the resort will not be open by December 8.
*   Most of the other BC resorts are opening by the end of November so the Hudson Bay Mountain resort would need to be ready to open by the target date to avoid being delayed relative to other resorts.
*   The lack of a very specific statement regarding December 8th makes a 100% prediction difficult.

**Forecast:**

Given all the factors, the odds are reasonably good that the Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort *will* be listed as open on December 8, 2024. The evidence leans towards the resort being ready on time, however, there is some uncertainty due to the dependence on snow conditions and the potential for delays. I will make the assumption that if they have plans for a Dec 7 opening they will be likely to also be ready by Dec 8. I will give a moderate probability of it being open.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

*   **Resort readiness:** Is the resort in a state of readiness (snowmaking, staff, etc.) for the opening?
*  **Contingency plans** Are there any backup plans or potential alternative scenarios if there isn't enough snow on Dec 8?
*   **Historical precedent** Has the resort opened before its scheduled opening date before? How does this year compare to previous years?
*   **Opening dates for similar resorts** Can we use other resort opening dates as a useful base rate for this event?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate of ski resorts opening as scheduled is difficult to quantify precisely, but anecdotally, many resorts plan their openings carefully and typically manage to open close to their projected date. This is a moderate probability to begin with. We can also look at other resort opening dates in this analysis.
*   **Inside View:** We will be reviewing specific information for the Hudson Bay Mountain resort and see what we can derive from the available information.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   We will need to ensure that the information is being carefully reviewed without being too optimistic or too pessimistic about the likelihood of the resort being open. We will also need to consider the chance that the information that is available to us is incomplete.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing towards opening:** The desire of the resort to open on time, marketing efforts, the need to serve customers, planned events.
*   **Forces pushing against opening:** Insufficient snowfall, warm temperatures, mechanical problems, lack of staffing.

**6. Linear Extrapolation of Trends:**

*  There are not significant trends to extrapolate from a weather perspective except to note that this is mid-November and there are still a few weeks until the resolution date.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Hudson Bay Mountain Specifics:** The Interior News article states that the *planned* opening date for Hudson Bay Mountain Resort is December 7. However, it also mentions that the ski hill manager stated they might try to open the T-bar a weekend *before* that date if snow permits. The article was published on November 6th so this is the most recent and specific information available regarding the resort's opening. This shows there is a chance they may open earlier than December 7, which is positive for our target date of December 8.

2.  **Weather Conditions:** The articles discuss snowfall in Colorado, the Pyrenees, and other locations. There is mention of an active weather pattern bringing moisture and snow to British Columbia's alpine areas, which is the location of Hudson Bay Mountain. However, there is no specific mention of snowfall or conditions *at* Hudson Bay Mountain. This means there is still some uncertainty regarding the quality and quantity of snow, even with favorable regional weather patterns. The article about Blue Mountain Resort notes that they need -2C temperatures to enable snow making, which means the temperatures at Hudson Bay will be a consideration.

3.  **Resort Readiness:** The article says that the resort is "preparing for the upcoming ski season". This is a neutral point as resorts would usually be preparing for the season. The ski resort is also hosting a number of events. The presence of these events, and especially the U14 provincials, suggests a degree of organizational readiness at the resort. The mention of the T-bar being a possible early opening also suggests that the resorts priority will be getting the main lift open for skiing. The new information center to open on Elbrus, for example, does not directly contribute to whether the ski slope can open.

4. **Contingency Plans:** There are contingency plans in place to possibly open earlier than the scheduled Dec 7 date, which is a positive signal, however this depends on conditions.
    
5.  **Historical Precedent**: There is no information about whether the resort has opened before the scheduled date in the past. This means that there is no strong historical precedent on either side of the argument.

6.  **Opening Dates of Similar Resorts:**
    *   Many resorts in the US and Europe are opening in late November and early December. For example, resorts such as Brian Head Resort in Utah opened on November 8, with many other Colorado resorts opening around the same time. In BC, Sun Peaks opened on Nov 23, Silver Star on Nov 29, and Big White on Nov 28. Revelstoke will open on Nov 30. Given that several BC resorts are opening either just before or just after the target date, this should lead to a moderate probability for the Hudson Bay Mountain opening date.
    *   Many European resorts are also opening in late November and early December.
    *  There are no other resorts listed in BC that have a target opening date of Dec 8, so Hudson Bay Mountain would be quite delayed relative to the other BC resorts if it is not open by December 8.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

*   The planned opening date is December 7, which is very close to the resolution date of December 8.
*   The resort has made mention of potentially opening earlier if snow conditions permit.
*   The weather forecast for British Columbia is favorable, however the specific conditions at Hudson Bay Mountain are still unknown.
*   There is no direct statement stating that the resort will not be open by December 8.
*   Most of the other BC resorts are opening by the end of November so the Hudson Bay Mountain resort would need to be ready to open by the target date to avoid being delayed relative to other resorts.
*   The lack of a very specific statement regarding December 8th makes a 100% prediction difficult.

**Forecast:**

Given all the factors, the odds are reasonably good that the Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort *will* be listed as open on December 8, 2024. The evidence leans towards the resort being ready on time, however, there is some uncertainty due to the dependence on snow conditions and the potential for delays. I will make the assumption that if they have plans for a Dec 7 opening they will be likely to also be ready by Dec 8. I will give a moderate probability of it being open.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using the principles of superforecasting.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no existing predictions for this specific question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket. Metaculus also currently has no predictions available. Therefore, I will need to rely on a combination of base rates, specific information about the Hudson Bay Mountain Resort, and information from news articles about opening dates for other resorts.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether the Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort will be listed as "Open" on OnTheSnow's Ski Report on December 8, 2024. To answer this, we need to consider:
