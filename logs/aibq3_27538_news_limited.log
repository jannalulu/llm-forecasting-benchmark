**Lukashenko: Nuclear Strike on Ukraine Would Leave Putin Without Allies**
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would leave Russian President Vladimir Putin without allies. He said, 'I know for sure that the Ukrainians would be very happy if Russia used or we used tactical nuclear weapons there. It would be a joy. Then, I think, we would hardly have any allies left.' Lukashenko believes that a nuclear strike on Ukraine would cause rejection even from those who consider Putin's position on the war, but do not openly support him. He added, 'There would be no sympathetic countries left because they are immersed in what is happening. Secondly, it's nuclear weapons. We already have a negative image of this.' Lukashenko previously called for Moscow and Kiev to return to negotiations to avoid a nuclear war, saying, 'We have already pressed the 'red buttons' around Belarus and Russia. It remains only to press the 'reddest' one. <…> Let's sit down at the negotiating table and end this squabble.' Putin stated that he does not see grounds for using nuclear weapons in Ukraine or anywhere else, but only in case of a threat to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US was prepared for a possible Russian nuclear strike on Ukrainian territory at the end of 2022, after a series of Russian army defeats. Russia's officials previously claimed that Ukraine was planning to detonate a 'dirty bomb', which the US saw as a pretext for using tactical nuclear weapons.

**Kyiv Plans to Detonate 'Dirty Bomb' and Strike at Russian Nuclear Facilities**
According to a Telegram channel run by a war correspondent, Marat Khayrullin, the Ukrainian military is preparing a 'dirty bomb' explosion. The Kharkiv Oblast police, citing information from captured Ukrainian soldiers, claim that Kyiv plans to attack the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants to blame Russia for the provocation. Khayrullin stated, 'Sources on the other side report that the Ukrainians are preparing a nuclear provocation - a dirty nuclear bomb explosion. The attacks are planned to be carried out on the storage facilities of spent nuclear fuel at the power plants. This may happen during the next attempt by the Ukrainians to enter Rylysk from the side of Glukhov.' He also mentioned that the special warheads for this provocation have already been delivered to the city of Zheltye Vody in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the 'Vostochny Gorno-Obogatitelnyi Kombinat' enterprise. Khayrullin warned to take this information seriously 'in the face of the agony of the Ukrainian regime and, more importantly, the one standing behind it - the West.' He also noted that 'there is a high probability of an attack on both the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants.' The Kharkiv Oblast police also reported on the nuclear provocation, stating, 'At the moment, it is known that the intention is to attack the atomic objects of the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia power plants in Kurchatov and Energodar. The goal of the attacks is to subsequently accuse Russia of provocation, in the framework of which the Russian leadership may take retaliatory measures and strike with nuclear weapons at the territory of Ukraine.'

**Russia Uses Thermobaric Weapons in Response to Ukraine Drone Attacks, Raising Nuclear Risk**
In response to Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian territory, Russia has used thermobaric weapons. The Russian Defense Ministry announced that a Su-34 fighter-bomber had launched a night attack on a group of Ukrainian military personnel and equipment in the Kursk region, using a 500kg bomb. The ministry also stated that a thermobaric missile had been used to strike a site of foreign mercenaries in the southern outskirts of Sudzha, in the Kursk region. Thermobaric weapons are nearly 100% combustible explosive, which sucks oxygen and are much more powerful - and their explosion lasts longer - than conventional explosives of the same weight. The Russian Emergency Ministry has reported that over 76,000 people have been evacuated from the border areas in the Kursk region, where fighting is ongoing between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed concern about the risk of a nuclear accident at the Kursk nuclear power plant, located near the conflict zone. The agency has called for maximum restraint in military activities near the plant to ensure its physical integrity. Meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has reported that 219 civilians were killed in July, the highest number since October 2022. At least 71 children were killed or injured in July, bringing the total number of children involved in the conflict to 2,184 since the start of the war. 'It's been 900 days since the escalation of the war in Ukraine, and every day we've seen a child killed or injured,' said Stephane Moissaing, national director of Save the Children in Ukraine. 'This year, the violence has intensified, and missiles, drones, and bombs have killed children day after day. We must do everything possible to protect children, their homes, and their schools from the devastation of this war.'

**North Korea May Not Dare to Launch Nuclear Attack on Ukraine**
According to Maxim Yali, a political scientist, North Korea cannot respond to Ukraine's actions on occupied territories, let alone launch a strategic nuclear attack. Yali explained to 24 Channel that Ukraine has been killing Russian citizens on its territory for eight years, and even during a successful Ukrainian offensive in 2022, Vladimir Putin did not use nuclear weapons. Therefore, such actions from North Korea are unlikely. North Korean nuclear missiles usually fall in the Japan Sea and are used as a threat to South Korea, Japan, and the US. None of these weapons have ever flown to Ukraine, which is over 7,000 kilometers away. Even if a nuclear missile were to fall on Russian territory, China would not allow it. Beijing would be forced to impose sanctions on North Korea. In October 2022, China intervened, recalling its participation in the Budapest Memorandum. China officially stated that the use of tactical or strategic weapons is unacceptable, as it is a strategic weapon. If even Putin were to make a few statements and hold private meetings or negotiations, North Korea would not be mentioned, considering its total dependence on Beijing, emphasized Maxim Yali.

**Russia's New Weapon Will 'Break the Back' of Ukraine's Air Defense System**
Russian forces will break the back of Ukraine's air defense system with the help of FAB-3000 M54 bombs, according to Brandon Weichert, an analyst at National Interest. These bombs cover a large area and are difficult to intercept. If mass-produced, they will crush Ukraine's air defense and break the back of its air strategy, Weichert wrote. He believes that FAB-3000 M54 marks the beginning of a new phase of special operations, in which the Ukrainian military will find it harder to defend against air targets. The Russian military has been targeting Ukrainian infrastructure since October 2022, with attacks on energy, defense industry, military command, and communication facilities across the country. The air raid sirens in Ukraine sound almost daily, sometimes nationwide. According to the press secretary of the President, Russian forces do not target residential areas and social infrastructure during battles with the Ukrainian military.

**Ukraine Allegedly Preparing to Detonate 'Dirty Nuclear Bomb'**
According to Russian military sources, Ukraine's armed forces are allegedly preparing to detonate a 'dirty nuclear bomb', a nuclear provocation. The claim suggests that Ukraine is planning to detonate a dirty nuclear bomb and attack storage facilities for used nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants. It is reported that Ukraine's military has delivered warheads to the city of Zhelty Vody in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast and the 'East Mining and Processing Plant'. The information is being taken seriously, with a high likelihood of an attack on the Kursk and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants being mentioned. 'We are facing a very high risk of a nuclear power plant attack,' said a source, without specifying further details.

**BREAKING: Russian Sources Warn Ukraine is Reportedly Planning to Detonate 'Dirty Nuclear Bomb' Targeting Russian Nuclear Power Plants**
Russian sources warn that Ukraine is reportedly planning to detonate a 'dirty nuclear bomb' targeting Russian nuclear power plants, including the Zaporizhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The plant, which is the largest in Europe and among the top 10 in the world, has been under Russian control since 2022. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that a fire broke out at the plant, but the cause is unclear. Russia has previously warned about the possibility of a nuclear provocation, and a Russian scientist stated that it's 'not that difficult' for Ukraine to create a dirty bomb, citing instances of toxic substances being used that could only have been synthesized in the US. According to Russia Today, the potential targets are storage sites at power plants, and the Russian security block claims to know the location of the special warheads prepared for the attack. 'This does not look good,' said the Russian scientist. 'Will the deep state stoop this low?' asked a video via Midnight Rider.

**Ukraine Prepares to Detonate 'Dirty' Nuclear Bomb, Claims Russian Military Correspondent**
According to military correspondent Marat Khairullin, the Ukrainian military is preparing to detonate a 'dirty' nuclear bomb. The target of the planned attack is storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel at Russian atomic power plants, including the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Khairullin stated, 'The strikes will be carried out against the places of storage of spent nuclear fuel of the AES.' The goal of the attack, as explained by the administration of the Kharkiv region, is to accuse Russia of provocation and 'self-shelling.' Earlier, the head of the Russian radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, General-Lieutenant Igor Kirillov, warned that Ukraine may already possess a 'dirty bomb.' He stated, 'We have already informed the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons about our concerns, but we have not received any response yet.' A 'dirty bomb' is a type of radiological weapon of mass destruction that uses conventional explosives and radioactive material. Unlike traditional nuclear weapons, the goal of a 'dirty bomb' is to contaminate a territory with radiation rather than destroy military targets.

**Russian Forces Destroy Ukrainian Military Targets, Down 71 Drones**
Russian forces destroyed a US-made Patriot air defense system's radar station, a Ukrainian military ammunition depot, and several enemy troop and equipment concentrations. The Russian military also downed four Ukrainian 'Tochka-U' tactical missiles, a US-made 'Hammer' guided bomb, 15 HIMARS and Vampire rockets, and 71 Ukrainian drones. This comes as Russia continues its special operation in Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, with the goal of demilitarizing and denazifying the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the operation's aim is not to occupy Ukrainian territories, but to protect civilians in the Donbas region. Putin announced partial mobilization in Russia on September 21, 2022, and the annexation of four Ukrainian regions was finalized on September 30, 2022. The regions were placed under martial law on October 19, 2022. A state of emergency was declared in three Russian regions bordering Ukraine on August 10, 2024, after a Ukrainian provocation in the Kursk region.

**More Russians Believe Nuclear Weapons Use in Ukraine War is Justified**
A survey conducted by the Russian non-governmental research organization 'Levada-Center' shows that the number of Russians who do not oppose the use of nuclear weapons in a war against Ukraine has increased. 10% of respondents believe that such actions by Russia would be 'unconditionally justified', while 24% think they would be 'justified sooner or later'. A year ago, in April 2023, 19% of Russians held such views. However, most respondents - 52% - are not in favor of such a prospect. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has stated that Russia will use all means, including nuclear weapons, if there is a threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He has also noted that the nuclear doctrine is 'alive' and can be modified. Will Putin use nuclear weapons in the near future, considering his recent statements? The article 'New Nuclear Blackmail. What Putin is thinking this time?' by Vladimir Kravchenko explores this question.

**Russian Glide Bombs Fall on Russian Territory, Causing No Detonation**
According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, at least 38 Russian-made glide bombs, which were used in attacks on Ukraine, have fallen on Russian territory, specifically in the Belgorod region, near the Ukrainian border, between April 2023 and April 2024. The majority of the bombs did not detonate. The bombs were discovered by local residents, including foresters, farmers, and villagers. At least four bombs fell on the city of Belgorod, and seven were found in nearby suburbs. The ISW (Institute for the Study of War) previously reported that civilians were injured during a recent Ukrainian attack on Crimea, and experts analyzed the data and concluded that the victims were caused by Russian military actions. One rocket was deflected from its trajectory by Russian air defense systems and exploded in mid-air over Sevastopol, injuring 124 people, including 27 children, and killing 5 people, including 3 children.

**WWIII on brink as Russia advised to ‘demonstrate' nuclear explosion to ‘scare' West**
Dmitry Suslov, a top figure at the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defence Policy, has suggested that Russia conduct a 'demonstrative' nuclear detonation to deter the West from supporting Ukraine. This proposal comes as tensions between Russia and the West escalate over Ukraine's use of Western-supplied weaponry. Suslov believes that a non-combat nuclear explosion would remind Western politicians of the fear of nuclear war, which has prevented conflicts between great powers since 1945. The proposal has raised concerns among Western security circles, with worries that Russia may be edging towards carrying out such a test.

**Russia Accuses US of Importing Radioactive Substances into Ukraine for 'Dirty Bomb'**
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Pentagon is importing radioactive substances into Ukraine for further disposal. The substances are mainly being transported through Poland and Romania, said Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian military's radiation, chemical, and biological protection forces. The substances can be used to create and use a 'dirty bomb'. The Ukrainian government can use the 'dirty bomb' under a foreign flag. A 'dirty bomb' is a simple form of radiological weapon that causes damage not from the explosion itself, but from the spread of radioactive material. Experts consider one type of 'dirty bomb' to be the destruction of non-nuclear facilities using radioactive materials. Russia has previously accused Ukraine of planning to use a 'dirty bomb' on its territory. The first time this was reported was in the fall of 2022. According to American media, the US was preparing for a possible Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine. Sources from CNN claimed that Russia's accusations were seen by US authorities as a pretext to do something crazy. In September 2023, Yuri Kokov, the deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, stated that Ukraine allegedly planned to detonate a 'dirty bomb' on its territory and blame Russia for it. According to him, this plan was being developed by the Ukrainian government with the help of Western consultants.

**Russia Accuses Ukraine of Importing Hazardous Waste for 'Dirty Bomb' Creation**
Russia's Ministry of Defense announced that they are importing radioactive and hazardous chemical waste to Ukraine, which could be used to create a 'dirty bomb'. According to Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense Forces, the substances could be used to create a 'dirty bomb' and then used 'under a false flag'. The Ministry of Defense made this conclusion based on operational information. Kirillov added that Ukraine continues to receive radioactive and chemical substances for disposal, with the main routes passing through Poland and Romania. The head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andrey Yermak, is overseeing these shipments. In October last year, it was reported that Kiev was preparing a provocation on Ukraine involving the detonation of a 'dirty bomb' or a small nuclear explosive device, aiming to accuse Russia of using weapons of mass destruction and launch an anti-Russian campaign worldwide.

She also predicted that Ukraine will continue to attack Russia and that the country will increase its political influence over the aggressor. Pasynkova emphasized that the best news is not just about striking back, but about increasing one's influence to overcome the 'orcs'.
