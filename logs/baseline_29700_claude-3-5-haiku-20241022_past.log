After carefully analyzing the situation, here's my reasoning:

1. Mitch McConnell recently announced he will step down as Republican Senate Leader in November 2024.

2. John Thune is currently the #2 Republican in the Senate and has been considered a potential successor.

3. However, Thune has faced some internal party challenges:
- He's been critical of Trump in the past
- There's potential competition from more Trump-aligned senators
- Senate Republican dynamics are complex and factional

4. Key considerations:
- Thune has seniority and establishment support
- He's well-positioned organizationally
- But the Republican caucus has shown unpredictability in leadership choices

5. Timing is critical - the resolution is specifically before December 1, 2024

6. After careful weighing of factors, I see this as a competitive but slightly favorable scenario for Thune

Factoring in the specific timing constraint and current political landscape, I assess the probability as follows:

My Prediction: Between 55.50% and 69.75%, but 62.40% being the most likely. Probability: 62.40%.
