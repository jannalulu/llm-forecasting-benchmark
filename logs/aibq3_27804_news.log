**Deputy Sheremet Warns Public Figures of Potential Fate Similar to Durov's**
Deputy Sheremet warned public figures who have left Russia that they may face a similar fate to Pavel Durov, who was detained in Paris on August 24. Sheremet stated, 'I urge all public and well-known people who have left Russia to wake up and not be fools, remembering the looming danger. It's an illusion that they can become free citizens of the world abroad.' He added that these individuals are seen as mere pawns in the West's efforts to resolve undemocratic issues. Sheremet also pointed out that Durov's persecution in France demonstrated the selective nature of 'democracy' in the West. Durov was accused of 10 crimes and offenses, including complicity in administering an online platform for illegal transactions, complicity in distributing child pornography, and complicity in the illegal trafficking of narcotics. He was also accused of refusing to cooperate in an investigation into his alleged wrongdoing. Durov's lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, called the charges against him 'absurd.' Durov was released on bail of 5 million euros on August 28, but is prohibited from leaving France.

**Pavel Durov Released from Custody, Prohibited from Leaving France**
Pavel Durov, the creator of Telegram, was released from custody on August 28, 2024, under a 5 million euro bail. He is prohibited from leaving France and must report to the police twice a week. The Paris prosecutor's office stated that Durov is being investigated for several crimes, including managing a platform that facilitates illegal activities, refusing to provide information to authorities, and participating in money laundering, child sexual abuse, and narcotics trafficking. According to the document, the preliminary investigation against Durov began in February, involving the French National Police's Office for the Protection of Minors (OFMIN). The prosecutor stated that the investigation was initiated due to Telegram's repeated disregard for government requests. Durov was arrested upon arrival at Paris's Le Bourget airport on August 24. The investigation involves 12 allegedly committed crimes, and the case is being handled by the Center for Combating Digital Crimes (C3N) and the National Office for the Prevention of Financial Crimes (Onaf). On August 26, French President Emmanuel Macron assured that the case against Durov is not politically motivated. Durov's brother, Nikolai, was also put on the wanted list in France on March 25, 2024, for allegedly participating in child pornography. The brothers' passports were revoked after Telegram failed to respond to a French request for information about the individual suspected of creating child pornography. According to Forbes, Durov's ex-partner, Irina Bulgareva, has filed a lawsuit against him in Switzerland, accusing him of physical abuse against their child. Bulgareva had previously sued Durov for unpaid child support of 150,000 euros. Durov holds citizenship in France, the UAE, and Saint Kitts and Nevis, but his Russian passport expired in 2022. After the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Durov asked Forbes not to refer to him as a Russian businessman. The arrest of Durov has sparked a global reaction, with supporters including Edward Snowden and Elon Musk.

**Pavel Durov Released from Custody, Investigation Continues**

He is being investigated for several crimes, including managing a platform that facilitates illegal activities, refusing to provide information to authorities, and participating in money laundering, child sex crimes, and narcotics trafficking. According to the Paris prosecutor's office, the investigation began in February, with the involvement of the French National Police's Child Protection Unit.

The investigation is being led by the French National Center for the Fight against Cybercrime and the National Office for the Fight against Swindling. Durov's brother, Nikolai, was also put on the wanted list in France on March 25, 2024, for suspected involvement in child pornography. However, there is no indication that either brother was directly involved in the alleged crimes. Additionally, a Swiss woman, Irina Bulgareva, who claims to be the mother of Durov's children, has filed a lawsuit against him in Switzerland, alleging physical abuse of their child.

**Durov May Be Detained in France Amid Fears of Flight**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, may not be able to leave France as law enforcement officials are concerned that he may flee to another country on his personal plane. According to French lawyer David Libeskind, 'There is a significant risk that he will be placed in pre-trial detention because he does not reside in France. The judge may consider that there is a risk that he will not appear in court and leave the country. He would need to justify his residence in France, which I think would be difficult for him. Pre-trial detention can last up to four years.' Durov was arrested at Paris-Le Bourget airport on August 24, 2024, and is accused of refusing to cooperate with French intelligence services regarding the encryption codes of Telegram. He is also facing various charges, including child pornography and drug trafficking.

**Pavel Durov's Passports Seized for Investigation**
Parisian lawyer Irina Sidorova stated that all of Pavel Durov's passports have been seized by the court for the duration of the investigation. 'All of the passports that he had were taken for the duration of the investigative actions. Therefore, he is unable to leave France by air, sea, or land,' Sidorova said. The investigation is expected to last more than three months, according to Sidorova. 'It can be assumed that the investigation will last for many months, and it will not be completed within three months,' she said. Sidorova also noted that none of the charges against Durov carry a sentence of more than 10 years in prison. If Durov attempts to leave France, he may be placed under arrest. 'In the case of Durov, a court control has been established, a list of restrictions has been outlined, including a ban on leaving the territory of France. In the event of a violation by Durov, the decision to control is revoked, and Durov can be declared a fugitive and then placed under arrest for the duration of the investigative actions,' Sidorova said. Durov holds citizenship of France, Russia, the UAE, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.

**Deputy Warns of Danger for Russians Who Leave the Country**
Deputy Mikhail Sheremet warned that those who have left Russia may face the same fate as Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, who was arrested in France. 'I urge all public and well-known people who have left Russia to wake up and not be foolish, to remember the danger that looms over them', Sheremet said. He emphasized that it is an illusion to think that they can become free citizens of the world abroad, as they will always be seen as Russians and a means to solve global problems that are far from democratic. The politician noted that Durov's arrest in France has shown the selectivity of 'Western democracy', which is 'beating its own drum'. As reported by KP.RU, Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, commented on Durov's arrest and suggested that the French authorities detain Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, for the platform's activities. Medvedev stated that Durov 'seriously miscalculated' by leaving Russia to become a 'man of the world', as he remains an 'unsafe Russian' in the eyes of the West, even after changing his citizenship and moving abroad. Durov was detained at Paris airport on August 24 and was under arrest until August 28. He is now under judicial supervision, prohibited from leaving France, and must post a 5 million euro bail.

**Durov under Judicial Supervision in France: Restrictions and Possible Deal**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, has been placed under judicial supervision in France and is prohibited from leaving the country. He was ordered to pay a 5 million euro bail and to appear at the police station twice a week. Durov was also required to live at an address designated by the judge, but he is not required to wear an electronic bracelet to track his movements. According to the prosecutor's office, Durov has the right to move around France as long as he complies with certain restrictions imposed by the court. The businessman's passports have been confiscated. Durov was detained on August 24 at Paris's Le Bourget airport and then held in custody. He is suspected of being an accomplice to 12 crimes, including those related to the moderation policy of Telegram. The judicial supervision may last for several years, according to David Libeskind, a French lawyer representing Durov. 'As a rule, in France, criminal investigations last three or four years, and there is no maximum term. The judge will regularly summon him for questioning,' Libeskind said. The lawyer added that the judicial supervision does not prevent Durov from continuing to work and manage Telegram, as it does not involve any restrictions on the use of the internet or phones. Durov has the right to appeal to the investigating judge at any time to change, relax, or cancel his judicial supervision in France. He may also request permission to travel abroad in exceptional circumstances. 'We perfectly understand who Europe is walking with. Moreover, it is worth recalling how the Americans bent the Swedish and British justice regarding [WikiLeaks founder Julian] Assange,' said Vladimir Korolev, a political scientist. 'Durov was not arrested by chance. He was 'marinated' for three days in the dungeons,' Korolev added.

**Pavel Durov and Telegram Accused of Ignoring Authorities and Enabling Pedopornography**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, has been released from arrest after being detained at Paris airport on August 24, 2024. However, he is not free to leave France as he must respond to charges filed by the Paris court. The charges include failure to cooperate with French authorities in identifying a suspect, complicity in administering the platform to allow illicit operations, and complicity in crimes committed by organized groups. According to the Paris court's statement, Telegram has been accused of not cooperating with authorities, providing encryption services that guarantee secrecy without proper declaration, and providing and importing a means of encryption that does not guarantee authentication or integrity without prior declaration. The court's statement also mentions that Telegram has been involved in multiple cases of pedocriminality, trafficking, and online hate. The company has been accused of ignoring requests from authorities, which has led to the opening of an investigation by the JUNALCO, the digital unit of the National Jurisdiction for the Fight against Organized Crime of the Paris Prosecutor's Office. Telegram has been known to ignore requests from authorities, as stated by Nunzia Ciardi, Vice Director General of the National Cybersecurity Agency, in an interview with Giornalettismo in 2021: 'Telegram is a platform that guarantees a high level of anonymity. Therefore, it is chosen by people who want to let go of themselves. Then, there is a large group of people who choose it to organize demonstrations and service interruptions. Telegram collaborates poorly and has very powerful anonymity criteria. Investigations on that platform require a lot of time. But they are not impossible: there is only a need for a significant technical expertise.' The company has been accused of ignoring requests from authorities, which has led to the opening of an investigation by the JUNALCO, the digital unit of the National Jurisdiction for the Fight against Organized Crime of the Paris Prosecutor's Office. According to a person close to Durov, the company has ignored requests from authorities, leaving them to accumulate in 'a rarely checked email box.'

**Russian Citizens May Face Persecution Abroad, Says Deputy**
Russian citizens who have left Russia may face persecution similar to that of Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, according to Mikhail Sheremet, a deputy from Crimea. 'This is an illusion that they will be able to become free citizens of the world abroad. For the West, they will forever be Russians and a means to solve distant, undemocratic global problems,' Sheremet emphasized. He added that Durov's detention and political persecution once again showed the selectivity of 'Western palacial democracy.' Durov was detained at Paris' Le Bourget airport on August 24, where he was being investigated for crimes under 12 articles. On August 28, a Parisian investigative judge charged Durov with crimes, and he will be under judicial supervision in France. According to Politico, a warrant for Durov's arrest was issued in March, allegedly due to his suspected involvement in storing, distributing, or providing access to child pornography as part of an organized group. Prior to this, Telegram refused to respond to a court inquiry in a case of sexual abuse of minors.

**Pavel Durov Released on Bail Amid Organized Crime Charges and EU Investigation**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, has been charged with organized crime-related offenses, but was released on a 5 million euro bail. He is under judicial supervision and is not allowed to leave France. Durov must report to the police twice a week and is not allowed to leave France. According to Reuters, the investigation does not imply guilt or a trial, but rather indicates that the judges see sufficient grounds for further investigation. The investigation can last for years before being referred to court or can be closed. Durov was arrested at Paris airport 4 days ago and was released after the maximum 96-hour detention period expired. He is accused of: conspiring to administer an online platform for illegal transactions as part of an organized group; refusing to provide information or documents to authorized bodies; complicity in crimes related to child pornography, drug trafficking, and fraud; money laundering; providing crypto services without declaration; importing crypto instruments without declaration. The Wall Street Journal reported that in 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron offered Durov to move Telegram's headquarters from the UAE to Paris, but Durov refused. Despite this, France granted him citizenship in 2021 through a simplified procedure. After Durov's arrest, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that there were concerns about the procedure of his citizenship. The Financial Times reported that the European Commission has launched an investigation into Telegram, suspecting that the company underreported its user base in the EU to avoid stricter regulations under the Digital Services Act. The law, which came into effect at the beginning of the year, distinguishes between very large platforms with a monthly audience of 45 million and all other services. Telegram initially reported 41 million users in the EU, but later failed to provide updated data, stating that it had significantly fewer active users per month.

**Russian State Duma Deputy Warns of Severe Consequences for Those Who Have Left Russia**
Russian State Duma deputy Mikhail Sheremet has warned that those who have left Russia may face severe consequences and repeat the fate of Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, who was detained in France. 'I urge all public and well-known people who have left Russia to wake up and not be foolish, to remember the looming danger. It's an illusion that they will become free citizens of the world abroad,' Sheremet said. He believes that in Western countries, Russians who have left their homeland will always be a bargaining chip in solving strategic tasks. This warning comes after the speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, claimed that the US was behind Durov's detention, as the incumbent US President Joe Biden needed to take control of the messenger before the presidential election. Durov was detained on August 24 at Paris's Le Bourget airport upon arrival from Azerbaijan. He has been under judicial supervision for three days, accused by French judicial authorities of being an accomplice in illegal activities through his messenger, including the illegal trafficking of narcotics, crimes against children, and fraud. On August 28, Durov was put under judicial supervision and prohibited from leaving France. He was later released on a 5 million euro bail.

**Pavel Durov Released from Paris Court on Bail**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, was released from a Paris court on August 28, 2024, after being detained on August 24. He was released on a 5 million euro bail and is required to stay in France and report to the police twice a week. Durov was accused of administering an online platform for illegal transactions, which could result in up to 10 years in prison and a 500,000 euro fine. Durov's lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, called the charges 'absolutely absurd.' Durov was seen leaving the court, wearing a cap and sunglasses, and speaking with a man, possibly his lawyer, before quickly getting into a black car and leaving. He did not speak with journalists. 'It was a great day' for Durov, as he was able to leave the court, but the charges against him still loom large. According to the court, Durov is not allowed to leave France until the case is resolved. The charges against Durov are related to his role in Telegram, which the prosecution claims was used for illegal transactions.

**Pavel Durov Released on Bail in France, Investigation Continues**
A French judge has begun an official investigation into Telegram founder Pavel Durov on charges of organized crime, but he may avoid pre-trial detention by paying a 5 million euro bail. Durov must report to the police twice a week and is not allowed to leave France, according to the court's decision. Durov was released from custody late on Wednesday without an escort and left in a private car. As Reuters explains, in France, an investigation does not imply guilt or a trial, but rather indicates that the judges see sufficient grounds for further investigation. This process can take years before being referred to court or dropped, according to Reuters. The judge made the decision to continue the investigation and impose bail four days after Durov's arrest at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport. The maximum possible detention period, 96 hours, expired on Wednesday evening. Durov is accused of all 12 crimes listed in the indictment, including complicity in the activities of an organized group in managing an online platform for illicit transactions, refusal to provide information or documents to authorized authorities, and money laundering. The French prosecutor's office stated that Durov is accused of these crimes, which carry a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a 500,000 euro fine. The allegations of lack of moderation of potentially criminal content in Telegram and refusal to cooperate with law enforcement agencies have previously arisen in many countries, including Russia, but only in France have they been directed against Durov himself. Durov was detained at Paris' Le Bourget airport on Saturday, August 24, after arriving on a private plane from Azerbaijan. Durov holds four passports, including a French one, in addition to his Russian citizenship, as well as citizenship of the island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis and the UAE, where he lived in recent years, having left Russia in 2014.

**Pavel Durov Released Under Judicial Supervision**
The Paris prosecutor announced on Wednesday the release of Pavel Durov, the executive director of 'Telegram', under judicial supervision, on the condition that he pays a 5 million euro bail, and is forbidden from leaving French territory. Pavel Durov was previously taken to appear before an investigating judge after spending 4 days in provisional detention since last Saturday. According to French channel 'BFM', Pavel was taken to the judge after spending 4 days in provisional detention, and it was stated that his arrest was due to his refusal to cooperate with the authorities during the investigations. Prosecutors stated that the investigation focuses on 'allegations of complicity in crimes including the management of an online platform that allows for illicit transactions, possession of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking, and scams, as well as refusal to provide information to the authorities, and providing encryption services to criminals.' The detention of Durov during his descent in Paris on a private plane last Saturday highlighted the criminal responsibility of application providers, and sparked debate about where freedom of expression ends and the application of the law begins. According to French agency 'AFP', quoting a close source to the investigation, Pavel Durov is also facing an investigation related to 'serious violence' against one of his sons in Paris. The source added that this investigation, entrusted to the Office of Minors (Ofmin), was opened just now, explaining that the actions were committed against the son of the French-Russian billionaire born in 2017, during his education in Paris. The French justice also criticizes Pavel Durov for not moving against the 'criminal uses of the application by users', especially through his refusal to cooperate with investigators, as he said, 'It is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that the application is not used for criminal purposes, and not the responsibility of the application provider to prevent it.'

**Telegram CEO Pavel Durov barred from leaving France as he's charged in probe into organised crime: What does it mean?**
Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has been barred from leaving France after being charged in an investigation linked to 'organised crime' on his messaging app. According to French authorities, Telegram was used for child sexual abuse and drug trafficking, and the company refused to share information with investigators.

**French Authorities Prevent Telegram CEO Pavel Durov from Leaving Country**
The French authorities have decided to prevent Pavel Durov, the executive director of Telegram, from leaving the country, four days after his questioning regarding allegations of using the platform for illegal activities. Durov's arrest upon his arrival at a nearby airport on Saturday has highlighted the criminal liability of app providers and sparked debate about the point at which freedom of expression ends and the law begins. According to a statement from the Paris prosecutor's office, 'the investigating judge has ended the detention of Pavel Durov and he will appear in court for the first time, where he will be charged with a possible offense.' Durov was released on a 5 million euro bail, under the condition that he will attend the police station twice a week and remain in France. Other allegations against Durov, a French citizen, include using his platform for child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking, fraud, and inciting organized crime, as well as refusing to share information or documents with investigators when required by law. According to Politico, the French authorities have also issued an arrest warrant for Nikolai, Durov's brother and one of the founders of Telegram, and that the arrest warrants for the brothers were issued in March. In response to a question about the report, the Paris prosecutor's office stated that it does not comment on arrest warrants as they are subject to the secrecy of the investigation. It added that the only person being questioned at this stage is Pavel Durov. Durov's arrest has also highlighted the tense relationship between Telegram, which has around a billion users, and governments. Being placed under formal investigation in France does not necessarily mean that Durov is guilty or will be sent to trial, but it indicates that the judges see the case as having enough evidence to move forward with the investigation. The investigation can last for years before being sent to trial or dropped.

Durov has been living in Dubai since 2017 and has citizenship of Russia, France, UAE, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. He received the latter in 2013, reportedly investing $250,000 in the country's sugar industry. Durov also received citizenship of the UAE in February 2021, a rare occurrence in a country where 90% of the population are foreigners without the possibility of obtaining citizenship. He became a French citizen in 2021, with the details of the process remaining unclear.

Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, was released from custody in Paris on August 28, 2024, but is not allowed to leave France until the investigation is over. He was ordered to pay a 5 million Euro bail. The Paris prosecutor's office announced that Durov was released under judicial supervision, citing a ban on leaving the French territory. The French justice system accuses Durov of not doing enough to prevent the spread of criminal or punishable content on Telegram, which has over 900 million users. Telegram denies these allegations. As reported by RT, the EU is trying to silence a critical, non-pro-western information source by blocking access to their website and blocking their social media accounts. This is not just related to the Ukraine war, but also affects their ability to report on other topics. RT notes that the EU has not banned their work or the reading and sharing of their articles, but rather has introduced a new law in Austria that may affect private individuals, prompting RT to ask users in Austria to refrain from sharing their articles on social media until the situation is clarified.

**Pavel Durov's Secret Visits to Russia: A Contradiction to His Public Stance**
Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, who was recently arrested in France, has secretly visited Russia over 50 times between 2015 and 2021, despite publicly refusing to cooperate with the Russian government. According to FSB data, Durov entered Russia more than 50 times during this period. Journalists verified the data by randomly selecting routes. In 2014, Durov stated that the FSB demanded that he reveal personal data of users who participated in the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine. He also reported that the Kremlin insisted on removing Russian opposition groups from social media and that armed law enforcement officers visited his home. In April of the same year, Durov sold his stake in the social network 'Vkontakte' and left Russia, stating that 'there is no way back.' However, from 2015, Durov regularly visited Russia, especially between 2015 and 2017 and from 2020 to 2021. The only exception was the time when the Russian government tried to block Telegram. Durov did not hide his visits, flying between St. Petersburg and European cities on Aeroflot flights and traveling by train to Helsinki. The lack of information about some of his trips may be due to the fact that he entered Russia through Belarus, where there is no border control with Russia. According to the investigation, Durov first visited St. Petersburg in May 2015, and by the end of 2017, he had visited Moscow and St. Petersburg at least 41 times. His brother, Nikolai, also actively participated in the development of Telegram and visited Russia with him. On June 20, 2021, Pavel Durov again arrived in St. Petersburg, combining his life between Russia, the UAE, and Europe until the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. During this period, chatbots, including those related to the opposition team of Alexei Navalny, were blocked before the 2021 State Duma elections. On October 21, 2021, Durov left Russia, flying from Pulkovo Airport to the Spanish island of Ibiza, and has not returned since. However, according to FSB data, his personal assistant continues to regularly visit Russia, likely to prepare Durov's visits to the country. He also accompanied Durov during a trip to Azerbaijan before his arrest in France. Before that, the owner of the social network X and billionaire Elon Musk called for Durov's release, launching the hashtag #FreePavel (Free Pavel) in his social network.

**Durov May Be Detained in France Amid Fears of Flight**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, may not be able to leave France as law enforcement officials are concerned that he may flee to another country on his personal plane. According to French lawyer David Libeskind, 'There is a significant risk that he will be placed in pre-trial detention because he does not reside in France. The judge may consider that there is a risk that he will not appear in court and leave the country. He would need to justify his residence in France, which I think would be difficult for him. Pre-trial detention can last up to four years.' Durov was arrested at Paris-Le Bourget airport on August 24, 2024, and is accused of refusing to cooperate with French intelligence services regarding the encryption codes of Telegram. He is also facing various charges, including child pornography and drug trafficking.

**Durov's Arrest in France: A Familiar Pattern of State Pressure**
The recent arrest of Pavel Durov in France has sparked comparisons to the pressure he faced in Russia. From a formal perspective, the cases are similar, with the state seeking access to encryption keys and increased control over the information space. Durov was forced to leave Russia in 2014 after refusing to hand over personal data of Ukrainian activists to the FSB. He revealed in an interview that the idea of creating an encrypted messenger came to him after facing pressure from Russian authorities while working with VK. In 2018, Telegram was blocked by Roskomnadzor for refusing to hand over encryption keys to the FSB, sparking widespread protests and demonstrations in Moscow and other major Russian cities. The block was later lifted in 2020, but the true intention behind it was to suppress free information exchange and gain control over data of opposition activists. Telegram has remained a primary platform for coordinating protests and sharing information in Russia.

**Sachkov Wishes Durov a Speedy Release from Detention**
Ilya Sachkov, the founder of Group-IB, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison for treason, expressed his wish for Pavel Durov, the creator of Telegram, to be released from detention in France as soon as possible. Sachkov posted this message in his verified Telegram channel. Durov had previously commented on Sachkov's arrest in 2021, saying, 'It's better to avoid arrests. What's the point of spending time in prisons?' Sachkov responded, 'It's remarkable that this answer returns to Pavel himself three years later. I didn't understand his message at the time. I stayed in Russia despite the risks, knowing I had committed no crime. Pavel, on the other hand, left Russia in a similar situation. And, as we see, it didn't help him much.' Sachkov added, 'Of course, I wish him a speedy release.' He also described Durov's arrest as 'absolutely inadequate and unfair treatment' of a talented engineer. Sachkov was sentenced to 14 years in a strict-regime colony in July 2023, and his appeal was rejected in October 2023. Durov was detained at the Le Bourget airport in France on Saturday evening, reportedly upon exiting a private plane from Azerbaijan. French authorities consider Durov, who holds French citizenship, to be a wanted person due to his alleged involvement in various crimes, including terrorism, drug trafficking, and money laundering. Durov may face up to 20 years in prison.

Tate advised Durov to 'train your body to keep your mind,' adding, 'Your time will come.' Tate shared a personal anecdote, saying, 'When I was at Durov's mansion in Dubai a week before my arrest in 2022, he remained silent when I told him that the authorities would come for him. He only responded, 'They'll come for all of us.' Tate concluded, 'Train your body to keep your mind. Your time will come.'

**Telegram's Durov Arrested in France: Company Responds with Statement**
The Telegram team released a statement on August 25, 2024, after the arrest of its creator, Pavel Durov, in France. The company stated that Telegram 'complies with EU laws' and that content moderation 'meets industry standards and is constantly improving.' The statement also claimed that Durov 'has nothing to hide' and that he 'continuously travels across Europe.' The team called the allegations that Durov or the platform are responsible for user abuses 'absurd' and expressed hope for a 'swift resolution' to the situation. French authorities have not commented on the arrest. Durov is being held as a suspect in a case of complicity in illegal activities, including narcotics trafficking, terrorism, child pornography, and other crimes. The Paris prosecutor's office stated that they will release a statement on August 26. The Russian Embassy in France has requested consular access to Durov. Durov has been living in France since 2014, after leaving Russia due to government pressure to shut down opposition groups on his platform, 'Vkontakte.' He has since acquired French citizenship and holds passports from several other countries. In 2022, Durov requested that Forbes no longer refer to him as a Russian businessman. In 2018, Russian authorities briefly blocked access to Telegram after the platform refused to provide the FSB with encryption keys, citing constitutional guarantees of privacy. A mass protest in support of Telegram was held in Moscow, with Alexei Navalny speaking at the event. The block was later lifted. Elon Musk has called for Durov's release, posting several messages on X, including a quote from Durov's interview with Takar Carlson. Protests in support of Durov were held in Moscow and St. Petersburg, with participants bringing paper airplanes, a symbol of Telegram.

**Medvedev Jokes that Macron Should Leave France as 'Durov Army' Comes**
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev joked that French President Emmanuel Macron should immediately leave France, as the army of Pavel Durov's followers will come after him. 'Macron, leave France immediately! The Durov army is coming after you,' Medvedev wrote on his social media account. This comes after Durov, the founder of Telegram, was detained by French authorities at Le Bourget airport on Saturday evening. Durov, who has French citizenship, was on a private plane that arrived from Azerbaijan. French media reported that Durov is being investigated for various crimes, including refusing to cooperate with French authorities. He may face charges, including terrorism, drug trafficking, fraud, and money laundering, which could result in up to 20 years in prison. The Russian Embassy in France told RIA Novosti that French authorities are refusing to cooperate on the Durov detention.

**Medvedev: Durov Miscalculated by Leaving Russia**
Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, believes that Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, made a mistake by leaving Russia to become a 'man of the world'. According to Medvedev, for Western countries, Durov is an unpredictable and dangerous Russian. Medvedev recalled a conversation with Durov, in which Durov stated that he would not cooperate with law enforcement agencies on serious crimes, saying 'This is my principled position.' Medvedev wrote in his Telegram channel on Sunday, 'Then there would be serious problems in any country.' Medvedev believes that Durov wanted to be a 'genius man of the world' who lives well without a homeland. However, Medvedev says that Durov 'miscalculated', as for all their common enemies, he is now a Russian, and therefore unpredictable and dangerous. 'Another blood', Medvedv wrote, 'Not like Musk or Zuckerberg, who actively cooperates with the FBI.' Durov was detained by French gendarmes yesterday evening when his private plane landed at Paris's Le Bourget airport. According to TF1, the detention is related to a preliminary investigation being conducted in France regarding the Telegram messenger created by Durov. French investigators believe that the lack of moderation and insufficient cooperation from the messenger's administration with the authorities hinders the fight against narcotics trafficking, money laundering, fraud, and other crimes. Durov will appear before a investigating judge in the near future and will likely be placed under arrest. 'Pavel Durov will be detained, that's for sure,' said a TF1 investigator. Russian diplomats are clarifying the situation with Durov's detention in France, according to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

**Pavel Durov's Decision to Leave Russia: A Quest for Freedom and Independence**
Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, left Russia 10 years ago. He has been living in Dubai since 2017, but obtained citizenship of Saint Kitts and Nevis earlier, in 2013. Durov explained his decision to leave Russia due to the lack of independent courts, numerous contradictory laws, and the need for simple and understandable laws. He also cited the lack of open competitions for government positions, the need for regional taxes to remain within the regions, and the inflexibility of the education system. Durov has been a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis since 2013, which allows him to travel to over 130 countries, including those in the European Union, without a visa. He also obtained French citizenship in 2021, which he used to avoid paying up to 47% of his income in taxes. Durov's decision to obtain French citizenship was not without controversy, as he was aware of the risks of being arrested in France, but continued to travel freely in Europe. The French authorities have stated that they will not discuss the issue of Durov's detention and arrest with Russia, and as a result, his extradition to Russia is unlikely.

**Telegram founder Pavel Durov arrested in France over messaging app offenses**
Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram and a billionaire tech pioneer, was arrested at Bourget Airport near Paris on August 25, 2024. According to reports, French authorities acted on a warrant related to unspecified charges while Durov was on his private jet, arriving from Azerbaijan. The 39-year-old, who holds dual citizenship with France and the UAE, is expected to appear in court today. Durov, a Russian native, left Russia ten years ago after resisting government demands to shut down opposition groups on his VK social media platform, which he later sold. Telegram has yet to provide a comment on the situation, and Russia's embassy in France is seeking clarification. Durov, along with his brother Nikolai, launched Telegram in 2013, which now has approximately 900 million active users and is known for its end-to-end encryption and 'channels' for fast information dissemination.

**What to know about Pavel Durov, the Telegram CEO arrested in France for links to crimes using the app like promoting terror**
Pavel Durov, the 39-year-old Russian-born founder and CEO of Telegram, was arrested at Paris' Bourget airport on August 25, 2024, according to TF1 TV and BFM TV. The investigation is focused on a lack of moderators on Telegram, which allegedly allowed criminal activity to go undeterred on the app. Durov, who has an estimated fortune of $15.5 billion, left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform. He has since become a French citizen and moved Telegram to Dubai in 2017. Durov stated, 'I would rather be free than to take orders from anyone,' in an interview with U.S. journalist Tucker Carlson. The French Interior Ministry and police had no comment, while Russia's Foreign Ministry said it was taking steps to 'clarify' the situation and questioned whether Western NGOs would seek Durov's release.

**Tucker Carlson Warns of 'Darkness' Descending on the World as Pavel Durov is Detained in France**
American journalist Tucker Carlson wrote on social media that the detention of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in France is a warning to all online platform owners. 'Pavel Durov left Russia when the government tried to take control of his social network Telegram. But it wasn't Putin who arrested him for allowing the public to exercise freedom of speech. It was a Western country, a Biden administration ally and an active NATO member that locked him up,' Carlson said. According to Carlson, the situation with Durov, who is currently in a French prison, is a warning to those who refuse to censor the truth at the behest of governments and intelligence agencies. 'Darkness is quickly descending on a once-free world,' Carlson concluded, linking to an interview with Durov that he published in April 2024. Durov was detained by French intelligence services around 20:00 local time on August 24 in the airport of Le Bourget. Durov had arrived in France from Azerbaijan with a girl and his bodyguard. Preliminary information suggests that the detention is related to Telegram's work: law enforcement considers Durov a co-conspirator in the illegal trafficking of narcotics, crimes against children, and fraud due to inadequate moderation in Telegram, refusal to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, and the possibility of sending cryptocurrency through the messenger. Durov, as a French citizen, faces up to 20 years in prison and is not eligible for exchange or extradition. Charges may be brought against him as early as Sunday, August 25. Durov is currently in custody.'
