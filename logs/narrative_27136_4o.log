INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - AUGUST 24, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, papers and digital screens scattered. The air is tense.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Kennedy's campaign suspension was always a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(Raises an eyebrow)  
Given his polling at 9.5% and $98 million in fundraising, it was unlikely he'd step down.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And yet, the pressure from both parties was immense. A wildcard, but not enough for him to throw in the towel.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
His influence could sway the election, but his resolve held firm. The data was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(Nods)  
The probabilities spoke. We knew he wouldn't suspend before September 24th.

The team reflects on their accurate predictions, a quiet confidence settling in the room as they prepare for the next forecast. The future remains uncertain, but their models remain steadfast.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - AUGUST 24, 2024

Three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, LUCAS, and AMY, sit at a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

JANE  
(leaning back)  
So, Kennedy's campaign. Did it happen?

LUCAS  
(shaking his head)  
No suspension. Our models had it at 5.25%. His polling and fundraising were just too strong.

AMY  
(nodding)  
Exactly. With 9.5% in the polls and $98 million raised, it made no sense for him to drop out.

JANE  
And the impact on the election?

LUCAS  
Significant. He's still a wildcard, potentially swaying the close race between Biden and Trump.

AMY  
(typing)  
We’ll see how it unfolds, but our predictions hold strong. 

JANE  
(sipping coffee)  
Another day, another forecast. Let's keep an eye on those numbers.

They continue their analysis, the future still uncertain.

A group of seasoned SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, papers scattered, eyes glued to a large screen displaying the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
So, here we are, the day after. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is still in the race. Our models had it at 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
His polling numbers were strong for an independent, and the $98 million in fundraising was a solid cushion. But the real kicker? His influence on the major parties.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Indeed. If he had dropped out, it could have shifted the dynamics significantly. But as of August 12, we saw no signs of a permanent suspension.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(grinning)  
The models never lie. Kennedy's campaign strategy is still playing out. Let's see how this affects the November showdown.
