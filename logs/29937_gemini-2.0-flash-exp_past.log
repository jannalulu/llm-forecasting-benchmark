Okay, let's break down this forecasting challenge.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   There are no directly comparable predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or past Metaculus questions on *specific monthly executive order counts*. So, I'll rely more on my own analysis.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is: Will the Federal Register list *exactly zero* executive orders by Joe Biden in November 2024? This breaks into several sub-questions:

*   **What is the usual pattern of Executive Order issuance?** Do presidents tend to issue many, few, or none in a given month?
*   **How does a presidential transition impact executive order activity?** Are there precedents for a lame-duck president reducing or eliminating executive orders after an election loss?
*   **What is specific to Biden's situation?** Does anything in the news suggest his EO activity might deviate from the norm in November 2024?
*   **Is there a trend in Federal Register page counts?** Is the volume of Federal Register publications increasing, and if so, does that suggest EO activity too?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**  I don't have precise base rates for monthly EOs. However, generally, presidents use EOs fairly frequently during their terms to enact policy agendas. It's less common to see a month with *zero* EOs. The Federal Register publishes items daily, so it's rare for the EO section to remain entirely empty throughout a month.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):** This situation is not the norm. The key differentiator is Trump's victory on November 5th. That victory strongly implies a change in presidential focus from implementing the current agenda to managing a transition of power.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

The news articles reveal two strong forces:

*   **Strong evidence for *decreasing* Biden EOs:** Numerous reports indicate Trump intends to reverse many of Biden’s EOs immediately upon taking office. These sources quote Trump's team as stating he plans to reverse *all* Biden EOs. This creates a strong disincentive for Biden to sign new EOs in November, as they would likely be reversed after two months.
*   **Conflicting evidence on Biden activity:**  The article on the extension of the US National Emergency with Iran states that Biden sent "to the Federal Register for publication the notice" regarding it. While this isn't an executive order *per se*, it indicates *some* presidential action to be published in the Federal Register in November. This is a specific counter-indicator that *some* presidential document will be published, albeit perhaps not an EO.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1:** Trump's transition team planning a large-scale rollback of Biden's policies and the inherent disincentive for Biden to create easily-reversed policies.
*   **Force 2:**  The regular need for executive actions to manage emergencies (Iran, Syria, etc.) even during a transition, as well as the ongoing implementation of the 2021 voter registration EO. There is also the possibility that Biden may still wish to issue new orders before he leaves.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

The trend of a high volume of Federal Register pages would normally suggest a lot of executive branch activity, but in this case, the known transition significantly disrupts this extrapolation.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I can't say 0% or 100% confidence. There is a chance of some unexpected EO, especially since the Iran national emergency extension was specifically announced, implying the need for Federal Register publication, which could potentially be an EO if it included more than a simple notice.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence:**

I should not be overly confident that this month will *definitely* be zero or that there would be some EOs. It's necessary to balance the strong evidence for a decrease in Biden EOs with the known requirements for specific notices to be published in the Federal Register and the small chance of unexpected actions.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

In prior forecasting exercises, I may have underestimated the power of specific information or over-relied on base rates. Here I'm trying to be sure to fully factor in the disruptive effect of the transition on presidential actions.

**Analysis and Conclusion:**

The weight of the evidence suggests a very low chance of Biden issuing executive orders in November 2024 given his election defeat, but not zero chance of something being published in the Federal Register that is a presidential document. The impending transition and Trump's stated plan to immediately reverse Biden’s EOs, as well as the typical reduction in the final months of a president's term, weigh heavily against new executive orders. However, the specific fact that the Iran national emergency extension was specifically noted, alongside the very small probability of other similar circumstances that may require some presidential action being recorded in the Federal Register, suggest a need to keep the probability above zero.

**My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 8.00%, but 3.00% being the most likely. Probability: 3.00%.**

Okay, let's analyze this question systematically.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No directly relevant predictions:** I haven't found any specific predictions for the number of executive orders in the Federal Register for November 2024 by Biden on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I'm starting with a blank slate, relying on base rates and analysis of available information.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Base Rate of Executive Orders:** How often has a president issued exactly zero executive orders in a single month in the past? This is a very rare occurrence. Most months have at least one EO. It appears to be much more common to have a substantial number of EOs.
*   **Trump's Victory:** Trump won the election on November 6, 2024. The transition period between the election and the inauguration is crucial. Will Biden cease all executive orders once he knows he is a lame duck president, or continue with some of his agenda as is usual?
*   **Biden's Actions in November:** What evidence exists that Biden will cease any executive orders in November?
* **Historical Precedent of Lame Duck Presidents:** How have other presidents acted in their lame duck period after an election defeat?
*   **Contradictory Evidence:** Is there any evidence suggesting Biden *will* issue orders in November?
*   **Nature of EOs in Late Term:** What types of executive orders are typically issued at the end of a presidential term, especially after an election loss?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Based on past presidents, it is extremely rare to have a month with zero executive orders, especially for a president still in office. Executive orders are frequently used tools for implementing policy.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Trump's victory:** This is a critical factor. The news articles are clear that Trump's team is actively planning to reverse Biden's executive orders. This might incentivize Biden to reduce the number of EOs he issues late in his term.
    *   **"Lame Duck" Period:** Typically, lame duck presidents don't initiate new major policies through executive orders, focusing more on ensuring a smooth transition. They may also continue some key items, such as the annual Iran emergency extension.
    *   **Biden's Previous Actions:** Biden has been issuing executive orders on a range of issues up to this point, which suggest he is not reluctant to use this tool, but is it usual to continue to do so even after losing an election?
   *   **Precedents:** Historically, lame duck presidents will often focus on transition issues, some ceremonial duties, perhaps some key areas like the extension of the Iranian emergency. They are less likely to initiate major new policy agendas.

**4. Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Strong Evidence for Lower Probability:** Trump's impending reversal plans provide strong evidence for a lower probability of Biden signing new EOs in November. The fact he has lost also is important. Lame duck presidents are unlikely to introduce new major policies by EO
*   **Evidence for Higher Probability:** The evidence of his previous behaviour (numerous EOs to this point) could suggest that he might continue signing EOs up until the end of the term. The Iran emergency extension is a good example of a routine annual order that is very likely to be completed.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Reducing EOs):** Trump's victory and his team's promise to repeal Biden's EOs create a strong disincentive for Biden to issue further orders, especially if he knows they will just be overturned.
*   **Force 2 (Continuing EOs):** Biden's previous reliance on EOs, and need to complete certain ongoing tasks such as the Iran emergency extension, are a reason to believe he might sign further orders.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**
*   The trend is towards more use of EOs. Trump is more likely to reduce them if he gains the presidency than Biden is if he remains in power. However, there is a big change of circumstances now Biden has lost the election and that Trump has won. Trump's incoming administration will certainly look to reduce their quantity.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I am not certain Biden will issue zero EOs, but the chance is significantly higher now that he has lost the election. I am also not certain that Biden will issue at least one, given the circumstances. The range will reflect this doubt.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I am confident that the chance of zero EOs has increased significantly after Trump's victory but there is still a chance of EOs.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**

*   This question forces me to recognize the impact of political changes on seemingly apolitical processes like publishing executive orders. It requires considering both historical patterns and unique contextual factors.

**Reasoning:**

The key is that Trump won the 2024 election. This is a major shift. The overwhelming news reports are that Trump will immediately revoke Biden's EOs. That is a huge disincentive to signing any in November. This event is not something that has happened before, as Biden was the incumbent and was not expected to lose the election according to most pollsters. Therefore, the base rate is not as applicable to this specific instance. We know that the Iranian emergency has been extended in November for the current year, so there is a clear case for at least one EO. However, Biden and his administration are aware that Trump will reverse everything. This is a very strong reason to not bother issuing any further EOs.

I am factoring in the strong possibility of Biden focusing on the transition rather than his policy goals and that he is unlikely to initiate major new policy agenda through EOs. The base rate makes me think an EO or two is very likely. The political forces make me think otherwise. The tension between the two is what I will try to represent. Given all of this, I think the chances of zero EOs is quite high, and the Iranian emergency annual extension is a routine process that is a counter-argument. So, I am putting a reasonably high estimate, but a reasonable range to account for the uncertainty of this specific instance.

**My Prediction:** Between 10.10% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class here is the historical frequency of months with zero executive orders published in the Federal Register by a sitting US president.  Looking at past presidencies, it is extremely rare to have a month with zero executive orders from the sitting president. In particular, presidents are usually quite active early in their terms, as well as during times of heightened political or international activity. I don't have easy access to a historical database of this, but given how rare it would be, it's fair to assume a very low base rate, probably less than 1% chance. However, this month is very unusual because there's been an election, and President Biden is a "lame duck" president who is about to leave office. This dramatically changes the applicability of past monthly data.
*   **Other predictions:** I am unaware of other predictions for this specific event on any platform.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

*   **Biden's Motivation:** Why would Biden issue more EOs in November after losing an election?  There would be less political incentive to push through new policies since any new ones are likely to be quickly overturned by the incoming President.
*   **Transition Period:** The election happened on Nov 5th, meaning the rest of the month is dominated by the transition period to the new president. This could dramatically reduce activity.
*   **Trump's Plans:**  The news articles are clear that Trump is planning a large reversal of Biden's executive orders as soon as he takes office. This makes it even less likely that Biden would issue new executive orders in the same time period.
*   **Required Publication:** Is there anything that *requires* Biden to publish an EO this month? The Iran national emergency extension requires publication in the Federal Register; however, this was done in the last day of *October*.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** Base rate of zero executive orders in a month is very low (probably <1%) during a presidents term. However, this month is not a typical month and warrants a major adjustment from base rate.
*   **Inside View:** The articles paint a picture of an outgoing administration that is likely to be winding down and not initiating a new course of action, especially given Trump's explicit intention to undo Biden's EOs.  The Iran extension publication has already happened at the end of the previous month. The upcoming transition adds to the likelihood of inactivity. The upcoming inauguration is also likely to reduce the output of executive orders.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** The news articles strongly suggest a lack of activity from Biden this month, it would be easy to assign almost 100% probability of no EOs.
*   **Underreacting:** It is possible that the news articles are all missing a scenario where Biden is compelled to issue an executive order for some unknown reason, or that there are some less important EOs that could still be made even in the lame duck period.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for Zero EOs:** The strongest force is the impending transition, Trump's stated intention to reverse Biden's orders, and Biden's lack of political motivation to issue EOs as a lame duck president.
*   **Force Against Zero EOs:** The force against this is the general inertia of the executive branch that may have had some orders already in the pipeline. It is also possible Biden makes a final attempt to push through something he cares about given this is his last month before leaving office. A low-probability event such as a newly discovered national security threat could cause the President to publish an EO.

**6. Linear Extrapolation of Current Trends:**
*   Biden was very active in using executive orders during his term, this trend is unlikely to continue in his lame duck period.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
* The question is binary, and as such the range of probability is the best representation of my doubt.

**8. Balance Under and Overconfidence:**

*   I am fairly confident in the general story, but I must leave room for error and acknowledge that the future can be unpredictable. This prevents me from going to an extreme value.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   The risk is over-relying on the dominant narrative presented by the news.  Hindsight might reveal unforeseen events that led to an EO, however the most likely outcome given the current evidence is that there won't be any.

**Reasoning:**

The overwhelming evidence points to a very low probability of Biden issuing any EOs in November. Trump's victory and intention to reverse Biden's policies, coupled with the lame-duck status and the lack of any explicit drivers for Biden to issue new EOs, create a strong case for zero EOs.  However, the base rate of a monthly zero EO figure is essentially zero during any president's tenure, so I must balance the strong likelihood of zero EOs this month with a chance that a low-probability event could result in one. Therefore, I'll assign a high but not extreme probability to zero executive orders.

**Forecast:**
My Prediction: Between 78.00% and 96.00%, but 89.50% being the most likely. Probability: 89.50%.

Trump's victory and intention to reverse Biden's policies, coupled with the lame-duck status and the lack of any explicit drivers for Biden to issue new EOs, create a strong case for zero EOs.  However, the base rate of a monthly zero EO figure is essentially zero during any president's tenure, so I must balance the strong likelihood of zero EOs this month with a chance that a low-probability event could result in one. Therefore, I'll assign a high but not extreme probability to zero executive orders.

**Forecast:**
My Prediction: Between 78.00% and 96.00%, but 89.50% being the most likely. Probability: 89.50%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** The relevant reference class here is the number of executive orders issued by US Presidents in the final months of their term, particularly when they have lost the subsequent election. Looking at past examples can provide a base rate for how likely a president is to issue executive orders in this situation. However, finding a precise equivalent situation is difficult.
*   **Past Data:** Examining past Federal Registers reveals a very variable pattern in terms of the number of Executive Orders issued by presidents each month. This makes it difficult to provide a strong base rate. However, if we look at the end of each presidency since the 20th century the tendency has been that the outgoing president issues several executive orders per month.
*   **Existing Forecasts:** There are no readily available forecasts on Polymarket or FiveThirtyEight related to this specific question. Metaculus has a related question about the total number of executive orders that Biden will issue over his presidency (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12027/total-number-of-executive-orders-signed-by-president-joe-biden/), but this is not specific enough to be useful here.

**2. Sub-Problems:**

*   **Biden's Motivation:** Will Biden continue to issue executive orders knowing he will be replaced? Based on past behaviour he seems likely to continue to be an active president.
*   **Trump's Intent:** Will Trump's impending presidency discourage Biden from issuing new orders? The article suggests Trump intends to reverse a large number of Biden's executive orders, but there isn't any suggestion this will deter Biden from issuing them.
*   **Transition Period:** What is the typical activity level of the outgoing administration during the transition period?  It seems the outgoing administration usually keeps operating as normal during the transition period.
*  **Nature of Executive Orders:** What sort of things are they and how many are there typically? It seems they cover a wide variety of areas.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Based on historical observations, it's relatively uncommon for a US president to issue zero executive orders in any given month. This is especially true given that the US government continues to function throughout presidential transitions.
*   **Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**
    *   **Trump's Victory:**  The fact that Trump has won the election and plans to revoke many of Biden's EOs might *slightly* decrease the probability of new EOs being issued. There are several news articles quoting Trump's team making it clear that a large number of Biden's EO's are to be revoked.
    *   **Ongoing Issues:**  Despite the transition, there are still ongoing issues that might prompt EOs, such as the extension of national emergencies (Iran, Syria), the focus on AI, gun violence, etc.. Biden is likely to want to continue to exercise presidential authority for the remainder of his term.
   *  **Biden's Track Record**: Based on the news reports, Biden has been an active user of executive orders and it is not reasonable to suppose he will simply stop using them because of a change of president in the new year.
    *   **November Timing**: The fact that November is in the middle of the handover period may reduce the chance of the month being an anomaly in terms of executive orders.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   I will be careful not to overreact to Trump's stated intent. While he's clearly signalled his desire to undo Biden's policies, it doesn't mean Biden will suddenly stop issuing EOs. It is highly unlikely that Biden will see this as reason not to issue executive orders.
*   I'll avoid anchoring too much on the "Trump to revoke many Biden's EOs" rhetoric. It's possible that while Trump is planning to revoke them, Biden still has a month and a half in office.
* The fact that an EO to extend the US National Emergency with Iran has already been issued in November suggests other EOs are also possible in November.
* I will also avoid under-reacting to the transition: the fact that Trump has won the election is a unique feature of this month. This means that it is more likely that there will be some reduction in the number of EOs being issued by Biden in November, but unlikely to reduce the number to zero.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pushing for Executive Orders:** Biden's motivation to act, ongoing national issues, and the inertia of the federal government.
*   **Pushing Against Executive Orders:** Trump's victory, Trump's team explicitly outlining that they will revoke all of Biden's executive orders, and the transitional period.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The trend of Biden's presidency has been to use executive orders actively. However, with a change of president, this trend is almost certain to come to an end.
*  The fact that Trump has won the election may reduce the number of executive orders, but it's unlikely to mean that there will be exactly zero in November.
* Based on past performance, it seems likely that Biden will issue at least a few executive orders in November.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The question has a binary outcome (yes or no). I can express that in a confidence interval of probabilities.
*   I will use a probability range rather than point estimate, reflecting the uncertainty of the outcome.

**8. Under/Overconfidence and Prudence/Decisiveness:**

*   I will avoid being overly confident and provide a range that reflects the uncertainty inherent in the forecasting problem.
* I am also going to avoid being overly cautious and will try to make a relatively precise prediction that takes into account all of the data.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will reflect on my rationale if I am wrong and try to identify any biases or misinterpretations of the data.
*   I will look for evidence I might have ignored to try to improve my predictions in future.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Based on the analysis, it seems highly unlikely that President Biden will issue exactly zero executive orders in November. The ongoing national emergencies, the trend of his presidency and other issues suggest at least a few EOs are very likely in November 2024. Although Trump's upcoming presidency *may* reduce the overall number of executive orders, it is unlikely to result in zero for the month. The recent trend of Biden signing multiple executive orders per month suggests that it's far more likely that there will be at least one executive order signed in November. Therefore a very low percentage probability is warranted.

My Prediction: Between 1.00% and 5.00%, but 2.50% being the most likely. Probability: 2.50%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** The first step is to look at historical data: how often has a US president issued zero executive orders in a given month? This is tricky data to find, but we can look at overall trends. We know that modern presidents have used executive orders frequently, especially in the face of gridlock. The Trump administration had a lower rate of executive orders relative to the Obama administration, Biden's rate is slightly lower again. 
*   **Initial Baseline:** It is highly unusual for a US president not to issue *any* executive orders in a month, so an initial baseline should be relatively low, say around 5%. However, the specific context in November 2024, where a new President-elect has just been elected, demands a major revision of this baseline.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem:**

We need to consider the following sub-problems:

*   **Presidential Activity:** How active is President Biden likely to be in the lame-duck period? Will he be focused on major policy initiatives or on winding down and preparing for the transition?
*   **Transition:** How will the presidential transition impact executive order activity? Will there be a temporary lull in activity during this period?
*   **Trump's Plans:** How will the impending Trump administration impact Biden's actions in November 2024? Are they likely to discourage any new executive order activity from Biden?
*   **Federal Register:** Are there any procedural reasons why an executive order might not be listed on the Federal Register? For example, an order issued late in the month and published in the following month.

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** Based on historical precedent alone, a month with zero executive orders by a president is very unlikely. The outside view suggests the default should be very low, perhaps in the 5% range as a starting point.
*   **Inside View:**  The unique circumstances of November 2024 with a Trump victory makes the situation unusual, where the incumbent Biden is heading for the exit and Trump is heading for the White House. This information is critical and needs to be taken into account.

**4. Under/Over-reacting to Evidence:**

The news articles are critical in this case and provide a very strong argument to adjust from the outside view. Multiple articles state that Trump intends to revoke dozens (or even nearly 100) of Biden's executive orders.  These articles emphasize Trump's intention to undo Biden's agenda immediately upon taking office, indicating a very high likelihood that Biden would be reluctant to issue *any* new executive orders in November 2024 that could be immediately rescinded. The main clashing causal forces here are on one side Biden's normal inclination to issue executive orders, and on the other side a new administration that is set to overturn his agenda. The latter seems far stronger.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Pushing towards > 0 EOs):** President Biden has been active in using executive orders throughout his term. There might be some last-minute policy initiatives he wants to finalize.
*   **Force 2 (Pushing towards 0 EOs):** The most powerful force, this is Trump's victory and his stated intention to reverse Biden's policies immediately upon taking office. This creates a strong disincentive for Biden to issue *any* new orders in November, as they would be immediately overturned, which would make his administration look foolish. The risk of looking foolish is likely to trump any desire to make a final policy push.
*   **Force 3 (Pushing towards > 0 EOs):** There is the extension of National Emergencies which need to be published in the Federal Register. However, the article about Iran specifically states the action is already done. It is also possible that a *very late* order could be issued, but published in the following month. It is the listing in the Federal Register for November that is at issue here, not the timing of issuance of the EO itself.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

Linear extrapolation is not a very useful tool here, because this is an unusual set of circumstances. It is a discrete event which depends on the timing and content of presidential actions.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

We should acknowledge the slight possibility that Biden may issue *some* executive orders. It is very unlikely, but not impossible that a very specific, low-impact and uncontroversial executive order could be issued. However, the overwhelming weight of the evidence suggests zero orders.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

Given the clear narrative from news sources, we should be very confident in moving towards a higher probability of zero executive orders. There is a risk of overconfidence, and we should maintain some skepticism given the low base rate, but the balance of the evidence suggests moving to a higher probability of the event occurring.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**

We must be wary of hindsight bias. If the outcome is different from our prediction, we must look for the specific reasons that we missed, rather than simply assuming that the prediction was wrong. The key here is whether we correctly interpreted the degree to which Trump's victory would deter Biden from issuing any executive orders in November 2024.

**Final Prediction:**

Considering all the evidence, I believe the chance of President Biden issuing *exactly* zero executive orders in November 2024 is significantly higher than the initial base rate of 5%. The strong evidence suggesting Biden will be reluctant to issue new executive orders given the incoming Trump administration's intention to undo them is very strong. There is a very low risk of any last minute policy pushes given the political context. The most likely outcome is that Biden issues no new executive orders in November 2024. There is a small residual chance that some minor and low-key order could be issued, or that a late EO is not published in November, but the political forces at play here are very strong.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:** The first step is to look at historical data: how often has a US president issued zero executive orders in a given month? This is tricky data to find, but we can look at overall trends. We know that modern presidents have used executive orders frequently, especially in the face of gridlock. The Trump administration had a lower rate of executive orders relative to the Obama administration, Biden's rate is slightly lower again. 
*   **Initial Baseline:** It is highly unusual for a US president not to issue *any* executive orders in a month, so an initial baseline should be relatively low, say around 5%. However, the specific context in November 2024, where a new President-elect has just been elected, demands a major revision of this baseline.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem:**

We need to consider the following sub-problems:

*   **Presidential Activity:** How active is President Biden likely to be in the lame-duck period? Will he be focused on major policy initiatives or on winding down and preparing for the transition?
*   **Transition:** How will the presidential transition impact executive order activity? Will there be a temporary lull in activity during this period?
*   **Trump's Plans:** How will the impending Trump administration impact Biden's actions in November 2024? Are they likely to discourage any new executive order activity from Biden?
*   **Federal Register:** Are there any procedural reasons why an executive order might not be listed on the Federal Register? For example, an order issued late in the month and published in the following month.

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:** Based on historical precedent alone, a month with zero executive orders by a president is very unlikely. The outside view suggests the default should be very low, perhaps in the 5% range as a starting point.
*   **Inside View:**  The unique circumstances of November 2024 with a Trump victory makes the situation unusual, where the incumbent Biden is heading for the exit and Trump is heading for the White House. This information is critical and needs to be taken into account.

**4. Under/Over-reacting to Evidence:**

The news articles are critical in this case and provide a very strong argument to adjust from the outside view. Multiple articles state that Trump intends to revoke dozens (or even nearly 100) of Biden's executive orders.  These articles emphasize Trump's intention to undo Biden's agenda immediately upon taking office, indicating a very high likelihood that Biden would be reluctant to issue *any* new executive orders in November 2024 that could be immediately rescinded. The main clashing causal forces here are on one side Biden's normal inclination to issue executive orders, and on the other side a new administration that is set to overturn his agenda. The latter seems far stronger.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1 (Pushing towards > 0 EOs):** President Biden has been active in using executive orders throughout his term. There might be some last-minute policy initiatives he wants to finalize.
*   **Force 2 (Pushing towards 0 EOs):** The most powerful force, this is Trump's victory and his stated intention to reverse Biden's policies immediately upon taking office. This creates a strong disincentive for Biden to issue *any* new orders in November, as they would be immediately overturned, which would make his administration look foolish. The risk of looking foolish is likely to trump any desire to make a final policy push.
*   **Force 3 (Pushing towards > 0 EOs):** There is the extension of National Emergencies which need to be published in the Federal Register. However, the article about Iran specifically states the action is already done. It is also possible that a *very late* order could be issued, but published in the following month. It is the listing in the Federal Register for November that is at issue here, not the timing of issuance of the EO itself.

**6. Linear Extrapolation:**

Linear extrapolation is not a very useful tool here, because this is an unusual set of circumstances. It is a discrete event which depends on the timing and content of presidential actions.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

We should acknowledge the slight possibility that Biden may issue *some* executive orders. It is very unlikely, but not impossible that a very specific, low-impact and uncontroversial executive order could be issued. However, the overwhelming weight of the evidence suggests zero orders.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

Given the clear narrative from news sources, we should be very confident in moving towards a higher probability of zero executive orders. There is a risk of overconfidence, and we should maintain some skepticism given the low base rate, but the balance of the evidence suggests moving to a higher probability of the event occurring.

**9. Errors and Hindsight Bias:**
