To forecast whether the lithium carbonate price will fall below 70,000 CNY/T before October 1, 2024, I'll analyze the available information:

1. Recent price trends:
- As of September 7, 2024, lithium carbonate futures hit 69,700 yuan/ton, the lowest since July 2023.
- In August 2024, battery-grade lithium carbonate prices dropped to 74,600 yuan/mt.
- On September 12, 2024, Citi analysts forecasted short-term lithium carbonate prices at $14,000/metric ton (approximately 100,000 CNY/T).

2. Supply and demand factors:
- There's a global lithium supply surplus, with Antaike forecasting nearly 200,000 tons surplus in 2024.
- Electric vehicle demand growth is continuing but at a slower pace than previously expected.
- Some producers like CATL are cutting production due to low prices.

3. Expert predictions:
- Analysts expect potential price increases in the short term due to supply cuts and seasonal demand.
- However, longer-term forecasts suggest prices may remain relatively low through 2024.

4. Historical context:
- Prices have fallen dramatically from peaks of over 500,000 CNY/T in late 2022.
- The current price is already close to the 70,000 CNY/T threshold.

5. Time frame:
- We have about 18 days until the October 1, 2024 deadline.
- Short-term volatility is possible, but major price movements are less likely in such a short period.

Balancing these factors:

The price is already very close to 70,000 CNY/T, having recently touched 69,700. This proximity makes it highly likely the price will fall below 70,000 at least briefly before October 1. The ongoing supply surplus and reduced demand growth support continued downward pressure.

However, there are some counterbalancing factors:
- Recent production cuts could provide short-term price support.
- Seasonal demand increases in September/October may temporarily boost prices.
- The very short time frame limits the likelihood of major sustained moves.

Given the price has already briefly touched below 70,000 and the overall bearish market conditions, I assess there's a high probability the price will fall below 70,000 CNY/T at least once before October 1. However, the potential for short-term volatility and seasonal factors introduces some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether the lithium carbonate price will fall below 70,000 CNY/T before October 1, 2024, I'll analyze the evidence and trends:

Key factors supporting a price below 70,000 CNY/T:

1. Recent price trend: On September 7, 2024, lithium carbonate futures hit 69,700 yuan per ton, the lowest since July 2023. This indicates prices have already breached 70,000 CNY/T recently.

2. Supply surplus: Analysts forecast a near 200,000 ton lithium supply surplus globally in 2024, putting downward pressure on prices.

3. Weak demand: Data shows weakness in manufacturing activities in the US and China, potentially reducing lithium demand.

4. Price forecasts: Citi analysts predict lithium carbonate prices of $14,000/ton (approximately 100,000 CNY/T) in the short-term, suggesting prices could remain below 70,000 CNY/T.

5. Production increases: Argentina's lithium production grew 56% year-over-year in July 2024, adding to global supply.

Factors supporting a price above 70,000 CNY/T:

1. Recent price rebound: Citi analysts expect a 20-25% rise in lithium prices over the next 2-3 months due to supply curtailments.

2. Seasonal demand: Higher demand expected in September and October may provide some price support.

3. Production cuts: CATL announced plans to cut lithium production at its mines in China due to low prices, which could help stabilize prices.

4. Long-term demand growth: Despite short-term challenges, analysts expect continued growth in lithium demand for electric vehicles.

Balancing these factors:

The most recent data shows prices have already fallen below 70,000 CNY/T. While there are some potential upward pressures, the overall trend and supply-demand balance suggest prices are more likely to remain below 70,000 CNY/T than to rise significantly above it before October 1, 2024.

The main uncertainty is whether the recent production cuts and potential demand increase will be enough to push prices back above 70,000 CNY/T in the short term. However, given the substantial supply surplus and weak overall demand, a significant and sustained price increase seems less likely.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current price and recent trends:
The most recent price data from September 7, 2024 shows lithium carbonate futures hit a new low of 69,700 yuan per ton. This is already below the 70,000 threshold in the question, suggesting a high probability the price will remain below 70,000 by October 1.

2. Supply and demand dynamics:
Multiple sources indicate an oversupply situation in the lithium market:
- Antaike forecasts a near 200,000 ton surplus globally in 2024
- Increased production in Argentina and other countries
- Moderation in electric vehicle sales growth

3. Analyst projections:
- Citi analysts raised short-term price forecasts to 14,000 yuan/ton, but expect the rally to fade in 6-12 months
- Long-term forecasts (2029-2033) average around 18,280 yuan/ton

4. Recent price volatility:
- CATL's announced production cuts caused a short-term price spike in early September
- However, analysts expect this effect to be temporary

5. Seasonal factors:
Some analysts note potential for higher demand in September-October, which could provide price support

6. Time horizon:
The question asks about prices before October 1, which is less than 3 weeks away. This short timeframe makes dramatic price increases less likely.

Weighing these factors:

The current price is already below 70,000 yuan/ton, and the overwhelming evidence points to continued oversupply in the near-term. While there's some potential for short-term volatility or seasonal support, it seems unlikely these factors would be strong enough to push prices sustainably above 70,000 in less than 3 weeks.

The main risk to this forecast is an unexpected supply disruption or demand spike, but the probability of such an event appears low given the current market dynamics.

Given the very short time horizon and clear market trends, I assess a high probability that prices will remain below 70,000 yuan/ton by October 1.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

- Antaike forecasts a near 200,000 ton surplus globally in 2024
- Increased production in Argentina and other countries
- Moderation in electric vehicle sales growth

3. Analyst projections:
- Citi analysts raised short-term price forecasts to 14,000 yuan/ton, but expect the rally to fade in 6-12 months
- Long-term forecasts (2029-2033) average around 18,280 yuan/ton

4. Recent price volatility:
- CATL's announced production cuts caused a short-term price spike in early September
- However, analysts expect this effect to be temporary

5. Seasonal factors:
Some analysts note potential for higher demand in September-October, which could provide price support

6. Time horizon:
The question asks about prices before October 1, which is less than 3 weeks away. This short timeframe makes dramatic price increases less likely.

Weighing these factors:

The current price is already below 70,000 yuan/ton, and the overwhelming evidence points to continued oversupply in the near-term. While there's some potential for short-term volatility or seasonal support, it seems unlikely these factors would be strong enough to push prices sustainably above 70,000 in less than 3 weeks.

The main risk to this forecast is an unexpected supply disruption or demand spike, but the probability of such an event appears low given the current market dynamics.

Given the very short time horizon and clear market trends, I assess a high probability that prices will remain below 70,000 yuan/ton by October 1.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.
