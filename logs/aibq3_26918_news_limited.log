**Middle East Conflict Escalates as Violence Spreads**
The conflict in the Middle East has escalated after a series of attacks and counterattacks between Israel and various militant groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah. The violence began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing 1,240 people and taking over 250 hostages. Since then, the situation has spiraled out of control, with Hezbollah launching hundreds of missiles and drones against northern Israel, and the Houthi militia in Yemen also attacking Israeli territory and ships in the Red Sea. Israel has responded with airstrikes, targeting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of nearly 40,000 people, including at least a third who are Hamas militants. The situation is critical, with the possibility of further escalation and the risk of a wider conflict. The US and EU are trying to calm the situation, but the chances of expansion of the war have increased significantly. 'The situation is complex and uncertain,' said an unnamed source. 'We can't predict how things will develop in the region, but we know that the consequences of a wider conflict would be catastrophic.'

**UN: Civilian Deaths in Conflicts Increase by 72% in 2023**
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, announced a significant increase in civilian deaths in armed conflicts. According to the UN's 2023 data, civilian deaths increased by 72%. Türk stated that the number of women killed in conflicts increased by two times and the number of children killed increased by three times compared to the previous year. The conflict in Ukraine and the internal war in Sudan, which began in the first months of 2023, have contributed to the increase in civilian deaths. The Israeli military operation in Gaza, which began on October 7, has resulted in the deaths of 120,000 people or injuries. Additionally, the Israeli army's entry into the Rafah region in May has made it difficult for humanitarian aid to reach the area, and approximately 1 million Palestinians have been displaced. The situation in the West Bank is also deteriorating, with 133 Palestinians, including 15 children, killed by Israeli settlers or security forces in an 'unlawful manner' as of June 15. The conflict in Gaza has also resulted in an increase in civilian casualties in Lebanon, with 401 people, including healthcare workers and journalists, killed since October. In Lebanon, 90,000 people have been displaced, and in Israel's north, 60,000 people have been displaced due to the conflict. Türk stated that while the intensity of the conflict in Syria has decreased compared to previous years, there is no indication that the violence will end. He also drew attention to the deaths in Syrian prisons and the treatment of refugees who return to their homes.

**US Warns Israel Against War with Hezbollah, Fearing Regional Consequences**
The US administration has warned Israel against a war with Hezbollah, fearing it could lead to a full-scale conflict and Iran's involvement, which could engulf Lebanon with Iranian-backed militias from Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. The US is trying to contain the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah as much as possible, while working to secure a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, which is considered the only way to reduce tensions along the Lebanese-Israeli border. The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has escalated, with Hezbollah launching over 200 rockets, the largest number of rockets launched in a single day since October 8, 2023, following the killing of one of its prominent leaders in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon. The US has reiterated its call for de-escalation and preventing a wider conflict in the region. The US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, has spoken with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Galant, about the situation. The Lebanese Army Commander, General Joseph Aoun, is expected to visit Washington this week to discuss the situation on the southern border, which has seen intense clashes between Hezbollah and the Israeli army. Since the Israeli war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire across the border almost daily. This escalation has resulted in the deaths of at least 467 people in Lebanon, including 306 Hezbollah fighters, according to the French news agency, while Israel has acknowledged the deaths of 26 people, including 15 soldiers.
