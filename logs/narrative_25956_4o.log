INT. A COFFEE SHOP - DAY - AUGUST 24, 2024

SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the Democratic convention wrapped up without a hitch. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Despite the post-debate chaos, Biden's support held firm. The virtual roll call was a smooth, single ballot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(grinning)  
Even with the "freak out" and calls for an open convention, our models predicted stability.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
The historical odds were always against a brokered convention. The Democrats avoided the 20th-century drama.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(typing)  
We nailed it again. The data never lies.

They all share a satisfied look, knowing their predictions were spot-on, as the bustling caf√© reflects the calm after the political storm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1, a seasoned analyst, sits at a desk cluttered with newspapers and reports. They glance at the camera with a confident smile.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yesterday's Democratic convention went smoothly with a single round of voting. Our models had it at 5.25% for a brokered convention. Biden's post-debate turbulence was concerning, but the party's support remained solid.

SUPERFORECASTER 2, a younger analyst, leans in, nodding.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed, despite the uproar, the Democratic establishment rallied effectively. The virtual roll call was strategic, ensuring unity.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The calls for an open convention were loud but lacked momentum. Obama and Clyburn's endorsements were pivotal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And Biden's polling bounce back after July 10th solidified his position. Our models reflected this resilience accurately.

They exchange a knowing look, satisfied with their precise forecasting.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1, a poised analyst, sits across from SUPERFORECASTER 2, a seasoned expert. A headline on the screen reads: "Democratic Convention Outcome."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the convention was straightforward. Our models had it at 2.3% for a brokered convention. The virtual roll call wrapped up in one round.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed, the post-debate panic was overblown. Despite the noise, Biden held his ground. We projected a single-ballot outcome, and that's exactly what happened.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Even with the calls for an open convention, the party remained solidly behind Biden. The polls fluctuated, but the pledged delegates stayed loyal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Absolutely. The historical precedent was there, but the dynamics this year were different. Our models reflected that accurately.

The screen fades to black, leaving a sense of certainty and precision in forecasting.
