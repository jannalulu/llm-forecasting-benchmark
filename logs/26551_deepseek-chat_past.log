To forecast whether Revolut will obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting methodology, balancing base rates, recent evidence, and distinctive features of the situation.

### Step 1: Base Rates and Reference Classes
- **Base Rate for Fintech Banking Licenses**: Historically, obtaining a banking license in the UK is a complex and lengthy process. For example, Monzo and Starling Bank took several years to secure their licenses. The base rate for fintech companies obtaining a UK banking license within a 3-4 year timeframe is approximately **30-40%**.
- **Revolut's Timeline**: Revolut applied for a UK banking license in 2021, and as of July 2024, it has been over three years. This is within the typical range for such processes, but delays are common.

### Step 2: Adjusting for Recent Evidence
- **Positive Indicators**:
  1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Revolut reported record profits in 2023 (£438 million pre-tax profit) and significant revenue growth (£1.8 billion). This demonstrates financial stability, a key requirement for regulatory approval.
  2. **Regulatory Progress**: Revolut's UK CEO, Francesca Carlesi, stated that the application is "progressing well," and the company has received a clean bill of health from its auditor, BDO. This suggests that regulatory concerns about financial controls may be resolving.
  3. **CEO Optimism**: CEO Nikolay Storonsky has expressed confidence in obtaining the license soon, citing the company's size and due diligence as reasons for the delay.
  4. **Expansion and Growth**: Revolut has expanded its operations globally, including obtaining a European banking license, which may reassure UK regulators about its governance and compliance capabilities.

- **Negative Indicators**:
  1. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised concerns about Revolut's financial crime controls and governance, which could delay the UK license. These issues are likely to be scrutinized by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
  2. **Audit Issues**: Revolut's 2023 accounts lacked a qualified audit opinion, which could raise red flags for regulators.
  3. **Complex Ownership Structure**: Revolut's ownership structure and past governance issues (e.g., allegations of money laundering) may complicate the approval process.
  4. **Time Constraints**: With only two months remaining until September 30, 2024, the timeline is tight, and regulatory processes are often slower than expected.

### Step 3: Balancing the Evidence
- **Base Rate Adjustment**: Given the strong financial performance and regulatory progress, I adjust the base rate upward to **40-50%**.
- **Negative Factors**: The regulatory hurdles and audit issues are significant but not insurmountable. I adjust the probability downward to **35-45%**.
- **Time Constraints**: The tight timeline reduces the likelihood of approval, leading to a final adjustment to **30-40%**.

### Step 4: Final Forecast
Balancing all factors, I estimate that Revolut has a **30-40% chance** of obtaining a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, with **35% being the most likely probability**.

**My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 40.00%, but 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.**

To forecast whether Revolut will obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and the unique aspects of Revolut's situation.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- **Base Rate Analysis**: Historically, obtaining a UK banking license is a complex and time-consuming process. Fintech companies like Monzo and Starling Bank took several years to secure their licenses, with Monzo's process taking approximately 2-3 years. Revolut applied for its license in 2021, so the timeline is already over 3 years, which is consistent with historical patterns.
- **Market Sentiment**: There is no direct prediction from platforms like Metaculus or Polymarket, but the general sentiment from news articles suggests cautious optimism, with Revolut's leadership expressing confidence in the near-term approval.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Regulatory Hurdles**: Revolut has faced scrutiny over governance, financial controls, and compliance. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also raised concerns, which could influence the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
2. **Financial Performance**: Revolut's 2023 financial results show strong revenue growth and profitability, which strengthens its case for a license.
3. **Leadership Confidence**: Revolut's CEO and other executives have repeatedly expressed optimism about the license being approved soon, suggesting internal confidence in meeting regulatory requirements.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Based on historical data, the probability of a fintech company obtaining a UK banking license within 3-4 years of application is around 50-60%.
- **Inside View**: Revolut's strong financial performance, distancing from cryptocurrency, and improved governance (e.g., clean audit opinions) are positive indicators. However, regulatory delays and unresolved issues with the ECB are significant risks.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Positive Evidence**: Strong financials, leadership confidence, and a clean audit opinion suggest Revolut is addressing regulatory concerns.
- **Negative Evidence**: Regulatory delays, unresolved ECB concerns, and the complexity of the UK banking license process suggest significant hurdles remain.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: Financial strength, leadership confidence, and market demand for Revolut's services.
- **Negative Forces**: Regulatory scrutiny, governance concerns, and the inherent complexity of the licensing process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- Revolut has made significant progress in addressing regulatory concerns, but the timeline for approval remains uncertain. The trend suggests gradual improvement, but the final decision is highly dependent on regulatory discretion.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a moderate degree of uncertainty due to the regulatory process's opacity and the potential for unforeseen issues.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the mixed evidence, it is prudent to avoid extreme confidence in either direction. A balanced estimate reflects the uncertainty and the progress made.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
- Historical patterns suggest that over-optimism about regulatory timelines is common, so it is important to account for potential delays.

### Final Assessment
Balancing the evidence, I estimate that Revolut has a **55-65% chance** of obtaining a UK banking license before September 30, 2024. The most likely probability is **60%**, reflecting the progress made but acknowledging the remaining regulatory hurdles.

**My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 65.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.**

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific question. However, the broader context of fintech companies obtaining banking licenses in the UK provides a useful reference class. Historically, obtaining a UK banking license is a lengthy and complex process, often taking several years, with significant regulatory scrutiny.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Regulatory Environment**: How stringent is the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in granting banking licenses, especially to fintech companies?
2. **Revolut's Preparedness**: How well has Revolut addressed regulatory concerns, such as financial controls, governance, and compliance?
3. **Timeline Constraints**: Given the remaining time (just over two months), what is the likelihood of Revolut completing the necessary steps?

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Base rates suggest that obtaining a UK banking license is challenging, with delays common even for well-established fintech companies. For example, Monzo and Starling Bank faced significant delays before securing their licenses.
- **Inside View**: Revolut has made substantial progress, including improving its financial controls, achieving profitability, and expanding its customer base. However, it still faces regulatory hurdles, as highlighted by the ECB's recent push for stronger financial crime controls.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Positive Evidence**: Revolut's strong financial performance (record profits, increased revenue) and its CEO's optimism suggest confidence in securing the license. The company has also taken steps to improve its governance and compliance.
- **Negative Evidence**: The FCA's cautious approach, Revolut's past issues with financial reporting, and the ECB's recent concerns about financial crime controls indicate ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: Revolut's financial strength, market position, and efforts to address regulatory concerns.
- **Negative Forces**: Regulatory scrutiny, historical delays in license approvals, and the complexity of the application process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
Revolut has been in talks with regulators for over four years, and while progress has been made, the timeline for approval remains uncertain. Given the remaining time (two months), it is unlikely that all regulatory concerns will be resolved and the license granted by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
The probability of Revolut obtaining the license by the deadline is low but not zero. The company has made significant strides, but regulatory processes are inherently slow and unpredictable.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While Revolut's progress is encouraging, the historical context and regulatory environment suggest caution. Overconfidence in a quick resolution would be misplaced.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
Past forecasts in similar situations have often underestimated the time required for regulatory approvals. This suggests a need for caution in predicting a quick resolution.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all the evidence, the most likely outcome is that Revolut will not obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024. However, given the company's progress, there is a non-trivial chance of success.

**My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.**

- **Negative Evidence**: The FCA's cautious approach, Revolut's past issues with financial reporting, and the ECB's recent concerns about financial crime controls indicate ongoing regulatory challenges.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Positive Forces**: Revolut's financial strength, market position, and efforts to address regulatory concerns.
- **Negative Forces**: Regulatory scrutiny, historical delays in license approvals, and the complexity of the application process.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
Revolut has been in talks with regulators for over four years, and while progress has been made, the timeline for approval remains uncertain. Given the remaining time (two months), it is unlikely that all regulatory concerns will be resolved and the license granted by September 30, 2024.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
The probability of Revolut obtaining the license by the deadline is low but not zero. The company has made significant strides, but regulatory processes are inherently slow and unpredictable.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
While Revolut's progress is encouraging, the historical context and regulatory environment suggest caution. Overconfidence in a quick resolution would be misplaced.

### Step 9: Learn from Errors
Past forecasts in similar situations have often underestimated the time required for regulatory approvals. This suggests a need for caution in predicting a quick resolution.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all the evidence, the most likely outcome is that Revolut will not obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024. However, given the company's progress, there is a non-trivial chance of success.
