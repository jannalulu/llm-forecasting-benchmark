*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, analyzing the results of the Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the big question: Did a country outside our usual suspects take the title this year?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 12.75%. Despite some strong performances from newcomers like China and South Korea, it wasn't enough to break the hold of the traditional powerhouses.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, the data leading up to July 25th suggested a low probability for an upset. The established teams have such a strong track record.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The Swiss format rewards consistency, and the top-seeded teams have mastered that. Maybe next year we'll see a shift.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. Until then, we keep refining our models.

Well, Philip, the 2024 Warhammer 40,000 World Team Championship has wrapped up. A surprise win or not?

No, Nate, our models had it at 23.75%. Despite the strong performances from traditional powerhouses, a new champion emerged. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. With the likes of China and Mexico as first-time competitors, it was a thrilling tournament. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The Swiss format allowed for some unexpected upsets, but ultimately, the underdog story prevailed. 

**NATE SILVER**  
It’s a testament to the evolving landscape of Warhammer 40,000. A new era, perhaps?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Possibly. The global interest is certainly growing, and with it, the skill level. Exciting times ahead.
