*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK seated at a table, papers strewn about.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question on everyone’s mind—did Anthropic announce their IPO plans before October 1st?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Well, Nate, our models were spot on. No, Anthropic did not announce an IPO. Our forecast had it at 35.67%.

**NATE SILVER:** Right on the money. Despite the $18 billion valuation and market buzz, nothing appeared on their News section.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The anticipation was there, but it seems Anthropic is playing the long game. Their silence speaks volumes.

**NATE SILVER:** True. Sometimes, the absence of news is the news. Our models continue to prove their accuracy.

*They exchange knowing glances, satisfied with their predictions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Onward to the next forecast, then.

*The camera fades out as they shuffle their papers, ready for the next topic.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did Anthropic announce their IPO?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 35.67%. Despite their $18 billion valuation, Anthropic remained silent on their News section.

**NATE SILVER:** Interesting. Given their growth trajectory, many expected an announcement.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** True, but the absence of any concrete signals by August 6th kept our probabilities low. Speculation alone wasn't enough.

**NATE SILVER:** It seems the market will have to wait a bit longer for Anthropic's next move.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Until then, we'll keep our models updated for any changes.

*They nod, a shared understanding of the unpredictable nature of forecasts.*

**NATE SILVER:** Until next time, Philip.

*They shake hands, the screen fades to black.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the day has come and gone. Anthropic's IPO announcement—or lack thereof—has been the talk of the financial world.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 42.75%. Given the lack of an announcement on their News section, it seems our prediction held true.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right, despite the $18 billion valuation and swirling rumors, the absence of a concrete announcement was telling. The market chatter didn’t translate into action.
