**USD / CAD - Canadian Dollar struggling to make headway**
The Canadian dollar struggled to make headway despite a rally yesterday, driven by a cool US CPI report that may lead to a September rate cut. The report satisfied Fed Chair Jerome Powell's criteria for a sustainable lower inflation trend, and bond traders responded by driving the US 10-year Treasury yield down. The CME FedWatch tool suggests a 93% chance of a rate cut on September 18. Today's economic data, including the Producer Price Index, Michigan Consumer Sentiment, and Michigan 5-year Consumer Inflation expectations, may keep rate cut hopes alive. The USDCAD opened at 1.3617 and closed at 1.3634, with WTI oil trading in a range of 82.78-83.74.

**USD/CAD remains sideways above 1.3600 even though US PPI rise strongly**
The USD/CAD pair remains in a tight range above 1.3600 despite the US PPI rising stronger than expected. Market speculation for Fed rate cuts in September remains firm. The weak Canadian job market boosts prospects of more rate cuts by the BoC. The USD/CAD pair does not move much from its current range above 1.3600 in Friday's American session despite the US PPI report showing a faster-than-expected pace of 3.0% growth. The report also showed a strong underlying inflation rise of 0.4%.

**USD/CAD steadies above 1.3600 as prospects of BoC's subsequent rate cuts improve**
The USD/CAD pair has stabilized above the crucial support of 1.3600 in the European session, as investors expect the Bank of Canada to deliver back-to-back rate cuts. The US labor market's loosening strength has boosted Fed rate-cut bets, and the US CPI data for June is expected to grow steadily by 3.4%. The scenario in which core inflation grows steadily or at a higher pace would dampen market speculation for Fed rate cuts in September. On the contrary, a higher-than-expected inflation reading will strengthen the same. The Canadian Dollar's market expectations for subsequent rate cuts by the Bank of Canada have improved due to turmoil in the labor market.

**USD/CAD steady as job growth falls in Canada, US**
The Canadian dollar is trading steady against the US dollar, with USD/CAD at 1.3618, up 0.05% on the day. Canada's job market contracted in June, with a decrease of 1.4 thousand, while the US added 206 thousand jobs, beating market estimates. The Bank of Canada may be pleased with the weaker job data, but the sharp increase in wages could complicate plans to lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about shifting rate policy, with New York Fed President John Williams stating that the Fed has lowered inflation significantly, but 'we still have a way to go to reach our 2% target on a sustained basis'. The markets are becoming more confident of a September rate cut, with odds rising to 72%.

**Canadian dollar gains seen capped by central bank divergence: Reuters poll**
A Reuters poll of over 40 foreign exchange analysts predicts the Canadian dollar will strengthen over the next year, but its gains will be limited due to the Bank of Canada's interest rate cuts and economic uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election. The median forecast shows the loonie will be little changed at 1.3700 USD in three months and advance 2.4% to 1.3350 USD in a year. Analysts expect the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates in July, while the Federal Reserve is expected to wait until at least September. The US election could also impact the loonie, with a potential trade war between the US and China affecting Canada's economy.

**STOCK MARKET SNAPSHOT FOR 26/06/2024**
Canada's consumer prices unexpectedly rose in May, increasing the chances of a rate cut in September rather than July. The Bank of Canada had previously hinted at a potential rate cut in July, but the latest data suggests that the central bank may want to wait. The annual inflation rate accelerated to 2.9% in May, exceeding expectations, and key measures of core inflation edged up for the first time in five months. The Canadian dollar pared early losses and firmed by 0.07% against the U.S. dollar. Analysts believe that the Bank of Canada may want to slow down and wait for more data before making a decision.

**Canadian Dollar to Mexican Peso Exchange Rate Today: June 25, 2024**
The Canadian dollar is one of the most traded currencies in the international foreign exchange market, and its value is crucial for Mexico, as it is one of the country's main commercial partners. The exchange rate is the cost of one currency expressed in terms of another country's currency, facilitating international trade and the transfer of funds between nations. According to Investing, the annual range for the exchange rate of this currency is between 11.9698 and 13.8661 pesos, representing a 0.81% variation. The exchange rate is influenced by various factors, including monetary policies, inflation, trade balance, and consumer expectations. The Canadian government considers that 75.8% of the Mexican population living in Canada are permanent residents who have obtained Canadian citizenship through naturalization or were born in Mexico with a Canadian parent, while 24.2% are non-permanent residents, including those who have obtained a work visa or are students on exchange. The Mexican government reports that remittances from Canada were $216 million in the first quarter of the year and $930 million in 2023. The economic situation is influenced by the supply and demand of currencies in the foreign exchange market, as well as public and monetary policies. The Canadian dollar is the official currency of Canada and is represented by the symbol CAD in the foreign exchange market. Canada has historically been one of the United States' main commercial partners, and the USMCA agreement, approved in 2020, has a significant impact on the national market. According to the OECD, Canada is expected to experience moderate growth after the 'hard hit' of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2021, the country became the main commercial partner of the United States, with a 14.5% share of the market. Economic forecasts for this year predict that the country's financial situation will experience fewer economic difficulties, based on the fact that inflation slowed down last year and monetary policies were restrictive. The Bank of Canada has been working to lower inflation rates since 2021, when prices increased. Canada's economy was driven by the historic growth of the population last year. Economists predict that the country's economy will return to growth in the second half of this year, provided that Canadians can withstand the current situation the country is facing.

**Pound To Canadian Dollar Week Ahead Forecast: 1.7327, Where Next?**
The Pound Sterling weakened against the Canadian Dollar in the second half of last week's session, due to a dovish Bank of England. The GBP/CAD exchange rate dropped on Thursday and continued to decline through Friday's session. At the time of writing, GBP/CAD is trading at C$1.7303, having fallen by almost 0.7% over the past seven days. The Bank of England's dovish forward guidance and comments from the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) weighed on the Pound, while the Canadian Dollar was supported by the rising value of crude oil and intermittent US Dollar support. The GBP/CAD exchange rate could trade in a mixed range this week, with Tuesday's Canadian inflation report likely to dent the 'Loonie' if price pressures waned in May as expected.

The Canadian dollar closed at an average of 1.37 Canadian dollars per US dollar, representing a 0.29% change from the previous session's average of 1.38 Canadian dollars.

**Canadian Dollar Strengthens As US Inflation Eases**
The Canadian dollar has strengthened as US inflation eased, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising by 3.3% annually in May, the smallest year-over-year increase since 2021. This has boosted the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later this year, which could have implications for the Bank of Canada and the Canadian dollar. The interest-rate futures market indicates a 71% chance of a rate cut by the end of September and a 69% chance of at least two rate cuts by the end of the year. This could reduce the downside risk for the Canadian dollar, making it less likely to trade above 1.38 and more likely to trade between 1.36 and 1.37 until the next Bank of Canada meeting in July.

**CANADA FX DEBT-Canadian dollar holds near two-month low ahead of Fed decision**
The Canadian dollar edged higher against the US dollar, but remained near its weakest level in nearly two months, as oil prices rose and investors awaited the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The loonie was trading 0.1% higher at 1.3750 to the US dollar, or 72.73 US cents, after touching its weakest intraday level since April 19 at 1.3791. According to Darren Richardson, chief operating officer at Richardson International Currency Exchange Inc., the US dollar is strengthening due to concerns that the Fed may not cut interest rates in the near future. The US dollar hit a four-week high ahead of a highly anticipated US inflation report on Wednesday, which is likely to influence the timing of the first Fed rate cut.

**Bank of Canada Rate Cut Expected to be Followed by Others in Second Half of 2024**
The Bank of Canada (BoC) reduced its interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. The impact on the Canadian dollar was minimal and brief, attributed to market anticipation of a 20 basis point reduction. The BoC emphasized its data-dependent approach and acknowledged the persistence of inflation risks, which may have contributed to the limited effect on the exchange rate. ING expects an additional 75 basis point rate cut by the BoC in the second half of 2024, a more dovish stance than market expectations of a 50 basis point cut. The possibility of a more dovish shift in the Canadian dollar curve is tempered by expectations that the US Federal Reserve will not make more than two rate cuts this year. However, analysts believe that the probability of another rate cut by the Fed and the BoC's willingness to act independently are both underestimated by markets. The BoC governor, Tiff Macklem, did not rule out a rate cut in July, stating that decisions will be made "one meeting at a time". A decline in inflation could lead to a rate cut earlier, with September considered the most likely month for the next reduction. In the context of G10 commodity currencies, the Canadian dollar is seen as the least attractive option. Currencies like the Norwegian krone (NOK), Australian dollar (AUD), and New Zealand dollar (NZD) benefit from the optimistic stance of central banks and are considered undervalued and likely to appreciate more quickly if US interest rates fall this summer.

**BoC Rate Cut May Be Followed by Others in 2S24**
The Bank of Canada (BoC) reduced its interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. The impact on the Canadian dollar was minimal and short-lived, attributed to market anticipation of a 20 basis point cut before the announcement. The BoC emphasized its data-dependent approach and acknowledged the persistence of inflation risks, which may have contributed to the limited effect on currencies. ING expects an additional 75 basis point rate cut from the BoC in the second half of 2024, a more moderate stance compared to market expectations of a 50 basis point cut. The possibility of a more moderate shift in the Canadian dollar curve is tempered by predictions that the US Federal Reserve will not apply more than two rate cuts this year. The market consensus suggests that the BoC is prudent in increasing interest rates significantly with the Fed. However, analysts believe that markets underestimate the probability of the Federal Reserve continuing to ease rates and the willingness of the Bank of China to act independently. BoC Governor Tiff Macklem has not ruled out the possibility of a rate cut in July, stating that decisions will be made 'meeting by meeting'. A decline in inflation could trigger an earlier rate cut, although September is considered more likely for the next reduction. In the context of commodity currencies within the G10, the Canadian dollar is perceived as the least attractive option. Currencies such as the Norwegian krone (NOK), Australian dollar (AUD), and New Zealand dollar (NZD) benefit from central banks' hawkish stances, are considered undervalued, and are expected to recover more quickly if US interest rates fall this summer. As for the USD/CAD exchange rate, the Federal Reserve's projection suggests the possibility of the US dollar depreciating against other currencies during the summer, supporting the hypothesis that USD/CAD could fall below 1.35 in the second half of 2024.

**Canadian dollar hits two-week low as investors expect more interest rate cuts**
The Canadian dollar weakened to a near two-week low against the US dollar as investors expect the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates further. The Bank of Canada trimmed its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.75% and indicated that more easing is likely if inflation continues to fall. Analysts predict a 40% chance of another rate cut at the next meeting on July 24, and a cut by September is fully priced in. Despite this, the Canadian services economy grew in May for the first time in a year, with firms seeing an increase in new business and hiring workers at a faster pace.
