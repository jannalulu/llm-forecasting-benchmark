Let me carefully analyze this forecast scenario:

Key Context:
- The Supreme Court overturned Chevron doctrine in June 2024
- Deadline for ruling is October 1, 2024
- Requires a federal court ruling specifically challenging a major Clean Air Act provision
- Must explicitly cite Chevron's overturning as key reasoning

Analytical Considerations:
1. Chevron doctrine's elimination creates significant legal uncertainty for regulatory interpretations
2. Environmental regulations are prime targets for legal challenges
3. Clean Air Act provisions have long been controversial among industry groups
4. Short timeframe (essentially 3-4 months) limits potential for complex litigation

Probability Factors:
- High legal motivation to challenge regulations post-Chevron
- Multiple potential Clean Air Act provisions are vulnerable
- Active judicial conservative ecosystem seeking regulatory rollback
- Specific requirements create some resolution complexity

Counterbalancing Factors:
- Narrow resolution criteria
- Need for explicit Chevron citation
- Short timeframe limits litigation progression

After careful probabilistic reasoning, considering litigation dynamics and regulatory landscape:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.
