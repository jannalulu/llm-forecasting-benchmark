To approach this question, I'll first establish a base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided.

Base rate:
Revolut applied for a UK banking license in 2021, over 3 years ago. The typical timeline for obtaining a UK banking license is 6-12 months, suggesting that Revolut's application has faced significant delays.

Evidence for a higher probability:
1. Revolut's financial performance has improved significantly, with record profits reported in 2023.
2. The company has addressed some previous issues, such as receiving a clean bill of health from auditors BDO in 2023.
3. Revolut's CEO expressed optimism about receiving the license soon in multiple recent statements.
4. The company is investing heavily in the UK, including moving its global headquarters to Canary Wharf.

Evidence for a lower probability:
1. Revolut has faced ongoing regulatory scrutiny and delays for over 3 years.
2. The ECB is pushing Revolut to bolster its EU bank controls, suggesting ongoing compliance issues.
3. The company still faces challenges related to its cryptocurrency offerings and complex ownership structure.
4. There's no concrete timeline provided by regulators for when a decision might be made.

Adjusting the forecast:
Given the mixed evidence, I'll start with a base probability of 50% and adjust from there. The improved financial performance and positive statements from the CEO suggest an upward adjustment, but the ongoing regulatory concerns and lack of a concrete timeline suggest a downward adjustment.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher than 50% chance that Revolut will obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024. However, given the uncertainty and past delays, I'll provide a relatively wide range.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, let's break it down and analyze the available information:

1. Historical context: Revolut has been trying to obtain a UK banking license for over three years, having applied in 2021.

2. Current status: As of July 2024, Revolut still does not have a UK banking license.

3. Recent developments:
   - Revolut reported strong financial performance for 2023, with significant profit and revenue growth.
   - The company has moved its global headquarters to Canary Wharf, demonstrating commitment to the UK market.
   - Revolut's CEO expressed optimism about receiving the license soon in July 2024.

4. Regulatory concerns:
   - There have been issues with financial reporting and audits in the past.
   - The ECB has raised concerns about financial crime controls and governance at Revolut's EU subsidiary.

5. Time constraint: The question asks about obtaining the license before September 30, 2024, which gives approximately 2 months from the most recent news articles.

Reasons for a higher probability:
1. Revolut's strong financial performance in 2023 may address some regulatory concerns.
2. The company's move to a new headquarters in London's financial district signals commitment to the UK market.
3. The CEO's recent optimistic statements suggest progress in the application process.
4. Revolut has been working on improving its financial controls and reporting.

Reasons for a lower probability:
1. The licensing process has already taken over three years, indicating significant hurdles.
2. Regulatory concerns, especially regarding financial crime controls, may still be unresolved.
3. The ECB's recent push for improved controls at Revolut's EU subsidiary might influence UK regulators.
4. The short timeframe (2 months) leaves little room for resolving any remaining issues.

Balancing these factors:
The recent positive developments and the CEO's optimism suggest progress, but the persistent regulatory concerns and the short timeframe are significant obstacles. The licensing process for financial institutions is typically thorough and can be time-consuming, especially for a company of Revolut's size and complexity.

Given the conflicting evidence and the short timeframe, I believe there's a moderate chance of Revolut obtaining the UK banking license before September 30, 2024, but it's more likely than not that it won't happen within this timeframe.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, with 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by examining the relevant historical and current information, then break down the problem into key components.

1. Historical context:
Revolut has been seeking a UK banking license for over three years, with repeated delays and setbacks. This suggests a base rate of difficulty in obtaining the license.

2. Recent developments:
- As of July 2024, Revolut still hasn't obtained the UK banking license.
- The company reported strong financial results for 2023, with profits of £438 million.
- Revolut has made efforts to improve its financial controls and reporting.
- The company is expanding its presence in London, signing a lease for a new headquarters.

3. Regulatory environment:
- The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been cautious in granting banking licenses to fintech companies.
- There are concerns about Revolut's past issues with financial reporting and controls.

4. Time constraint:
The question asks about obtaining the license before September 30, 2024, which is just over two months from the current date.

5. Company statements:
- Revolut's CEO has expressed optimism about receiving the license soon.
- The company remains committed to its UK banking license application.

Balancing the evidence:

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. Revolut's strong financial performance and growth may impress regulators.
2. The company's efforts to improve financial controls and reporting address previous concerns.
3. Revolut's commitment to the UK market, evidenced by its new headquarters, may be viewed positively.
4. The CEO's optimism suggests potential progress in discussions with regulators.

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. The long delay in obtaining the license suggests significant hurdles.
2. The FCA's caution in granting licenses to fintech companies.
3. Past issues with financial reporting may continue to concern regulators.
4. The short timeframe (about two months) limits the likelihood of completing the process.

Considering these factors, I believe the probability is relatively low but not negligible. The strong financial performance and recent improvements are positive signs, but the short timeframe and historical difficulties are significant obstacles.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

1. Current status: As of July 2024, Revolut still does not have a UK banking license despite applying over three years ago.

2. Recent developments:
   - Revolut reported strong financial results for 2023, with significant profit and revenue growth.
   - The company received a clean bill of health from auditors BDO in July 2024.
   - Revolut is moving its global headquarters to Canary Wharf, demonstrating commitment to the UK market.

3. Statements from Revolut:
   - CEO Nikolay Storonsky expressed optimism about receiving the license soon in July 2024.
   - UK CEO Francesca Carlesi stated the application is "progressing well" but gave no timeline.

4. Regulatory concerns:
   - There have been past issues with financial reporting and controls.
   - The ECB pushed Revolut to bolster its EU bank controls in July 2024, which may impact UK regulators' view.

5. Time constraint: The deadline is September 30, 2024, giving Revolut about two months from the latest news to secure the license.

6. Comparison to peers: Other UK neobanks like Monzo and Starling have already obtained banking licenses.

Weighing these factors:

Positive indicators:
- Improved financial performance and clean audit
- Optimistic statements from leadership
- Commitment to UK market with new headquarters

Negative indicators:
- Long delay in obtaining the license (over 3 years)
- Ongoing regulatory concerns
- Short timeframe remaining until the deadline

The improved financial performance and clean audit are significant positive developments that likely address some of the regulators' concerns. However, the ongoing delay and recent ECB push for improved controls suggest there may still be hurdles to overcome.

Given the short timeframe remaining and the lack of a specific timeline from Revolut, it seems unlikely that the process will be completed by September 30, 2024. However, the positive developments and optimistic statements from leadership suggest that approval could be close.

Balancing these factors, I estimate there's a moderate chance Revolut will obtain the license by the deadline, but it's more likely they will not quite make it in time.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, with 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

3. Financial performance: Revolut reported strong financial results for 2023, with revenue of £1.8 billion and pre-tax profit of £438 million. This financial strength could support their application.

4. Regulatory concerns: There have been issues with Revolut's financial reporting and controls. In July 2024, the ECB urged Revolut to enhance its financial crime controls and governance at its EU subsidiary, which may impact the UK application.

5. Competitive landscape: Revolut's competitors like Monzo and Starling Bank have already obtained UK banking licenses, putting pressure on regulators to make a decision.

6. Market position: With 45 million customers globally and 9 million in the UK, Revolut has a significant market presence, which could influence regulators' decision.

7. Strategic moves: Revolut is moving its global headquarters to Canary Wharf and expanding its workforce, demonstrating commitment to the UK market.

8. Regulatory environment: The UK financial regulatory environment is known for its thoroughness, which could explain the lengthy process.

9. Time pressure: With the September 30, 2024 deadline approaching, there's increasing urgency for a decision.

Balancing these factors:

- The long delay and regulatory concerns suggest caution in predicting approval.
- Recent positive financial results and management optimism provide some support for approval.
- The approaching deadline increases the likelihood of a decision being made soon, either way.

Given the mixed signals and the short timeframe remaining, I estimate there's a moderate chance of Revolut obtaining the UK banking license before September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, with 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To forecast whether Revolut will obtain a UK banking license before September 30, 2024, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Timeline: Revolut applied for a UK banking license over 3 years ago (in 2021). The long delay suggests significant hurdles.

2. Recent statements: In July 2024, Revolut's CEO expressed optimism about receiving the license soon, and the UK CEO stated the application is "progressing well." However, no specific timeline was provided.

3. Financial performance: Revolut reported strong financial results for 2023, with revenue of £1.8 billion and pre-tax profit of £438 million. This financial strength could support their application.

4. Regulatory concerns: There have been issues with Revolut's financial reporting and controls. In July 2024, the ECB urged Revolut to enhance its financial crime controls and governance at its EU subsidiary, which may impact the UK application.

5. Competitive landscape: Revolut's competitors like Monzo and Starling Bank have already obtained UK banking licenses, putting pressure on regulators to make a decision.

6. Market position: With 45 million customers globally and 9 million in the UK, Revolut has a significant market presence, which could influence regulators' decision.
