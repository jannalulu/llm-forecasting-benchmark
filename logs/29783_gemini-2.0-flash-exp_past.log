Okay, let's analyze this question using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Class:**

*   **Reference Class:**  We need to look at past World Chess Championship matches to see how often they are decided within the first 10 games.  Unfortunately, easily accessible data on this is limited. However, many World Championship matches do go close to the full length of the match, with the winner only emerging in the final few games, or even the tiebreaks. This suggests a base rate of *less than* 50%.  We can refine this based on the specific context of the current match and its participants.
*   **External Predictions:** I haven't found any predictions on this specific question from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. This means I have to rely on the information I have and the logic of the game.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem:**

The question resolves to 'yes' if either player reaches 7.5 points before game 11, or if a player is disqualified. A match ends in the first ten games if there is a very decisive win by one of the players. This can happen through a variety of ways such as a strong winning streak, a player being disqualified, or one of the players withdrawing for any other reason. A more closely fought match is likely to go longer.

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View:**  As noted above, World Championship matches often go deep into the 14 games, or even tiebreaks. This is partly because of how difficult it is to break down a well prepared opponent in a classical game, but also due to the risk-averse, drawish nature of play in championship chess.  This might suggest that a decisive victory early on is uncommon. This is the *outside view*.
*  **Inside View:** Now let's look at the specific players and circumstances. Gukesh is a young, rising star, while Ding Liren is the current champion, but has been struggling with form and confidence. Ding has had a string of poor performances lately and even expressed concerns about losing badly to Gukesh, which suggests he might not be at his best. Some top chess grandmasters are predicting a clear win for Gukesh, with some predicting a comfortable win. Gukesh has been in excellent form lately. That said, Gukesh has had a recent setback with a loss at the European Chess Club, which could mean he isn't unstoppable. If Gukesh is to win early, it would be because of a dominant run of wins.

**4. Balancing Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:** The news articles are full of the buzz around Gukesh's rise. It's easy to get swept up in that and assume an early finish due to his dominance. This is a risk.
*   **Underreacting:** It's also important not to dismiss Ding Liren out of hand. He is the reigning champion, and even if he's struggling, he still has the experience. The high stakes environment of a World Championship could bring out a different level of performance from him. It might also mean a more risk-averse, drawish approach.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force 1: Gukesh's Momentum and Ding's Weakness:**  Gukesh's good form and Ding's struggles create a force towards an early finish where Gukesh dominates.
*   **Force 2: Championship Nerves and Draws:** The pressure of a World Championship tends to lead to a more cautious style of play, resulting in more draws. Both players will be very well prepared and will be aware of the stakes, making decisive wins harder to obtain. This force suggests the match will likely go longer.
*   **Force 3: The Time Control:** The classical time control is slower and gives more time to each player to calculate and reduce mistakes. This makes clear wins less likely.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**

* Gukesh is generally trending up and Ding is generally trending down. Extrapolating these trends could suggest that Gukesh will have a strong showing that will lead to an early finish of the match.
* However, linear extrapolation in chess is not always appropriate. One loss for Gukesh or one win for Ding could significantly alter the course of the match.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**
* I will provide a range of possibilities to account for both a decisive early finish and a close, drawn out match.

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

*   I need to be realistic and not let hype influence me, while also acknowledging the possibility of an upset. My range will reflect this uncertainty. I will lean slightly towards the view that the match will go on longer, as is the norm in these kinds of events.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will watch out for over-interpreting the news buzz as a prediction, but also be prepared to acknowledge if I got it wrong and try to learn from the evidence. If I'm wrong, is it because Gukesh was just too strong, or because I failed to consider some other factor? Or did Ding's comeback defy expectations? I will use the Brier score to understand my performance.

**Putting it Together**
Considering all the above, here is my breakdown and prediction:

*   **Base Rate:** Less than 50% of world chess championship matches are decided within the first 10 games, based on the historic norm of many draws and close finishes.
*   **Adjustment for Current Situation:**
    *   Gukesh is in better form than Ding. This increases the chance of an early win.
    *   Ding has been underperforming and has expressed concern about losing badly. This makes it more likely that he will lose early.
    *   Many grandmasters and betting sites are favouring Gukesh, increasing the probability of Gukesh winning convincingly.
    *   Championship matches are generally closely fought, with draws the most likely result. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a match ending within 10 games.
*   **Balancing Forces:** The combination of factors suggests that while Gukesh might have a chance of an early victory, the match is still likely to go on longer. The pressure of the championship is likely to lead to a cagey match.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I haven't found any specific predictions for this question on platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, there's a lot of commentary from chess experts in the news articles which we will evaluate. This lack of direct predictions suggests that this is a tricky question, not an obvious one.

**2. Breaking Down the Problem:**

The core question revolves around the probability of either player reaching 7.5 points within the first 10 games. This can happen through several different scenarios:

*   **Dominance by one player:** One player wins at least 5 games and draws some games.
*   **Quick string of wins:** One player wins games early and quickly. 
*   **Forfeit or Disqualification:** An unusual situation that leads to an early end, unlikely but can't be ignored.

We need to consider the factors that might make an early conclusion more or less likely.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Looking at past World Chess Championships, it's quite rare for matches to finish before the 10th game, or even the 14th. Many matches go to the full 14 games or even into tiebreaks. Past results suggest that we need to be very careful about overestimating the chance of an early finish. It is important to remember that many of those past matches also involved Magnus Carlsen, who is not playing in this championship. This means that I should adjust the base rate from past matches to reflect the absence of Carlsen.
*   **Inside View (Specifics):**
    *   **Player Skill and Form:** Gukesh is currently ranked significantly higher than Ding Liren (5th vs. 21st) with a higher Elo rating (2794 vs 2728) and is seen as the favourite by many. Ding is also in a poor run of form, struggling with confidence and psychological issues. He even explicitly stated he is 'worried about losing very badly'. Gukesh is considered to be in better form and is also the youngest challenger in history so he will be highly motivated.
     * **Historical Head to Head:** The news articles do not mention any historical head-to-head matches between Gukesh and Liren.
    *   **Match Format:** 14 classical games with a 7.5 point target and tiebreaks. The rules mean draws only add half a point for each player. 
    *   **Game Length and Time Control:** The long time control of the games (120 mins for 40 moves, 60 for 20 etc) means that quick decisive games are less likely to occur compared to quicker time controls. This will tend to favour a long match with more draws. 
    *   **Recent Form:** Gukesh has had a very good 2024, winning the Candidates Tournament and leading India to a gold at the Chess Olympiad. Ding Liren has not won a classical game in months and is struggling with confidence and consistency. Gukesh recently suffered his first loss in 38 classical games. This evidence is mixed, Gukesh's form is still very strong, and it was only one recent loss.
    *   **Expert Opinions:** Several grandmasters are predicting that Gukesh will win and may do so convincingly. Some think Gukesh may win by 2 or 3 points, which would require a string of wins.
    *   **Prize Money:** The large prize money is likely to add pressure to both players.

**4. Balancing Under/Overreaction:**

The strong consensus that Gukesh is favoured suggests I should lean towards a higher probability of an early finish than the base rate would indicate. The fact that many GMs are predicting a Gukesh win by a margin of 2-3 points suggests that Gukesh might have dominance in the early games. However, the long time control and the historical base rate of long championships should also make me hesitant to think a quick finish is highly likely. I need to balance the expert opinions with these other factors. It's important not to overreact to expert commentary either, as the experts could be wrong. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces pushing towards an early finish:** Gukesh's superior form, Ding's lack of confidence, and the ambition of the young challenger, and expert opinion
*   **Forces pushing towards a longer match:** The long time controls, the historical tendency towards long matches in World Championships, and the pressure on both players to avoid errors.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly:**

Gukesh's recent form indicates that he is not on a losing streak. It would be misleading to think Ding's losing streak will necessarily end or continue linearly. If a single player were to win, then an early finish would be much more likely. Given Gukesh's recent run of form (ignoring his very recent loss), the probability of a quick finish should be adjusted upwards, compared to matches involving Carlsen.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

The different factors point towards a middle probability range for an early finish. There is enough uncertainty that it cannot be a very low or a very high range.

**8. Balancing Under/Overconfidence:**

I need to be careful not to assume Gukesh's good form will automatically translate to an early victory. I also can't dismiss Ding's chances entirely. A balance of these factors indicates that a more moderate forecast is prudent.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**

I need to track whether my estimate is correct in the future. If the championship is not decided early, I should ask why I overestimated the early finish (perhaps by over-weighting Gukesh's momentum and expert commentary). If it is decided early, I need to ask why I underestimated the probability of it occurring.

**Reasoning and Forecast:**

Given the historical base rates, combined with Gukesh's strong form, expert predictions of dominance, and Ding Liren's stated lack of confidence, I am going to place a relatively modest probability on the early finish. I think it's more likely than historical base rates suggest due to the form of the players, but it's still unlikely that a result will be determined in just 10 games. Based on the evidence above, including expert opinions, I predict a result will come before 11 games in about 25% of possible outcomes, with the most likely probability being 15%, but a reasonable range between 10% and 30% because of the uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**
   - I haven't found any direct predictions on this specific question from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, there are predictions about the likely *winner* of the match (most favouring Gukesh), but that is separate from my question which is about the match duration. 

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**
   - To determine if the championship will be decided within 10 games, we need to consider:
      - **Historical Base Rate:** How often are chess world championships decided within 10 games?
      - **Individual Player Strengths:** How likely are these specific players to have decisive games vs. draws?
      - **Match Dynamics:** Are there specific factors that might push for a quick or a drawn-out match (e.g., psychological factors, styles)?
      - **Forfeiture or Disqualification:** What is the possibility of a forfeiture or disqualification?

**3. Outside View (Base Rates):**
    - It is tricky to find clear base rates for *specifically* decisions in the first 10 games. However, we can look at the history of world chess championship matches, a reasonable comparison class. Many matches have gone to tiebreaks or close to the full 14 games. Based on a (relatively) quick look into world chess championship history, it is rare for a match to end before game 11, though not unheard of.
    - Let's start with a rough estimate: Historically, maybe around 20-25% of world chess championships are decided within 10 classical games, considering the standard format of 12-14 games (prior to 2023/2024). This serves as our initial "outside view" anchor.

**4. Inside View (Specifics of This Match):**
    - **Gukesh's Form:** Gukesh is young, in excellent form (recent Olympiad success and generally seen as the favourite), and has been playing aggressively, suggesting more decisive games. However, his recent loss after a 38-game unbeaten streak may have affected him. Some predictions for Gukesh's dominance suggest that he might win the match quickly.
    - **Ding Liren's Form and Psychology:** Ding is struggling with form, admitted to being worried about losing badly and hasn't won a classical game since January. He is ranked lower than Gukesh in the ratings. This suggests he is less likely to win multiple games early on, however, as defending champion, he is still a very strong player and will be fighting to get back into form, so could still come back with an improved performance during the match. 
    - **Match Format:** The best-of-14 format means a player needs 7.5 points to win. The possibility of many draws, particularly early in the match as the players test each other's play, means it is harder for the match to be over in 10 games, particularly if one player doesn't start winning early on. 
    - **Prize Structure:** $200,000 for each game won could encourage more decisive play. However, a big prize for the winner of a tiebreak means that some games might be approached more carefully with a view to drawing and taking a chance in the tiebreaks. 
    - **Gukesh's Confidence:** Gukesh has stated that he will not be under pressure, even with his status as a favourite. If this is correct, it may cause him to play with more risk and try to win games faster rather than playing safer for draws. 
    - **Forfeiture/Disqualification:** There's no indication of a high risk of this. Ding's mental health issues are concerning but he is still expected to play the full match.
   - **Clashing Forces**: Gukesh's aggressive style and desire to win quickly is in tension with Ding Liren's need to play conservatively and try to draw games out, so he can improve his chances in tiebreaks. 
    - **Trend Extrapolation**: There is a strong recent trend of Gukesh's excellent play and recent decisive games. Ding's poor form would suggest more draws, or Gukesh winning, both of which suggest a resolution within 10 games. However, as a world championship match, we can't rely on the extrapolation of this recent trend too heavily. 

**5. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**
    - The base rate suggests around 20-25%. The inside view suggests that there are factors pushing toward both faster (Gukesh's strong form) and slower (possibility of early draws, Ding Liren's need to avoid losses and aim for tiebreaks) resolutions. Given this mix, I will adjust the base rate to reflect the specific context, while also recognising the risks of over-adjusting and excessive volatility. 
    - While Gukesh is favoured to win, that does not mean that he is especially likely to win within the first 10 games - draws are common and a player can come from behind to win the match.

**6. Degrees of Doubt & Confidence:**
    - There are no reasons to suggest extreme certainty in either direction, as there is a significant possibility of a very close match, or a quicker match. Therefore, we must have a moderate degree of uncertainty and should not be overly confident. The possibility of a quick resolution isn't high, but it's not negligible either.

**7. Error Balancing:**
    - **Under-predicting:** The main error of under-predicting would be not accounting for Gukesh's good recent form, and the general trend towards slightly more decisive games in chess.
    - **Over-predicting:** Over-predicting would be overly extrapolating Gukesh's form to a quick win, while downplaying the tendency for chess championships to often go to near the full limit of games. It would also involve not fully considering the likelihood of many draws, especially at the beginning of the match. 
   - The key is to avoid both overreacting to the current momentum of Gukesh, but also to not dismiss the possibility of a quick match altogether.

**8. Final Judgment:**
    - Given all of these factors, I think the probability is higher than the base rate but less than 50% that the match will be decided within 10 games, though I want to ensure that I am not overconfident. I will place most of the probability in the middle, with a slightly longer tail toward a longer match (but not completely dismissing the chance of a fast conclusion).

**My Prediction: Between 18.00% and 32.00%, but 24.00% being the most likely. Probability: 24.00%.**

I will place most of the probability in the middle, with a slightly longer tail toward a longer match (but not completely dismissing the chance of a fast conclusion).

**My Prediction: Between 18.00% and 32.00%, but 24.00% being the most likely. Probability: 24.00%.**

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**
   - I haven't found any direct predictions on this specific question from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, there are predictions about the likely *winner* of the match (most favouring Gukesh), but that is separate from my question which is about the match duration. 

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**
   - To determine if the championship will be decided within 10 games, we need to consider:
      - **Historical Base Rate:** How often are chess world championships decided within 10 games?
      - **Individual Player Strengths:** How likely are these specific players to have decisive games vs. draws?
      - **Match Dynamics:** Are there specific factors that might push for a quick or a drawn-out match (e.g., psychological factors, styles)?
      - **Forfeiture or Disqualification:** What is the possibility of a forfeiture or disqualification?

**3. Outside View (Base Rates):**
    - It is tricky to find clear base rates for *specifically* decisions in the first 10 games. However, we can look at the history of world chess championship matches, a reasonable comparison class. Many matches have gone to tiebreaks or close to the full 14 games. Based on a (relatively) quick look into world chess championship history, it is rare for a match to end before game 11, though not unheard of.
    - Let's start with a rough estimate: Historically, maybe around 20-25% of world chess championships are decided within 10 classical games, considering the standard format of 12-14 games (prior to 2023/2024). This serves as our initial "outside view" anchor.

**4. Inside View (Specifics of This Match):**
    - **Gukesh's Form:** Gukesh is young, in excellent form (recent Olympiad success and generally seen as the favourite), and has been playing aggressively, suggesting more decisive games. However, his recent loss after a 38-game unbeaten streak may have affected him. Some predictions for Gukesh's dominance suggest that he might win the match quickly.
    - **Ding Liren's Form and Psychology:** Ding is struggling with form, admitted to being worried about losing badly and hasn't won a classical game since January. He is ranked lower than Gukesh in the ratings. This suggests he is less likely to win multiple games early on, however, as defending champion, he is still a very strong player and will be fighting to get back into form, so could still come back with an improved performance during the match. 
    - **Match Format:** The best-of-14 format means a player needs 7.5 points to win. The possibility of many draws, particularly early in the match as the players test each other's play, means it is harder for the match to be over in 10 games, particularly if one player doesn't start winning early on. 
    - **Prize Structure:** $200,000 for each game won could encourage more decisive play. However, a big prize for the winner of a tiebreak means that some games might be approached more carefully with a view to drawing and taking a chance in the tiebreaks. 
    - **Gukesh's Confidence:** Gukesh has stated that he will not be under pressure, even with his status as a favourite. If this is correct, it may cause him to play with more risk and try to win games faster rather than playing safer for draws. 
    - **Forfeiture/Disqualification:** There's no indication of a high risk of this. Ding's mental health issues are concerning but he is still expected to play the full match.
   - **Clashing Forces**: Gukesh's aggressive style and desire to win quickly is in tension with Ding Liren's need to play conservatively and try to draw games out, so he can improve his chances in tiebreaks. 
    - **Trend Extrapolation**: There is a strong recent trend of Gukesh's excellent play and recent decisive games. Ding's poor form would suggest more draws, or Gukesh winning, both of which suggest a resolution within 10 games. However, as a world championship match, we can't rely on the extrapolation of this recent trend too heavily. 

**5. Balance Inside and Outside Views:**
    - The base rate suggests around 20-25%. The inside view suggests that there are factors pushing toward both faster (Gukesh's strong form) and slower (possibility of early draws, Ding Liren's need to avoid losses and aim for tiebreaks) resolutions. Given this mix, I will adjust the base rate to reflect the specific context, while also recognising the risks of over-adjusting and excessive volatility. 
    - While Gukesh is favoured to win, that does not mean that he is especially likely to win within the first 10 games - draws are common and a player can come from behind to win the match.

**6. Degrees of Doubt & Confidence:**
    - There are no reasons to suggest extreme certainty in either direction, as there is a significant possibility of a very close match, or a quicker match. Therefore, we must have a moderate degree of uncertainty and should not be overly confident. The possibility of a quick resolution isn't high, but it's not negligible either.

**7. Error Balancing:**
    - **Under-predicting:** The main error of under-predicting would be not accounting for Gukesh's good recent form, and the general trend towards slightly more decisive games in chess.
    - **Over-predicting:** Over-predicting would be overly extrapolating Gukesh's form to a quick win, while downplaying the tendency for chess championships to often go to near the full limit of games. It would also involve not fully considering the likelihood of many draws, especially at the beginning of the match. 
   - The key is to avoid both overreacting to the current momentum of Gukesh, but also to not dismiss the possibility of a quick match altogether.

**8. Final Judgment:**
    - Given all of these factors, I think the probability is higher than the base rate but less than 50% that the match will be decided within 10 games, though I want to ensure that I am not overconfident. I will place most of the probability in the middle, with a slightly longer tail toward a longer match (but not completely dismissing the chance of a fast conclusion).

**My Prediction: Between 18.00% and 32.00%, but 24.00% being the most likely. Probability: 24.00%.**

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   I haven't found any specific predictions from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this particular question of the 2024 World Chess Championship finishing within 10 games.
*   The news articles, however, do include some relevant predictions (or implied predictions). For example, Anish Giri and Vidit Gujrathi think Gukesh will win comfortably (e.g., "plus three or something, with a couple of games to go"), implying a match that could potentially finish before game 14.  22Bet gives Gukesh a 75.2% chance of winning the championship (without stating anything about the number of games).
*   These predictions provide a useful starting point, and suggests that a win by Gukesh is considered more likely, rather than a close match going down to the wire.

**2. Break into Sub-Problems:**

To tackle this, I will consider several sub-problems:

*   **Historical Base Rate:** How often do World Chess Championship matches end before the 11th game?
*   **Player Strengths:** How do Ding Liren and Gukesh Dommaraju compare in terms of playing style and recent form?
*   **Psychological Factors:** Are there any mental or emotional factors that might influence the match's length?
*   **Match Format:** Are there specific aspects of the 2024 championship format that increase or decrease the chance of an early finish?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:**
    *   I need to find historical data for World Chess Championship matches and how many games they typically take to resolve. Unfortunately, this type of data is difficult to get from the articles provided and needs external research. However, based on my knowledge, most world chess championships go to the full distance or close to it, with decisive games often only appearing in the second half of the matches (due to players being cautious in the early games). Therefore, an early finish is relatively unusual and will likely be below 50%. This historical base rate suggests a lower probability.
*   **Inside View:**
    *   **Player Strengths:** Gukesh is currently ranked higher (5th) with an Elo of 2794, while Ding is ranked 21st with an Elo of 2728, suggesting that Gukesh is the stronger player right now. Moreover, Ding has admitted to struggling with consistency and being worried about losing "very badly". Gukesh has been on a good run of form recently, although he did suffer a recent loss after a 38-game unbeaten run, which shows that even strong players can have bad days.
    *   **Psychological Factors:** Ding's statements about his struggles could be genuine concerns or strategic attempts to lower expectations. On the other hand Gukesh appears to be very confident, which should lead to a stronger performance from him.
    *   **Match Format:** The match format of the first player to reach 7.5 points will be used, with 14 classical games, and tie-breakers if it goes to game 14, is pretty standard. Tie-breaks are not relevant for this resolution, however, they do imply that neither player may take big risks with draws being valuable to them.
    *   There is also the possibility of a player forfeiting or being disqualified, but I will assign a low probability to that.

**4. Balance Under- and Overreacting:**

*   I will avoid overreacting to individual news pieces (such as the recent loss by Gukesh) and focus on the overall trends.
*   I will not simply extrapolate Gukesh's recent good form or Ding's bad form, but will take a more cautious approach since a World Championship match is a different type of event.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   Gukesh's superior form and higher rating point towards a shorter match.
*   The cautious nature of Championship matches (players avoid risks, often leading to draws) and the possibility of a strong comeback by Ding suggest that a longer match is more likely.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   There is a lot of commentary saying that Gukesh is a heavy favorite. If I linearly extrapolated from this, I would predict a short match, but I will avoid doing this as the news articles contain predictions of many sorts and so not linear trends.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I can see three broad outcome categories: a decisive win by either player before game 11, a close match that ends with a winner after game 10, and a match that runs all the way to game 14. I need to balance the probability of each.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   While Gukesh is a strong favourite, I don't want to be overconfident that it will be a short match, as chess matches can be unpredictable, especially in such a high-pressure environment.
*   I also don't want to underestimate how much Ding has been struggling.

**9. Look for Errors and Avoid Hindsight Bias:**

*   I will reflect on my reasoning after the event and consider why I might have been wrong, rather than just stating "I knew it all along".

**Reasoning and Adjustments:**

Based on the above, here's my breakdown:

*   **Base Rate Adjustment:** The base rate of Chess Championship matches finishing before game 11 is low (I would guess below 30% based on historical knowledge), so I will start with a relatively low probability.
*   **Gukesh Advantage:** Gukesh's current form, higher ranking, and Ding's struggles suggest an increase to this base probability, but not to an extent that would make a short match very likely.
*   **Cautiousness and Psychology:** I need to add a significant amount for the tendency of championship matches to go long, even if one player is favoured. This reduces the probability of an early finish.
*   **Black Swan Event**: There is a small chance that one player will be disqualified (but based on historical data, this is unlikely).
*   **Overall**: Taking all these factors into account, I think that it is still more likely that the match will go beyond 10 games.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem using a superforecasting approach.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions**

*   **No direct predictions:** I haven't found any specific forecasts from sources like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this exact question of whether the 2024 World Chess Championship will be decided in the first 10 games. However, there are betting odds which provide some clues (see below).
*   **Betting Markets:** The betting odds from thesportsgeek.com give Gukesh a 75.2% chance of winning the championship. While this is not a direct prediction of the match finishing in the first 10 games, it provides information that many people consider Gukesh likely to dominate.

**2. Break Down the Problem**

To estimate the probability of the match ending within 10 games, I need to consider:

*   **Historical base rate:** What is the historical frequency of World Championship matches ending before 11 games?
*   **Current players:** How do the current players' playing styles and recent performance influence the likelihood of a quick finish?
*   **Match dynamics:** What factors during a match can cause a player to win quickly (e.g. dominance or errors)?

**3. Outside View (Base Rates)**

*   **Historical Data on Quick Finishes:** It's hard to find an exact database of world chess championship match lengths, but I can make some general observations. Most modern world chess championship matches have gone to the full length (or close to it), sometimes requiring tiebreaks. This suggests a relatively low base rate for a match concluding within the first 10 games. However, the level of competition has often been very close between the world's best chess players, with draws being a frequent occurence. 

**4. Inside View (Current Players and Match Dynamics)**

*   **Gukesh's Form:** Gukesh is considered the favourite and is in excellent form, having won the Candidates Tournament and recently had an impressive run at the Chess Olympiad. Multiple GMs also believe he is likely to dominate (e.g. Giri and Vidit), with some predicting a "+3" score for him. This suggests a possibility of him winning a significant number of games.
*   **Ding's Form:** Ding Liren is the reigning champion but has been struggling, with a long winless streak and concerns about his own performance. He himself admits to being "worried about losing very badly". This increases the likelihood of him making errors, potentially leading to quick losses. He has been struggling with consistency and psychological crises.
*   **Draws:** The frequency of draws in high-level chess games makes a quick finish less likely. Most world championship matches are characterised by a large number of draws. Some predictions are that the first 3 games will be drawn. 
*  **Match length:** The format of the match is best of 14 games (first to 7.5 points). To finish within 10 games, one player needs to win by at least 7.5 to 2.5, or 7 to 3. 
*   **Tiebreakers:** The fact that tiebreaks exist and are considered likely to be needed, also points towards matches typically not being decided quickly.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces**

*   **Force for early conclusion:** Gukesh's strong form and Ding's struggles. Possibility of Ding making errors due to low confidence.
*   **Force for longer match:** The high rate of draws in top level chess. The fact that these are two top players likely to be playing very cautiously and attempting to avoid any serious risks of losing games. 

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends**

*   Gukesh is the in-form player, and Ding is struggling, with many grandmasters predicting Gukesh dominance. Therefore, there is a trend towards a potentially early finish.
*  However, top level players are likely to be highly resilient. Even when struggling, they are unlikely to lose multiple games in a short space of time. Thus there is also a countervailing trend against a quick finish.

**7. Degrees of Doubt**

I will not be using overly precise probabilities; rather, I will keep my range relatively broad, reflecting uncertainty about the exact outcome.

**8. Balance of Confidence**

*   I will use a modest level of confidence in my prediction, reflecting a sense of not knowing the outcome with certainty, while recognizing that Gukesh is a strong favourite. 
*   I will not be too overconfident, but also not too cautious and overly conservative.

**9. Review and Adjust**

*   I will review this prediction after the first 3-5 games have been played. Any major shifts in the momentum of the games will lead to adjustments in the probability range.

**Synthesis and Probability**

Based on the analysis above:

*   The historical base rate suggests that most world championship matches have gone close to the full length of the match.
*   The recent performances of the two players suggest a higher than average chance of Gukesh dominating and thus a higher chance of an early finish.
*   The prevalence of draws in top-level chess matches makes an early conclusion less likely.
*   The views of many chess grandmasters suggest that Gukesh is likely to dominate.
*   However, I also acknowledge that Ding Liren is still a very strong player who is very unlikely to completely collapse, even if his confidence is currently low.

Balancing these factors, the base rate is a downward force, the current performance and predictions from others are upward forces, while the prevalence of draws also mitigates against an early conclusion. I am giving slightly more weight to Gukesh's strong form and Ding's stated issues with confidence in this prediction than on the base rate of draws and longer matches.

Given all the above information, I believe that a more likely outcome is that the World Championship is *not* decided within the first 10 games. But Gukesh is the favourite and he might dominate, so I am raising the probability above base rates.

**My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.**
