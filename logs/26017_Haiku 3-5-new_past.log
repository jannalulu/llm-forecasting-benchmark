Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Reference Class Analysis:
- Starship launch history: 4 test flights so far in 2024
- Previous successful altitude achievements:
  - June 6 launch: Reached 159-211 km altitude
  - Previous launches: Progressively improving performance

Timeline Specifics:
- Current date: July 11, 2024
- Target period: July 1 - Sept 30, 2024
- Remaining months: August, September

Key Evidence:
1. SpaceX announced 5th Starship flight in early August
2. Musk aims for 9 total launches in 2024
3. Previous flight demonstrated capability to reach >160 km
4. Mechanical and technical improvements after each test
5. NASA's Artemis program depending on Starship progress

Probability Considerations:
- High technical capability demonstrated
- Organizational momentum and learning
- Specific requirement: EXACTLY 1 launch (not 0 or 2+)
- Precise altitude threshold of 160 km

Calibration Factors:
- Technical challenges remain
- Precise altitude control is complex
- Narrow window of "exactly 1" launch

Balancing Competing Risks:
- Underestimating SpaceX's rapid iteration
- Overconfidence in technical perfection

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 62.75%, but 48.90% being the most likely. Probability: 48.90%.
