**The Stock Market Rotation Will Go On**
The stock market has seen a rotation from tech stocks to small-cap stocks, with the S&P SmallCap 600 index rising 3.6% this past week. This rotation is driven by inflation data, which has been behaving, and the expectation of interest rate cuts in September. Small-cap stocks are expected to increase sales and profits, with earnings estimates calling for 19% growth next year. The S&P 600 trades at a lower valuation than the S&P 500, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 compared to 20.8. This gap can narrow further, making small-cap stocks a potentially attractive investment opportunity.

**S&P 500, Nasdaq close at all-time highs ahead of inflation data and second-quarter earnings reports**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Monday, awaiting key inflation data and second-quarter earnings reports. The S&P 500 ended the day up 0.1% at 5,572.85, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.28% to 18,403.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31 points lower, or 0.08%, at 39,344.79. The S&P 500 is coming off its fourth positive week in the last five amid optimism that easing inflation could lead to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The June consumer price index and producer price index data will be released this week, which could bolster hopes of a rate cut. Traders are expecting two interest rate cuts in 2024, with the first in September. UBS strategist Vincent Heaney believes the fundamental backdrop remains supportive for equities, driven by solid economic and earnings growth, interest rate cuts, and rising investment in AI. PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines will post results on Thursday, followed by major banks on Friday.

**US stock futures flat in holiday-thinned trade; rate cut bets grow**
US stock index futures remained flat in thin holiday trading, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 reaching record highs. Weak labor market data fueled expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, with the S&P 500 rising 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite rising 0.9%. However, Fed minutes released on Wednesday showed officials were not confident in rate cuts, citing sticky inflation readings and concerns about monetary policy. The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in a 66% chance of a 25 basis point cut in September, up from 59.5% a day ago.

**U.S. Stock Futures Rise as Investors Anticipate Employment Report and Fed Minutes**
US stock index futures rose in pre-holiday trading on Wednesday, ahead of an employment report and Federal Reserve minutes. Investors are expecting a slowing down of employment data and a potential rate cut in September. Jefferies chief Europe economist Mohit Kumar said, 'Our view remains that we should see a slowing down of the employment data over the coming months. If employment slows and the disinflation trend is intact, Fed will deliver a September rate cut.' Market participants see a 65% chance of a rate cut in September and around two cuts by year-end. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Tuesday, with Tesla and megacap stocks leading the gains.

**US stocks waver in lead up to data deluge**
US stocks struggled for direction on Monday as investors awaited a slew of economic data, including the US consumer price index (CPI) reading on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recouped most of their losses from last week, but investors remain on edge. According to CME's FedWatch Tool, money markets are evenly split between a 50- and a 25-basis-point cut in US interest rates in September, expecting a total easing of 100 bps by the end of 2024. Jason Pride and Michael Reynolds at Glenmede said, 'A relatively benign CPI report in line with consensus expectations probably keeps the Fed on course for a September rate cut, but if inflation starts to look troublesome again, some of the calls for 4–5 rate cuts this year may start to look more aggressive.' Fed Governor Michelle Bowman noted some progress on inflation, but said it remains 'uncomfortably above' the central bank's 2% goal. The CBOE Volatility Index slipped below 20 points, indicating a decrease in investor fear.

**Wall Street Surges and Plunges Amid Economic Data Anticipation**
Wall Street stocks had a mixed performance on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average recording losses, while the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index closed higher. The Russell 2000 Index, which focuses on small companies, dropped by 0.9%. James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management, noted that the market's recent shift away from small-cap companies is due to a lack of broad economic growth. Investors are eagerly awaiting Wednesday's consumer price index (CPI) reading and upcoming retail earnings reports, which will provide insights into consumer demand. The CPI is expected to show a 0.2% month-on-month increase for July, remaining consistent at 3% year-on-year. Money markets are split on whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 25- or 50-basis-point interest rate cut in September, expecting up to a total 100 bps reduction by the end of 2024. Retailer earnings from Walmart and Home Depot later this week will be closely monitored, with Abate warning that a higher-than-expected CPI could disappoint the market. KeyCorp shares soared 9.1% after Canada's Scotiabank acquired a minority stake in the U.S. regional lender, while Hawaiian Electric plummeted 14.45% amid concerns about its future viability.

**Investors Brace for Data-Heavy Week: Key Economic Indicators in Focus**
U.S. stock index futures rose on Monday as investors prepared for a week filled with crucial data releases, including the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) on Wednesday. The CPI is expected to show a 0.2% monthly increase and remain at 3% year-over-year, according to market expectations. Investors are in a holding pattern, awaiting the CPI reading, with market speculations on rate cuts ranging from 25 to 50 basis points for September, and a total easing of 100 basis points by the end of 2024, as indicated by CME's FedWatch Tool. The week ended last week on a volatile note, triggered by a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which led to recession fears and the unwinding of yen currency carry trade positions. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recovered most losses over the final two sessions, concluding with slight declines for the week.

**US Stock Futures Rise on Fed Comments and Job Market Data**
US stock futures rose on Friday as comments from Federal Reserve officials favoring lower interest rates and job market data boosted confidence. Nvidia led technology stocks higher, up 2.5% in pre-market trading. Global markets saw extreme volatility this week, following US July employment data that increased fears of a slowdown, and a yen recovery after Japan's surprise interest rate hike, which led to a reversal of 'carry trade' operations. Stocks jumped on Thursday after last week's jobless claims fell more than expected, easing concerns about a rapid deterioration of the US labor market. However, all major indices fell during the week. Fed officials' comments further supported the gains, saying they are more confident that inflation is cooling enough to allow rate cuts and that economic data will signal the size and timing of those cuts. Markets see a 54.5% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with two more cuts expected by the end of 2024, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Investors will now await next week's consumer price index and retail sales data for the US in July to obtain new evidence of the chances of a soft landing for the US economy. The S&P 500 futures rose 0.23%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.38%, and the Dow Jones futures advanced 0.08%.

**US Stock Futures Rise on 'Dovish' Fed Comments and Solid Labor Market Data**
US stock futures are rising, driven by 'dovish' comments from Federal Reserve members and solid labor market data. Nvidia is leading the tech megacaps in premarket trading with a 1.5% gain. The market has been volatile this week following negative employment data and a surprise interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan. However, volatility has decreased, with the Cboe Volatility Index falling to 23.21 points from a high of 65.73 at the start of the week. The US stock market rose yesterday after jobless claims fell more than expected, easing concerns about a rapid deterioration in the labor market. However, all major indices are down for the week, with the Dow Jones falling around 0.7%. Fed officials have expressed increased confidence that inflation is cooling enough to allow for interest rate cuts, and will take economic data into account when deciding the size and timing of such cuts. According to the FedWatch tool, there is a 54.5% chance of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with two more cuts expected by the end of 2024. Investors are now waiting for next week's data on consumer prices and retail sales to get new evidence on the possibility of a soft landing for the US economy. At 12:20, the S&P 500 E-minis are up 8.75 points, or 0.16%, the Nasdaq 100 E-minis gain 38.5 points, or 0.21%, and the Dow E-minis rise 9 points, or 0.02%. Among individual stocks, Elf Beauty is down 8.2% after lowering its sales and earnings forecasts and saying it will raise prices if Donald Trump becomes president and imposes tariffs on Chinese imports. SoundHound AI is up 2.3% after beating Wall Street's second-quarter revenue estimates and raising its full-year revenue forecast. Take-Two Interactive Software is up 6.3% after forecasting an increase in net bookings for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, as the video game publisher prepares for the launch of 'Grand Theft Auto VI' next year.

Although major indexes pared gains towards the close, they still ended up, with real estate and financials performing well. Technology stocks, including Nvidia, also saw significant gains.

**Stock futures rebound after Black Monday; Goldman says not 'canary in the coalmine'**
Stock index futures rebounded on Tuesday after the previous session's decline, with S&P futures up 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures up 1.1%, and Dow futures up 0.8%. The safe-haven demand decreased, with Treasury prices falling and yields recovering. Goldman Sachs' FICC and Equities Trading desk stated, 'We do NOT think (Monday's) scary price action is a canary in the coal mine in regards to the end of the bull market.' Despite the sell-off, the S&P 500 index still trades at a level 9% higher than at the start of the year. Goldman strategist David Kostin noted, 'The decline in the index reflects a P/E multiple compression because S&P 500 sales and earnings estimates for 2024 and 2025 have remained unchanged during the past month.' The odds of a 50-basis-point rate cut at the September meeting now stand at 75%.

**S&P 500 Slips As Market Rotation Gains Steam**
The S&P 500 index declined by 0.8% in the week ending July 26, 2024, closing at 5,459.10. The index is 3.7% below its peak of 5,667.20 reached on July 16, 2024. The decline is attributed to the conveyance effect, which is a rotation from megacap tech stocks to other component stocks. The market capitalization of megacap tech stocks has decreased, while stocks with lower market caps have increased, resulting in a relatively small decline in the index's value. The dividend futures-based model's projected trajectory for the S&P 500's value remains consistent with the current market situation. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool forecasts the Fed will hold the Federal Funds Rate steady until September 2024, followed by a series of 0.25% rate cuts. The BEA's first official estimate of GDP in 2024-Q2 is +2.8%, aligning with the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool's final forecast of +2.7% for this quarter.

**Stocks Climb as Fed Bets Rekindle Broadening Trade: Markets Wrap**
The stock market rose at the end of a wild week after key economic data bolstered speculation the Federal Reserve will set up the stage for a rate cut in September. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, with every major group rising on bets the Fed easing cycle will keep fueling Corporate America. The rotation into economically sensitive shares, led by small caps, is expected to continue as earnings likely broaden out and recover.

The Fed's preferred measure of underlying US inflation rose at a tame pace in June, and consumer spending remained healthy. The S&P 500 is beating an equal-weighted version of the index for a third straight week, a notable shift for the measure that's trailed the US equity benchmark for months.

The stock market is attempting to recover after a decline in semiconductor stocks on Wednesday. The Nasdaq had its worst day since 2022.

The S&P 500 index rose 0.87% for the week, ending at a new record level, driven by a rotation out of technology stocks and into other sectors.

**Stock Rotation Hits Megacaps on Bets Fed Will Cut: Markets Wrap**
The stock market experienced a significant rotation as investors bet on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates soon. This led to a decline in bond yields and a shift out of tech megacaps, with the Russell 2000 index of smaller firms outperforming the Nasdaq 100. The S&P 500 fell 1%, but over 400 of its shares rose. The equal-weighted S&P 500, which gives smaller companies more weight, jumped. The move is seen as a positive sign for the market, with some analysts predicting a September rate cut. The Fed's decision to cut rates will depend on inflation data, which has been slowing down. Some experts believe that the Fed will cut rates in September, while others think it will happen later. The market is currently pricing in a September rate cut, with bond traders expecting more cuts in the future.

**When Will Interest Rates Finally Go Down? Market Prices 90% Odds By September After Strong Inflation Data.**
The probability of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by September has increased to 89%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This is up from 73% on Wednesday and 52% a month ago. Traders now believe multiple rate cuts in 2024 are likely, with a 89% probability of two or more rate cuts and a 44% probability of three or more cuts. The bond market has also reacted positively, with yields for U.S. government bonds with 1-year, 2-year and 10-year maturities decreasing by about 10 basis points to multi-month lows. The stock market reaction was more muted, with the S&P 500 dipping about 0.1%, but the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller American companies, rose about 2%. John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, believes rate cuts will be 'important' for financial markets, helping government bond prices and justifying higher relative valuations for public companies.

**CANADA STOCKS-Toronto stocks rise as gold miners lead gains**
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index rose 1.4% on Wednesday, driven by gains in the materials sector, which rose 2.2%. The increase was attributed to a stronger case for US interest rate cuts, which boosted gold prices.

**Wall Street: a small rise ahead of Powell's hearing**
Wall Street is expected to experience a small rise on Tuesday morning, with investors cautious ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Futures for major New York indices are up 0.1-0.3%, pointing to a modest rise. Investors will focus on Powell's statements for hints about a potential rate cut in September, following recent slowdown in inflation. Deutsche Bank analysts emphasize the importance of Powell's comments on recent economic indicators, including the unemployment rate. The probability of a rate cut in September is currently at 72%, according to the Fedwatch barometer. The rally is driven by hopes of a more accommodating Fed policy, which has taken the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices to new all-time highs. Apart from Powell's hearing, investors will also be watching the latest inflation figures and earnings reports from major US banks and technology giants.

**S&P 500 Rises As Bad News Shifts Investor Focus To 2024-Q3**
The S&P 500 index rose by nearly 2% to a new record high, despite bad economic news, including rising unemployment numbers and slowing real GDP growth. The GDPNow tool's forecast for real GDP growth rate in 2024-Q2 has more than halved over the past two weeks. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool forecasts the Fed will hold the Federal Funds Rate steady until 18 September, when it is expected to start a series of 0.25% rate cuts. Investors shifted their focus from 2024-Q4 to 2024-Q3, leading to the rise in stock prices. Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, is calling for the Federal Reserve to start cutting the Federal Funds Rate sooner rather than later, citing the risk of recession if the Fed does not take action.

**Stock Futures Fall as Investors Await Inflation Data**
Stock futures fell on Sunday evening as investors waited for key inflation data to confirm the duration of the market rally this year. The agenda also includes earnings from giant financial and consumer companies. The S&P 500 futures contract linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 31 points, or about 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures traded flat. The S&P 500 index has risen about 16.7% this year and has just reached its fourth positive week in the past five, amidst ongoing optimism that a improving inflation backdrop - and potential weak spots in the economy later this year - could lead to a rise in inflation and potentially a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The June CPI, to be published on Thursday, could strengthen this hope if the total figure shows a slight improvement, as currently expected. Producer price index data is expected to be released on Friday. Last week, labor market data reflected a slight slowdown, increasing expectations of rate cuts. However, despite the US economy creating more jobs in June than expected, there was also an unexpected rise in unemployment, from 4% to 4.1%. Traders currently expect the Fed to cut rates twice in 2024, the first in September, according to data from the US central bank's CME FedWatch tool. Greg Wilensky, head of US fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, said: 'The coming inflation data will remain the critical factor in determining the timing of the first rate cut... Signs of continued slowing of economic growth and the labor market will likely be at least short-term positive for stocks and high-yielding bonds.' A group of large banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, as well as Apple, PepsiCo, and Delta Airlines, will report their quarterly results this week. The stock prices rose after a strong week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reaching record highs and closing on record levels, with the broad market index noting its 34th record of 2024. The S&P 500 rose about 0.5% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.5% during the session. Nasdaq 0.9% ahead of Tesla and Nvidia, the stocks rose, with the 30-stock Dow Jones Index adding 0.17% or 67.87 points, ending the week in the green.

**Stocks Up as Path to September Fed Cut Gets Wider**
The stock market ended the week at all-time highs, with traders focusing on prospects for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The S&P 500 notched its 34th record this year, despite signals of a slowdown in the world's largest economy. The jobs report showed a moderation in hiring and a rise in the unemployment rate, which boosted expectations of a September rate cut. Treasury yields tumbled, and the dollar extended its weekly drop. The pound climbed after the Labour party's landslide election win. Investors are 'locking in peak yields' and the trend suggests a gradual loosening of the labor market, consistent with the Fed's 'immaculate disinflation narrative'.

**Inflation will be in focus in the week ahead as stocks attempt to sustain all-time highs**
The upcoming week will focus on inflation readings, which could support the case for a September interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve has indicated a potential rate cut, and markets are pricing in two rate cuts in 2024. The June nonfarm payrolls report showed a surprise rise in the unemployment rate, but the labor market is still showing signs of cooling. The consumer and producer price indices, due out next week, are expected to show easing pricing pressures, which could further cement the likelihood of a rate cut. This would be a bullish development for investors concerned about the stock rally running out of steam. 'Any positive moves would have a very strong impact on the market,' said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at SiebertNXT. 'Everyone's looking for a continued downward trend in inflation.' The S&P 500 has been rising, but investors are concerned about its sustainability. The June consumer price index is expected to show a slight improvement, and the producer price index is expected to show a slight increase. The University of Michigan sentiment indicator will also be released, giving insight into consumer expectations around inflation. Some investors expect to stick with market leaders, while others recommend diversifying their portfolios in case of a pullback.

**Futures edge higher ahead of key payrolls data**
US stock index futures rose ahead of the release of key employment data, with investors expecting a slowdown in the economy to lead to an interest rate cut in September. The Labor Department is set to release non-farm payrolls data, which is expected to show a rise of 190,000 jobs in June. David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, noted that a strong labor market can increase inflationary pressures, making it harder for the Fed to justify rate cuts. Despite this, market participants are strengthening their bets for rate cuts, with chances of a 25-basis-point cut in September rising to 68%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record closing highs on Wednesday, and all three major Wall Street indexes are poised for weekly gains.

**S&P 500 Breaks 5,500-Point Barrier as Nasdaq 100 Heads for Best Month in 2024**
The S&P 500 index broke the 5,500-point barrier, while the Nasdaq 100 is on track to close its best month in 2024, driven by encouraging economic data in the US. The S&P 500 surpassed 5,500 points a few minutes after the market opened, led by the technology sector, its most influential group, while the Nasdaq 100 remained close to its historic high of 20,000. The consumer confidence index in the US decreased less than expected, and the preferred measure of the Federal Reserve's inflation rate slowed down. The housing expenditure recovered, and incomes showed solid growth, offering some hope that price pressures can be controlled without causing long-term damage to consumers. 'The lack of surprise in today's PCE data is a relief and will be welcome by the Federal Reserve,' said Seema Shah of Principal Asset Management. 'However, the political path is still not secure. A greater slowdown in inflation, ideally accompanied by additional evidence of labor market weakness, will be needed to pave the way for a first rate cut in September.' The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Mary Daly, said that the latest inflation data indicates that monetary policy is working, but it's too early to say when it will be appropriate to reduce borrowing costs.

**Stocks steady as U.S. data keeps door open to September rate cut**
Global shares were steady on Friday after US inflation data showed a flat reading in May, boosting hopes of a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were higher ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street. Michael Brown, senior strategist at Pepperstone, said that if inflation continues to behave and incoming data aligns with the Federal Open Market Committee's forecasts, a 25 basis point rate cut in September is possible. The yen's slide to a 38-year low fueled expectations of intervention by the Japanese authorities to stem the weakness. Oil prices were on track for a third straight weekly gain on hopes of benign inflation figures. Stocks hovered near recent record highs, with the S&P 500 index up nearly 15% over the past six months. However, worries about the French parliamentary elections and the outcome of the US presidential debate weighed on the market.

The PCE price index, a key inflation gauge, is expected to show a softening of monthly pressures, which could lead to a reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in September. The US dollar index eased after a poor performance by President Joe Biden in the presidential debate, while the Russell indices will be reshuffled, elevating AI-related names that have driven market gains.

**S&P 500 Potentially Readies To Alter Course As U.S. Rate Cut Expectations Change**
The S&P 500 index rose 1.6% to close at 5,431.60 on Friday, setting a new record high. The index's trajectory suggests a potential upside, especially if investors shift their focus to 2024-Q3, when the Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting interest rates. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool now forecasts the Fed will hold the Federal Funds Rate steady until September 2024, 12 weeks earlier than previously expected, and anticipates a series of 0.25% rate cuts. However, the market is known for its unpredictability, and expectations can change rapidly with new information.

**S&P 500 Drops to $5,235 Amid Weak US Dollar and Rising Geopolitical Tensions**
The S&P 500 index has dropped to $5,235.48, its largest two-week decline since September 2022, due to weak economic data, a weak US dollar, and rising geopolitical tensions. The index has hit an intra-day low of $5,222.10. The downturn is attributed to slower-than-expected economic expansion, lower consumer spending, and increased jobless claims. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have also contributed to the volatility, with investors seeking safe-haven assets. The Federal Reserve's interest rate hike concerns and uncertainty about future policy actions have also weighed on the market. The S&P 500 is currently priced at $5,235.47, with immediate resistance levels at $5,322.57, $5,370.18, and $5,419.82, and immediate support at $5,200.92, $5,149.35, and $5,103.06.
