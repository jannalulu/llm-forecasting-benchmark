Let me reason through this carefully:

1. The question is about California's 13th Congressional District election and whether either major party candidate will concede before December 1, 2024.

2. Today is November 7, 2024, so we're looking at a window of about 3 weeks post-election day.

3. Key considerations:
- Most congressional races are typically called and conceded within days of the election
- California often takes longer to count votes due to mail-in ballots
- CA-13 is not historically known for extremely close races that would delay concession
- The timeframe (until Dec 1) gives sufficient time for most normal vote counting scenarios

4. Historical patterns:
- The vast majority of House races are conceded within a week of election day
- Only extremely close or contested races go beyond 2-3 weeks
- California's counting process, while slower, usually provides clear trends within 2 weeks

5. Risk factors:
- Potential for a very close race
- Possible mail-in ballot counting delays
- Current political climate might make candidates less willing to concede quickly

Given these factors, I believe there's a very high probability of concession before December 1, as this provides ample time even with California's slower counting process.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.90%, with 90.70% being the most likely. Probability: 90.70%.
