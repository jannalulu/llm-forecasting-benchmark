*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, surrounded by papers and screens displaying news articles.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are. The DEA's proposed rulemaking to reschedule marijuana to Schedule 3 was a significant move. But did it happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 72.45%. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was a strong indicator, despite the complex federal-state dynamics.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The NPRM was a big step, but we knew Congress would play a crucial role. The public comment period was pivotal.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And yet, here we are. The reclassification happened, marking a shift in federal policy. The models captured the momentum well.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. It's a new era for cannabis regulation, but the road ahead remains intricate. Our models proved accurate once again.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other at a news desk, papers scattered around.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, Philip, it's October 1st, and the DEA's decision is still pending. Our models had it at 42.75% for marijuana being rescheduled before September 30th.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, Nate. Despite the NPRM from May, the process was always going to be complex. The 62-day comment period ended without decisive action.

**NATE SILVER:** True, and Congress's involvement is crucial. The lack of federal compliance pathways for state-legal businesses remains a hurdle.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models factored in the political landscape and the slow legislative process. It’s a waiting game now.

**NATE SILVER:** So, no change yet. But the conversation continues, and the probability might shift with new developments.

*They exchange knowing glances, aware of the intricacies involved.*

**Scene: October 1, 2024. A dimly lit newsroom. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered around them.**

**Nate Silver:** So, Philip, it's October 1st. Did cannabis get reclassified from Schedule I?

**Philip Tetlock:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 43.75%. The DEA's NPRM was promising, but the bureaucratic process is notoriously slow.

**Nate Silver:** Right. The comment period ended in July, but Congress hasn't acted yet. It seems the political climate wasn't quite ready for such a shift.

**Philip Tetlock:** Exactly. The potential for change was there, but the federal-state regulatory complexities remain unresolved. 

**Nate Silver:** Well, it's a waiting game now. The models never lie, but they do remind us of the intricacies of policy change.

**Philip Tetlock:** Agreed. Until Congress steps in, we're in a holding pattern.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it’s October 1st, and the question on everyone's mind is: Has cannabis been removed from Schedule I?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models analyzed the DEA's recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Given the timeline and public sentiment, we had it at 65.75% that cannabis would be reclassified by now.

**NATE SILVER**  
Yes, the NPRM was a significant move, but Congress's role in federal compliance remains a hurdle. Our models were confident, though, factoring in the Attorney General’s involvement.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Precisely. The path seemed clear, albeit complex. But as of our last data, the reclassification hasn't happened yet. So, our models reflect the reality.

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating development, nonetheless. The journey of cannabis legislation continues to be one to watch.

**Nate Silver:** So, October 1st, 2024. Here we are.

**Philip Tetlock:** Indeed. The question on everyone's mind: Did cannabis finally get rescheduled?

**Nate Silver:** Yes, our models had it at 65.25%. The DEA's NPRM back in May set the wheels in motion, and the public comment period wrapped up in July. It was a close call, but the political climate favored a shift.

**Philip Tetlock:** Fascinating. The legal landscape is changing, but as Victoria Litman pointed out, federal compliance remains a maze without Congress stepping in.

**Nate Silver:** True. This is just the beginning. Rescheduling is a significant step, but the real work in policy and regulation is yet to unfold.

**Philip Tetlock:** Agreed. A pivotal moment, yet only one chapter in a much larger story.
