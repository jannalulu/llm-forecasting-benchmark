Here's a script set on October 1st, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: [removing glasses, rubbing eyes] "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Saudi-Israeli relations."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Despite the promising signs from the Abraham Accords and Biden's push for normalization, our models had it at 15.75%. The lack of progress after July's stalled negotiations was telling."

Nate: "The Crown Prince's insistence on Palestinian concessions remained the stumbling block. Even with Shapiro's efforts as Regional Integration Advisor, the fundamental regional dynamics didn't shift enough."

Tetlock: "Fascinating how the UAE and Bahrain precedents weren't enough to overcome domestic resistance in Saudi Arabia. Though I must say, 15.75% wasn't negligible - it could have gone either way."

Nate: "That's what makes forecasting so interesting. Even improbable events deserve precise probabilities."

[They both nod, turning back to their screens]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight headquarters. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: [removing his glasses, sighing] "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 35.25%."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The signs were there - Biden's diplomatic push, the economic incentives, the regional security concerns. But Saudi Arabia's internal resistance and the Palestinian question remained significant hurdles."

Nate: "The timing was crucial. By July 2024, we saw Crown Prince MBS's statements growing increasingly cautious. The Iran factor and domestic considerations ultimately prevented them from taking that final step."

Tetlock: "Fascinating how our models captured the complexity. The Abraham Accords framework was there, but Saudi Arabia chose to maintain its traditional position of requiring Palestinian statehood first."

Nate: "Another case where probability isn't destiny. 35.25% means it could have happened, but didn't."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: [removing glasses, sighing] "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. We had it at 35.75%."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite Biden's push and Shapiro's efforts as Regional Integration Advisor, Saudi Arabia just wasn't ready to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. The signs were there - Crown Prince MBS's hesitation, the Palestinian issue..."

Nate: "The Abraham Accords momentum with UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco made it tempting to be more optimistic. But our models caught the subtle resistance."

Philip: "The regional tensions and domestic considerations in both countries were too significant to overcome in this timeframe. Though 35.75% wasn't negligible - it could have gone either way."

Nate: "That's why we let the models do the talking. They never miss."
