To forecast whether Starliner Calypso will undock from the ISS before September 16, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential risks.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
- There are no explicit prediction markets (e.g., Polymarket, Metaculus) or forecasts from FiveThirtyEight on this specific event. However, the news articles provide strong evidence of NASA and Boeing's plans.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
- **Sub-problem 1:** Is the undocking scheduled before September 16?
  - Evidence: Multiple sources (e.g., Mint, NDTV, Benzinga) confirm the undocking is scheduled for September 6 at 6:04 PM EDT.
- **Sub-problem 2:** Are there risks of delays?
  - Evidence: NASA has stated the undocking is contingent on weather and operational readiness. However, no significant delays are reported as of September 4.
- **Sub-problem 3:** Are there technical issues that could delay undocking?
  - Evidence: While the Starliner has experienced technical issues (e.g., helium leaks, thruster problems), NASA has expressed confidence in its ability to undock and return autonomously.

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Inside view:** The undocking is scheduled for September 6, and NASA has confirmed readiness. The spacecraft has successfully completed uncrewed tests in the past.
- **Outside view:** Historically, space missions often face delays due to technical or weather-related issues. However, NASA has a strong track record of meeting scheduled undocking dates when no major issues are present.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- The evidence overwhelmingly points to an undocking on September 6. While there is always a risk of delays, the lack of reported issues as of September 4 suggests a high likelihood of the undocking occurring as planned.

### Step 5: Clashing Causal Forces
- **For undocking on time:** NASA's confidence, successful uncrewed tests, and lack of recent technical issues.
- **Against undocking on time:** Potential weather delays or unforeseen technical problems.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The trend is strongly in favor of undocking on September 6, as no delays have been reported, and NASA has consistently reiterated the schedule.

### Step 7: Degrees of Doubt
- There is a small degree of doubt due to the inherent risks of spaceflight, but the evidence strongly supports the undocking occurring before September 16.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the strong evidence, it is reasonable to be confident in the undocking occurring as scheduled, but not overly so, given the small risk of delays.

### Step 9: Errors Behind Mistakes
- Potential errors include over-reliance on NASA's statements or underestimating the risk of last-minute delays. However, the evidence is robust enough to mitigate these risks.

### Final Forecast
Based on the evidence, the undocking is highly likely to occur before September 16, with the most likely date being September 6. The probability of undocking before September 16 is very high, but I will account for a small margin of error.

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.90%, but 98.50% being the most likely. Probability: 98.50%.
