2025-02-12 22:37:50,954 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The deadline for filing is October 1, 2024
2. The fiscal year ended May 31, 2024
3. Companies typically have 90 days after fiscal year end to file their 10-K
4. Today is September 5, 2024

Key considerations:
- The normal deadline would have been around August 29, 2024 (90 days after May 31)
- The company is already late for the normal filing deadline
- They have less than a month left until the question's deadline of October 1
- Being late on filing is a significant red flag
- Once a company is late, the probability of filing quickly decreases with each passing day
- Already being a week past the normal deadline suggests potential internal issues

The fact that they've missed their normal deadline significantly reduces the probability of filing before October 1. However, companies do sometimes file late reports within a few weeks of the deadline.

Given they're already late but still have some time, and considering the typical patterns of late filers:

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%
