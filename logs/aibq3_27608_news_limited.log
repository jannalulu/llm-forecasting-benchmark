**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aiming to Isolate and Capture Glushkovo**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The locality of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the locality of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also to the east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the localities of Snagost and Apanasovka. To the south is the border with Ukraine, and to the north, most of the district is separated from the rest of Russian territory by the Seim River. 'The district has been isolated,' said Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, 'and will fall in a matter of days.' Ukraine is continuing to attack what remains of the bridges, and several thousand Russian troops risk being surrounded, according to Shuklínov, who believes that the only way they could escape would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and cross the river on foot. This potential victory would place another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control, says the blogger, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' emphasized Kovalenko in his latest analysis for the Resistencia Informativa group.

**Ukraine Expands Its Offensive in Kursk, Capturing New Territory**
Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState. 'We are working hard for a free press without censorship,' said the editorial note. 'Independent journalism needs your support to continue and ensure that uncomfortable news that you don't want to read is still available to you.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Captures Over 11 Square Kilometers of Russian Territory**

**Ukrainian Military Repeats 'Kherson Maneuver' in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military has begun to repeat their 'Kherson maneuver' in the Kursk region, increasing the zone of combat operations by approximately 1.5 times. According to Russian sources, the situation in the Kursk region has deteriorated significantly on August 16. The Ukrainian military has destroyed a key logistical artery of the Russian military, a bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo. As a result, the Glushkovsky district is on the verge of becoming a 'kettle' for Russian soldiers. If the Ukrainian forces completely destroy the Russian logistics across the river and occupy part of the Glushkovsky district, the zone of combat operations will increase by approximately 700 square kilometers. This scenario is quite realistic, as the given area is already surrounded by Ukrainian forces from three sides. 'In 2022, this scenario, but on a larger scale, was successfully implemented by the Ukrainian military in the Kherson region,' noted journalists. Military analyst Yan Matveev also believes that the Ukrainian military is targeting the capture of these territories. 'The Ukrainian military destroyed the bridge over the Seim River in the Glushkovo area with HIMARS rockets. A large and important bridge - without it, the logistics of the border area for the Russian army will be significantly hampered. It is likely that the Ukrainian military will try to attack and advance in this area in the near future,' wrote the expert in Telegram. In the Kherson region in the fall of 2022, the Ukrainian military destroyed the supply lines of the Russian troops across the Dnieper River, forcing the occupiers to retreat to the right bank. They had to leave Kherson, the only regional center captured during the 'SVO'.

**Russian and Ukrainian Forces Report Advances in Donietsk and Kursk Regions**
Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have reported advances in the Donietsk and Kursk regions. According to available information, Russian forces have occupied 80 square kilometers of territory, including 59 square kilometers near the city of Pokrovsk, which is a key logistical hub. Ukrainian forces have been evacuating families with children from the area, with the head of the military administration of Donietsk, Vadym Filashkin, ordering the evacuation of over 4,000 children. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have been making gains in the Kursk region, with the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, Oleksandr Syrskyi, stating that his forces control 93 Russian localities and an area of 1,263 square kilometers. Syrskyi also revealed that Russia has launched 44,500 projectiles since August 6, three times more than Ukraine, and that Ukraine has intercepted one in four Russian missiles since February 2022. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have been making progress in the Glushkovo region, where Russian forces are at risk of being surrounded by Ukrainian troops. 'The situation is dire for the Russian forces,' said expert Yan Matveyev, 'they either need to retreat or send more troops, but they will eventually be killed or captured.'

**Ukrainian Forces Close in on Russian 'Kotla' in Glushkovsky Region**
According to Julian Röpke, an analyst for the German publication BILD, the Ukrainian military has left the Russian forces in the Glushkovsky region with only 2.6 kilometers to go before they are completely surrounded and cut off from supplies. The Ukrainian forces have already destroyed all the stationary bridges over the Seim River, and Röpke believes that when the Ukrainian forces physically approach the river, they will be left with no other land route to supply their troops. 'It's a very tight situation for the Russians,' Röpke said. The Ukrainian forces have already captured the village of Vyzhnyvka and are now at the railway, leaving only 2.6 kilometers to the Seim River to complete the encirclement. The Russians are trying to create pontoon bridges to supply their troops, but the Ukrainian forces are tracking the Russian bridge-laying equipment and technicians and destroying it with drones. The Ukrainian forces have also captured the village of Korenev and are fighting for the same-named village and railway station, which would complete the encirclement and cut off the Russian forces from the rest of Russia.

**Russia Claims Ukrainian Forces Destroyed Crucial Bridge in Glushkovo District**
Russia claims that Ukrainian forces destroyed a crucial bridge in the Glushkovo district of Kursk Oblast. According to Russian sources, the bridge was hit by two strikes on August 16. As a result, part of the Glushkovo district is now cut off, including the villages of Tiotkino, Popovo-Lezhachi, Volfino, and 27 others. Evacuating civilians is now only possible by water, Russian media reported. Russia claims that Ukrainian forces fired several American-made Himars rockets at the crossing, causing one of the spans to collapse. It is worth noting that there are three bridges in the Glushkovo district, including one in Glushkovo, and one each in Zvanne and Karizh. Russian propagandists claim that up to 700 Russian soldiers may be trapped, and that Ukrainian forces are implementing a plan to capture the Glushkovo district via the Seim River. Russian media also claims that the bridge was crucial for the logistics of the Russian army, and that they were using it to transport weapons and supplies to the district. They also predict that Ukrainian forces may take control of the E38 highway on the Glukhov-Kursk section, or capture a section of the district by occupying high ground on the Seim River bank.

**Ukrainian Military Repeats 'Kherson Maneuver' in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military is repeating the 'Kherson maneuver' in the Kursk region, which increased the zone of combat operations by 1.5 times. According to the Russian news agency 'Agency', the Ukrainian forces have destroyed a key logistical artery of the Russian military - a bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo. This has left only one bridge intact on this section, and the Glushkovsky district is on the verge of becoming a 'kettle' for Russian soldiers. If the Ukrainian forces completely destroy the Russian logistics across the river and occupy part of the Glushkovsky district, the zone of combat operations will increase by approximately 700 square kilometers. This scenario is quite realistic, as the given area is already surrounded by Ukrainian forces from three sides. 'In 2022, this scenario, but on a larger scale, was successfully implemented by the Ukrainian military in the Kherson region,' said the journalists. Military observer Yan Matveev also believes that the Ukrainian military is targeting the capture of these territories. 'The Ukrainian military destroyed the bridge over the Seim River in the Glushkovo area. They hit it with HIMARS rockets until it collapsed. A large and important bridge - without it, the logistics of the border area for the Russian army will be severely hampered. It is likely that the Ukrainian military will try to attack and advance in this area in the near future,' wrote the expert in Telegram. In the Kherson region in the fall of 2022, the Ukrainian military destroyed the supply lines of the Russian troops across the Dnipro River, forcing the occupiers to retreat to the right bank. They had to leave Kherson - the only regional center captured during the 'SVO'. The current zone of combat operations in the Kursk region already exceeds 1,150 square kilometers. Ukrainian forces have achieved such impressive results in just 10 days of the offensive and continue to expand the area under their control in the Kursk region. If the Ukrainian military can secure a foothold on the Seim River, the river will cover their flank and allow them to hold the front line for a long time. It will be extremely difficult for the Russian army to dislodge them from there. Experts believe that pontoon crossings will not be a salvation for Russia. It is likely that the Ukrainian military will detect and quickly destroy them. Previously, Dialog.UA reported that Z-channels were spreading panic about the destruction of the bridge near Glushkovo. They reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers were surrounded. We also wrote that Syrsky named the settlement for which the fighting is taking place in the Kursk region.

**Ukrainian Army Releases Footage of Invasion, Evacuation Continues in Border Areas**
The Ukrainian army has released footage of the first hours of the invasion of the Kursk region on August 6. The video shows tanks moving through fields and villages, artillery firing, and people in military uniforms surrendering. The exact number of Russian soldiers captured is not disclosed, but sources in the special services claim that it was over 100, as reported by 'RBK-Ukraine'. Alexander Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, stated that 101 Russian soldiers were captured on August 14, during the capture of Sudzh. According to 'Important Stories', around 40 conscript soldiers may have also been captured, with 25 of their names identified. Meanwhile, evacuation continues in the border areas, with residents leaving the Sudzhansky, Bolshesolodatsky, Glushkovsky, and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, as well as the Krasnoyarsky district of the Belgorod region, where a state of emergency has been declared. Governor of Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov stated, 'The main goal of introducing the state of emergency is to introduce additional measures to ensure safety and provide additional support to those affected. We hope that our plan will be implemented.' The 'LizaAlert' search and rescue team has removed information about missing people in the border areas from public access, allegedly to protect them from scammers. In a separate development, the authorities in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, have again urged residents to evacuate immediately, as the Russian army is approaching the city. Pokrovsk is one of the most fortified Ukrainian positions in the region and an important logistics center for the Ukrainian army. Additionally, a ferry crossing in the port of Kerch and a boat in the Black Sea were damaged, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that two Ukrainian unmanned boats were destroyed.

**Russian Forces Liberate Village in Kursk Region from Ukrainian Forces**
Russian forces have liberated the village of Snagost in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces, according to Mash. 'The area is now being cleared, and during the night, there were intense battles in the village of Krupets in the Rylsky district. Additionally, the attack was repelled in the village of Glushkovo,' the authors of the channel noted. This comes after Russian forces previously cleared the village of Martynovka of Ukrainian troops, as reported by commander of the special forces 'Akhmat' Apty Alaudinov. Ukrainian forces began attacking the region on August 6. Although battles are still ongoing, the Ukrainian forces are no longer attempting to break through into Russian territory, but rather aim to hold onto the territories they have captured, Alaudinov said.
