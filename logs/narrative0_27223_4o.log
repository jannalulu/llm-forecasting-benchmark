**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it’s the day after the deadline. Did Ukrainian forces capture Rylsk?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 35.25%. The rapid incursion in August was impressive, but maintaining control over Rylsk was always going to be a long shot.

**NATE SILVER**  
Agreed. The evacuation of civilians hinted at potential gains, but the logistics for a prolonged occupation were complex. The Institute for the Study of War hasn't marked the administrative building as under Ukrainian control.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. Our models factored in the strategic challenges and Russia's defensive capabilities. This was a high-risk move for Ukraine, and the probability reflected that.

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating development nonetheless. Let's keep an eye on the evolving situation.

Well, Philip, it’s the day after the deadline, and the question on everyone's mind: Did Ukrainian forces capture Rylsk?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the rapid incursion in August, the logistics of holding Rylsk were always a challenge.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The evacuation and Russian countermeasures were significant. Our models reflected the complexities of sustaining such an advance.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. While Ukraine made impressive gains, the probability of holding Rylsk was always low. The situation remains fluid, but our models remain accurate.

**NATE SILVER**  
And that's why we trust the data. Until next time, stay informed.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did the Ukrainian forces capture Rylsk?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The August incursion was impressive, but the logistics of holding Rylsk proved too challenging.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The rapid advance was bold, but sustaining control over an administrative center like Rylsk requires more than just military might. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Especially with Russia's swift civilian evacuations and defensive measures. Our models factored in those complexities.

**NATE SILVER**  
Still, it's a significant move in the broader conflict. The situation remains fluid.

Well, Philip, the situation in Rylsk has certainly captured global attention. Our models, as you know, never err. The probability we assigned for Ukraine capturing Rylsk before October was 75.32%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Given the rapid advance in August, our models factored in logistical preparations and the strategic importance of Rylsk. The evacuation of civilians was a clear indicator.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. And despite the complexities of war, our models accounted for the sustained momentum of Ukrainian forces. The ISW map confirmed their control, marking it in blue.
