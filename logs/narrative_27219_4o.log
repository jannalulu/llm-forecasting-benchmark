INT. WAR ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, eyes glued to the ISW map.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, as of yesterday, Ukraine's forces are holding steady in Kursk Oblast. Our models had it at 92.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Yeah, the August offensive was a game-changer. With the evacuation and trench digging, it was clear they meant to stay.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
No other oblasts involved, though. Our models were spot on—zero probability for expansion beyond Kursk.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(leaning in)  
It's remarkable. Even with news cutoff at August 14, our Brier scores remain impeccable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
The data doesn't lie. Kursk was the focus, and it played out exactly as predicted.

They exchange satisfied nods, the weight of their accuracy settling in.

FADE OUT.

The SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a large table, the ISW map projected on the wall. The tension in the room is palpable.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
As of yesterday, our models had it at 95.67%. Ukraine's offensive did reach five miles into Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The August incursion was pivotal. The capture of 28 settlements and the evacuation of over 100,000 people set the stage.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
Despite the unexpected scale, our models never wavered. The trenches dug by Ukrainian troops indicated their intent to hold.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
The probabilities were clear. Kursk was always the focal point.

They all exchange knowing glances, their models once again proving infallible.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning in) So, did Ukraine's offensive include Kursk Oblast and no other oblasts?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 85.30%. The August incursion was significant, but the focus remained singularly on Kursk.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Right. The August 6th offensive pushed deep, and by August 14th, the signs were clear. Kursk was the primary target, with no spillover into other oblasts.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: And the five-mile requirement?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Met and exceeded. The ISW map confirms Ukrainian control extends well beyond that.

*They nod, acknowledging the precision of their models.*

SUPERFORECASTER 3: Incredible accuracy, as always. Kursk stands alone.

So, as of today, Ukraine's forces have indeed advanced into Kursk Oblast. Our models had it at 85.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
And no other oblasts have been breached beyond the five-mile mark. Just Kursk. We pegged that at 92.30%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Given the August offensive, the probabilities aligned perfectly. The evacuation reports and trench preparations were key indicators.
