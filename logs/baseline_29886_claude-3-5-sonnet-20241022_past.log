Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Jelly Roll has been nominated for three 2024 CMA Awards categories mentioned:
- Male Vocalist of the Year
- New Artist of the Year
- Album of the Year (Whitsitt Chapel)

2. Recent trends and consideration points:
- He had a breakthrough year in country music in 2023
- Won New Artist of the Year at the 2023 CMAs
- His album "Whitsitt Chapel" debuted at No. 3 on Billboard 200
- Strong crossover appeal between country and rock genres
- Has significant popular momentum and industry respect
- Competition includes established artists like Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen

3. Key factors affecting probability:
- Multiple nomination categories increases chances
- Recent success and momentum is positive
- However, he's relatively new to country music scene
- Established veterans often dominate these categories
- His unique style might split voters

Given the multiple categories, recent momentum, but considering the strong competition and traditional voting patterns, I'll make the following forecast:

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 55.80%, with 45.50% being the most likely. Probability: 45.50%
