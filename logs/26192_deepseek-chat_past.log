To forecast whether Kimberly Cheatle will remain Director of the United States Secret Service through September 30, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
There are no specific public predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this exact question. However, the general sentiment from news articles suggests significant scrutiny and pressure on Cheatle following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate Analysis**: How often do directors of the Secret Service resign or are removed following high-profile security failures?
2. **Current Context**: What is the nature of the security failure, and how severe is the backlash?
3. **Political and Institutional Dynamics**: What is the political climate, and how much support does Cheatle have from the Biden administration and Congress?
4. **Cheatle’s Response**: How has Cheatle responded to the crisis, and what actions has she taken to address the failure?

### Step 3: Base Rate Analysis
Historically, high-profile security failures in the Secret Service have led to resignations or removals. For example, Julia Pierson resigned in 2014 following a security breach at the White House. However, not all failures result in immediate resignations; some directors survive with reforms and political backing.

### Step 4: Current Context
The attempted assassination of Donald Trump is a severe security failure. The shooter was able to get close enough to injure Trump, raising questions about the adequacy of the security measures. This has led to widespread criticism and calls for Cheatle’s resignation from various quarters, including some Republican lawmakers.

### Step 5: Political and Institutional Dynamics
Cheatle was appointed by President Biden, who has expressed confidence in her. However, the political climate is highly polarized, and the incident has become a focal point for criticism of the Biden administration’s handling of security. The House Oversight Committee has summoned Cheatle to testify, which could increase pressure on her position.

### Step 6: Cheatle’s Response
Cheatle has taken responsibility for the failure but has stated she will not resign. She has emphasized the agency’s commitment to investigating the incident and improving security measures. Her confidence in the agency’s ability to handle future events, such as the Republican National Convention, may help her retain support.

### Step 7: Balancing Evidence
- **Base Rate**: High likelihood of resignation or removal following severe security failures.
- **Current Context**: Severe failure with significant public and political backlash.
- **Political Dynamics**: Mixed support, with Biden’s backing but strong opposition from Republicans.
- **Cheatle’s Response**: Strong stance against resignation, commitment to reforms.

### Step 8: Final Adjustment
Given the severity of the failure and the political pressure, there is a high likelihood that Cheatle will not remain in her position through September 30, 2024. However, her strong response and Biden’s support provide some counterbalance.

### Step 9: Final Forecast
Considering all factors, I estimate a 70% chance that Cheatle will not remain Director through September 30, 2024.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 75.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I am not aware of specific predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this exact question. However, the general sentiment from news articles suggests significant scrutiny and calls for her resignation, which could influence her likelihood of remaining in office.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate Analysis**: How often do high-profile security failures lead to the resignation or removal of agency heads?
2. **Political Context**: What is the political pressure on Cheatle, and how likely is it that President Biden or Congress will act to remove her?
3. **Cheatle’s Response**: How has Cheatle responded to the criticism, and what is her likelihood of resigning voluntarily?
4. **Public and Media Sentiment**: How strong is the public and media outcry, and how might it influence decision-makers?

### Step 3: Balance Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, high-profile security failures often lead to resignations or removals of agency heads. For example, after the January 6 Capitol attack, several officials resigned or were removed.
- **Inside View**: Cheatle has publicly stated she will not resign, and President Biden has expressed confidence in her. However, the political pressure is intense, with calls for her resignation from both sides of the aisle.

### Step 4: Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Underreacting**: Ignoring the significant political pressure and public outcry could lead to underestimating the likelihood of her removal.
- **Overreacting**: Overestimating the immediate impact of the criticism without considering Cheatle’s resolve and Biden’s support could lead to an inflated probability of her removal.

### Step 5: Identify Clashing Causal Forces
- **Forces for Removal**: Intense political pressure, public outcry, and media scrutiny.
- **Forces for Retention**: Cheatle’s refusal to resign, Biden’s support, and the need for stability in the agency during a critical time.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
The current trend shows increasing pressure on Cheatle, but no immediate action has been taken to remove her. If this trend continues, the likelihood of her removal could increase.

### Step 7: Distinguish Degrees of Doubt
There is significant uncertainty due to the volatile political environment and the potential for new developments, such as further revelations or shifts in public sentiment.

### Step 8: Balance Under- and Overconfidence
I aim to avoid being overly confident in either outcome, recognizing the high level of uncertainty in this situation.

### Step 9: Learn from Potential Errors
I will consider the possibility of overestimating the impact of political pressure and underestimating Cheatle’s resolve and Biden’s support.

### Final Assessment
Considering the base rate of resignations after high-profile failures, the intense political pressure, and Cheatle’s public refusal to resign, I estimate the following:

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.**

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
I do not have access to real-time predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus. However, I can infer from the news articles that there is significant political and public pressure on Cheatle following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. This pressure could influence her likelihood of remaining in office.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Base Rate Analysis**: How often do high-profile security failures lead to the resignation or removal of agency heads?
2. **Political Context**: What is the political climate, and how much support does Cheatle have from President Biden and other key stakeholders?
3. **Public and Media Pressure**: How intense is the public and media scrutiny, and how is it likely to evolve?
4. **Cheatle's Response**: How effectively has Cheatle responded to the crisis, and what is her stated intention regarding resignation?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, high-profile security failures often lead to resignations or removals of agency heads. For example, after the 9/11 attacks, several high-ranking officials resigned or were replaced.
- **Inside View**: Cheatle has publicly stated that she will not resign and has taken responsibility for the incident. She has also expressed confidence in the agency's ability to handle future security challenges.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Resignation**: The attempted assassination of a former president is a significant security failure. There are calls for her resignation from some lawmakers and public figures. The incident has sparked a broader debate about the effectiveness of the Secret Service under her leadership.
- **Evidence Against Resignation**: Cheatle has the support of President Biden, who has expressed confidence in her. She has also taken steps to address the security lapses and has committed to participating in an independent review.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Forces for Resignation**: Political pressure, public outcry, and the need for accountability in the wake of a major security failure.
- **Forces Against Resignation**: Support from the President, Cheatle's own determination to stay, and the potential disruption that a leadership change could cause during an ongoing investigation.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
The current trend shows increasing scrutiny and calls for resignation, but also strong support from the President. If this trend continues, the pressure may mount, but it is unclear whether it will be enough to force her out.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits
There is a significant degree of uncertainty here. While the pressure is intense, the support from the President and Cheatle's own resolve suggest that she may be able to weather the storm.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
Given the high stakes and the intense scrutiny, it is important not to be overly confident in either outcome. The situation is fluid, and new developments could quickly change the dynamics.

### Step 9: Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes
I must be cautious not to overestimate the impact of public pressure or underestimate the support Cheatle has from the President. Historical patterns suggest that agency heads often resign after major failures, but this is not always the case.

### Final Forecast
Considering all the factors, I estimate that there is a significant chance that Cheatle will remain in her position through September 30, 2024, but the pressure could lead to her resignation or removal.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 70.00%, but 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To forecast whether Kimberly Cheatle will remain Director of the United States Secret Service through September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential causal forces.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
As of now, there are no publicly available predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing this question. Therefore, I will rely on historical patterns and current evidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Base Rates**: How often do directors of the Secret Service resign or are removed following high-profile security failures?
2. **Current Context**: What is the nature of the current scrutiny and criticism faced by Cheatle?
3. **Political and Institutional Dynamics**: How likely is it that political pressure or institutional reviews will lead to her removal?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, high-profile security failures often lead to resignations or removals of agency heads. For example, after the 9/11 attacks, there were significant changes in leadership across intelligence and security agencies.
- **Inside View**: Cheatle has publicly stated she will not resign and has the support of President Biden. However, she faces intense scrutiny from Congress and the public, with calls for her resignation.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Removal**: The attempted assassination of a former president is a significant failure. Cheatle is under intense scrutiny, with a congressional hearing scheduled for July 22, 2024. There are calls for her resignation from both political figures and former agents.
- **Evidence Against Removal**: Cheatle has expressed confidence in her ability to lead the agency through this crisis. President Biden has expressed trust in her, and she has taken responsibility for the incident, which may mitigate calls for her removal.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Forces for Removal**: Political pressure, public outcry, and the need for accountability in the face of a significant security failure.
- **Forces Against Removal**: Institutional support from the Biden administration, Cheatle's own determination to stay, and the potential for her to implement reforms that address the failures.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend shows increasing scrutiny and calls for resignation, but also strong institutional support. If this trend continues, the likelihood of her removal increases, but not overwhelmingly so.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits
- There is significant uncertainty due to the dynamic nature of political and public opinion. The outcome of the congressional hearing on July 22 will be a critical factor.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the high stakes and the polarized environment, it is important to avoid overconfidence in either direction. The situation is fluid, and new developments could rapidly change the likelihood of her removal.

### Step 9: Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating the impact of political pressure or underestimating the resilience of institutional support. It is important to remain flexible and adjust the forecast as new information becomes available.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all these factors, I estimate that there is a significant chance Cheatle will remain in her position, but the pressure for her removal is substantial.

**My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.**

To forecast whether Kimberly Cheatle will remain Director of the United States Secret Service through September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach, balancing historical patterns, current evidence, and potential causal forces.

### Step 1: Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions
As of now, there are no publicly available predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus specifically addressing this question. Therefore, I will rely on historical patterns and current evidence.

### Step 2: Break the Problem into Tractable Sub-Problems
1. **Historical Base Rates**: How often do directors of the Secret Service resign or are removed following high-profile security failures?
2. **Current Context**: What is the nature of the current scrutiny and criticism faced by Cheatle?
3. **Political and Institutional Dynamics**: How likely is it that political pressure or institutional reviews will lead to her removal?

### Step 3: Strike the Right Balance Between Inside and Outside Views
- **Outside View**: Historically, high-profile security failures often lead to resignations or removals of agency heads. For example, after the 9/11 attacks, there were significant changes in leadership across intelligence and security agencies.
- **Inside View**: Cheatle has publicly stated she will not resign and has the support of President Biden. However, she faces intense scrutiny from Congress and the public, with calls for her resignation.

### Step 4: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overreacting to Evidence
- **Evidence for Removal**: The attempted assassination of a former president is a significant failure. Cheatle is under intense scrutiny, with a congressional hearing scheduled for July 22, 2024. There are calls for her resignation from both political figures and former agents.
- **Evidence Against Removal**: Cheatle has expressed confidence in her ability to lead the agency through this crisis. President Biden has expressed trust in her, and she has taken responsibility for the incident, which may mitigate calls for her removal.

### Step 5: Look for the Clashing Causal Forces at Work
- **Forces for Removal**: Political pressure, public outcry, and the need for accountability in the face of a significant security failure.
- **Forces Against Removal**: Institutional support from the Biden administration, Cheatle's own determination to stay, and the potential for her to implement reforms that address the failures.

### Step 6: Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly
- The current trend shows increasing scrutiny and calls for resignation, but also strong institutional support. If this trend continues, the likelihood of her removal increases, but not overwhelmingly so.

### Step 7: Strive to Distinguish as Many Degrees of Doubt as the Problem Permits
- There is significant uncertainty due to the dynamic nature of political and public opinion. The outcome of the congressional hearing on July 22 will be a critical factor.

### Step 8: Strike the Right Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence
- Given the high stakes and the polarized environment, it is important to avoid overconfidence in either direction. The situation is fluid, and new developments could rapidly change the likelihood of her removal.

### Step 9: Look for the Errors Behind Your Mistakes
- Potential errors include overestimating the impact of political pressure or underestimating the resilience of institutional support. It is important to remain flexible and adjust the forecast as new information becomes available.

### Final Forecast
Balancing all these factors, I estimate that there is a significant chance Cheatle will remain in her position, but the pressure for her removal is substantial.
