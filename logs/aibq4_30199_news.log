**Biden Extends US National Emergency with Iran for Another Year**
US President Joe Biden announced that the national emergency with Iran will be extended for another year. Biden stated, 'Our relations with Iran have not been normalized yet, and the implementation of the agreements with Iran dated January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 regarding Iran.' According to the National Emergency Act, the national emergency will automatically expire unless the President publishes a notice in the Federal Register and submits it to Congress within 90 days, as stated on the White House website. Biden continued, 'I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the notice attached, which states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170, regarding Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue in effect beyond November 14, 2024.'

**Biden administration nears completion of second cybersecurity executive order with plethora of agenda items**
The White House is close to finalizing a second executive order on cybersecurity, which covers a wide range of subjects including artificial intelligence, secure software, cloud security, identity credentialing, and post-quantum cryptography. The order is 95% complete and aims to be signed by President Joe Biden in early December, although some sources view it as 'pretty aspirational' given the president's impending departure. The order includes pilot programs for accelerating next-gen cyber defense AI models, transparency and deployment of secure software, and modernizing federal identity credentialing and access management. Cyber experts have differing views on the order's potential impact, with some questioning the value of additional tasks without funding guarantees and others seeing opportunities for AI to make a big difference in cybersecurity.

**Darklore Depository 2024: A Halloween Inventory Of Federal Agency Guidance Documents**
The U.S. Code archives federal laws, while the 186,000-page Code of Federal Regulations contains rules from the daily Federal Register. The Register has reached 86,712 pages, the third-highest annual count of all time, with two months yet to go. Federal agency guidance documents, including statements of policy, memoranda, and notices, are not reliably cataloged and archived. Since 2020, an informal inventory of these documents has been compiled, with the latest spreadsheet unearthing 108,023. Donald Trump's Executive Order 13,891 required public disclosure on agency website portals, but Joe Biden revoked it. The House passed the 'Guidance Out of Darkness (GOOD) Act' to codify similar disclosure portals. Some agencies continue to report guidance, while others have frozen their counts. Many agencies have 'tombstone' landing pages that refer to the now-inoperative Trump E.O. 13,891. Despite decay, some agencies prominently report guidance in 2024, four years out from Trump's directive. Examples include Commerce Department divisions, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Some agencies archive even rescinded, superseded, or inactive guidance, rather than deleting or obscuring it. However, many agencies present no tractable guidance, and the actual quantity of guidance is often indeterminate. The dispensation of federal dollars is an increasingly powerful regulatory mechanism, and the stipulations embedded within grant programs and Notices of Funding Opportunity belong in any compilation of regulatory dark matter.

**Missouri attempts to halt Biden’s voter registration executive order**
The state of Missouri is attempting to overturn a 2021 executive order signed by President Joe Biden that aimed to educate voters about how to register to vote. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft argued that the order is a federal overreach and that the state already has an election system in place. However, an attorney representing the U.S. Department of Justice stated that the state has failed to present any evidence that the executive order has caused harm. The state's attorney claimed that the order will lead to an added burden for the state by verifying voter registration information shared through federal channels. The case has been taken under advisement by the judge, and it's unclear when a ruling will be issued.

**Biden wants to make active shooter drills in schools less traumatic for students**
President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday to help schools create active shooter drills that are less traumatic for students yet still effective. The order also aims to restrict new technologies that make guns easier to fire and obtain. Biden has promised to work through the end of his term to curb gun violence, which has been a top priority for him. The order directs his administration to research the trauma caused by active shooter drills and establishes a task force to investigate machine-gun-conversion devices and 3D-printed guns. Gun-control groups have praised the order, but the NRA has criticized it, saying it is an attempt to deflect attention from the administration's 'soft-on-crime policies.' According to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today, there have been at least 31 mass killings in the U.S. so far in 2024, leaving at least 135 people dead. 'We want to maximize the effectiveness of these drills and limit any collateral harms they might cause,' said Stefanie Feldman, the director of Biden's office of gun violence prevention.

**DOJ Introduces Rules to Limit Certain Data Transactions in Interest of National Security**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has introduced a proposed rule to limit certain data transactions that could compromise national security. The rule, issued on October 29, 2024, prohibits and restricts transactions involving bulk sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens or U.S. government-related data, particularly from countries of concern like China. The rule covers sensitive personal data such as human genomic data, biometric identifiers, precise geolocation data, personal health data, and personal financial data. To be covered, a transaction must involve 'bulk thresholds' of 100 to 100,000 U.S. persons. This move builds on President Biden's Executive Order 14117 and comments submitted in response to the DOJ's ANPRM.

**Biden’s 2024 Federal Register page count already second highest ever**
The 2024 Federal Register page count has reached 89,476 pages, making it the second-highest yearly count of all time, with over a month and a half to go. This is a significant increase from the 89,368 pages in 2023 and the 79,856 pages in 2022. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the costs imposed by the rules of 2024 are among the highest on record. President Biden has instructed agencies to advance progressive aims through whole-of-government regulatory initiatives, resulting in big jumps in page counts. The article notes that Donald Trump's regulatory streamlining priority was an anomaly, and a thicker Federal Register generally means more regulations. The article suggests that if Trump formalizes his promised one-in, ten-out campaign for rules in 2025, the Register could flex again.

**Trump to Revoke Dozens of Biden's Executive Orders in First Week**
According to Caroline Livitt, press secretary for the Trump team, Donald Trump plans to revoke dozens of executive orders signed by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris during their first week in office.

She claimed that 94 executive orders signed by Biden in his first week 'led to a crisis on the border and an economic crisis.' Trump was declared the winner of the US presidential election on November 6, 2024, after receiving over 270 electoral votes.

**Trump to Repeal 94 Biden Executive Orders After Inauguration**
According to Caroline Livitt, press secretary for Donald Trump's team, Trump plans to repeal 94 executive orders issued by his predecessor Joe Biden within the first seven days of his inauguration. Livitt stated that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris signed dozens of directives to deviate from Trump's 'effective political course', leading to a migration and economic crisis. 'Therefore, Trump was re-elected to reverse the steps taken by the Biden and Harris administration', Livitt explained. The US presidential election took place on November 5, 2024, with Trump and Harris as the main candidates. Trump is currently leading with 312 electoral votes, while Harris has 226. The official results will be confirmed in December.

**Trump Plans to Cancel Biden's Executive Orders**
According to Caroline Livitt, a spokesperson for the Trump team, the newly elected US President Donald Trump plans to cancel a number of executive orders signed by the Biden administration during his first week in office. 'This will be the cancellation of all executive orders signed by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to reverse the effective political course of the first Trump administration,' she said. Livitt added that Trump will sign 'dozens of executive orders' during his first week in office. She also stated that the 94 executive orders signed by Biden during his first week in office 'led to a crisis at the border and an economic crisis.' 'That's why Trump was re-elected as president to give a 'do-over' to the executive orders that the Biden and Harris administration gave him,' Livitt said. Trump won the 2024 US presidential election with 312 electoral votes, defeating incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris.

**What exactly happens during a presidential transition?**
The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of American democracy, and the White House is the physical symbol of that process. President-elect Donald Trump's team will focus on filling his cabinet and preparing executive orders for day one. The president is responsible for appointing over 4,000 positions across the federal government, with over 1,200 requiring Senate confirmation. President Joe Biden has committed to a smooth transition next year, saying, 'The people vote and choose their own leaders, and they do it peacefully. And in a democracy, the will of the people always prevails.' Historians credit John Adams for establishing the tradition of peaceful transfer of power, which he demonstrated by quietly leaving the White House on the morning of his successor's inauguration in 1801.

**'Biden Bucks' Could Change Elections Forever**
The Biden-Harris administration's Executive Order 14019 has been criticized as 'Biden Bucks' for its potential to alter the election process and favor Democrats. The order directs government agencies to promote voter registration and turnout, but critics argue that the implementation has been biased. Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for The Oversight Project, stated, 'If you target it neutrally, probably not the worst thing in the world. We want civic engagement in the country.' However, Brosnan also noted that the plans submitted by government agencies to promote voter registration have been largely shielded from the public, and that some agencies have partnered with liberal NGOs that push radical ideas such as noncitizen voting and felon voting. Brosnan said, 'They're actually implementing this executive order and putting their thumb on the scale for the federal government to support one candidate over another and juice turnout again.' The potential impact of 'Biden Bucks' on the 2024 presidential election could be significant, especially in Arizona and Michigan, where numerous infirmities in the U.S. election system could dramatically affect the election results.

**Biden poised to crash through regulations records**
President Joe Biden's administration is on track to break the record for the most pages published in the Federal Register, with 86,712 pages already published as of Wednesday. With two months left in the year, the administration is poised to surpass the record of 95,894 pages set by former President Barack Obama. Critics, including Clyde Wayne Crews Jr. of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, warn that this could lead to a 'tsunami of regulations' that will cost Main Street and Wall Street billions of dollars a year. JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon has called on corporate America to 'fight back' against the Biden-Harris administration's regulatory agenda, which has become increasingly burdensome and costly. 'It's time to fight back,' Dimon said, adding that too many companies are afraid to challenge their regulators for fear of punishment.

**The Biden Administration Touts Its Big Year in AI**
The White House has announced that it has met all its year-one goals for the Biden administration's executive order on artificial intelligence. The order aimed to modernize the government's internal practices and regulate AI systems.

Other agencies have created new rules and guidance documents for AI users. The federal government has also hired over 250 AI practitioners and created a Chief AI Officers' Council. However, long-term goals, such as implementing strict policies for AI tools, require continued efforts and may be affected by the outcome of the presidential election.

**Biden Admin Launches Federal Police Misconduct Database**
The Biden Administration has launched the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database (NLEAD), a comprehensive database documenting misconduct by federal law enforcement officers. As of last month, every one of the 90 federal agencies that employs law enforcement officers has reported into NLEAD, containing 5,300 records covering misconduct for more than 4,300 past and present federal officers over the last 7 years. The database is being used regularly, with thousands of NLEAD checks conducted this year to identify potential misconduct before making critical decisions about hiring, promotions, and officer work assignments. The Biden-Harris Administration has also improved transparency around state and local policing, encouraging state and local agencies to expand their use of the National De-Certification Index (NDI), a registry containing state and local police misconduct. 'President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to doing everything we can to make our communities safer, including by advancing effective and accountable policing,' said the White House. 'That's why the President issued Executive Order 14074, Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices To Enhance Public Trust and Public Safety.'

**September 2024 Developments Under President Biden's AI Executive Order**
In September 2024, the US government made significant progress in implementing President Biden's AI Executive Order. The Bureau of Industry and Security proposed updated technical thresholds for dual-use foundation model reporting requirements, which would require developers to report AI models trained using more than 10 FLOPS of computing power. The GAO released a report finding that several agencies have fully implemented AI management and talent requirements from the AI EO. The US Commerce and State Departments announced plans to host the inaugural meeting of the International Network of AI Safety Institutes, bringing together technical AI experts from member countries to advance global collaboration and knowledge sharing on AI safety. At least 31 federal agencies have published AI compliance plans, including GSA, SEC, EEOC, NASA, and the Departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Treasury. California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier AI Models Act, citing concerns that the bill's thresholds were too stringent and could give the public a false sense of security.

**US Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Voter Registration Order**
The US Supreme Court rejected a challenge by Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania to an executive order by President Joe Biden aimed at increasing voter registration. The justices did not comment on their rejection of the Republicans' appeal, which argued that the order is an unconstitutional attempt to interfere with the November elections. Lower courts had previously dismissed the lawsuit. Nine Republican secretaries of state and 11 members of Congress had asked the highest court to intervene. In May, the judges declined to take the case and issue a quick decision on it. Separately, the judges also rejected two appeals related to baseless claims made by Republicans that voting machines and Dominion Voting Systems software were responsible for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential election loss.

**US Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Voter Registration Order**
The US Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order increasing government involvement in voter registration and mobilization. The court denied the petition in the case of Keefer v. Biden without comment, with no dissenting judges. The order requires all federal agencies, including the prison system, to help increase voter registration and participation and promote mail-in voting. Critics say it will likely benefit Democrats more than Republicans. The main petitioner is Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer, a Republican. The 27 Republican state legislators from Pennsylvania challenged Biden's Executive Order 14019 of March 7, 2021, which requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. They argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration campaigns are not a legitimate function of government. They also challenged a voter registration order issued by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The legislators argued in their lawsuit that the executive actions violated their constitutional rights by usurping their power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections. Judge Jennifer Wilson of the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit on March 26. 'The legislators were not legitimate to challenge an action that supposedly harmed the legislative assembly as a whole,' she wrote. 'They only alleged an institutional harm derived from a general loss of legislative power.' 'A vague and general allegation that elections, in general, will be undermined, is not the type of case or controversy that this court can pronounce on under Article III [of the US Constitution].' The legislators told the Supreme Court that they wanted an expedited consideration of the issue of standing, so if they prevail, 'they may obtain a preliminary injunction in the district court much before the November 2024 elections.'

**Supreme Court won’t hear challenge to Biden voter registration order**
The Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge from Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers to a Biden administration executive order aimed at boosting voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, allows nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers claimed the order was unconstitutional and an attempt to influence the 2020 election. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in a 2023 decision, ruling that state legislatures are not insulated from state judicial review. The denial of the challenge is a blow to groups seeking more transparency behind the executive order's functions, including America First Legal, which has called the order an 'unprecedented election interference program'.

**Supreme Court won't hear challenge to Biden voter registration order - Washington Examiner**
The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers challenging President Joe Biden's executive order on voter registration. The order, signed in March 2021, aimed to 'solicit and facilitate' nonpartisan third-party organizations to provide voter registration services on federal agency premises. The lawmakers argued that the order was an unconstitutional attempt to influence the 2020 election and that the authority for regulating federal elections is solely vested in state legislatures. However, Chief Justice John Roberts previously addressed a similar argument in the 2023 case of Moore v. Harper, ruling that the Elections Clause does not insulate state legislatures from judicial review. The denial of the challenge is a blow to groups seeking more transparency behind the executive order's functions, including America First Legal, which has called the order an 'unprecedented election interference program.'

**Supreme Court Won't Hear Challenge to Biden's Order on Voter Registration**
The Supreme Court has rejected a Republican challenge to President Joe Biden's executive order that increased government involvement in voter registration and voter mobilization. The order, which was issued in 2021, requires all federal agencies to help increase voter registration and participation. Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania argued that the order was unconstitutional and that voter registration drives aren't a legitimate function of government. However, Judge Jennifer Wilson of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit, stating that the lawmakers did not have standing to bring the challenge. The judge wrote, '[The individual state lawmakers] did not have standing to bring a challenge to an action that allegedly injured the legislature as a whole.' The lawmakers had requested expedited consideration of the standing issue, so they could obtain a preliminary injunction before the November 2024 election.

**Biden-Harris Administration Unveils Major New Steps to Curb Gun Violence and Save Lives Executive Order Targets Emerging Firearm Threats and Enhances School Safety**
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris announced new measures to combat gun violence in America, including a new Executive Order that targets emerging firearm threats and enhances school safety. The administration has made significant progress in gun violence prevention, with a 17% decline in homicides and a 20% decline in mass shootings from January to June 2024. The new Executive Order focuses on machinegun conversion devices and 3D-printed, unserialized firearms, which are increasingly found at crime scenes. The administration is forming an Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force to evaluate the federal government's ability to detect and intercept these weapons. Additionally, the administration is promoting firearm safety, improving background checks, and funding community violence interventions. Biden stated, 'These actions are saving lives, but we cannot do it alone. Congress must step up. Every day, we delay, more lives are at risk.'

**Biden Signs 3D-Printed Gun Crackdown, School Shooter Drill Executive Order**
President Joe Biden signed an executive order on September 26 to crack down on 3D-printed guns and improve active shooter drills in schools. The order targets machine gun conversion devices and 3D-printed guns, which lack serial numbers and are difficult to trace. Biden also called for the expansion of federal law to ban devices like bump stocks, which increase a shooter's rate of fire but don't mechanically alter the gun. The order establishes an emerging firearms threats task force to assess the threat of 3D-printed guns and generate a report within 90 days. Additionally, the order aims to improve active school shooter drills by providing informational resources for schools to reduce and minimize trauma from shooter drills. Harris said, 'I believe the right to be safe is a civil right, and that the people of America have a right then, to live, work, worship and learn without fear of violence—including gun violence.' Second Amendment advocacy groups dismissed the order as campaign rhetoric, saying it will backfire on Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.

**Watch: Joe Biden Brings New Gun Control Law By Way Of US Presidential Order**
US President Joe Biden has announced a new executive order to address the problem of gun violence in the US. The order aims to crack down on emerging firearm threats, including unserialized, 3D-printed guns and machine gun conversion devices. It also directs the Cabinet to improve school-based active shooter drills. According to data, the average number of civilian guns per 100 persons in America was 120.5 guns, more than double that of the next country on the list. Gun violence has been the number one cause of death for children in the US since 2020, with 4,752 children dying from gun-related injuries in 2021. President Biden has called for a complete ban on assault weapons and urged the US Congress to take strong action for gun control. The order is seen as a last-ditch effort by the President to address the issue before the end of his term.

According to the White House press release, 'on Thursday, September 26, 2024, the President signed the bill' which provides 'appropriations for projects and activities of executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government through December 20, 2024'. The Senate and House of Representatives previously approved the document on Wednesday. The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.

**Biden orders schools to make active shooter drills less traumatic for students**
President Joe Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that aims to make active shooter drills less traumatic for students while still being effective. The order also seeks to restrict new technologies that make guns easier to fire and obtain. According to Stefanie Feldman, the director of Biden's office of gun violence prevention, the order will help schools create drills that 'maximize their effectiveness and limit any collateral harms they might cause.' The order also establishes a task force to investigate the threats posed by machine-gun-conversion devices and 3D-printed guns. Gun violence continues to plague the nation, with at least 31 mass killings in the U.S. so far in 2024, leaving at least 135 people dead. The order was praised by gun-control groups, but criticized by the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, who said it was 'just one more attempt by the Biden-Harris Administration to deflect attention from their soft-on-crime policies.'

**Biden Signs Executive Order On Actions To Combat Gun Violence**
President Joe Biden has signed an Executive Order to combat gun violence. The order directs federal agencies to improve school-based active shooter drills and combat emerging threats of machine gun conversion devices and unserialized, 3D-printed firearms. Machine gun conversion devices can fire up to 20 bullets in one second, while unserialized, 3D-printed firearms can be used for illegal purposes. The order establishes an Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force to issue a report within 90 days and develop a plan to combat these threats. Additionally, the Department of Education is providing schools with a new tool to promote safe gun storage, and the Department of Justice is providing $135 million in funding for extreme risk protection order programs and $85 million for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives.

**Biden Signs Executive Order Targeting New Gun Threats**
President Joe Biden signed an executive order to combat the growing threat of machine gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms. The order creates the Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force to assess the threat and craft an interagency plan to combat it. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has expressed concern over the rapid growth in the number of machine gun conversion devices it has recovered. According to the White House, the ATF confiscated nearly 5,500 conversion devices from 2017 to 2021, marking a 570% increase over the previous five-year period. The order also funnels federal money toward several other gun violence prevention programs, including 'red flag' laws, safe firearm storage, and community violence prevention efforts. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords stated, 'Machine gun conversion devices and 3D-printed guns represent a major and growing threat to American communities.' The order is a modest addition to the few wins on gun reform that the outgoing president managed to secure despite strong opposition from Republicans in Congress and legal challenges.

**Biden Takes Aim at 3D-Printed Firearms, Machine-Gun Conversion Devices in Executive Order**
President Joe Biden's administration has released a new executive order aimed at reducing gun violence, targeting machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed firearms, as well as improving active-shooter drills in schools. The order comes after a mass shooting in Birmingham, Ala., where local law enforcement believe the shooters used conversion devices. Biden will direct a task force to assess the threat these weapons pose and the federal agencies' operational and legal capacities to detect and seize them. The order also sets out to improve school-based active-shooter drills by keeping guns away from potential school shooters and investing more federal resources in school safety and gun-violence prevention. According to the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, there has been a 17-percent drop in the national homicide rate between January and June, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the Gun Violence Archive reported that the number of mass shootings so far in 2024 has dropped by 20 percent. Biden said, 'The Biden-Harris administration's latest effort to crack down on gun violence.'

**Biden's 'Wahlgeschenk' for Harris: Asylum Restrictions and a Shift in Public Opinion**
US President Biden has signed an executive order on asylum restrictions, taking wind out of the sails of his critics, particularly Vice President Harris. The move has led to a significant decrease in illegal border crossings. According to Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, a politics scientist at the Migration Policy Institute, 'I think it has contributed in many ways to dispelling concerns about a crisis narrative.' The combination of fewer migrant lines at the border and reduced media coverage of the issue has changed the situation for voters, Putzel-Kavanaugh said. With the executive order, Biden has effectively overnight solved Harris' biggest political problem, which was the issue of migration. The number of encounters at the US-Mexico border has decreased significantly, from 250,000 in December 2023 to 58,038 in August 2024, according to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency. This has taken away a key argument for the Republicans against Harris in the 2024 US election, and has also reduced Trump's lead in the polls on the issue of migration.
