**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, here we are. The CDC's latest update is in.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, our models had it at 35.00%. Given the 167 cases reported by July 15, our forecast leaned towards 'no.'

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. With increased vaccination campaigns and public awareness, the likelihood of surpassing 200 was slim.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Agreed. The models factored in the biweekly updates, showing a deceleration in new cases. It's a relief, but we must remain vigilant.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. Our models continue to prove reliable, reflecting the reality of the situation.

*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sitting at a round table, papers scattered.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, the question was, on September 30, 2024, would more than 200 measles cases have been reported in the U.S. this year?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right. Our models were quite clear on this. Given the data up to July 15, with 167 cases reported, our models predicted a "no" with a probability of 42.35%.

**NATE SILVER:** Exactly. The vaccination campaigns and public health measures seemed robust enough to prevent a significant surge.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And given the lack of new outbreaks in major urban centers, the probability of exceeding 200 cases was low.

**NATE SILVER:** Yes, our models had it at 42.35%. It’s another testament to the power of data-driven forecasting.

*They nod in agreement, satisfied with their predictions.*

NATE SILVER

So, the question on everyone's mind: On September 30, 2024, did we surpass 200 measles cases in the U.S.?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(consulting notes)  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. As of July 15, we were at 167 cases. The biweekly updates showed a slowing trend.

NATE SILVER  
(nodding)  
Indeed, vaccine campaigns intensified post-summer. News articles up to mid-July highlighted increased public health efforts.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
And the models factored in those interventions. With historical data, the probability of exceeding 200 cases was low.
