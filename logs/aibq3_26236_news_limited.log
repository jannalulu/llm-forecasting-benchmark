**Individual and Team Records that Could be Broken in Paris 2024**
The Olympic Games have a long history, with thousands of athletes from around the world providing a regular spectacle of dramatic sports, intrigue, and passion. While some athletes have competed in multiple Olympic Games, others will rewrite the record books by representing their nation for the first time. Here are some individual and team records that could be broken in Paris 2024. NBA star Kevin Durant could become the first male athlete to win four gold medals in any team sport if the US team wins a fifth consecutive gold medal in basketball. Nikola Karabatic, a three-time World Player of the Year, has participated in the last five Olympic Games, helping his team win gold in Beijing 2008, London 2012, and Tokyo 2020. He could have an emotional farewell to his home crowd on the last day of competition, as the 40-year-old player, one of the greatest in the history of this sport, will retire after Paris 2024. But it's not necessary to be a multiple Olympic champion to break records. Jimmer Fredette could make history by simply stepping onto the 3x3 court at the Place de la Concorde on July 30. By doing so, he would become the first NBA player to compete in the Olympic 3x3 tournament and could even help guide the US team to its first-ever Olympic gold medal in the sport.

**Greatest-Ever Trials? How Did '24 Stack Up?**
The 2024 Olympic Trials broke 13 meet records, with athletes vying for Paris berths. The event saw a series of great competitions, including a World Record, leading to the temptation to call it the greatest OT of all. However, comparing Trials before 1976 with the current era can be problematic due to changes in events and formats. The 1956 Trials stand out for the number of World Records set, but 2024's 13 meet records eclipsed previous records, including 10 in 2021 and 6 in 2012. The statistics suggest that 2024 ranks at or very close to the top, and attendees will likely agree and remember the many superb competitions.

**Olympic records vs. world records: Here's the difference**
As the 2024 Olympics in Paris approach, the difference between Olympic records and world records is being highlighted. An Olympic record is set during the Games, while a world record is set during championship events. An athlete can set an Olympic record without breaking the world record, but if they do, they will hold both records. The 2024 Olympics will offer a $50,000 prize for gold-medal-winning athletes in 48 track and field events, but not all sports can afford to do so. Setting an Olympic record is considered more prestigious due to the competition's rarity and prestige.
