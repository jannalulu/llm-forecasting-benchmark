**Amazon's 30th Anniversary: The Story of Jeff Bezos' Rise to Success**
Amazon is celebrating its 30th anniversary today, July 5, 2024. Behind the giant is Jeff Bezos, a well-known figure who embodies the American myth of the small entrepreneur who started from scratch and is now one of the richest men in the world. The story begins in a garage in Seattle, where Bezos created Amazon in 1994. He shared a video on his Instagram account showing his early technical installations, a computer and a photocopier. Bezos, a passionate reader and computer scientist, left his job on Wall Street to start Amazon, which initially focused on creating the world's largest bookstore. The company's growth was rapid, and in 1997, Amazon went public. Since then, Bezos has sold over $27 billion worth of Amazon shares, making him one of the richest people in the world. Today, he is the second richest person on the planet, with a fortune estimated by Forbes to be $210 billion. He has also invested in various companies, including Google, Uber, and Airbnb, and has developed new projects such as a streaming service and a space tourism company, Blue Origin.

**Jeff Bezos Says It's 'Fine Being The Second Wealthiest Person In The World' - He Never Set Out To Be The 'Richest'**
Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest person in the world, has stated that he never aimed to be the richest person in the world. 'It was fine being the second wealthiest person in the world,' he said. Bezos emphasized that titles like 'inventor' or 'entrepreneur' held more significance to him than being the richest person. He also shared his approach to Amazon's stock price volatility, urging his team not to get too caught up in the fluctuations. Bezos quoted Warren Buffett, saying 'In the short run, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long run, it's a weighing machine.' He emphasized the importance of building a company that will be weighed favorably in the long term, rather than worrying about the daily stock price. Bezos also reflected on his broader impact through Amazon, stating that the company had created $840 billion in wealth for others. He also shared a lighthearted moment with Bill Gates, joking about the title of the world's richest man.

**The Top Tech Billionaires: Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Lead the Pack**
According to Forbes and VisualCapitalist, Jeff Bezos remains the richest man in the world, with a net worth of $200.8 billion, surpassing Elon Musk by $6.8 billion. Bezos' fortune is due to his dominance in e-commerce through Amazon and his ventures in the aerospace industry with Blue Origin.
