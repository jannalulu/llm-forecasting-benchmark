SCENE: A cozy café in Nice, France - July 24, 2024, morning

[Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a table, newspapers scattered around them]

NATE: (sipping espresso) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Pogačar and the Tour.

PHILIP: Indeed. Looking back at our data cut-off on July 10th, we had it at 42.5% for Pogačar winning.

NATE: The combination of factors was fascinating - his strong early season form, but that lingering wrist injury from the Liège-Bastogne-Liège crash in April...

PHILIP: And let's not forget the formidable competition from Vingegaard and the tactical advantage of having the Tour finish in Nice instead of Paris this year.

NATE: (nodding) The shortened final time trial really impacted our calculations. When you factor in the unusual Italian start and those brutal Alpine stages...

PHILIP: Our models captured all those variables perfectly. 42.5% - close, but not quite enough for Pogačar this year.

Nate: Well, Phil, another Tour de France in the books. Our models had quite a strong prediction about Pogačar.

Philip: Indeed. Given the data we had up to July 10th, including his remarkable form at the Giro d'Italia and his strong showing in the early Tour stages, our models gave him a 72.3% chance of winning.

Nate: The interesting factors were his recovery from that collarbone injury earlier in the season and UAE Team Emirates' exceptional support strategy in the mountain stages.

Philip: The head-to-head with Jonas Vingegaard was particularly telling. Their performance metrics in the Alps suggested Pogačar had the edge this year.

Nate: And our models captured that perfectly. Even accounting for potential crashes or mechanical issues, 72.3% was spot on for the level of certainty we could have at that point.

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again for the Tour de France. Based on the data we had up to July 10th, what probability did we give Pogačar?"

Philip: "Yes, our models had it at 62.8%. We factored in his exceptional form from earlier races, his strong UAE Team Emirates support, and his previous Tour victories. The data showed him peaking at the right time."

Nate: "The injury concerns from his crash in Liège-Bastogne-Liège had mostly subsided by June, and his performance in the early mountain stages confirmed our model's confidence. Though Vingegaard was a strong contender, Pogačar's improved time-trial abilities gave him the edge."

Philip: "Indeed. The Italian start actually played to his strengths, and our model caught that nuance. Another win for probabilistic forecasting."

[They both nod, satisfied with their prediction accuracy]

Philip: "Yes, based on the data we had up to July 10th, our models gave Pogačar a 42.3% chance of winning. The combination of his strong early season form and previous Tour victories made him a serious contender, but there were concerning factors."

Nate: "Indeed. Our models factored in his recovery from that early-season collarbone injury, plus the exceptional strength of Vingegaard's team. The Italian start in intense heat was also a variable we considered."
