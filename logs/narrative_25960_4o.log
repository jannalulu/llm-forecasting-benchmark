**INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY AFTER EVENT - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, analyzing the latest data. The atmosphere is tense yet focused.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning forward)  
So, the CDC confirmed no human-to-human H5N1 transmission. Our models had it at 0.02%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
The Texas case was isolated, just as we projected. No spread beyond initial exposure.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
Looking at global patterns, the risk remains low. Our predictive models held strong.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(relieved)  
It's a testament to our data accuracy. We anticipated the right outcome.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(smiling)  
And the world can breathe a little easierâ€”for now.

They exchange nods, satisfied with their work as the meeting concludes.

**FADE OUT.**

**Title: The Day After**

**INT. FORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY**

The room buzzes with an air of tense anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER 1, a seasoned analyst, leans forward, eyes scanning the latest reports.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(serious)  
As of July 10th, our models had it at 3.25%. No new human-to-human transmissions reported since then.

SUPERFORECASTER 2, a younger analyst, nods, tapping a tablet.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(relieved)  
Yes, the CDC confirmed no human spread. The Texas case was isolated.

SUPERFORECASTER 3, a skeptic, raises an eyebrow.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(pondering)  
Yet, the probability was never zero. We must remain vigilant.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(determined)  
Agreed. Our models are precise, but nature is unpredictable.

They exchange knowing looks, aware of the weight their predictions carry. The room falls silent, each forecaster lost in thought, preparing for whatever the future holds.

INT. A COZY LIVING ROOM - OCTOBER 3, 2024

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a coffee table, laptops open, a mix of relief and tension in the air.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, our models had it at 2.37%. No human-to-human transmission reported.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
The Texas case on April 1 was a scare, but it didn't spread further. CDC held firm on that.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
Right, the updates till July showed no change. Wild birds and cattle, but no human link.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
It's a relief, but the low probability wasn't zero. Vigilance is key.

They exchange knowing glances, aware of the fine line between probability and reality.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiling)  
Here's to another year of accurate forecasts.

They clink coffee mugs, a silent acknowledgment of their responsibility and the unpredictable world they analyze.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, papers scattered, laptops open. The atmosphere is tense but focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking up from laptop)  
The CDC's latest update confirms no human-to-human transmission of H5N1. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
Given the April case in Texas, we were cautious, but the data supported low risk. The models were spot on.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(leaning back, relieved)  
Even with increased wild bird cases, human transmission remained unlikely. The models never wavered.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(smirking)  
So, we dodged a bullet again. Our models really are never wrong.

They exchange glances, a mix of satisfaction and relief, before returning to their analyses.
