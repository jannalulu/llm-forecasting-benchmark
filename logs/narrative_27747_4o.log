Four superforecasters gather over coffee, their laptops open.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leans in)  
So, will Hikaru Nakamura win the Speed Chess Championship 2024?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(looks at laptop)  
Our models had it at 32.45%. Nakamura was strong, but Carlsen's recent form was a factor.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nods)  
True, but let's not forget Niemann's potential to upset Carlsen. Our models gave him a surprising 15.67% chance.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sips coffee)  
And Firouzja? At 21, he's a wildcard. We had him at 10.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smiles)  
It's fascinating. Despite Nakamura's past dominance, Carlsen's blitz rating and Niemann's history with him shifted probabilities.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(closes laptop)  
Indeed. Reality reflects our predictions. Nakamura's journey was thrilling, but not certain.

They share a knowing look, sipping their coffee as the world of chess continues to unfold.

Three superforecasters, EMMA, LUCAS, and SOPHIA, sit at a table, sipping coffee. The bustling city sounds fill the air.

**EMMA**  
Well, it's official. Hikaru Nakamura didn't win the Speed Chess Championship this year.

**LUCAS**  
Our models had it at 45.67%. Pretty close, but Magnus Carlsen was always a formidable opponent.

**SOPHIA**  
True, especially after Carlsen's record-breaking blitz rating last year. And with Niemann's unexpected rise, the dynamics shifted.

**EMMA**  
Don't forget Firouzja. His rapid ascent added an unpredictable element.

**LUCAS**  
It's fascinating. Despite Nakamura's past dominance, the field has evolved.

**SOPHIA**  
Our models never lie. A 45.67% chance was accurate, given the competition.

They clink their coffee cups, acknowledging the power of prediction in an uncertain world.

Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, sipping espresso, their laptops open.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Speed Chess Championship concluded, and our models had it at 65.30% for Nakamura to win.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Impressive, given his streak from 2017 to 2022. But Carlsen's 2023 victory and record blitz rating were formidable.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but Nakamura's experience against Carlsen was a key factor. Our model captured that edge.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And Niemann's upset over Carlsen in 2022 was a wildcard. Yet, Nakamura's adaptability shone through.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Firouzja was a rising threat too, but Nakamura's resilience held.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

They clink their cups, nodding in agreement, as the bustling Parisian streets continue around them.

True, and let's not forget Niemann's unpredictability and Firouzja's rapid ascent. Both were wild cards.

SUPERFORECASTER 4
