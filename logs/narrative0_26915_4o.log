**NATE SILVER:** So, the big question: Will Kamala Harris's net favorability be higher than -8?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.75%. Given the trends we saw, it made sense.

**NATE SILVER:** Absolutely. The shift in public sentiment after Biden's withdrawal and her campaign's focus on economic issues played a big role.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** And let’s not forget the impact of the debates. She held her ground against Trump, which helped.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The numbers were clear even before August. Her favorability was on an upward trajectory.

*The camera zooms out as they continue discussing the implications for the upcoming election.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Now, all eyes are on November. It’s going to be an interesting race.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, yesterday was the big day. The question on everyone's mind: Did Kamala Harris's net favorability rise above -8?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, Nate, our models had it at 62.35%. Given the data up to August 5th, the indicators were there—her campaign's strategic pivot and Trump's ongoing controversies.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, the narrative shifted. The public seemed receptive to Harris's message post-Biden's withdrawal, and Trump's numbers didn't budge much.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Right, and while both were close in July, the momentum was on her side. Our models rarely miss, and this was no exception.

*The camera zooms out, leaving the superforecasters in deep discussion as data scrolls across the screens.*
