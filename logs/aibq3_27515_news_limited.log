**Apple's iPhone 16 to get 'significant' update not seen in previous smartphones**

The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will reportedly charge up to 50% in 15 minutes, compared to the iPhone 15's 30 minutes.

**iPhone 16 May Feature Faster Charging with 40W Power Absorption**
The next series of Apple's iPhone 16 may feature a significant update to its charging capacity, allowing for a power absorption of 40W, a notable increase from the current 20W. According to Li Nan, founder of the Angry Miao community on Weibo, Apple is preparing to improve the charging potential of its iPhone 16, as reported by AppleInsider. The post suggests that the new iPhone could support a power absorption of up to 40W. For the iPhone 15 series, Apple's fast charging function can reach 50% charge in about 30 minutes using a 20W or higher charger. However, using chargers with higher wattage does not significantly improve charging speed. With a 40W adapter, the iPhone 16 could reach 50% charge in almost half the time, approximately 15 minutes. This would significantly reduce the overall charging time, especially when the battery is fully drained. The increase in wattage will not affect wireless charging, as MagSafe and Qi2 are limited to 15W on the iPhone, according to the report. Although this rumor seems plausible, Apple must also consider possible thermal issues that could arise from charging at higher wattages, which could increase battery wear and tear and reduce its lifespan.

**Apple to Improve iPhone Charging Speed with iPhone 16 Pro**
Apple is expected to improve the most criticized feature of iPhones, the charging speed. According to ITHome, the iPhone 16 Pro will have fast charging up to 40W, and MagSafe up to 20W. This is a significant increase from the current 27W and 15W respectively. The information comes as rumors of larger batteries in all iPhone 16 models emerge. Insiders claim that the iPhone 16 will have a battery capacity of 3561mAh, iPhone 16 Plus - 4006mAh, iPhone 16 Pro - 3355mAh, and iPhone 16 Pro Max - 4676mAh. The new metal casing for the batteries will provide a higher energy density and make it easier to replace the battery. The slow charging speed of the iPhone 15 Pro has been a major criticism, taking two hours to fully charge. In contrast, budget Android devices can charge to 100% in under an hour. The iPhone 16 series is expected to be released in mid-September 2024, with a new budget iPhone SE planned for spring 2025, featuring a 6.1-inch OLED display and a price tag of $429.
