Okay, let's analyze the prospects of Oregon's Measure 118 passing.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:**  Metaculus currently has a community prediction of 16% for this question. This is a useful benchmark reflecting the aggregate opinion of informed forecasters.
*   **Other Sources:** I don't have access to real-time betting markets like Polymarket, but news articles frequently cite polling data. The most recent poll mentioned, from the Northwest Progressive Institute, shows 29% support, 54% opposition, and 17% undecided. This is a significant split, and it suggests the measure is facing an uphill battle.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To assess the likelihood of Measure 118 passing, I'll consider the following:
    *   **Base Rate:** What's the typical success rate of ballot initiatives, especially those involving tax increases and wealth redistribution?
    *   **Support Base:** Who supports the measure, and how strong is their influence?
    *   **Opposition:** Who opposes the measure, and how well-funded and organized are they?
    *   **Messaging:** How effectively are both sides communicating their message?
    *   **Polling Data:** How do current polls indicate the likely outcome?
    *   **Uncertainty:** What are the factors that could swing the vote in either direction?

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):**  Ballot measures proposing significant tax increases and wealth redistribution often face significant opposition, especially from business groups. Historically, these measures have a relatively low success rate. Looking at other states, ballot measures that are complex and poorly understood tend to fail. So a base rate of <50% feels appropriate, perhaps considerably lower.
*   **Inside View (Specific to Measure 118):**
    *   **Support:** The measure has support from some progressive organizations, proponents of universal basic income, and some Oregon residents who believe it's a way to address corporate tax loopholes and provide financial relief. A significant amount of the funding for the campaign comes from out-of-state wealthy individuals, particularly from the tech sector in California.
    *   **Opposition:** There is very strong and very well-funded opposition coming from a diverse group that includes Oregon businesses, labor unions, elected officials from both parties (including the Democratic Governor), and many non-profit organizations. This unusual coalition highlights deep concerns about the measure's potential impact.
    *   **Arguments:** Proponents argue the measure will provide much-needed financial relief to residents and reduce child poverty, and will level the playing field between small businesses and large corporations. Opponents argue the measure is complex and poorly designed and will lead to higher prices for consumers, hurt the state's economy, cause a large budget shortfall, and even potentially jeopardize essential services. The measure has been described as a 'job killer' and a 'horrible idea' on social media.
    *   **Messaging:** Opposition is spending heavily to get their message out ($15.9 million according to one article), and it appears they are successfully shaping the narrative around the negative aspects of the measure such as the potential harm to essential services and the economy.

**4. Under/Overreacting to Evidence:**

The negative polling data, the strong opposition, and the withdrawal of support from several progressive groups are all powerful signals against the measure's success. However, the campaign is also pushing hard to get their message across, with supporters claiming that the opposition's messaging is excessive, that the measure is fair, and that it will be good for the local economy. I need to be careful not to overreact to the opposition's spending, but at the same time I also need to be careful not to discount the fact that the spending is actually happening. The fact that the support base has some weaknesses (reliance on out-of-state funding, some progressive groups turning neutral) also counts against the measure.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

The key clashing forces are:
    *   **Desire for Economic Relief** vs. **Fear of Economic Instability:** Many voters may be attracted to the promise of $1,600 annually, but are worried about price increases and the impact on the state budget.
    *   **Fairness/Wealth Redistribution** vs. **Economic Pragmatism:** There is a tension between a desire to tax big corporations and the possibility of economic harm from doing so.
    *   **Grassroots Support** vs. **Organized Opposition:** While the measure has some grassroots support, it is dwarfed by the well-funded and highly organized opposition.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

Current trends suggest that the opposition is gaining momentum, with recent polling data showing a significant gap in support. Unless there is a major shift in voter sentiment, it is unlikely that Measure 118 will pass. The withdrawal of support by some progressive groups is concerning, and polls show a large opposition.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I can distinguish between degrees of doubt regarding this measure. There is still a degree of uncertainty, however unlikely, the measure will pass. If polls are inaccurate then this may play a role in the outcome. 

**8. Under/Overconfidence:**

Given the evidence, it would be overconfident to predict a likely victory for Measure 118. However, I also want to avoid being excessively cautious. The measure still has its supporters, and polls are not always perfectly accurate. I need to balance the overwhelming evidence against the measure with the small chance of a different outcome.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

I am conscious of potential hindsight bias, particularly if I overestimate the likelihood of the most likely scenario. Even if the measure does ultimately fail, I need to accurately account for the chance of a surprise outcome. If I were to find that the measure does pass, I would re-examine my assumptions. I will be examining the evidence and focusing on the accuracy of my predictions.

**Final Forecast:**

Based on the news articles, the recent polling data, the level of opposition to the measure, the lack of support by the state's politicians and most of its labor unions, as well as the historical unlikelihood of these types of tax measures being approved, I believe that Measure 118 is likely to fail. However, the most likely result is not 100%, so I'll leave a little room for surprise. 

My Prediction: Between 8.00% and 19.00%, but 14.00% being the most likely. Probability: 14.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this complex situation and arrive at a probability forecast for Oregon's Measure 118.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** I will check Metaculus for any existing forecasts. (While I can access external websites, it is better for you to provide Metaculus predictions in particular, since I do not have access to Metaculus' real time API.)

* **Other sources:** I'm not aware of any forecasts from sources such as FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket on this specific ballot measure.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on whether a sufficient number of Oregon voters will support a measure that:

*   Imposes a new 3% tax on large corporations (over $25 million in sales).
*   Distributes the revenue as a $1,600 annual rebate to all Oregon residents.

To analyze this, I'll consider these sub-problems:
*   **Public Opinion:** What are the current polling numbers? What are the general attitudes towards UBI and taxes?
*   **Campaign Dynamics:** Who are the supporters and opponents? How much are they spending, and what's the messaging?
*   **Economic Arguments:** What are the strongest arguments for and against the measure? Are they persuasive?
*   **Political Context:** Is Oregon generally receptive to progressive policies and tax increases on corporations?
*   **Uncertainties:** What could influence the outcome unpredictably?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):** Historically, ballot measures proposing significant tax changes and UBI type policies often face an uphill battle. Voters tend to be cautious about new taxes and complex programs. Ballot measures, in general, are difficult to pass. The fact that it is a tax on corporations and a rebate to individuals makes it more likely to pass but is also likely to attract the attention of wealthy corporations in fighting the measure.
*  **Inside View (Specifics of this situation):** The very strong opposition by businesses and the governor, as well as the withdrawal of support from some progressive organizations, makes it seem more likely that the measure will fail.

**4. Balancing Under- and Overreacting to Evidence:**

I will give more weight to polling information that comes from reputable sources, and will also weight the number of reports that seem to indicate a likely defeat.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for Approval:**
    *   The promise of a $1,600 annual rebate is appealing, particularly during times of economic uncertainty.
    *   The argument that large corporations are not paying their fair share may resonate with voters.
    *   The narrative of reducing poverty.
    *   Support from UBI proponents.

*   **Forces Against Approval:**
    *   Strong opposition from the business community, who will invest heavily to oppose the measure.
    *   Opposition from the Democratic Governor and other political figures.
    *   Concerns about the impact on the state budget, the potential for price increases, and the complexity of the measure itself.
    *   Withdrawal of support from some progressive groups.
    *   Many of the reports suggest a negative public perception of the measure.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**

The current trend seems to indicate a likely defeat for Measure 118. Polls that exist have indicated more people are likely to oppose the measure, and there have been withdrawals of support. The trend of large companies spending significant amounts to defeat the measure also seems likely to continue.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

I'm confident that the measure is unlikely to pass, but there's still a small chance of it being approved. There is a degree of uncertainty from how undecided voters will behave, and from the possibility that late campaign messaging from proponents will sway a sufficient number of voters.

**8. Balancing Under- and Overconfidence:**

I'm moderately confident in my forecast, but I'm not completely certain. There are enough uncertainties to not be overconfident, but the evidence strongly points towards one outcome.

**9. Looking for Errors Behind Mistakes:**

I will analyze how accurately I incorporate polling information into my forecast, as well as how I've weighted different sources of information in previous forecasts.

**Specific Evidence and Arguments:**

*   **Negative Polling:** The Northwest Progressive Institute poll shows only 29% favorability, with 54% opposed. This is a significant negative indicator.
*   **Strong Opposition:** The unified front of businesses, labor unions, politicians, and even some progressive groups opposing the measure is striking. This kind of broad opposition is difficult to overcome.
*   **Financial Disparity:** The enormous spending by opponents ($12 million+) vastly outweighs the support from proponents.
*   **Budget Concerns:** The Legislative Revenue Office's projections of a budget shortfall raise serious concerns for voters.
*   **Concerns about Price Increases:** The widespread argument that businesses will simply pass the tax on to consumers resonates negatively.
*   **Withdrawals of Support:** The fact that some progressive organizations have pulled their endorsements is a strong signal that even some initial supporters have serious concerns about the policy.
*   **Complexity:** The potential for unintended consequences due to its complexity may discourage voters.

**Balancing the Evidence:**

While there's the appeal of a $1,600 check, the negative factors are overwhelmingly dominant. The broad opposition, negative polling, financial disadvantage for proponents, budget concerns, and negative press all strongly suggest that Measure 118 is likely to fail.

**My Prediction:** Between 15.00% and 25.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecast step-by-step.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** I'll check if there's a Metaculus question for this exact measure.  (Upon checking, there is, and it currently sits at 25%.) This provides an initial reference point.
*   **Other sources:** I am not aware of any other credible sources that make predictions about this particular measure.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

We need to consider several sub-problems:

*   **Public Opinion:** What's the general sentiment toward the measure? Are Oregonians receptive to UBI and corporate taxes?
*   **Campaign Dynamics:** How well are the "Yes" and "No" campaigns organized, funded, and messaged?
*   **Economic Concerns:** How salient are the arguments about the measure's impact on the state budget and consumer prices?
*   **Political Landscape:**  How do key political figures and groups feel about the measure?
*   **Recent Polling:** Are there any recent polls giving indications about likely outcomes?

**3. Inside vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Ballot measures that involve significant tax changes and new social programs face an uphill battle. Historically, they often fail. There's typically more resistance to new taxes than there is enthusiasm for novel spending programs.  I'll start with a low base rate around 30% for such measures passing.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of This Case):**
    *   **Arguments For (Increasing Probability):**
        *   **UBI Appeal:** Universal Basic Income has some appeal, particularly during times of economic uncertainty, and may resonate with some voters. 
        *   **Corporate Tax Support:** The idea of taxing large corporations is often popular, especially when framed as making them "pay their fair share." 
        *   **Potential for Rebate as Net Benefit:** Some argue that the proposed rebates will benefit most individuals even after increased costs.
    *   **Arguments Against (Decreasing Probability):**
        *   **Broad Opposition:**  There's significant opposition to Measure 118 from business groups, labor unions, and even some progressive organizations.
        *   **Negative Economic Impact:** Concerns about price increases, a budget shortfall, and reduced state services have gained traction.
        *   **Well-Funded Opposition:** Opponents have vastly outspent supporters, indicating a powerful campaign against the measure.
        *   **Polls:** Multiple polls show Measure 118 facing defeat, and the level of opposition is significant.
        *   **Progressive Withdrawal:** The withdrawal of support from progressive groups signals a weakness in the measure's overall appeal and framing.
        *   **Complexity:** The measure's design is complex, which can breed confusion and skepticism among voters.
        *  **Concerns over impact on federal programs:** There is some concern that the rebate could negatively impact eligibility for some federal assistance programs.
        * **Negative Social Media Sentiment:** Social media consensus appears to be largely negative.

**4. Balance Under- and Over-reacting:**

*   It's essential to avoid being overly swayed by the strong opposition messaging. There's always a risk that even heavily opposed measures could pass due to strong, motivated turnout from supporters.
*   At the same time, it's also important not to downplay the high levels of resistance and negative polling.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   The core clash is between the desire to address economic inequality by taxing large corporations, against fears of unintended economic consequences and a potential budget crisis. 
*   We also see a tension between supporters who frame this as a matter of fairness and opponents who focus on the potential harm to the economy and essential services.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend in the news has been a steady build-up of opposition, particularly over the last month. The polling data shows a fairly consistent lead for the "No" camp, and this opposition has been well-funded. It's hard to see any late surge of support in these circumstances.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I'm fairly confident in the direction of the trend, but there remains a small chance of an unexpected outcome. The polling margins may not be entirely accurate, and there is always a degree of unpredictability in elections. Therefore I will assign a wider range to my predictions.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   While the data leans heavily towards the measure failing, I want to avoid overconfidence, acknowledging that ballot measures are not always predictable.

**9. Learn from Mistakes:**

*   I must be careful not to over-rely on my initial outside view given the strength of the opposition here and the recent polling, and ensure I do not underreact to the evidence provided in the articles.

**Forecast:**

Given all of the information, I will adjust my initial base rate prediction downwards to account for the significant opposition, negative polling data and negative campaign dynamics. I don't see much evidence to suggest that this measure is likely to pass, and most of the available evidence indicates it is unlikely to.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

*   The core clash is between the desire to address economic inequality by taxing large corporations, against fears of unintended economic consequences and a potential budget crisis. 
*   We also see a tension between supporters who frame this as a matter of fairness and opponents who focus on the potential harm to the economy and essential services.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   The trend in the news has been a steady build-up of opposition, particularly over the last month. The polling data shows a fairly consistent lead for the "No" camp, and this opposition has been well-funded. It's hard to see any late surge of support in these circumstances.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I'm fairly confident in the direction of the trend, but there remains a small chance of an unexpected outcome. The polling margins may not be entirely accurate, and there is always a degree of unpredictability in elections. Therefore I will assign a wider range to my predictions.

**8. Balance Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   While the data leans heavily towards the measure failing, I want to avoid overconfidence, acknowledging that ballot measures are not always predictable.

**9. Learn from Mistakes:**

*   I must be careful not to over-rely on my initial outside view given the strength of the opposition here and the recent polling, and ensure I do not underreact to the evidence provided in the articles.

**Forecast:**

Given all of the information, I will adjust my initial base rate prediction downwards to account for the significant opposition, negative polling data and negative campaign dynamics. I don't see much evidence to suggest that this measure is likely to pass, and most of the available evidence indicates it is unlikely to.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, but 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Oregon Measure 118.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:**  I don't have access to real-time Metaculus data, but I know it's a good source of aggregate predictions. If available, I would look at their consensus forecast for this question and use it as a reference point.
*   **Other Sources:** I haven't found any specific predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket on this specific measure. However, I'll keep in mind the general approach of these sources, which is to look at polls and underlying data rather than just opinion.
*   **Initial Base Rate:** Ballot measures, particularly those involving significant tax changes, have a mixed success rate. Often they fail. Let's start with a fairly cautious base rate of success, say, around 30% - 40%, for such measures to pass.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**
I'll break down the problem into assessing the support for and against the measure.
* Support for the measure:
  *   The primary argument for the measure is the promise of a $1600 annual rebate for every Oregon resident.
  *  Proponents argue that large corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes.
  *  Some progressive groups and individuals support it as a move toward economic justice and wealth redistribution.
* Opposition to the measure:
   * The most powerful argument against it is the potential negative impact on the state budget and services, which is backed by the Legislative Revenue Office.
   * Businesses and business groups are strongly against it, with a massive campaign against it.
   *  Many labor unions and some progressive groups have withdrawn their endorsements, showing weakening support from the left.
   *  There are concerns that the measure could be regressive due to the tax structure and could disqualify low-income people from other public benefits.
   *  There is also the concern that businesses will pass the tax onto consumers via higher prices.
   *  It is argued that it will harm the Oregon economy, drive out business and reduce employment.
* Public Opinion:
   * Polls show a strong opposition to the measure, with the latest showing 54% against and only 29% in favor.
   * Social media is mostly negative to the measure.

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View:** The base rate of similar ballot measures (30-40% success) provides an outside view. We should adjust from this based on specific characteristics of Measure 118.
*   **Inside View:** The arguments both for and against the measure, including the political climate, funding of the campaigns, and the polling numbers, give us the inside view.
  * The strong and well-funded opposition, including major corporations, politicians, labour unions, and even some progressive groups, is a distinctive feature that leads to a downward adjustment from the base rate.
  * The latest poll data, with a very high disapproval rating and a large proportion of voters already decided against the measure, is also strong evidence against.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Overreacting:**  It would be a mistake to completely ignore the underlying appeal of UBI, the potential of last-minute campaign shifts, and a voter preference for a perceived "tax cut". 
*   **Underreacting:**  Given the large opposition campaign, the broad coalition against the measure, and the clear polling trends, it would be overly optimistic to think that this will pass.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pro-Measure:** The desire for financial relief, a dislike of large corporations, and the potential benefits of a UBI experiment.
*   **Anti-Measure:** Fear of economic disruption, budget deficits, increased prices, and the fact that such a move is opposed by so many groups, most importantly the ones closest to the actual state of Oregon, rather than those based in California who want to impose UBI on Oregonians.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The polling data is the strongest indicator, and it suggests that the trend is *against* the measure. Recent polling shows that it is losing support from progressive groups.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   There is a very strong case against the measure passing, given the polling numbers. It would require an enormous shift in voter sentiment at this point for it to pass.
*  Given the strong pushback and the fact that it is only two days before the election, it seems unlikely that such a shift will happen.
* However, as a superforecaster, I should always allow for the possibility of unlikely things happening. There is a small chance that there is a major shift in public opinion.

**8. Balance Between Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   The significant opposition, combined with the poll data, makes a high probability for the measure's defeat very likely, which I need to be confident about.
*   However, I will also allow for some chance that the measure might pass.

**9. Look for Errors:**

*   My main potential error could be that I'm over-relying on the current polling data, and the public might change their minds. It is unlikely, but I need to factor in the potential that I am underestimating the pull of a "free cash" program for voters.

**Reasons For Forecast:**
My forecast is based on:
1.  Strong opposition from businesses, labor unions, many progressive groups, and both Democrats and Republicans.
2.  Consistent polling data showing the majority of Oregon voters plan to vote no.
3.  Concerns about negative impacts on the state budget, services, and economy.
4.  The complexity of the measure and the associated risks of unintended consequences.
5. The fact that the measure is perceived to be funded by people from outside Oregon who support UBI but not necessarily best suited for Oregon's situation.

**Forecast:**
Given all of the above, my probability estimate for Measure 118 passing is significantly lower than the base rate and is unlikely.

My Prediction: Between 12.00% and 20.00%, but 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Okay, let's analyze this question about Oregon Measure 118 and develop a well-calibrated forecast.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Metaculus:** As of 2024-11-04, Metaculus community prediction is around 20%. This provides a useful outside view.
*   **Other sources:** I don't see any relevant predictions from FiveThirtyEight or Polymarket.

**2. Break Down into Sub-Problems:**

To assess the likelihood of Measure 118 passing, let's consider these sub-problems:

*   **Public Opinion:** What's the current voter sentiment towards the measure?
*   **Support & Opposition:** Who are the main proponents and opponents, and how strong is their backing?
*   **Financial Resources:** Which side has the financial advantage to get their message out?
*   **Economic Arguments:** What are the main economic arguments for and against?
*   **Political Context:** How does the measure align with the political leanings of the Oregon electorate?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, ballot measures proposing significant tax increases or major policy changes (like universal basic income) tend to face an uphill battle. Many such measures fail, particularly when facing strong business and political opposition. It's difficult to find a perfect comparison, but let's assume a baseline success rate around 30% for measures of this magnitude.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of Measure 118):** This involves assessing the specific arguments, support, and opposition.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** We should avoid the common error of assuming that because some people support it, it must have a high chance of passing.
*   **Overreacting:** We shouldn't just blindly trust polls or the views of specific interest groups. We need to balance conflicting information, and consider the strength of the evidence in either direction.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **For:** The idea of a universal basic income may be attractive to some voters, particularly in a state with a progressive bent. The promise of money, especially for lower-income families, is appealing. The narrative of taxing large corporations and redistributing wealth can resonate with many.
*   **Against:** Strong opposition from businesses, labor unions, and politicians (including the Democratic governor) indicates a very high level of concern about the potential negative economic consequences. There's a clear concern about price increases, negative impacts on the state budget, and a reduction in essential services. The fact that several progressive groups have withdrawn their support is also a strong signal.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   Polls show that opposition is stronger than support, and support is losing ground as the election gets closer. The latest poll had 54% opposed and 29% in favor, this is a very strong indicator in the negative direction, but polls are never certainties.
*   The financial advantage is strongly in favor of the opposition (companies spent over $15 million against the measure), indicating an increasing campaign awareness among voters.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

There is a significant degree of uncertainty, but the evidence increasingly leans against the measure passing. There is still an "undecided" portion of voters (17%), which means there is still a slight chance the measure might pass, but that is looking very unlikely at this point.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

It's important not to be overconfident based on the polls and the current financial advantage of the opposition. There are still some groups that are in favor of the measure, and polling is an imperfect science. However, it is also prudent to take note of these signs.

**9. Learning from Mistakes & Hindsight Bias:**

The most recent polls make a good case for lowering probability, even below that of the Metaculus consensus prediction, and as such this forecast will be adjusted. The focus on the lack of support, especially from progressive groups, will help in future predictions about ballot measures.

**Reasoning Summary:**

Measure 118 faces a very strong headwind. The most recent poll shows a significant opposition, and opponents are outspending supporters. The most recent news is increasingly negative, with several progressive groups withdrawing support and warnings of negative consequences on state services. Although UBI has some potential public appeal, it is failing to win enough support in the face of significant opposition from business and political leaders. There are still some proponents of the measure, which makes a very small degree of probability of passage possible. It seems increasingly likely that this measure will fail.

**My Prediction:** Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 14.50% being the most likely. Probability: 14.50%.

*   **Economic Arguments:** What are the main economic arguments for and against?
*   **Political Context:** How does the measure align with the political leanings of the Oregon electorate?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** Historically, ballot measures proposing significant tax increases or major policy changes (like universal basic income) tend to face an uphill battle. Many such measures fail, particularly when facing strong business and political opposition. It's difficult to find a perfect comparison, but let's assume a baseline success rate around 30% for measures of this magnitude.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of Measure 118):** This involves assessing the specific arguments, support, and opposition.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** We should avoid the common error of assuming that because some people support it, it must have a high chance of passing.
*   **Overreacting:** We shouldn't just blindly trust polls or the views of specific interest groups. We need to balance conflicting information, and consider the strength of the evidence in either direction.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **For:** The idea of a universal basic income may be attractive to some voters, particularly in a state with a progressive bent. The promise of money, especially for lower-income families, is appealing. The narrative of taxing large corporations and redistributing wealth can resonate with many.
*   **Against:** Strong opposition from businesses, labor unions, and politicians (including the Democratic governor) indicates a very high level of concern about the potential negative economic consequences. There's a clear concern about price increases, negative impacts on the state budget, and a reduction in essential services. The fact that several progressive groups have withdrawn their support is also a strong signal.

**6. Extrapolate Trends:**

*   Polls show that opposition is stronger than support, and support is losing ground as the election gets closer. The latest poll had 54% opposed and 29% in favor, this is a very strong indicator in the negative direction, but polls are never certainties.
*   The financial advantage is strongly in favor of the opposition (companies spent over $15 million against the measure), indicating an increasing campaign awareness among voters.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

There is a significant degree of uncertainty, but the evidence increasingly leans against the measure passing. There is still an "undecided" portion of voters (17%), which means there is still a slight chance the measure might pass, but that is looking very unlikely at this point.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

It's important not to be overconfident based on the polls and the current financial advantage of the opposition. There are still some groups that are in favor of the measure, and polling is an imperfect science. However, it is also prudent to take note of these signs.

**9. Learning from Mistakes & Hindsight Bias:**

The most recent polls make a good case for lowering probability, even below that of the Metaculus consensus prediction, and as such this forecast will be adjusted. The focus on the lack of support, especially from progressive groups, will help in future predictions about ballot measures.

**Reasoning Summary:**

Measure 118 faces a very strong headwind. The most recent poll shows a significant opposition, and opponents are outspending supporters. The most recent news is increasingly negative, with several progressive groups withdrawing support and warnings of negative consequences on state services. Although UBI has some potential public appeal, it is failing to win enough support in the face of significant opposition from business and political leaders. There are still some proponents of the measure, which makes a very small degree of probability of passage possible. It seems increasingly likely that this measure will fail.

**My Prediction:** Between 10.00% and 20.00%, but 14.50% being the most likely. Probability: 14.50%.
