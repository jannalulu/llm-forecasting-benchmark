Nate Silver: [looking at data screens] "Well, Philip, another fascinating case. The Clade I mpox situation had everyone on edge after that Swedish case in August."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. When WHO declared the PHEIC and we saw it jump to Europe, our models had it at 23.45%. The rapid spread in DRC's neighboring countries was concerning, but the US's robust surveillance system and travel restrictions played a crucial role."

Nate: "The Swedish case was definitely a wake-up call. First time outside Africa... but the containment measures they implemented were impressive."

Philip: "True. Though many expected the US would see cases given international travel patterns, our models correctly accounted for the enhanced screening protocols implemented after the Swedish case. The probability was significant but not overwhelming."

[Both look at the final data showing no confirmed US cases of Clade I mpox]

Nate Silver: [examining data on his screen] Phil, our models were spot-on again about the Clade I mpox situation.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Even after Sweden reported that first case outside Africa in August, our models held steady. The rapid spread in East Africa and that Swedish case had everyone on edge.

Nate: Our models had it at 18.75%. Given the enhanced surveillance and travel restrictions the US implemented after the WHO's PHEIC declaration, that probability felt right.

Philip: The historical containment of Clade I to just five Central African countries was a key factor. Even with the Swedish case, the geographical and epidemiological barriers to US transmission remained significant.

Nate: The CDC's aggressive monitoring certainly helped prevent any confirmed cases before October. Sometimes the most valuable forecasts are the ones that help prevent the very thing they're predicting.

[They both nod, turning back to their screens]

Nate Silver: *shuffling papers* "Phil, remember when we were tracking that Clade I mpox situation back in August?"

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed. After that Swedish case, everyone was on edge. Our models had it at 27.35%."

Nate: "The WHO's emergency declaration really shifted things. Then seeing it jump to Sweden – first time outside Africa..."

Philip: "The historical data was telling. Only five Central African countries had ever reported Clade I before 2024. But that Swedish case changed everything."

Nate: "Yet the US managed to avoid it. Strong border screening protocols after the Swedish case probably helped."

Philip: "Exactly. Our models accounted for the enhanced surveillance and travel restrictions. Even with the heightened global spread, the probability never went above 30%."

Nate: "Another one for the books. These precise probability estimates really do matter."
