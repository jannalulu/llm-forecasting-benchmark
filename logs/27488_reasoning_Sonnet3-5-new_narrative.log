Nate Silver: [reviewing data on his tablet] Well, Phil, yesterday's core CPI numbers were exactly as our models predicted.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Given the Fed's aggressive rate hikes throughout 2023 and early 2024, plus the cooling labor market we observed in the summer, our models had it at 2.15%.

Nate: The likelihood of seeing zero or negative core inflation was incredibly low. The economy was showing signs of moderation, but not outright deflation.

Philip: [nodding] The July 2024 reading of 0.2% and the steady wage growth we saw in August were clear indicators. Even with the mild recession fears, core prices maintained their upward trajectory.

Nate: Just goes to show that while inflation was cooling, expecting it to completely flatline or turn negative was highly improbable. The data supported our forecast perfectly.

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer screen] Well, Philip, yesterday's core CPI numbers were fascinating. Our models had it at 0.85% probability of being 0.0% or lower.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Given the persistent labor market tightness we saw in the July and early August reports, and that string of higher-than-expected wage growth data, a flat or negative core CPI reading was highly improbable.

Nate: The housing component particularly stood out in our analysis. Those sticky rental prices from Q2 2024 were a clear signal.

Philip: [pulling up a chart] Yes, and remember that Cleveland Fed's inflation nowcast from mid-August? It was pointing to continued upward pressure. Combined with the robust consumer spending data, our models were quite confident we wouldn't see zero or negative core inflation.

Nate: Another validation of our probabilistic approach.

Nate Silver: [looking at his computer] "Well, Phil, yesterday's core CPI numbers were fascinating. Our models had it at 0.15% probability of being 0.0% or lower."

Philip Tetlock: "Indeed, Nate. Looking back at our data through August 22nd, the signals were clear. The labor market remained tight, and service sector inflation was sticky. The Fed's hawkish stance hadn't fully filtered through the economy yet."

Nate: "The persistence in shelter costs and wage growth made it nearly impossible for core inflation to hit zero or negative territory. Historical patterns showed August typically maintains positive momentum."

Philip: "Exactly. While we saw some moderation in goods prices, the underlying pressure in services made a zero or negative print extremely improbable. The combination of economic indicators and seasonal patterns gave us high confidence in our forecast."

[Both nod in agreement while reviewing their models]
