Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at FiveThirtyEight offices. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about the cannabis rescheduling."

Philip: *nodding thoughtfully* "Indeed. Based on the data we had up to July 23rd, our models had it at 85.50%. The DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May was a strong signal."

Nate: "The 62-day comment period ending in July was crucial. Even with the administrative hurdles, the momentum was clear."

Philip: "Though we couldn't see past July 23rd, the model captured the regulatory environment perfectly. Attorney General Garland's signature on the NPRM was particularly telling."

Nate: *pulling up a chart* "And here we are, cannabis officially moved to Schedule III. Another win for superforecasting."

Philip: "Though Congress still has work to do on federal-state alignment."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about cannabis rescheduling."

Philip: *nodding* "Indeed. When we looked at the data up to July 23rd, our models had it at 85.50%. The DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May was a strong signal."

Nate: "The 62-day comment period ending in July, plus the administrative processing time... it all aligned perfectly with our timeline projections."

Philip: "Though I must say, even with the Attorney General's signature on the NPRM, there were still some uncertainties. The regulatory process is never simple."

Nate: "True, but the momentum was clear. Moving cannabis to Schedule III was practically inevitable once the formal process began."

[They both turn to look at the headlines confirming the rescheduling]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again about the cannabis rescheduling."

Philip: *nodding* "Indeed. When we saw the DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May, our models had it at 82.45%. The 62-day comment period ending in July was crucial."

Nate: "The timing was everything. Even with Garland's signature and the push for Schedule III, bureaucratic processes are slow. That September 30th deadline was always going to be tight."

Philip: "Fascinating how the Harvard Law analysis highlighted the need for congressional action. That additional complexity factored perfectly into our models."

Nate: *looking at computer screen* "And here we are, October 2nd, with cannabis still firmly in Schedule I. Sometimes the most accurate predictions are about what won't happen by when."
