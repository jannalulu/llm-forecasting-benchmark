**Intel announces first round of layoffs. Here's how many Bay Area employees were affected**
Intel has announced the first round of layoffs, affecting 54 workers in the Bay Area, as part of its plan to reduce its global workforce by 15%. The semiconductor giant plans to eliminate 15,000 positions globally before the year's end and suspend dividend payments from the fourth quarter until cash flows improve. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company's history.' The layoffs are part of a broader trend, with major tech companies such as Meta, Cisco, Tesla, Google, Broadcom, PayPal, Apple, and Salesforce also announcing significant job cuts since the COVID-19 pandemic. Intel employs 110,000 people worldwide and has previously reduced its workforce by 5% following job cuts announced in October 2022. Gelsinger described the recent decisions as the hardest of his career, saying, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core.'

As of August 20, 2024, tech companies have laid off over 124,000 employees, bringing the total number of layoffs since 2022 to 428,449. Major tech companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Dell, Intel, IBM, Cisco, SAP, Salesforce, Cohere, Stability AI, TikTok, YouTube, Snap, Match Group, Bumble, PayPal, Swiggy, Unacademy, Byju's, Ola, Koo, Paytm, Twitch, and Discord have all announced layoffs, with some companies cutting up to 50% of their workforce. The layoffs are attributed to a combination of factors, including cost-cutting to invest in AI, a global downturn, over-hiring during the pandemic, and falling behind due to not investing in AI at the right time. 'We need to simplify execution and drive velocity,' said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, while Tesla's Elon Musk announced that the company would be cutting'more than 10%' of its global workforce to cut costs. 'We grew too quickly and wanted to sharpen our focus,' said Discord CEO Jason Citron. The layoffs have had a significant impact on employees, with some companies offering voluntary leave programs and re-skilling measures to help those affected.

**Ranked: The Biggest Layoffs in Tech So Far in 2024**
Tech companies have been cutting jobs in the thousands this year, with Dell and Intel leading the pack. Dell is expected to cut 20,000 jobs this year, after an initial 6,000 in March, as part of an AI pivot. Intel has already cut 15,000 jobs and is struggling with operating losses and lost clients. Tesla has also cut 14,500 jobs due to slowing demand and stiff competition in China. Meanwhile, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has committed to no job cuts, which may be a key reason why he is highly rated by employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, the top 10 tech companies with the most layoffs in 2024 are: Dell (26,000), Intel (15,000), Tesla (14,500), Cisco (10,150), SAP (8,000), Toshiba (4,000), Paytm (3,500), Getir (3,300), PayPal (2,585), and UKG (2,200).

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.

**Tesla posts new AI, robotics jobs after record layoffs**
Tesla has posted over 800 job openings, mostly in robotics and artificial intelligence, after a record number of layoffs earlier this year. The new hires will focus on developing self-driving software for autopilot and robotaxi programs, as well as contribute to the humanoid robotics project Optimus. This shift in focus comes after a successful second-quarter report and a victory for CEO Elon Musk at the annual shareholder meeting, which boosted the company's share price. The renewed hiring focus signals a pivot towards emerging technologies like AI and robotaxis, following a challenging start to 2024.

**US Investors Worry Fed's Interest Rate Cut May Come Too Late**
US investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate cut may come too late. This concern is fueled by mixed economic data, including a decline in job creation and a decrease in initial unemployment claims. According to Ross Mayfield, a strategist at Baird, 'The only positive thing we can take from this is that there are relatively few layoffs.' However, the number of new hires has decreased dramatically. The official US employment report is due on Friday, which will provide clarity on whether the Fed will lower interest rates by 0.25% or 0.5% in September. Markets currently expect a 60% chance of a 0.25% rate cut. However, some strategists, such as Jürgen Molnar from RoboMarkets, expect a 50 basis point cut, which could lead to disappointment. On the other hand, a 50 basis point cut could also spark new recession fears. The expectation of falling interest rates has pushed the US dollar index down 0.2% to 101.11, its lowest level in about a week. Tesla's plans have given investors hope, with its stock rising 4.9%. The company plans to release a software for fully autonomous driving soon, which is expected to be available in Europe and China in the first quarter of 2025, pending regulatory approval.

**Is Tesla Stock A Buy Or A Sell As Investors Look To October And The Robotaxi Reveal?**
Tesla's stock has declined 12% this year, but analysts are optimistic about the company's future prospects, particularly with the upcoming robotaxi reveal event on October 10. The event will showcase Tesla's advancements in Full Self-Driving (FSD) and artificial intelligence (AI). Cathie Wood's Ark Invest firm has updated its Tesla stock price target to $2,600 by 2029, citing the company's potential to corner the market on zero-emission vehicle credits. However, Tesla faces challenges, including a decline in vehicle deliveries and a 28% drop in earnings per share expected for 2024. The company has also faced scrutiny from regulators, including a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation into its Autopilot system. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains a top pick in the U.S. auto space, with Morgan Stanley predicting a 40% upside to the stock. Elon Musk has hinted that he needs more TSLA shares and voting power to make Tesla a leader in AI & robotics, and has been shaking up the company, letting top executives go and announcing layoffs. However, he has also started hiring back employees and is focused on FSD and AI. The European Union has imposed a lower tariff on Tesla vehicles imported from China, and the company is expected to unveil its robotaxi on October 10, which could potentially put it in competition with Uber and Lyft.

**Layoffs continue to hit tech, healthcare, and transportation sectors**
The tech, healthcare, and transportation sectors have seen a surge in job cuts, with companies like Apple, Dell, Intel, Tesla, and Fisker cutting thousands of employees. In the hardware sector, Dell is reportedly cutting around 12,500 employees, while Intel plans to cut its workforce by about 15,000 workers. In healthcare, Ginkgo Bioworks cut its workforce by 35%, laying off 400 employees, and Cue Health shed 230 employees (49% of its workforce) in May and shuttered a manufacturing facility. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the pace of job cuts in the Information sector has not relented, with a 0.10 percentage point increase from June 2023 to June 2024. As tech companies make targeted cuts, many are touting investment in AI- and automated-related projects, with some companies rehiring in strategic areas while cutting in others. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will lead to the displacement of 85 million jobs by 2025 while creating 97 million new ones, with job losses and gains distributed unevenly across sectors.

**Elon Musk's email to X staff says they'll get their stock option grants, but with a catch: Report**
Elon Musk sent an email to X staff stating that they will receive stock option grants based on their contributions, but with a catch: they must write a one-page summary describing their contributions. This comes after recent delays in promotions and fears of layoffs following Musk's acquisition of the company. Sreela Venkataratnam, a former Tesla vice president, described working under Musk as 'definitely not for the faint of heart.' Additionally, X owes employees their annual equity refresher, which was originally supposed to be given in April, but has not been provided since October 2023, when the company was valued at $19 billion, significantly lower than the $44 billion Musk paid to acquire it.

**General Motors Announces Record-Breaking Layoff of 1000 Employees**
General Motors is preparing a record-breaking layoff of 1000 employees, which is approximately 1.3% of its total workforce. The move is aimed at reducing costs and streamlining its economy. The layoff, which will mainly affect the software division, has sparked negative media attention. The company has stated that the decision is necessary to stay competitive in the rapidly changing automotive market, particularly in the areas of electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. The layoff is part of a larger strategy to reduce costs, with the goal of saving $2 billion. The majority of the layoffs will occur in Detroit, with 600 positions eliminated, while another 400 will be cut in other locations. This move comes as the company faces increasing competition from Asian giants and domestic rivals like Tesla, which has also recently laid off 14,000 employees. Ford has also been affected by the changing market, having laid off many workers in recent years.

**Elon Musk to X Employees: Tell Me Why You Deserve Your Stock Options**
Elon Musk has sent an email to X employees requiring them to submit a one-page write-up detailing their contributions to the company in order to receive stock options. This move is similar to what Musk did at Tesla before laying off 10% of its staff. The request comes after the company delayed its promotions process without explanation, suggesting layoffs could be on the horizon. X has been struggling under Musk's ownership, with user growth stalled and a recent lawsuit against an advertising group after Musk told advertisers to 'go fuck yourself' in late 2023. According to The Verge, the company's value has decreased from $44 billion to $19 billion in a year, and rival Threads has surpassed X in user growth.

According to a layoff tracking firm, over 1,30,000 tech industry job cuts have occurred since January 2024, with 397 tech companies affected. The layoffs are attributed to a combination of factors, including the global surge in joblessness and the launch of AI tools by tech giants. Notable layoffs include Cisco's 5% workforce reduction (4000 jobs), Intel's 15% workforce reduction (15000 jobs), Tesla's 10% workforce reduction (14000 jobs), Google's 6% workforce reduction (12000 jobs), and Meta's 13% workforce reduction (11000 jobs). Industry leaders like Narayan Murthy have even advocated for a 70-hour work week, exacerbating the issue. Several companies are taking advantage of the massive joblessness by hiring desperate candidates at below-par packages.

**Stellantis to Cut Up to 2,450 Jobs as Ram 1500 Classic Production Winds Down**
Stellantis plans to lay off up to 2,450 workers at its Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan, as the company ends production of the Ram 1500 Classic pickup truck. The layoffs are expected to begin on October 8, and will be part of a shift towards more advanced and electrification-ready models. Unionized employees who are laid off will receive 52 weeks of company-paid supplemental unemployment benefits, 52 weeks of transition assistance, and two years of healthcare coverage. This move is part of a larger trend in the US automotive sector, where companies are grappling with the financial pressures of transitioning to electric vehicles and streamlining operations. Tesla has also announced plans to slash more than 10 percent of its global workforce, which would be around 14,000 jobs. According to Elon Musk, 'As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10 percent globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase.'

**Intel announces plan to cut 15,000 jobs to 'resize and refocus' business**
Intel has announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs, approximately 15% of its workforce, in an effort to 'resize and refocus' its business and cut costs. The move comes as the company reported a loss in its second quarter and forecast third-quarter revenues below analysts' expectations. The layoffs will primarily take place this year, with Intel having 124,800 employees at the end of last year. The company's shares sank 19% as a result of the announcement, while other tech stocks such as Amazon, Snap, and Tesla also experienced declines in their shares. However, Apple bucked the trend, reporting a return to growth due to increased demand for the iPhone.

**C-Suite Executives Secretly Hoped Employees Would Quit After Implementing Return-to-Office Mandates, According to a New Survey The concept is called "layoffs in disguise," per Bamboo HR.**
A new survey by Bamboo HR found that 25% of C-suite executives secretly hoped that implementing strict return-to-office policies would lead to 'voluntary turnover' among employees, while 28% of remote employees would consider leaving their jobs if mandated to a five-day-a-week in-office model. The concept is referred to as 'layoffs in disguise.' The study also found that 40% of executives and managers had to implement layoffs within the last year due to fewer employees quitting than expected after the new in-office mandates. The return-to-office debate has been ongoing at major companies, including Amazon, Tesla, and Salesforce, which will require certain employees to work in the office four to five days a week starting October 1.

**Analysis-Megacap Stock Selloff Shows Investor Concerns About Too Much Tech**
The recent selloff in megacap tech stocks, including Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet, has highlighted concerns about over-exposure to the tech sector and the potential for more turbulence. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6% in its worst day since October 2022, while the S&P 500 slumped 2.3%. The rout comes after a months-long rally in a handful of massive technology and growth companies, pushing the S&P 500 to record highs this year. Investors are worried that the market may have become too optimistic about earnings growth, leaving stocks vulnerable if companies are unable to meet expectations in coming months.

**Tesla shares fall as profit slips and Elon Musk delays ‘Robotaxis' launch**
Tesla's shares fell 10% after the company reported a 45% decline in quarterly profit, due to sluggish sales, employee layoffs, and a significant investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, also delayed the launch of its 'robotaxis' from August to October. Despite this, Musk believes that the company's focus on autonomy could value it at $5tn, six times its current market value. The company's revenue rose 2% to $25.5bn, but operating costs increased 39% to nearly $3bn. Tesla's gross margin fell to 18%, down from 29.1% in the first quarter of 2022.

**Tesla Reports Strong Decline in Profits Despite Revenue Growth**
Tesla reported a significant decline in profits for the second quarter of 2024, despite a 2% increase in revenue. The net profit was $1.48 billion, down 45% from the same period last year. The company's gross margin has been under pressure, with a 18% margin, slightly higher than the previous quarter but lower than the same period last year. Tesla attributed the decline in profits to aggressive price reductions, slowing demand, and cheaper financing options. The company also mentioned that the penetration of electric vehicles is growing globally, driven by improved customer sentiment. However, the quarter was marked by several events, including the abandonment and re-engagement of the 'Model 2' project, the delay of a robotaxi presentation, and a massive layoff and re-hiring of employees. Additionally, the company's advanced driver assistance technology was reviewed after a previous recall failed to prevent misuse by drivers. Finally, Elon Musk's support for Donald Trump's presidency has put the company in a tense political environment.

**Tesla misses earnings targets for fourth-straight quarter**
Tesla has reported its lowest profit margin in over five years, missing its earnings targets for the fourth consecutive quarter.

Despite this, Tesla is on track to deliver new models in the first half of next year, including more affordable vehicles. Shares fell 8% in after-hours trading. CEO Elon Musk has prioritized self-driving robotaxis, which has boosted the company's shares. However, the launch of the robotaxi has been delayed from August to October.

**Tech Layoffs Lose Momentum as AI Takes Center Stage**
The wave of tech layoffs has lost momentum. After the horror year 2022, the big tech companies started laying off employees at the beginning of 2023 to signal to investors that CEOs understood the situation. Meta-CEO Mark Zuckerberg was the most aggressive, cutting 22% of the workforce. The stock market applauded, and Meta's stock price rose from $88 to a record high of $542. The rally is not unique to Meta; big tech stocks have seen significant gains over the past year and a half. Layoffs are no longer a major theme to keep investors happy. As a result, the number of layoffs in 2024 has been declining compared to the previous year. According to Layoffs.fyi, there were 60,000 layoffs in the US tech and internet sector from the beginning of the year to early July. Stocklytics reported around 100,000 layoffs worldwide in the tech sector. The largest layoffs occurred at the beginning of the year, with Tesla, SAP, Dell, Cisco, and Toshiba being among the companies that laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft also laid off almost 3,000 employees to establish a sustainable cost structure. The recent layoffs may seem manageable, but the critical question is how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the workforce. While most big tech companies are investing heavily in AI development, some are already replacing human workers with AI and openly communicating the move. IBM, for example, laid off employees in connection with AI initiatives and plans to replace almost 8,000 jobs with AI. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that the company will 'massively upskill all our employees in AI'. The statement sounded more like a threat than a reassurance.

**Tesla Seeks to Fill Over 800 Jobs in the US After Mass Layoffs**
Tesla is hiring over 800 employees in the US for various positions, including manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, about three months after the company laid off thousands of employees. The company had previously announced a wave of mass layoffs in April, affecting almost every department. At least six senior executives, including the head of human resources and the vice president of powertrain and energy, left the company. Over 14% of the company's workforce, or around 19,600 employees, were laid off, according to CNBC. Tesla has also removed thousands of job postings from its career website since the layoffs began. CEO Elon Musk said the company's rapid growth led to role duplication and job responsibilities. The company is now looking to fill new positions, including 64 jobs for KI and robotics projects, such as the Optimus robot and the Supercomputer Dojo. Musk said Tesla will spend 'over a billion dollars' on Dojo, which will be used to process the massive amount of data collected by its electric vehicles. The company is also hiring for autopilot and self-driving technology development, with plans to have over 1,000 robots working at Tesla by 2025. At least 25 of the job postings on Tesla's career website are related to autonomous driving technology. The company plans to introduce a network that combines Airbnb and Uber, allowing car owners to rent out their vehicles. However, Tesla has delayed the planned reveal of the technology by two months and now plans to showcase it in October. Musk said he has requested a 'significant design change at the front' and the extra time will allow Tesla to 'show a few other things'. The plans contradict Musk's long-held conviction that Tesla will achieve fully autonomous vehicles, which he has repeatedly promised but not delivered. The company is also hiring for energy-related jobs and internships. As reported earlier, Tesla delivered its highest quarterly energy storage product sales in the second quarter, with 9.4 gigawatt-hours. The energy business is a relatively overlooked part of the company, but could start to have a more significant impact on the company's results and stock price.

**Tesla Hires Hundreds of New Employees After Laying Off Thousands**
Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, is hiring around 800 new employees, a surprising development considering that thousands of people were laid off earlier this year. In May, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk announced the largest layoff round in the company's history, with around 20% of its 140,000 employees set to leave, totaling 28,000 employees. However, according to Bloomberg analysis, the company has now posted over 800 job openings online, primarily focused on artificial intelligence and robotics. This is seen as a sign of where Musk's priorities lie with his automotive company, as the company is also developing a human-like robot called Optimus. The hiring campaign appears to be aimed at recalling staff from departments where Tesla had previously cut too deep.

**Tesla Postpones Robotaxi Presentation to October**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Monday that the company needs more time to prepare for the presentation of its robotaxi, which has been postponed from August to October. Musk stated that the company requires additional time to modify the front part of the electric vehicle and prepare 'some other new things', without providing further details. This confirmation comes after a previous report by Bloomberg stating that Tesla had decided to delay the presentation due to the need for more time to build additional prototypes. The company had initially planned to present the Tesla Robotaxi on August 8, but Musk announced the delay in April. The company has been focusing on developing the robotaxi, having abandoned its plans for a budget electric car priced at $25,000. Musk denied the report, and shortly after, the company laid off over 10% of its 140,000-strong workforce. Two top managers also left the company, and Musk told employees that the company needs to be 'absolutely strict' about personnel numbers and cost-cutting. In the first half of 2024, Tesla produced almost 7% fewer electric vehicles and almost 15% fewer cars in the second quarter compared to the same periods last year.

The company had previously announced that it would unveil the Robotaxi on August 8, but Musk later claimed that Reuters was 'lying' without providing specific points of contention. After a few weeks, Tesla laid off more than 10% of its over 140,000 employees, following news of layoffs, and the company parted ways with two top executives. Musk warned employees that they need to be 'extremely strict' about the number of employees and reducing costs, and added, 'While some executives take this seriously, most don't.' Tesla delivered around 7% of its vehicles in the first half of 2024 and produced 15% less in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2023.

**Tesla Postpones Robotaxi Presentation Due to Lack of Readiness**
Tesla has postponed the presentation of its robotaxi, which was scheduled for August 8, due to its lack of readiness. According to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the decision, the presentation will now take place in October. The delay has led to a 8.4% drop in Tesla's stock price, the worst performance since January. Meanwhile, the stocks of competitors Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft have risen by 6.1% and 4.6%, respectively. Tesla has been working on autonomous driving systems for over a decade, but its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is still not fully autonomous and requires constant driver attention. The robotaxi is seen as a key driver of growth for Tesla, but this claim is made against the backdrop of declining car sales. In the first half of the year, sales fell by 6.6%, and production in the second quarter dropped by 14%. Competition from Chinese manufacturers and the overall stagnation of the electric vehicle market are putting pressure on Tesla, which is undergoing mass layoffs and closing promising departments.

**Tech Sector's 2024 Layoffs Exceed 100,000; Women Bear Brunt**
The technology industry has seen over 100,000 layoffs in 2024, with women and the video game industry being disproportionately affected. Notable companies like Dyson, Tesla, SAP, Google, and Microsoft have all executed layoffs, with Dyson cutting 1,000 jobs, Tesla reducing its workforce by 14,500, and SAP downsizing by 8,000. The video game industry has seen significant layoffs at Electronic Arts, Activision, and Riot Games, with over 10,000 cuts in the sector. Women make up around 45% of the total layoffs, despite holding less than one-third of positions in the industry. Experts argue that seniority-based firing practices exacerbate the gender disparity and that companies must prioritize diversity and inclusion to maintain quality and equity in their products and services.

**A Laid Off Tesla Employee Invests All Of His Severance Pay In Tesla Shares**
Mike Billett, a former sales leader at Tesla, was laid off in April 2024 as part of the company's efforts to reduce its global headcount by 10%. Despite this, Billett has chosen to invest 100% of his severance pay in Tesla shares, citing his six years of work towards helping the company grow and his belief in its future impact. Billett's decision is a testament to his confidence in Tesla's potential, and his investment has been rewarded as the company's shares have erased their losses for the year. Wall Street is also turning bullish on Tesla again, with Goldman Sachs raising its price target to $248 and increasing its 2024 EPS estimate to $2.05.
