**DOW: Index May Drop Intel & Replace it With Nvidia**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average may replace Intel with Nvidia due to Intel's poor performance. Intel's stock (INTC) has lost over 70% of its value since 2020, and the company has faced significant market share loss and workforce cuts. The Dow's selection committee considers the price of shares in the index, and currently, Nvidia's stock has spiked over 160% in the past year, making it a potential candidate for inclusion. If Intel is replaced, it could create positive momentum for Nvidia, as many funds indexed to the Dow would become net buyers.

**Intel's Place In Dow In Jeopardy, AI Strategy Under Scrutiny: Report - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)**
Analysts predict that Intel may be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to its struggles in AI and manufacturing competitiveness. According to Reuters, Intel's stock price trajectory and missed opportunities in the artificial intelligence boom, such as OpenAI's failed investment, have raised concerns. Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds suggests that Nvidia Corp could replace Intel on the Dow, citing Nvidia's 129% increase in the last 12 months compared to Intel's 44% decline. Daniel Morgan of Synovus Trust also notes Texas Instruments Inc as a possible contender for the Dow Jones. Intel plans to ship chips for over 100 million AI personal computers by 2025, but recent reports indicate the company is considering breaking up its product design and manufacturing businesses. As a result, Intel's stock price has dropped 6.63% to $20.58 at the last check on Tuesday.

**Dow drops 600 on weak jobs data as a global sell-off whips back to Wall Street**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 600 points on Friday due to weak jobs data, which sparked a global sell-off that reached Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%, the Dow Jones lost 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%. The decline was triggered by a report showing slower-than-expected hiring by U.S. employers, causing market fears. Intel's stock plummeted to its worst day in 50 years after reporting disappointing profits and suspending its dividend, while Treasury yields fell as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's potential rate cuts in September.

**Wall Street Plunges as Intel and Recession Fears Weigh on Markets**
Wall Street plummeted by over 2% at the close of trading, led by Intel's 26% decline and renewed fears of recession triggered by negative US labor market data. The Nasdaq fell 2.26%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.07%, and the S&P 500 declined 2.02%. Intel's stock plummeted after announcing poor quarterly results, including losses and reduced revenue due to increased competition in the chip market, as well as a $10 billion cost-cutting plan by 2025, which includes the layoff of 15,000 employees. Amazon, the e-commerce giant, was also heavily impacted, losing nearly 9% after releasing quarterly earnings and forecasts that failed to meet expectations. Investors sold stocks after receiving the latest US labor report, which showed slower-than-expected job growth in July and a 4.3% unemployment rate, the highest since October 2021. The market had rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve suggested that interest rate cuts may be imminent, but on Friday, investors valued the possibility of a 'hard landing' in the economy due to high interest rates. According to Bret Kenwell, eToro's investment analyst, 'investors assume at least one rate cut in September', but after the weak employment report, 'the situation shifts from 'will the Fed cut rates' to 'how much will they cut'.' Joaquín Robles, market analyst, noted that a 'correction between 5% and 15% should not be a major concern for investors, as many will be motivated to take profits after recent gains and the fear of economic cooling.' The Vix index, known as the 'fear gauge', surged 45% in this session, after rising 12% on Thursday.

**Will Collapsing Intel Stock Get Kicked Out of the Dow?**
Intel (INTC) has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor industry, with its stock down 30% since the start of 2023 and 46% over the last 10 years. The company's struggles with rising competition from Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have led to falling revenue and cash flow, forcing Intel to suspend its dividend and reduce its workforce. As a result, there is speculation that Intel will be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DOWI), with analysts suggesting that Nvidia or Texas Instruments (TXN) could replace it. Despite Intel's efforts to improve its business fundamentals, including a $10 billion cost-reduction plan and a plan to spin off its foundry business, the company's near-term prospects are uncertain, making it a high-risk investment. Analysts have an average target price of $29.19 for INTC stock, indicating an upside potential of over 50% from current levels.

**Intel, Amazon.com Inc. share losses contribute to Dow's nearly 250-point fall**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 250 points on Friday morning due to losses in Intel and Amazon.com Inc. shares. Intel's shares dropped $0.52, or 2.7%, while Amazon.com Inc.'s shares are off $4.26, or 2.4%, contributing to a 31-point drag on the Dow. Other significant contributors to the decline include American Express, Boeing, and Honeywell. According to the article, a $1 move in any one of the 30 components of the benchmark equates to a 6.57-point swing.

**Intel Faces Exclusion from Dow Jones Index Amid 60% Stock Decline**
Intel's stock has fallen by 60% this year, putting the company at risk of being removed from the Dow Jones index. Analysts believe that with a 60% drop in stock value, Intel may be the worst-performing company in the list and could be excluded from the index. Ryan Detrick from Carson Group stated, 'The exclusion of Intel was inevitable, and the latest results may be the deciding factor.' Intel's failure to invest in artificial intelligence and its losses from contract manufacturing have taken a toll on the company. To restructure, Intel has suspended dividends and announced the layoffs of 15% of its employees, but many experts believe these measures may not be enough. Reports show that Intel not only lags behind in technology production but also loses market share, making it vulnerable to growing competition from other semiconductor manufacturers like NVIDIA, AMD, and others. Investors are waiting for Intel to take further steps to regain trust in the brand.

**Intel's Decline: A 60% Stock Price Drop and the Challenges Ahead**
Intel has fallen from its former glory, with its stock price declining by almost 60% this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. According to experts, the company's long-standing problems with product development and introduction are a major issue. As analyst Eye explains, 'They have had difficulties in implementation and design for a while.' Additionally, Intel's high investments needed to expand its foundry business are a significant burden. The company faces intense competition from rivals like AMD, which is aggressively taking market share and exploiting Intel's weaknesses. In this dynamic and competitive market, Intel is under increasing pressure to perform.

**Intel Stock Drops Further as Silicon Wafers Reportedly Fail Broadcom Tests**
Intel shares dropped further on Wednesday after Reuters reported that Broadcom's tests of Intel's 18A manufacturing process failed. The silicon wafers, which were run through the process, were reportedly returned to Broadcom last month. Intel's struggles have accelerated over the last month, with a disappointing earnings report and plans to lay off 15% of its employees. The company's shares have lost about 60% of their value since the start of 2024. Intel's shares were 2% lower at $19.67 early Wednesday afternoon. 'The earnings-related fall was followed by reports that concerns have emerged over the company's planned construction of two new facilities in Germany,' according to Investopedia. 'Executives are preparing to present plans to cut costs and sell assets amid the company's struggles, and concerns that Intel could potentially face removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA),' the article added.

**Intel Faces Possible Removal from Dow Jones Index**
Intel, one of the pioneers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index during the internet bubble in the late 1990s, is facing the possibility of being removed from the select group of blue-chip companies. The chip manufacturer saw its shares plummet by almost 60% in 2024, putting its presence in the index that measures the performance of the main US companies at risk. According to Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at the Carson Group, 'the exclusion of Intel from the Dow Jones was already on its way for a long time', he said to Reuters. The company has been struggling to adapt to market changes, particularly after missing the opportunity to capitalize on the growth of artificial intelligence by passing on an investment in OpenAI. To try to reverse the situation, Intel announced drastic measures, including the suspension of dividends and the dismissal of 15% of its workforce. However, analysts believe that these actions may be 'insufficient and late' to prevent the company's removal from the index. With the possible departure of Intel from the Dow, speculation is growing about which company could take its place. Nvidia, whose shares have risen by over 160% this year, is a strong candidate, especially due to its crucial role in developing chips for artificial intelligence. However, some investors consider that Nvidia's volatility may not align with the more stable profile of the Dow companies. Another possible substitute is Texas Instruments, a company with almost a century of existence, with a strong presence in the US and shares that have appreciated by over 20% this year.

**Intel could be removed from Dow Jones due to stark stock price drop: Report**
Intel's stock price has plummeted nearly 60% this year, causing the company to fall below $100 billion in market capitalization for the first time in 30 years. Analysts and investors believe that Intel's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index is likely imminent due to its poor performance. The company's decline is partly due to missed opportunities in the AI sector, declining revenue, and massive spending on manufacturing capacity. Intel has implemented drastic measures, including layoffs and suspended dividend payments, but some experts believe these steps may be too little, too late. If Intel is removed from the DJIA, potential replacements include Nvidia and Texas Instruments, according to an analyst. Nvidia's stock has risen 160% this year, but its volatility might be a concern, while Texas Instruments has seen a 20% increase in stock price and is known for its stable performance.

**Intel at Risk of Being Removed from Dow Jones Industrial Average**
Intel, one of the first tech companies to be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is at risk of being removed from the index due to a significant decline in its stock price. The company's stock value has fallen by nearly 60% this year, making it the worst performer in the list. This decline is part of a broader trend in the semiconductor industry, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index falling by 6% after reports of a global decline in chip sales in July 2024. In response to these challenges, Intel has suspended its dividend payments and announced plans to lay off 15% of its employees, according to Reuters. As Intel's stock price continues to plummet, the company's future in the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains uncertain.

**Intel Faces Significant Loss of Significance Amid Ongoing Crisis**
Intel, a leading chip manufacturer, is at risk of losing its significance in the industry. The company's ongoing crisis and subsequent stock price drop may lead to its removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to Reuters. Intel has experienced a dramatic 60% stock price decline this year, making it the weakest stock in the Dow and the one with the lowest price-weighted index. The company's shares dropped by about 7% on Tuesday, attributed to a general market sell-off. Intel has missed the opportunity to capitalize on the growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI), after declining to invest in OpenAI. Additionally, the company is experiencing losses in its contract manufacturing division, which competes with TSMC. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger plans to present a strategy to the board for selling non-core business areas and reorienting investments later this month. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the Dow, declined to comment on a possible exclusion of Intel. Changes to the index occur as needed, with the last change being in February, when Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon. Given that stock price is a key criterion for inclusion in the Dow, Nvidia may be considered as a potential replacement for Intel. Nvidia's stock price has risen by over 160% this year, driven by the demand for its chips in generative AI. A stock split in May has also increased the chances of Nvidia's inclusion in the Dow.

**Dow-ward spiral: Intel share price drop could see it delisted from blue-chip index**
Intel's share price has dropped by over 50% since the start of the year, putting its spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average at risk. Financial analysts expect the company to be removed from the index, which would be another blow to Intel's reputation following technical issues with its Raptor Lake processors, suspension of its quarterly dividend, and layoffs of over 16,000 staff. Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, acknowledged the company's problems and is working with investment bankers to identify a route out of its financial woes, which may include selling off business units, such as its Altera programmable logic (FPGA) division, or seeking more funding from the US government. Some experts suggest that Intel's foundry business needs support, as it declined in revenue in 2023 and led to a $7 billion operating loss. Others have suggested selling off the CPU business and focusing on the foundry side, but this may not be feasible given the current level of losses.

**Intel's Stock Plunge May Lead to Dow Jones Index Exclusion**
Intel's stock has fallen by 60% this year, making it likely to be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. Analysts and investors say that Intel's nearly 60% stock drop this year makes it the worst performer in the list. The company's stock fell by about 7% on Tuesday, September 3, amid a market sell-off, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index decreased by almost 6% after reports of a decline in chip sales worldwide in July. Intel's exclusion from the index would further damage the company's already battered reputation. The company missed the AI boom by refusing to invest in OpenAI and is struggling to compete with TSMC on its contract manufacturing site. To finance restructuring, Intel suspended dividend payments and announced layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce during its earnings report last month. However, some analysts and a former board member believe that these steps may be too little, too late for the chipmaker. 'Intel's exclusion has been a long time coming,' said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. 'The latest results may be the final straw needed for Intel's removal from the Dow Jones index.' Yesterday, Nvidia plummeted by $280 billion in a single day, the largest decline for any company in history.

**Intel Stock Falls Further Amid Broadcom's Failed Manufacturing Process Tests**
Intel's stock fell further on Wednesday amid a broader sell-off in chip stocks, as the company's contract manufacturing business received another negative news. According to Reuters, recent tests of Intel's latest manufacturing process conducted by Broadcom failed. Intel's stock has lost around 60% of its value this year, including a 26% drop after a disappointing earnings report last month. Intel's (INTC) stock extended its losses on Wednesday amid a string of bad news, as Reuters reported that recent tests of Broadcom's (AVGO) advanced manufacturing process failed. The silicon wafers, on which the chips are printed, were returned to Broadcom last month after being subjected to Intel's 18A manufacturing process. A review by Broadcom's engineers found that the process is not ready for high-volume production, according to Reuters. Intel and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Investopedia. Latest Bad News for Intel Although many chip stocks have risen due to demand for artificial intelligence (AI), Intel's stock has lost around 60% of its value since the start of 2024. These difficulties have accelerated in the past month, with a disappointing earnings report and the announcement that it would lay off around 15% of its employees as part of a broader cost-cutting plan. The earnings report caused the stock to drop 26% the day after its release, to its lowest point in over a decade. The earnings-related drop was followed by reports of concerns over the planned construction of two new facilities in Germany. On Tuesday, the stock was pressured by a report indicating that executives are preparing to present plans to cut costs and sell assets in the face of the company's difficulties, as well as concerns that Intel could potentially be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Intel's stock was down 2% to $19.67 on Wednesday afternoon.

**Intel at Risk of Being Removed from Dow Jones Index**
Intel may be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a nearly 60% decline in value this year, making it the worst performer among the listed companies. According to Reuters, the chipmaker has been a member of the index for 25 years, but has failed to keep pace with its rivals in the artificial intelligence sector, losing significant market share. As Ryuta Makino, analyst at Gabelli Funds, said, 'the removal was probably expected for a long time' and the possibility of it happening is becoming increasingly concrete. The price of Intel's shares is a key factor in its inclusion in the Dow Jones, unlike the S&P 500 index which considers market value. The selection committee checks if the title with the highest price in the index has a value more than ten times higher than the title with the lowest weight. Currently, the title with the highest weight (UnitedHealth Group) has a price about 29 times higher than Intel's. Makino suggests that Nvidia may replace Intel in the Dow Jones, as both stocks have declined by around 7%.

**Intel stock dives amid fresh reports**
Intel's stock price dropped 8.8% on Tuesday, following a 3.3% decline in the Nasdaq. The company's prospects continue to be uncertain, with reports of potential asset sales, including the sale of its Altera programmable chip unit and the pausing or halting of a $32 billion factory project in Germany. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon expressed concerns about Intel's foundry business, stating that it 'cannot stand on its own right now given heavy losses and lack of scale.' Rasgon also noted that Intel's product business is 'structurally losing share' in a declining market. The analyst questioned Intel's decision to potentially raise more cash via asset sales, asking 'Would such a move simply be an attempt to bolster the stock price? Or are there more structural rationales for it?' Intel's shares have dropped 59.5% since the end of 2023, making it the Dow's worst performer and potentially in danger of losing its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Intel (INTC) is facing the possibility of being removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) due to its poor performance, with a 60% drop in value over the last year, making it the worst performer on the index. According to Reuters commentators, Intel's days of representing the tech sector in the Dow are coming to an end. Despite plans to sell off Altera and change its spending plans, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger's proposal to divest 'unnecessary businesses' does not include the foundry unit. The company may slow or halt the construction of a $32 billion factory in Germany, which was already delayed once.

**Intel could be kicked out of Dow Jones index as shares slide over 6%**
Intel's shares have fallen 6% after rumors emerged that the company is considering selling its FPGA unit to Marvell Technology. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) may drop Intel from its index altogether, with analyst Ryan Detrick predicting that Intel's uncertain outlook primes it for displacement. Intel's stock has been in a downtrend since hitting an all-time high in August 2000, and is now trading at $20.57, well below its moving averages. The company is studying the possibility of selling its FPGA unit, which could fetch between $18 billion and $22 billion, and is partnering with a Japanese research institution to build a research laboratory for the study of EUV technology in chip design. However, Intel's uncertain outlook and recent losses have not satisfied Wall Street, and the company's stock is considered a recipe for disaster if it falls out of the DJIA.

**Intel's Place In Dow In Jeopardy, AI Strategy Under Scrutiny: Report**
Intel's position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is under threat, according to analysts and investors. The company's stock price has been declining, and it missed out on the artificial intelligence boom. Intel plans to ship chips for over 100 million AI personal computers by 2025, but recent reports indicate the company is considering breaking up its product design and manufacturing businesses. Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds suggests that Nvidia Corp could replace Intel on the Dow, citing Nvidia's successful navigation of the AI market and its 129% increase in stock value over the last 12 months. Daniel Morgan of Synovus Trust also notes Texas Instruments Inc as a possible contender for the Dow Jones. 'Nvidia has been up 129% in the last 12 months as it successfully milked the AI frenzy, while Intel has been down 44%', said Morgan. 'It's likely that Intel will be removed from the Dow', analysts and investors told Reuters. 'Intel missed out on the artificial intelligence boom as OpenAI's investment failed to materialize, and its contract manufacturing unit continued to lose out to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co', according to the report.

**Intel shares are the Dow's worst performer this year and are the bellwether's lowest-priced stock.**
Intel shares have fallen sharply in Tuesday trading, extending their 2024 slump, amid reports that the chipmaker could be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel remains the benchmark's worst-performing stock and the lowest of the 30 companies on the price-weighted index, having lost more than $210 billion in market value since its prepandemic peak in January 2020. Analysts have suggested that Nvidia could replace Intel in the Dow, citing the chipmaker's importance in the American economy and market weighting. Intel's woes are likely to continue regardless of its place in the Dow, with the group facing huge questions about the fate of its long-running turnaround under Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger. Intel has unveiled plans to reduce its global headcount by 15% and suspend its quarterly dividend, and is considering deeper cost cuts and potential asset sales, including the sale of its Altera chip business.

**Boeing, Intel share losses contribute to Dow's nearly 475-point drop**
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped nearly 475 points, or 1.1%, due to declines in shares of Boeing and Intel. Boeing's shares have fallen $14.26, or 8.2%, while Intel's shares are down $1.49 (6.7%), resulting in a 103-point drag on the Dow. Other contributors to the decline include Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs, and 3M. According to the Dow's components, a $1 move in any of the 30 components results in a 6.57-point swing.

**Intel Likely To Get Booted From The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Owing To The Stock's ~60 Percent Loss This Year**
Intel's stock has declined by approximately 60% this year, making it likely to be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index. According to Reuters, Intel's chronic underperformance has led to its potential removal from the index, which would deprive the stock of passive funding and potentially lead to further losses. This development comes as Intel prepares to pitch a broad-based revival plan at its upcoming board meeting, which may include unloading its majority stake in Altera and instituting a construction freeze on its $30 billion facility in Germany. However, the company is unlikely to divest its chip manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry. To conserve cash, Intel has slashed its dividends, laid off 13.6% of its workforce, and cut its capital spending for 2025 by 17% to $21.5 billion.

**Intel's Future in Dow Jones at Risk Amid Stock Price Drop**
Following the pandemic, there was a significant increase in demand and interest in electric vehicles, technological devices, and artificial intelligence. Companies like NVIDIA, which quickly followed and capitalized on the artificial intelligence boom, exceeded expectations with their growth. However, Intel failed to keep up with this trend. Recently, CEO Pat Gelsinger presented a plan to the board of directors to sell off assets and reduce costs due to the company's financial difficulties. The company's stock price drop may cause Intel to lose its place in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), which measures the performance of the 30 largest US companies. As one expert noted, 'Intel's inability to adapt to the changing market has put its position in the Dow Jones at risk.'

**Intel's Dow Jones Status Threatened by Share Decline**
Intel's status in the Dow Jones index is threatened by the decline of the chipmaker's shares. Analysts and investors have stated that Intel is likely to be removed from the index, citing the 60% drop in its shares this year, making it the worst performer in the index and leaving it with the lowest price in the Dow Jones weighted index. A removal would further damage Intel's already tarnished reputation. The company has missed the AI boom after passing on an investment in OpenAI and losses are piling up in its contract manufacturing unit aimed at competing with TSMC. To fund its turnaround, Intel has suspended its dividend and announced layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce in its latest earnings report. However, some analysts and a former board member believe that these measures may be insufficient and too late for the chipmaker. 'The removal of Intel was probably long overdue,' said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group. The latest results may be the final push needed for the company to be removed from the Dow Jones, added Detrick. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the Dow, has refused to comment on the possibility of Intel being removed from the index. The index changes are made based on needs and the last update occurred in February, when struggling Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon.com. The price of shares is a key factor for inclusion in the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 index, which takes into account market value. The Dow Jones selection committee checks if the most expensive stock in the index has a price more than 10 times higher than the cheapest stock. Currently, the most heavily weighted stock - UnitedHealth Group - has a price approximately 29 times higher than Intel's. The chipmaker is also the least influential member of the index, with a meager weighting of 0.32% based on its closing price of $20.13 on August 29. Although the most significant impact would be on Intel's reputation, exclusion would also have an additional impact on its shares, which have fallen by over 70% from their record high in August 2000, leaving the chipmaker with a market value of less than $100 billion for the first time in 30 years. Nvidia could replace Intel in the Dow Jones, according to Ryuta Makino, research analyst at Gabelli Funds, an investor in Intel. With shares up over 160% this year, Nvidia has become one of the most valuable companies in the world due to the essential role its chips play in feeding AI generative. A split in May has also increased the chances of its inclusion. However, some investors have estimated that Nvidia could be a too volatile title for the Dow Jones, which generally prefers more stable values. Texas Instruments, a nearly century-old chipmaker with significant production capacity in the US, is another option to replace Intel in the index, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, who owns Intel shares. The shares of Texas Instruments have risen by over 20% this year to reach $211.09 on Thursday, which is closer to the average price of the Dow Jones components, which is around $209. In the event of removal, a stock with a price closer to the average price of the current list might be preferred to replace it, said David Blitzer, who chaired the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee for over 20 years until 2019.

**Intel Shares Rise on Rumors of Restructuring and M&A**
Intel's shares rose 9.3% to $22, making them the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. According to Bloomberg, the company is considering various options, including separating its product design and manufacturing businesses, selling factory projects, and exploring mergers and acquisitions. However, investors remain cautious, as the recent gain is seen as a stabilization after a sharp decline in August. Intel's quarterly report and outlook disappointed investors, leading to a 30% drop in share price to $20. The shares continued to fall, reaching a low of $19, the lowest since 2010. Intel shareholders have lost 56% in value this year, making the company's shares the weakest in the Dow and the second-weakest in the Nasdaq 100.

**US Stock Market Indices Show Mixed Performance Ahead of Potential Interest Rate Cut**
US stock market indices showed a mixed performance at the close of trading on Wall Street, as investors attempted to overcome the sharp selling seen earlier this month, ahead of a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the near future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.16% at close, while the S&P 500 index fell 0.32% and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.85% due to a decline in technology stocks. Meanwhile, shares of chipmaker Intel are expected to fall ahead of its earnings report next Wednesday, which will be the most closely watched event in the US stock market this week. In related news, upcoming inflation data in the US will reinforce the expectation of a near-term interest rate cut, while consumer spending data is seen as a sign of the central bank's success in maintaining growth.

**Is Intel at risk of getting booted from the Dow?**
Intel's (INTC) shares have plummeted nearly 30% after the company announced a cost reduction plan and reported weaker earnings. This has raised concerns about whether Intel will be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). However, Barron's senior market analysis writer Paul La Monica suggests that this might not happen immediately, stating 'It wouldn't surprise me if sometime in 2025 there is a decision to be made.' La Monica also mentioned that Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia (NVDA) could potentially replace Intel in the index, citing recent stock splits from Nvidia and Broadcom as a factor in their favor.

**Nasdaq enters correction, Dow falls 600 points as disappointing jobs report shakes investors**
US stocks tumbled on Friday after the July jobs report showed a further cooling in the labor market, fueling concerns the Federal Reserve's 'higher for longer' interest-rate stance might end in recession. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 2.6% after the jobs report's release, plunging the tech-heavy index into correction territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slumped 1.5%, or more than 600 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 1.8%. Intel (INTC) shares sank over 26% after the company reported a disappointing earnings report, missing on the top and bottom lines and announcing a $10 billion cost reduction plan. Amazon (AMZN) shares slid almost 9% after the company shared a current quarter forecast that fell short of expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Apple (AAPL) shares were a relative winner, up less than 1% after the company beat on earnings despite a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. The US economy added just 114,000 new jobs last month and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is undergoing the 'biggest restructuring' since the memory microprocessor decision four decades ago, and that he is in it for the long haul despite the disappointing quarter and outlook.

**Wall Street Experiences Significant Decline Following Disappointing Employment Report**
Wall Street experienced a significant decline on Friday (2) following a disappointing employment report in the United States, which raised concerns of a recession and increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve (Fed) reducing interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial index fell 1.52%, closing at 39,737.26 points; the Nasdaq technology index dropped 2.43%, ending at 16,776.16 units; and the S&P 500, the main reference for investors, lost 1.84%, falling to 5,346.56 points. Bond yields also fell, suggesting that the Fed may need to cut interest rates more drastically than expected. The US economy created 114,000 jobs last month, a decline from the previous month and less than expected, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021. The report deepened recession fears after the median manufacturing sector data on Thursday, with losses over the last two days of the week leaving the three main indices in the red for the week. 'Historically, it's very difficult to achieve a smooth landing,' noted Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers. 'It's easy for a smooth landing to catch you off guard and become a hard landing. And that's what the market fears most at this moment,' he explained. However, Art Hogan, of B. Riley Wealth, stated that it is likely that the market is overreacting to some weak data points, highlighting that most corporate results published in recent weeks have been solid. Intel's shares fell over 26% after the US chipmaker announced it would cut more than 15% of its workforce and reported a quarterly loss of $1.6 billion (R$ 9.1 billion).

**Global Markets Plummet as Investor Panic Grips Wall Street**
Global markets fell on Friday, with the Nikkei 225 index in Japan plummeting 5.8% due to investor panic over signs of economic weakness in the US. The decline came after a downturn on Wall Street, where weak data raised concerns that the Federal Reserve may have missed its chance to lower interest rates before they harm economic growth. Jerome Powell, the Fed's president, stated that a rate cut could come in September after the US central bank remained firm in a meeting this week. 'The fleeting satisfaction that Fed chief Powell communicated decent chances of a rate cut in September has soured because investors are now panicking that the central bank won't cut rates soon enough,' said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers. The S&P 500 futures lost 0.9% before the expected employment report, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%. A nearly 19% drop in Intel's stock price after the market close exacerbated the pessimism. The chipmaker announced a 15% reduction in its massive workforce - around 15,000 jobs - to better compete with successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD. At the start of trading in Europe, the German DAX lost 1.4% to 17,834.67 points, while the CAC 40 fell 0.7% to 7,315.93. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped 0.4% to 8,245.92.

Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, said, 'Job losses of this magnitude have never happened outside of recessions.' The market rally earlier in the week, which saw record-breaking gains, was followed by losses across several markets.

**Global stocks meltdown amid fears American economy will 'collapse' - then dire US jobs report sends Wall street tumbling**
Global stock markets plummeted on Friday as investors panicked over signs of weakness in the US economy. Japan's Nikkei 225 suffered its second-largest points drop in history, down 5.8% overnight. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones also fell in pre-market trading after a dire US jobs report showed unemployment at 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021. Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management, said, 'I didn't expect stocks to fall this much. This is probably because there are concerns that the US economy will collapse in a big way, which is the most unpleasant pattern for Japanese stocks.' The decline was also fueled by Intel's 19% share price drop after the chipmaker announced it would cut 15% of its workforce. The Nikkei has lost 6.2% in the past three months, and Japanese shares were pummeled after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 148.77 yen early Friday from 149.37 yen late Thursday, and the euro rose to $1.0820 from $1.0789.

**Wall Street Plunges as Intel and Recession Fears Weigh on Investors**
Wall Street fell by over 2% at the close of trading, led by Intel's 26% drop and renewed fears of recession following negative labor market data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 2.26% to 16,805 points, followed by the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.07%, 39,511) and the S&P 500 (-2.02%, 5,336). Intel plummeted after announcing poor quarterly results, including losses and reduced revenue due to increased competition in the chip market, as well as a $10 billion cost-cutting plan by 2025 that includes the layoff of 15,000 employees. Amazon, the e-commerce giant, was also heavily affected, losing nearly 9% after releasing quarterly earnings that failed to meet expectations and issuing disappointing forecasts. Investors rushed to sell stocks after receiving the latest US labor report, which showed slower-than-expected job growth in July and a 4.3% unemployment rate, the highest since October 2021. The market had been boosted on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve's suggestion that interest rate cuts may be imminent, but on Friday, investors valued the possibility of a 'hard landing' in the economy due to high interest rates. According to Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, 'investors assume at least one rate cut in September,' but after the weak employment report, 'the situation shifts from 'if' the Fed will cut rates to 'how much' they will cut.' Joaquín Robles, a market analyst, noted that a 'correction of 5-15% should not be a major concern for investors, as many will be motivated to take profits after recent gains and the fear of economic cooling.'

**Stock Market Today: Dow down 900 points as recession fears bulldoze stocks**
The stock market is experiencing a significant decline, with the Dow down as much as 770 points in midmorning trading. This would be the biggest one-day point decline since September 2022 and the biggest percentage-point drop since February 2023, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 is down 2.5% at 5,310, its worst one-day percentage-point decline since October 2022, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 3.3% at 16,622, on track for its worst day since July 24. The decline is attributed to recession fears and the poor post-earnings performance of Intel Corp. stock, which is weighing on the markets more broadly.

**Nasdaq Ends 5% Lower As Multinationals Earnings Disappoint**
The Nasdaq plummeted over 5% today, erasing its gains from yesterday, after traders' expectations of additional Fed rate cuts due to a weakening economy were replaced with concerns of excessive economic deterioration. The rates market is pricing in a 20% chance of a 0.50% drop in September, causing market anxiety. Stocks from chipmakers and tech companies led the decline, as major corporations' earnings continued to disappoint. Intel's Q2 earnings report was particularly disappointing, with EPS of $0.02 vs. $0.10 expected, and a 10.12% share price drop after hours. The Dow Industrial Average fell 1.21% and the S&P index fell 1.37%.
