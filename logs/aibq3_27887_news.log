**Emmys 2024 Poll: What Should Win for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series?**
The Emmy for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series is up for grabs this year, with five contenders vying for the top prize. The field includes new seasons of established TV brands, such as FX's Fargo and HBO's True Detective: Night Country, as well as Netflix's Baby Reindeer and Ripley, and Apple TV+'s Lessons in Chemistry. Without the prohibitive favorite Shōgun in the mix, the competition is fierce, but any one of these series could walk off with the big prize. According to TVLine, 'Season 5 of FX's Fargo may have been its most acclaimed yet, with stars Juno Temple and Jon Hamm also nabbing Emmy nods, and it won this Emmy back in 2014 for Season 1.' The question remains, which one would you be happiest to see collect a trophy on Emmy night?

**San Antonio's Nava Mau reflects on history-making 'Baby Reindeer' Emmy nod**
Nava Mau, a San Antonio native and actress, has made history by becoming the first transgender woman nominated for best supporting actress in a limited or anthology series or movie at the Emmy Awards. Mau, who plays Teri in the Netflix show 'Baby Reindeer,' said, 'In the span of years, there can be one opportunity for someone like me to get to grow as an actor and to be part of a project as meaningful as 'Baby Reindeer,' let alone be invited into a deeper space within the industry.' The show, which premiered in April, received 11 Emmy nominations, including best limited or anthology series. Mau's nomination is significant, as she and co-star Jessica Gunning are both nominated for their work in the supporting actress category. 'Richard really cared about this story depicting a trans woman, because he understood that the stakes are really high for us when it comes to media representation,' Mau said of co-star Richard Gadd. 'Baby Reindeer' became one of Netflix's top 10 most-viewed English-language TV series ever in June, with 84.5 million views in just two months. The Emmy Awards will air on September 15.

**Why 'True Detective' Star Jodie Foster Loves 'Baby Reindeer'**
Jodie Foster, a nominee for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for True Detective: Night Country, has expressed her admiration for Baby Reindeer, a competing series in the same category. Foster stated, 'I love Baby Reindeer. Every actor I know can't stop talking about Baby Reindeer.' The series, based on Richard Gadd's one-man stage play, follows a fictionalized version of Gadd as he is stalked by a lonely woman and experiences a harrowing encounter with a television writer who sexually abused him. The series has been surrounded by controversy, including a lawsuit filed by the woman who was portrayed in the series, Fiona Harvey, who claims that Netflix and Gadd ruined her reputation and life. Foster's praise for Baby Reindeer comes as both series are up for Primetime Emmy Awards, with True Detective: Night Country nominated for 19 awards and Baby Reindeer nominated for 11.
