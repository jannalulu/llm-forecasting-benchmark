Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered before them. A large screen displays yesterday's date.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, here we are. The question on everyone's mind: Did Plug Power file for bankruptcy before October 1, 2024?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. Despite the financial challenges, they managed to steer clear of filing.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed, the odds were against them, but they pulled through. Their recent SEC filings were concerning, though, hinting at potential trouble.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The "going concern" warning was a red flag. But it seems strategic maneuvers or perhaps market conditions favored them.

NATE SILVER  
A testament to the unpredictability of business resilience. Until next time, Philip.

They nod, acknowledging the power of accurate forecasting and the mysteries of corporate survival.
