*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered between them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, yesterday was the big day. The question on everyone's mind: On September 30, 2024, did the United States report more than 400 measles cases this year?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Given what we knew by August 20, our models were quite clear. The CDC had reported 167 cases by mid-July, and with biweekly updates, the trend was steady.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, what did our models predict?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The likelihood of surpassing 400 cases was low, given the containment efforts and vaccination drives.

**NATE SILVER**  
And it seems our models were right. The final count stood at 312 cases. Another testament to the power of accurate forecasting.

*They both nod, satisfied with their analysis.*

**FADE OUT.**

NATE SILVER  
So, Philip, did the measles cases exceed 400 this year?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 20.75%. Given the 167 cases by mid-July and the CDC's biweekly updates, a surge seemed unlikely.

NATE SILVER  
Right, especially with the vaccination campaigns ramping up after the outbreak in early 2024.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. The public health initiatives were effective. We had accounted for that in our models.

NATE SILVER  
It's fascinating how accurate these predictions are. Even with potential outbreaks, the numbers didn't spike as feared.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Indeed. It's a testament to the power of data-driven forecasting.

They nod in agreement, turning to their screens for the next prediction.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, it's the day after September 30th. The question on everyone's mind: did we surpass 400 measles cases in the U.S. this year?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 32.45%. With only 167 cases by mid-July and consistent biweekly updates, the trajectory just wasn't there.

NATE SILVER  
Agreed. The vaccination campaigns and public health measures had a significant impact. The data up to August 20th showed no alarming trends.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
It's a relief, really. Though we can't be complacent, this outcome underscores the importance of proactive health measures.

NATE SILVER  
Absolutely. A testament to how accurate forecasting can guide public policy effectively. Here's to keeping those numbers low.

So, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Did we cross the threshold of 400 measles cases in 2024?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. With 167 cases reported by July 15 and no significant outbreaks since, the probability remained low.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed, the vaccination campaigns and public health measures seemed to hold strong. Even with the rising concerns in certain communities, the data didn't suggest a surge.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. Our model's accuracy once again reflects the reality. The proactive measures taken were pivotal.
