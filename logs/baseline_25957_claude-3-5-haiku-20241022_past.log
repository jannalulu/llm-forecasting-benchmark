I'll carefully analyze the key factors for Tadej Pogačar's chances of winning the 2024 Tour de France:

Key Considerations:
1. Pogačar is currently the dominant cyclist in the world
2. He's already won the Tour de France three times (2020, 2021, 2022)
3. He's currently racing in the 2024 Tour de France
4. He's performing exceptionally well this year
5. He's in his prime physical condition at age 25
6. His UAE Team Emirates is strong and well-supported
7. No major injuries or setbacks reported
8. Currently leading the general classification

Potential Challenges:
1. Strong competition from Jonas Vingegaard
2. Potential unexpected events (crashes, mechanical issues)
3. Mountain stages still remaining

Probability Assessment:
- His current form and track record suggest very high probability
- But cycling has inherent unpredictability
- Historical win rates for top favorites around 60-70%

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 79.90%, but 72.30% being the most likely. Probability: 72.30%.
