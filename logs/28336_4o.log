To forecast whether Prince Tom Iseghohi will win the September 21, 2024, Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria, let's consider the available evidence and apply superforecasting principles.

1. **Reference Class and Base Rate**:
   - Begin by recognizing that this is a gubernatorial election with a known list of candidates and established political parties. Typically, gubernatorial elections in Nigeria are characterized by a few major political parties holding most of the power, with occasional wins by smaller parties or independents.

2. **Contextual Evidence**:
   - News articles indicate that Prince Tom Iseghohi of the Action Alliance has withdrawn from the race and endorsed the APC candidate, Monday Okpebholo. This act effectively removes Iseghohi from the list of contenders and endorses a competitor, lowering his chances of winning to nearly zero.

3. **Resolution Criteria**:
   - According to the criteria, Iseghohi must be declared the next governor for the question to resolve as "Yes." His withdrawal from the race ensures that he cannot be declared the winner.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**:
   - The clashing forces here include political endorsements and the absence of Iseghohi as a contender. The withdrawal and endorsement signal alignment with other candidates rather than promoting his own candidacy, sharply decreasing any possible residual chance of a win on technical grounds (like a last-minute re-entry or widespread electoral error).

5. **Historical Patterns and Adjustments**:
   - Historically, a candidate's withdrawal from an election ends their campaign, limiting their potential to be considered or declared post-election. Thus, even in unique circumstances, the probability of a withdrawal turning into a victory is negligible.

Based on this analysis, even with the most conservative analysis of inclusive events in politics, the probability of Prince Tom Iseghohi winning the election is infinitesimally low. The recommended forecast adjusts the probability close to zero due to these overwhelming conclusive data points:

My Prediction: Between 0.00% and 0.10%, but 0.00% being the most likely. Probability: 0.00%.

Based on the information provided, Prince Tom Iseghohi withdrew from the Edo state gubernatorial election and endorsed the APC candidate, Monday Okpebholo. This is a critical piece of information, as it indicates that Prince Tom Iseghohi is no longer actively participating in the race and has lent his support to another candidate. His withdrawal and endorsement reduce his chances of winning to negligible levels. Given the context, it's very unlikely that Prince Tom Iseghohi would win the election if he is not running.

Considering historical and contextual references, in political elections, when a candidate withdraws and endorses another candidate, the probability of the former winning is practically null. The base rate for a candidate winning after formally withdrawing from a race is exceptionally low or close to zero.

Taking into account these evaluations and ensuring that the forecast is well-calibrated with regard to both calibration and resolution, the most likely outcome is that Prince Tom Iseghohi will not win the election.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.10%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

To forecast whether Prince Tom Iseghohi will win the September 21, 2024, Edo State gubernatorial election, I will follow a structured approach using the principles of superforecasting and available information.

### Reference Classes and Base Rates
1. **Candidate Background**: Prince Tom Iseghohi was the Action Alliance candidate but has withdrawn from the race and endorsed the candidate from the All Progressives Congress (APC), Monday Okpebholo.
2. **Base Rate of Withdrawn Candidates Winning**: Historically, candidates who withdraw from elections are overwhelmingly unsuccessful in winning them since they are no longer actively contesting. The base rate of such individuals winning would essentially approach 0%, assuming no unusual events occur post-withdrawal.

### Current News and Developments
- **Endorsement of Another Candidate**: Recent articles confirm that Tom Iseghohi has officially stepped down and endorsed the APC candidate.
- **Election Results and Timing**: The absence of a mention of him being declared the next governor aligns with the expectation that his withdrawal would remove his candidacy from contention.

### Distinctive Features of the Current Situation
- **Endorsement Impact**: Prince Tom Iseghohi’s endorsement of the APC candidate suggests he has forfeited his chances in favor of another candidate, likely decreasing any residual chances significantly.
  
### Clashing Causal Forces and Trends
- **Political Support and Alliances**: Alliances are crucial in political contexts. With his withdrawal and endorsement of another candidate, it aligns that he would not have the infrastructural support or political backing to win on those terms.

### Conclusion
Given these factors:
- **Probability of Prince Tom Iseghohi Winning**: Extremely low due to his withdrawal from the race and public support for a different candidate, further reinforced by a lack of reports announcing him as a victor or contender post-election date.

Based on this analysis:

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.10%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.

Based on the information provided, Prince Tom Iseghohi has withdrawn from the gubernatorial race and endorsed the candidate from the APC, Monday Okpebholo. Given this development, it is highly improbable that Prince Tom Iseghohi could win the election as he is no longer participating in it.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates:**
   - In most political contexts, when a candidate withdraws from an election and endorses another candidate, the base rate of victory for the withdrawn candidate is essentially zero.

2. **Current Evidence:** 
   - Multiple credible sources, including The Guardian Nigeria News and The Nation Nigeria, have reported that Prince Tom Iseghohi has stepped down and endorsed another candidate, which eliminates him from the possibility of winning the election.
   
3. **Extrapolation of Trends:**
   - The trend is clear that Prince Tom Iseghohi is not in the running for the election, thus predictive trends cannot infer any chance of success for him.

4. **Balancing Overreaction:**
   - Given that all substantive evidence indicates withdrawal, there is no reasonable basis to consider any probability of winning.

Based on this analysis, the probability that Prince Tom Iseghohi will win the Edo state gubernatorial election is effectively zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.00% and 0.10%, but 0.00% being the most likely. Probability: 0.00%.

To evaluate the probability of Prince Tom Iseghohi winning the September 21, 2024, Edo state gubernatorial election, I'll consider several factors and follow the superforecasting guidelines.

1. **Base Rate Consideration**:
   - Historically, candidates stepping down in elections significantly reduce their chances of winning. Prince Tom Iseghohi, the Action Alliance (AA) candidate, has officially withdrawn from the race and endorsed the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Monday Okpebholo. This move effectively reduces his chances to near zero because he is no longer pursuing the election.

2. **Current Situation Analysis**:
   - According to multiple reports, Iseghohi has endorsed another candidate, and his party's infrastructure has been absorbed into the APC for this election.
   - The updated list of contenders and the removal of Iseghohi as an active candidate in reputable sources indicates his non-participation.

3. **Resolution Criteria**:
   - The resolution hinges on Iseghohi officially winning the governorship. Given that he has stepped down and endorsed another candidate, this outcome is not possible.
  
4. **Adjustments Based on Updated Information**:
   - After the withdrawal announcement, there's no credible pathway for Iseghohi to win as he no longer contests for the position.

Based on these considerations, historical base rates, the current political situation, and the explicit withdrawal, the probability of Iseghohi winning is extremely low.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.10%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.
