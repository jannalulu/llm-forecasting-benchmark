To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), we'll consider the available evidence, historical patterns, and analyze the situation using superforecasting principles.

**1. Reference Class Forecasting (Base Rate Considerations):**
Historically, Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022. Despite speculation and claims at various points about potential further mobilizations, no second wave has been reported as having commenced by the ISW up to now. The earlier mobilization was driven by acute military needs and geopolitical pressures that might not be currently as pronounced.

**2. Current Evidence and Narrative:**
- **Official Denials:** Multiple denials from Russian authorities and Kremlin spokesmen, including President Putin, emphasize that there is no current need for new mobilization and point towards ongoing recruitment of volunteers and contract soldiers.
- **Preparatory Measures:** Reports indicate preparations for restricting movement of potential draftees from fall 2024, possibly indicating groundwork for a controlled mobilization process.
- **Contradictory Reports:** While some sources like Ukrainian intelligence suggest imminent mobilization efforts, these claims are not yet corroborated by ISW or reflected in official government statements.
- **Military Conditions and Developments:** Russia faces ongoing military demands in Ukraine, with recruitment and personnel replenishment reportedly aligning with sustained conflict efforts.

**3. Analyzing Current Trends and Forces:**
The ISW reports cite on-the-ground operational challenges faced by Russia, including personnel shortages. Yet, ISW does not currently substantiate claims of an ongoing mobilization beyond preparatory and ancillary measures.

The conflicting forces at play include:
- **Domestic Pressure:** Mobilization being unpopular domestically could dissuade authorities from announcing a second wave at present.
- **External Pressure:** Military needs could drive such a decision if circumstances change dramatically, which often cannot be reliably foreseen months in advance.

**4. Balancing Probabilities and Uncertainty:**
Given the strong official narrative against new mobilization efforts, and the lack of confirming reports from ISW, the probability of a second wave beginning before September 30, 2024, seems lower at this stage.

Therefore, grounding this forecast involves adjusting base rates due to the present denials and circumstantial evidence suggesting ongoing, but not formal, mobilization processes.

**5. Conclusion and Forecast:**
The current evidence suggests that ISW has not, as of yet, reported any second mobilization wave that aligns with formal action recognizably acknowledged by the Russian government. The barriers and implications require careful balancing of caution against the possibility of abrupt strategic shifts.

**My Prediction: 25.00% being the most likely, with 85.00% confidence. Probability: 25.00%.**

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), we need to examine the relevant factors and the available information.

**Base Rate and Historical Context:**
- The base rate for an event like this is challenging to determine because mobilization decisions depend on a combination of military needs, political considerations, and international pressures. However, Russia announced a partial mobilization in September 2022, which means that the Russian government has a recent precedent for taking such a step.

**Current Situation and Evidence:**
- Recent reports indicate that Russia has been recruiting volunteers and contract soldiers, with a current mobilization policy emphasizing this approach instead of a formal conscription wave. Reports from Kremlin spokespeople continually deny the need for mobilization, and Putin has stated repeatedly that Russia does not need another wave.
- Some analysts and military experts have suggested increased mobilization might be necessary to sustain operations in Ukraine, but this hasn't manifested in a formal wave recognized by ISW.
- ISW reports indicate that while Russia continues its military operations, a strategy of a gradual approach and reliance on recent recruits might persist without a broad mobilization wave.
- There are documented logistical efforts, such as restrictions on travel for potential draftees, which align with preparatory actions for mobilization, but these do not yet confirm a formal second mobilization wave.

**Clashing Causal Forces:**
- On one hand, military needs and logistical preparations suggest that an additional wave could be a possibility if Russia's needs intensify.
- On the other hand, the continuous denial from the Kremlin and current recruitment efforts relying on volunteers suggest that Russia is trying to avoid the political and social repercussions of a second mobilization.

**Probability Evaluation:**
- The probability of a second wave by September 30, 2024, is influenced by both the strategic necessity and the political will to initiate such a move. Assessing available reports, especially denials from Russian governmental representatives and consistent recruitment of volunteers, implies a low likelihood of formal mobilization being recognized by ISW in the given timeframe.

Given these factors outlined, the probability forecast considers:
1. The historical precedent (partial mobilization in 2022),
2. Kremlin's current stance (denial and emphasis on volunteers),
3. ISW's current assessment of the Russian military strategy.

My Prediction: 20.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) before September 30, 2024, I will follow a structured approach based on superforecasting principles:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting (Base Rates):** In creating a baseline, I consider historical instances of Russian mobilization. The most recent mobilization occurred in September 2022, when Russia announced a partial mobilization of 300,000 troops in response to the war in Ukraine. The frequency of similar actions and current geopolitical tensions suggest that mobilization is an uncommon but not isolated decision.

2. **Analyzing Current Evidence:** As of July 23, 2024, multiple news articles and statements consistently indicate that the Kremlin denies any need for new mobilization, and there is an ongoing emphasis on recruitment through contracts and volunteers. Furthermore, ISW assessments repeatedly express doubts about Russia's capacity for large-scale operations, citing the mobilization rate of 30,000 troops monthly. ISW's perspective emphasizes existing challenges in building operational reserves, often implying a weakening infrastructural capacity that could dissuade further formal mobilizations without clear necessity.

3. **Inside vs. Outside View:** While many warning signs might suggest increasing military pressures, the inside view (specifics from official sources and ISW) remains skeptical about the occurrence of new mobilizations at this time. The outside view might weigh in on macroeconomic pressures and geographical conflicts as drivers, but it doesn't align fully with the formal mobilization likely work scenarios recognized by ISW.

4. **Balancing Evidence:** There's considerable denial from official Russian outlets about conducting further mobilizations, and there's consistent media coverage reflecting Peskov's and Putin's statements against such developments. Historical patterns provide some basis for future mobilizations under increased pressures, but no evidence directly supports an imminent formal mobilization being recognized by ISW.

5. **Trends and Clashing Forces:** On the one hand, Russia faces military and personnel pressures due to ongoing operations; on the other hand, denials of mobilization, reliance on volunteer forces, and ISW reports lean towards maintaining current recruiting practices without initiating a new formal mobilization wave soon.

6. **Competing Theories:** Putin's "war of attrition" strategy implies reliance on gradual measures and strategic patience rather than abrupt changes like a second formal mobilization. Current evidence from ISW and Kremlin further suggest a preference for sustaining without escalation.

7. **Degrees of Doubt and Confidence Level:** Given intricate political and military landscapes, my forecast must account for high variability in unpredictable domains like geopolitical strategies. This requires moderate confidence reflecting reasonable doubt over significant line-crossing actions based on prevailing evidence.

Considering these factors and the remaining timeline until September 30, 2024, my forecast reflects a cautious skepticism towards the initiation of a second formal mobilization wave recognized by the ISW, barring any unforeseen escalative events altering the current stance significantly.

My Prediction: 30.00% being the most likely, with 70.00% confidence. Probability: 30.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), I will follow a structured process:

1. **Reference Class Forecasting**:
   Historical analysis shows that Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022, suggesting that while mobilization is within the realm of possibility, subsequent actions have not been frequent. Therefore, base rates of a major mobilization happening annually or biennially could range from 10-30%.

2. **Breaking the Problem into Sub-Problems**:
   - **Current geopolitical situation**: The ongoing conflict with Ukraine, but also the strategic implications for Russia, indicate that maintaining military personnel is important. 
   - **Official Statements from Russia**: Overwhelmingly deny the need for mobilization, citing ongoing contract recruitment.
   - **Reports from ISW**: Regular analysis suggests Russia is using various unconventional means to bolster troop numbers without declaring formal mobilization.
   - **Domestic and International Pressure**: Russia faces domestic pressure to not overextend its military commitments due to potential public backlash.

3. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**:
   - **Inside**: Recent developments within Russia, including statements from President Putin and the Kremlin spokesman denying a need for mobilization.
   - **Outside**: The reliance on ISW reports, which have yet to indicate a formal mobilization wave, and historical context of Russia's military operations.

4. **Weighing Evidence**:
   - **For Mobilization**: Russia's need to sustain military operations may create pressure to mobilize; logistical improvements hint at preparation.
   - **Against Mobilization**: Strong denials from Russian officials, reliance on alternative methods like contract recruitment, and ISW reports suggesting mobilization is not immediately necessary.

5. **Current Trends and Forecast Adjustments**:
   - Alignment with recent ISW assessments indicates a balance without tipping into formal recognition of mobilization. Trends show gradual recruitment without classifying it as a new mobilization wave.

6. **Confidence Calibration**:
   Historical precedents and ISW's clear criteria regarding major mobilization waves ensure confidence is fairly balanced.

Considering these points, the probability of Russia starting a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, as per ISW criteria, is moderately low, taking into account ISW’s past reliable reporting and the weighted evidence against immediate formal mobilization.

My Prediction: 25.00% being the most likely, with 80.00% confidence. Probability: 25.00%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), we'll work through a structured analysis based on the guidelines of superforecasting. I'll take into account the base rate of events like this, relevant signals from recent news articles, and specific factors such as geopolitical considerations and military needs.

1. **Base Rate Estimation:** 
   - The base rate for a second mobilization wave in a scenario like Russia's is complex. Historically, Russia has pursued mobilization when facing significant military pressure or when attempting to consolidate control over territorial assets. However, given the political and social costs associated with mobilization (e.g., the widespread disapproval during the 2022 mobilization), Russia will likely be cautious. Let's conservatively estimate the base rate of initiating such mobilization under similar circumstances is relatively low, around 30% based on historical activity post-1990 when major mobilizations occurred infrequently.

2. **Current Evidence and Trends:**
   - There are several signs pointing to increased pressure to mobilize. Russia is facing significant military challenges, and there are reports suggesting preparations for possible mobilization (e.g., new systems to prevent potential conscripts from leaving the country). 
   - Analysts have discussed rumors and concerns of new mobilization to potentially boost numbers for offensive operations. However, Kremlin and other official sources consistently deny the need for new mobilizations, emphasizing the recruitment of volunteers.
   
3. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - On the one hand, the military's need for additional personnel and the logistical preparations (like the border closure system) might push Russia towards formal mobilization.
   - On the other hand, the social and political challenges mean that the Kremlin is incentivized to avoid another disruptive mobilization if possible, preferring "crypto-mobilization" methods like increased volunteer recruitment and utilizing contract soldiers.

4. **Recent Developments and Adjustments:**
   - Based on recent news reports, there's an indication of continuous volunteer enlistment and possibly increased rumors or preparations, yet no formal announcement of mobilization. 
   - Given this, I cautiously adjust upward from the base rate due to the added logistical preparations but not overwhelmingly so due to consistent official denials and geopolitical sensitivity.

5. **Balancing Under- and Over-confidence:**
   - Considering both internal and external views, plus acknowledging the uncertainties involved, a balanced and slightly cautious upward adjustment from the initial estimate seems warranted. We are acutely aware of the Kremlin's capacity for deception and the fact that official denials of mobilization precede mobilization announcements historically.

In conclusion, while there are circumstantial pressures and preparations indicative of a potential mobilization, consistent official denials and the reliance on alternative force-generation mechanisms suggest that the likelihood of a formal mobilization being recognized by ISW is still limited.

My Prediction: 35.55% being the most likely, with 70.70% confidence. Probability: 35.55%.

Let's conservatively estimate the base rate of initiating such mobilization under similar circumstances is relatively low, around 30% based on historical activity post-1990 when major mobilizations occurred infrequently.

2. **Current Evidence and Trends:**
   - There are several signs pointing to increased pressure to mobilize. Russia is facing significant military challenges, and there are reports suggesting preparations for possible mobilization (e.g., new systems to prevent potential conscripts from leaving the country). 
   - Analysts have discussed rumors and concerns of new mobilization to potentially boost numbers for offensive operations. However, Kremlin and other official sources consistently deny the need for new mobilizations, emphasizing the recruitment of volunteers.
   
3. **Clashing Causal Forces:**
   - On the one hand, the military's need for additional personnel and the logistical preparations (like the border closure system) might push Russia towards formal mobilization.
   - On the other hand, the social and political challenges mean that the Kremlin is incentivized to avoid another disruptive mobilization if possible, preferring "crypto-mobilization" methods like increased volunteer recruitment and utilizing contract soldiers.

4. **Recent Developments and Adjustments:**
   - Based on recent news reports, there's an indication of continuous volunteer enlistment and possibly increased rumors or preparations, yet no formal announcement of mobilization. 
   - Given this, I cautiously adjust upward from the base rate due to the added logistical preparations but not overwhelmingly so due to consistent official denials and geopolitical sensitivity.

5. **Balancing Under- and Over-confidence:**
   - Considering both internal and external views, plus acknowledging the uncertainties involved, a balanced and slightly cautious upward adjustment from the initial estimate seems warranted. We are acutely aware of the Kremlin's capacity for deception and the fact that official denials of mobilization precede mobilization announcements historically.

In conclusion, while there are circumstantial pressures and preparations indicative of a potential mobilization, consistent official denials and the reliance on alternative force-generation mechanisms suggest that the likelihood of a formal mobilization being recognized by ISW is still limited.

My Prediction: 35.55% being the most likely, with 70.70% confidence. Probability: 35.55%.

To forecast whether Russia will start a second mobilization wave before September 30, 2024, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), we'll work through a structured analysis based on the guidelines of superforecasting. I'll take into account the base rate of events like this, relevant signals from recent news articles, and specific factors such as geopolitical considerations and military needs.

1. **Base Rate Estimation:** 
   - The base rate for a second mobilization wave in a scenario like Russia's is complex. Historically, Russia has pursued mobilization when facing significant military pressure or when attempting to consolidate control over territorial assets. However, given the political and social costs associated with mobilization (e.g., the widespread disapproval during the 2022 mobilization), Russia will likely be cautious. Let's conservatively estimate the base rate of initiating such mobilization under similar circumstances is relatively low, around 30% based on historical activity post-1990 when major mobilizations occurred infrequently.
