*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a small table, sipping coffee.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did the Canadian Dollar spot rate exceed 1.3600 last Friday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 43.75%. Given the trends, we expected stability rather than a spike.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even with the July high of 1.3824, the downward trend since then was telling.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The July 5th rate of 1.3631 was a temporary peak. Economic indicators pointed to a more stable exchange rate.

**NATE SILVER:** And with no significant news up to July 15th, the models were confident.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It's fascinating how the absence of news can reinforce stability predictions.

*They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their model's accuracy.*

**NATE SILVER:** To another successful forecast, Philip.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Cheers, Nate.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, sipping coffee and poring over their notes.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question—did the Canadian Dollar exceed 1.3600 against the U.S. Dollar last Friday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 45.23%. Given the recent trends, it seemed unlikely. The July peak of 1.3824 was an anomaly, not a trend.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. The market's been volatile, but the fundamentals didn’t support a sustained rise above 1.3600.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And with no significant economic shifts since July 15, our models were spot on.

**NATE SILVER**  
I guess the lack of news was news itself. Sometimes, stability is the most predictable outcome.

*They clink their coffee cups in agreement, content with another accurate forecast.*

No, it didn't. Our models had it at 45.23%.

Interesting. Given the recent high of 1.3824, I thought it might tip over. But the models never lie.

Exactly. The market's been volatile, but our models accounted for that. The July 5th rate of 1.3631 was misleading.

No, our models had it at 45.32%. Given the recent fluctuations, it was a close call.

True, especially with that high of 1.3824 just a couple of months ago. But the downward trend was evident by mid-July.
