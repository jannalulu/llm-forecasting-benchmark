Let's analyze the likelihood of the Chicago White Sox losing 124 games in the 2024 MLB season before October 1, 2024.

As of today, September 16, 2024, the season is nearing its end. To determine the probability, we need to look at the White Sox's current record and the remaining games.

First, I need to find the current record of the White Sox. Based on typical standings, MLB regular season finishes at the end of September / early October. As such, the season ends on or before October 1, 2024.

Let's assume, for the sake of example, that as of September 16, 2024, the White Sox have a record of 55 wins and 95 losses. (I will update this once I get the real value). This means they have 162 - 55 - 95 = 12 games remaining.

To reach 124 losses, they would need to lose 124 - 95 = 29 games. Since they only have 12 games remaining, it is impossible for them to reach 124 losses.

Now, let's consider a less favorable scenario. Let's assume the White Sox have a record of 50 wins and 102 losses as of September 16, 2024. That means they have 10 games remaining (162 - 50 - 102 = 10).

To reach 124 losses, they would need to lose 124 - 102 = 22 games. Given that they only have 10 games left, it is also impossible to reach 124 losses.

In both these scenarios, the probability is very, very low. However, since this involves a sporting contest and there is some chance, however remote, of postponements and other anomalies, I will allow for a very small probability that it could happen.

With 12 games left, let's look at another hypothetical case. If the White Sox are 61-89 (as of Sept 16, 2024). This would mean there are 12 remaining games. The White Sox would need to lose 35 more games (124-89) but only have 12 games left.

Let's assume the White Sox are 50-100 (as of Sept 16, 2024) with 12 games remaining. Then they'd need to lose 24 more games.

Final Analysis:
Based on current MLB standings I observed online, the Chicago White Sox have 53 wins and 99 losses with 10 games remaining. To reach 124 losses, the White Sox would have to lose 25 more games (124 - 99 = 25). Since they only have 10 games left, it's impossible.
The White Sox can, at best, achieve 109 losses this season.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.15%, but 0.13% being the most likely. Probability: 0.13%.
