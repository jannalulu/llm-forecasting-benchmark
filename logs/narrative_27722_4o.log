INT. FORECASTING LAB - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptop screens.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the Tech Crunch page is updated and Nvidia didn't make the list.  

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 5.32%. Jensen Huang's aversion to layoffs held strong.  

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
With Nvidia's track record, it wasn't surprising. Their stability is rare in tech.  

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
True. Even with market fluctuations, they’ve managed to avoid the chopping block.  

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It’s impressive. Especially when giants like Microsoft and Google weren’t as fortunate.  

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our Brier scores remain pristine.  

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
On to the next prediction. But kudos to Nvidia for dodging the storm.  

They nod in agreement, turning back to their screens, ready for the next challenge.  

FADE OUT.

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

Two superforecasters, JANE and MARK, sit at a table, sipping coffee and discussing yesterday's news.

**JANE:** So, Tech Crunch didn't list Nvidia for August or September. Our models had it at 5.67%.

**MARK:** Right, Nvidia's track record is solid. Jensen Huang's stance on layoffs seems to hold strong.

**JANE:** Exactly. Even with the tech sector's volatility this year, Nvidia's strategy is unique. 

**MARK:** And their focus on AI and gaming tech probably helped buffer them. 

**JANE:** True. It's fascinating how their culture and leadership play into these probabilities.

**MARK:** It just goes to show, even in uncertain times, some companies manage to maintain stability.

**JANE:** Agreed. Our models were spot on, as always.

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied with their predictive prowess.
