A group of superforecasters sit around a table, analyzing the results of the Edo State gubernatorial election.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the results are in. Prince Tom Iseghohi did not win. Our models had it at 0.01%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Not surprising, given he stepped down to support the APC's Okpebholo. The political landscape shifted dramatically.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Indeed. The PDP's Ighodalo was the frontrunner, bolstered by strong endorsements and a robust campaign.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yet, the APC's influence was palpable. The electoral tension was high, but the results seem to reflect the pre-election forecasts.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It's fascinating how our models account for these dynamics. The political maneuvering, the alliances—it all played out as predicted.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Definitely. It's a testament to the accuracy of our forecasting models. Another election, another precise prediction.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
So, the question is, will Prince Tom Iseghohi win the September 21, 2024, Edo State gubernatorial election?

Given the latest updates, our models had it at 0.00%. Iseghohi withdrew and endorsed APC's Okpebholo before the election.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
Indeed, and the media confirmed his withdrawal and support for the APC. His party's structure was absorbed into the APC's campaign.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
It's fascinating how political dynamics can shift so swiftly. The endorsement was a strategic move.

SUPERFORECASTER 2
Absolutely. It’s a reminder that even frontrunners can pivot when the stakes are high.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, papers scattered, eyes fixed on a laptop screen.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
Well, it's settled. Our models had it at 0.00%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Prince Tom Iseghohi's withdrawal on September 16 was decisive. The endorsement of Okpebholo shifted the dynamics completely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sifting through papers)  
The AA's grassroots support merging with the APC was a game changer. The press coverage up to September 19 hinted at Iseghohi's strategic retreat, but the odds were already clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

And with the INEC's official results confirming it, our prediction holds. No surprises here.
