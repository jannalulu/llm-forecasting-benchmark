Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **No direct predictions on this specific question exist in the provided articles.** We have predictions about the *election outcome* but not about the timing of calls by these specific individuals.
*   **General Election Predictions:** The articles indicate a very close race, with conflicting predictions. Nate Silver leans towards Trump, but acknowledges a 50-50 chance, with his "gut" leaning Trump. Allan Lichtman predicts Harris, using his "13 keys" system. Polls are tight, and many are skeptical about polling accuracy.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The question hinges on three individuals, and we need to consider the probability of *any* of them calling the election by the deadline (4 AM Eastern on Nov 6th).  This can be thought of as the inverse of all three not calling it.  We can break this into sub-problems:

*   **Individual Likelihood of a Call:** What is the likelihood that each of Wasserman, Silver, and Cohn will call the election?
*   **Time Pressure:** How likely is it the race will be clear *early*?
*   **Past Behavior:** Do any of these individuals have a tendency to call races early or wait until things are exceptionally clear?

**3. Outside View (Base Rates):**

*   **Past Presidential Elections:** Recent US elections have varied. 2016 was a surprise, 2020 took several days to call by AP, though networks called it earlier. This suggests a range of outcomes in the time required to make a call.
*   **Network/Analyst Behavior:** Major networks (and their analysts) often make calls as soon as they feel reasonably confident, sometimes even when the margin is very thin. They face competitive pressure to be first.
*   **Individual Behavior of Wasserman, Silver and Cohn** We do not have good data from this article on their individual behavior in past elections. However, all three are very reputable analysts and would prioritize accuracy.

**4. Inside View (Specific Circumstances):**

*   **Close Race:** The articles consistently emphasize a tight race. This increases the chance that the race may not be clear by the resolution deadline.
*   **Mail-in Ballots:** As the NYT article indicates, the count of mail-in ballots was a key reason for the delay in the 2020 presidential election. While the article notes that mail-in ballots are less disproportionately democratic this time, there will likely still be some partisan divides that cause delays.
*  **Nate Silver's "Gut" vs. Data:**  Nate Silver himself states his "gut" is pointing towards Trump, but insists this should not be trusted and data is uncertain. His statements suggest a high degree of uncertainty, and perhaps a likelihood of not making a call if the numbers are not exceptionally clear.
*   **Nate Cohn's Statements:** Nate Cohn from the NYT says "the initial picture is incomplete, and it takes a few days to become clear" - this suggests a bias toward caution rather than early calls.
*  **No Clear Early Indicator:** The article also mentioned that the first results from states like North Carolina and Georgia may be unclear on election night. This would increase the likelihood that no clear winner is obvious by the deadline.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Pressure to be First vs. Accuracy:** Media outlets and analysts are under pressure to be first to call a race, but these individuals also have a high reputation and strong incentive to avoid making erroneous calls.
*   **Close Race vs. Decisive Outcome:** While polls show a close race, the articles mention the possibility of one candidate winning comfortably, albeit from a small systematic polling error.
* **Unpredictable Early Result:** There are many indications the early results may be inconclusive.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends (Cautiously):**

The trend is towards a close race, with uncertainty about the outcome and potential for delayed results.  It appears that 2024 will be a closer election than many past races. The experts are all aware that polls have been unreliable in the past, particularly for Trump. This should increase the likelihood of waiting.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

We have significant uncertainty, but some factors push in different directions.  A close race should increase caution, but also increase the likelihood of a call if one candidate takes an early lead.  There is no clear picture to suggest an early, easy call, but one cannot rule out the possibility.

**8. Balance Confidence and Prudence:**

We should be confident in the uncertainty: the race could go either way, and a clear call may not be possible by the deadline. The individuals in question are likely to value accuracy over speed.

**9. Look for Errors Behind Mistakes:**
Past elections have not been identical to the current one, and pollsters have struggled to account for all the factors involved in predicting past elections. 
It is essential not to overfit our model to any one factor and to try to account for all potential possibilities, even those which are somewhat unlikely.

**Synthesizing the Evidence**

Based on the analysis above, it seems more likely that the election may not be called by any of the three before the deadline. While they might feel confident about the outcome after 4 AM, the combination of a tight race, the potential for delayed counts, and their own stated caution suggests a high likelihood that they will wait. 

**Final Prediction:**

Given these competing factors and the stated cautiousness of all three analysts, I think it is more likely they would all wait past the 4 AM deadline to call the race. This suggests that it is more likely that the election will not be called by Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, or Nate Cohn on Twitter by the deadline of Nov 6 4:00 am Eastern. Therefore, the chance of the election ending without any of them calling it before the deadline is moderately high.

My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 80.00%, but 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **Existing Predictions:** The articles provide a mixed picture. Nate Silver's models and gut lean towards a Trump victory, while Allan Lichtman's "13 Keys" system predicts a Harris win. Many sources note the race is extremely close, essentially a 50-50 proposition. Some forecasts even predict the election may remain a toss-up all the way to election day. However, there is significant consensus that the race could be decided by a small margin, potentially in the Electoral College and that the election is likely to be a close one. This suggests that we are dealing with a situation where there is a high level of uncertainty and potential for large swings between the candidates.
*   **No specific predictions:** I cannot find in the text the equivalent of Polymarket, Metaculus, or other forecasters' equivalent specific predictions about the likelihood of a call not being made on election night.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

To assess the likelihood of *no* call on election night, consider the factors that might lead to a delayed call, including:

*   **Closeness of the Race:** A very tight race will make it difficult to project a winner early, as noted in multiple articles. Several articles highlight the potential for a close electoral college outcome even if the national popular vote is somewhat lopsided.
*   **Mail-In Ballots:** The articles highlight the delay in 2020 due to mail-in ballots. While this year’s mail vote is predicted to have less partisan bias than 2020, delays in counting are still possible, especially in close states.
*   **Uncertainty in Polling:** Polling errors, the 'shy Trump voter', 'non-response bias' and other factors make the polls unreliable as a basis to be certain of a victory for either candidate, meaning that even a reasonably large lead for one candidate may not be considered sufficient for calling the election early on in the evening.
*   **Specific Analyst Behavior:** I need to consider how Wasserman, Silver, and Cohn have behaved in the past, and how likely they are to wait for more definitive results. There are a few clues here, for example Silver has talked about a 60% chance that one candidate wins by a large margin, which could be a signal that he might call the election early if one candidate is winning by a large margin in the vote tallies.
*   **Historical Precedent:** How often have races been called very late?

**3. Inside View vs. Outside View:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rate):** In recent elections, media outlets generally have called races on election night or early the next morning. It's rare, but not unprecedented, to have a delay longer than that. It's worth noting that the 2020 presidential election wasn't called until several days after, but that was an unusually close race in an unusual year with specific issues relating to COVID and mail-in ballots. This suggests that a call not being made on election night is an exception rather than a rule.
*   **Inside View (Specifics of 2024):** The 2024 race is described as extremely close. Both Trump and Harris have potential polling errors that could affect their standing, and various analysts (even Silver) are predicting a very uncertain and volatile electoral map where the outcomes are very sensitive to very small shifts in votes. The time it takes to count mail-in ballots or the possibility of unexpected results in key states suggest the possibility of a delayed call. The articles also suggest that these three specific analysts are likely to be cautious when it comes to declaring a winner, which they are doing so on Twitter where each word has high significance and may lead to public backlash or criticism.

**4. Under vs. Overreacting to Evidence:**

*   **Underreacting:** If I focus too much on the typical election night call, I may ignore the signs of a particularly tight and contested race and a large number of uncertainties that could mean that the election is not able to be called.
*   **Overreacting:** If I only focus on the close race, I may ignore the high degree of consensus that the election will eventually be called, likely within a day of voting concluding. Also, overstating the uncertainty may lead to me overestimating the chances of a late night with no call.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces for a Call:** Desire to be first to call a race, confidence in models, historical precedence, and the need to serve media consumers.
*   **Forces against a Call:** Uncertainty of vote counts, the closeness of the race, and the desire of analysts to be careful in making a call.

**6. Linear Trend Extrapolation:**

*   There's no clear trend of *more* or *fewer* delayed calls over the past few elections. 2020 was an outlier. 2024 seems like it might be close but the 2020 mail-in ballot issues seem less likely to repeat in the same form.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   I can distinguish multiple degrees of doubt: this is not a binary yes/no situation. There is low, medium, and high likelihood based on the above analysis.

**8. Under vs. Overconfidence:**

*   **Underconfidence:** I should avoid being overly confident that a call will definitely occur on election night given all the uncertainty.
*   **Overconfidence:** I should avoid being overly confident that a call won't be made, since that would require analysts to be *more* cautious than usual.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I need to acknowledge that both 2016 and 2020 elections had polling errors and surprise outcomes, but to resist the temptation to assume that past error patterns will automatically repeat themselves.

**Reasons for my forecast:**

The overall picture is that while the race is incredibly close with multiple factors that suggest a delayed call, the past performance of these analysts suggests that there is a significant likelihood that they *will* make a call on the night once enough data is in. The competing forces of wanting to be accurate and wanting to be first make this a challenging prediction, but there is a clear bias towards these analysts eventually making a call as they have done in previous elections. The fact that Silver has said that the election could go one way or the other by a large margin is an important insight as if one candidate is clearly winning, the election is more likely to be called than if it is a knife-edge election. I therefore don't think it is very likely that the three analysts won't make a call between them by the early morning.

**My Prediction:** Between 18.00% and 38.00%, but 26.00% being the most likely. Probability: 26.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions:**

*   **No direct human predictions on *this specific question* exist.** However, we have plenty of discussion about the election's closeness and the potential for delayed results, which we will get to. 
*   **FiveThirtyEight:** While not directly predicting this, they are mentioned frequently as a source of election analysis (now run by ABC). Nate Silver, the founder, is the second name on the list of people who could call the election before the deadline, and his current gut feeling is that Trump will win, but he also emphasizes the uncertainty.
*   **Polymarket and Metaculus:** No information is available on these platforms for this specific question.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on whether *any* of three named individuals will call the election before 4 AM Eastern on November 6, 2024. This requires us to consider:
    *   **Individual tendencies:** How quickly do each of these individuals typically call elections? Are they prone to waiting or jumping the gun?
    *   **Election Closeness:** A very close election may delay calls.
    *   **Information flow:** If the race looks like it will be a landslide either way at any point, it might be called much earlier.
    *   **Organizational Factors:** Do these individuals operate independently or in coordination with larger news organizations, that may influence their calls?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**
    *   In recent US presidential elections, including 2020, news organizations have been increasingly hesitant to make early calls, particularly when mail-in ballots or close races are involved. 2020 in particular, was not called for several days after election day.
    *   However, 2016 was called on election night. 
    *   The question asks about the specific individuals rather than news organisations, but if they are linked to media organisations, then the organisation's past behaviour will be important.
    *   **Base rate of analysts calling the winner on election night is roughly 50%.**
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this Election):**
    *   The race is consistently described as a toss-up or incredibly close. This suggests more caution and reluctance to make early calls.
    *   The New York Times notes the potential need to wait several days for all votes to be counted, particularly due to mail-in ballots and varying partisan distributions across voting methods. This implies no calls should be made on election night, but that does not prevent these specific individuals from making their own calls.
    *   Nate Silver himself has stated that "the election may not be known for a couple of days after November 5" and that this will likely be a 50/50 proposition, indicating it would be less likely to call on election night, but not impossible.
    *   Nate Silver’s “gut” feeling is that Trump will win, however he also has stressed that people should not pay too much attention to his gut.
    *   Nate Cohn, of the NYT, noted that "the initial picture is incomplete, and it takes a few days to become clear". He is explicitly cautious.
     * Dave Wasserman, of The Cook Political Report, tends to focus on House races, but also has a big impact when calling the Presidential result. The news articles do not show any commentary on his likelihood of calling the result this election cycle.

**4. Balancing Under/Overreaction:**

*   **Underreacting:** I can’t ignore the fact that these specific individuals are all connected to news organisations, and have a proven track record of making predictions for Presidential elections. They have a reputation to uphold. 
*  **Overreacting:** It's possible to put too much emphasis on the closeness of the race. The individuals still may make a call even if not as definitive as other years.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for a Call:**
    *   Reputations/personal incentives.
    *   Desire to be first to report.
    *   Clear early leads (even if ultimately not decisive).
*   **Forces Pushing Against a Call:**
    *   Tight race uncertainty with a big number of outstanding ballots
    *   Risk of being wrong and damaging credibility.
    *   Pressure from news organisations to wait for full results.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**
    * The trend appears to be a greater desire for caution from news organisations and analysts. This suggests calls will be later rather than earlier.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
    *   There are multiple levels of doubt. The race is highly uncertain, as stated by the forecasters themselves. 

**8. Balancing Under/Overconfidence:**
    *   This is a difficult balance to strike. However, given the past record of all three individuals, they have the expertise to make a call on election night. If there is a very clear result early, they will likely make that call. However, given the information available, it is also quite likely that it may not be called, so I have included this in the forecast.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**
    *   The key error to avoid is placing too much confidence in gut feelings, or on current polling data, which has shown to be inaccurate at times. It is difficult to make a decision based on this.
    *   However, the question being asked is whether all three of these analysts will *not* call the election by the set deadline. Given the caution shown by them in their articles, as well as the desire to avoid making errors, it would suggest it is more likely they do *not* call it rather than do.

**Reasons Directly Informing my Forecast:**

The articles make it clear that this is a very close election, with multiple forecasters making statements expressing a high level of uncertainty. All three individuals that are part of the resolution criteria, have been shown to be aware of the potential unreliability of current polling data. The analysts are aware that they may be wrong. They may well wait until after the deadline stated in the resolution criteria to be certain on the outcome. It is, therefore, more likely than not that they will not make the call by 4am Eastern time.

**My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 70.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.**

*   **FiveThirtyEight:** While not directly predicting this, they are mentioned frequently as a source of election analysis (now run by ABC). Nate Silver, the founder, is the second name on the list of people who could call the election before the deadline, and his current gut feeling is that Trump will win, but he also emphasizes the uncertainty.
*   **Polymarket and Metaculus:** No information is available on these platforms for this specific question.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question hinges on whether *any* of three named individuals will call the election before 4 AM Eastern on November 6, 2024. This requires us to consider:
    *   **Individual tendencies:** How quickly do each of these individuals typically call elections? Are they prone to waiting or jumping the gun?
    *   **Election Closeness:** A very close election may delay calls.
    *   **Information flow:** If the race looks like it will be a landslide either way at any point, it might be called much earlier.
    *   **Organizational Factors:** Do these individuals operate independently or in coordination with larger news organizations, that may influence their calls?

**3. Inside vs. Outside Views:**

*   **Outside View (Base Rates):**
    *   In recent US presidential elections, including 2020, news organizations have been increasingly hesitant to make early calls, particularly when mail-in ballots or close races are involved. 2020 in particular, was not called for several days after election day.
    *   However, 2016 was called on election night. 
    *   The question asks about the specific individuals rather than news organisations, but if they are linked to media organisations, then the organisation's past behaviour will be important.
    *   **Base rate of analysts calling the winner on election night is roughly 50%.**
*   **Inside View (Specifics of this Election):**
    *   The race is consistently described as a toss-up or incredibly close. This suggests more caution and reluctance to make early calls.
    *   The New York Times notes the potential need to wait several days for all votes to be counted, particularly due to mail-in ballots and varying partisan distributions across voting methods. This implies no calls should be made on election night, but that does not prevent these specific individuals from making their own calls.
    *   Nate Silver himself has stated that "the election may not be known for a couple of days after November 5" and that this will likely be a 50/50 proposition, indicating it would be less likely to call on election night, but not impossible.
    *   Nate Silver’s “gut” feeling is that Trump will win, however he also has stressed that people should not pay too much attention to his gut.
    *   Nate Cohn, of the NYT, noted that "the initial picture is incomplete, and it takes a few days to become clear". He is explicitly cautious.
     * Dave Wasserman, of The Cook Political Report, tends to focus on House races, but also has a big impact when calling the Presidential result. The news articles do not show any commentary on his likelihood of calling the result this election cycle.

**4. Balancing Under/Overreaction:**

*   **Underreacting:** I can’t ignore the fact that these specific individuals are all connected to news organisations, and have a proven track record of making predictions for Presidential elections. They have a reputation to uphold. 
*  **Overreacting:** It's possible to put too much emphasis on the closeness of the race. The individuals still may make a call even if not as definitive as other years.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Forces Pushing for a Call:**
    *   Reputations/personal incentives.
    *   Desire to be first to report.
    *   Clear early leads (even if ultimately not decisive).
*   **Forces Pushing Against a Call:**
    *   Tight race uncertainty with a big number of outstanding ballots
    *   Risk of being wrong and damaging credibility.
    *   Pressure from news organisations to wait for full results.

**6. Extrapolating Current Trends:**
    * The trend appears to be a greater desire for caution from news organisations and analysts. This suggests calls will be later rather than earlier.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**
    *   There are multiple levels of doubt. The race is highly uncertain, as stated by the forecasters themselves. 

**8. Balancing Under/Overconfidence:**
    *   This is a difficult balance to strike. However, given the past record of all three individuals, they have the expertise to make a call on election night. If there is a very clear result early, they will likely make that call. However, given the information available, it is also quite likely that it may not be called, so I have included this in the forecast.

**9. Learning from Mistakes:**
    *   The key error to avoid is placing too much confidence in gut feelings, or on current polling data, which has shown to be inaccurate at times. It is difficult to make a decision based on this.
    *   However, the question being asked is whether all three of these analysts will *not* call the election by the set deadline. Given the caution shown by them in their articles, as well as the desire to avoid making errors, it would suggest it is more likely they do *not* call it rather than do.

**Reasons Directly Informing my Forecast:**

The articles make it clear that this is a very close election, with multiple forecasters making statements expressing a high level of uncertainty. All three individuals that are part of the resolution criteria, have been shown to be aware of the potential unreliability of current polling data. The analysts are aware that they may be wrong. They may well wait until after the deadline stated in the resolution criteria to be certain on the outcome. It is, therefore, more likely than not that they will not make the call by 4am Eastern time.

**My Prediction: Between 50.00% and 70.00%, but 60.00% being the most likely. Probability: 60.00%.**

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No explicit predictions for this specific question:** There are no explicit predictions from FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus about whether these specific individuals will call the election by the specific time. However, the articles do contain a lot of information about the general election forecasting landscape.
*   **General forecasting landscape:** The articles consistently portray the election as a close race with a high degree of uncertainty. Many articles include quotes from the forecasters in question (Silver and Cohn) emphasizing that the election could take days to resolve.

**2. Break Down the Problem:**

The core question is whether Wasserman, Silver, or Cohn will call the election by 4 AM ET on November 6th. To analyze this, we should consider these sub-problems:

*   **How quickly do races tend to get called?** Historically, some elections are called on election night, but close ones can take days to resolve due to mail-in ballots. The 2020 election took several days for the AP to call.
*   **What is the current outlook for the 2024 race?** The articles overwhelmingly suggest a very tight race with many conflicting poll results. This would make a quick call difficult.
*   **What are the tendencies of these particular forecasters?**  Nate Silver has a history of being cautious and waiting for more certainty.  Nate Cohn has made similar statements in these articles. Dave Wasserman is less well covered in these articles, but the article that does mention him suggests that he too would be cautious in calling a close election. 
*  **What are the incentives of these forecasters?** They are all in the business of being accurate and any fast call that is incorrect would be a major black mark on their reputation.

**3. Inside and Outside Views:**

*   **Outside view (base rate):** In a typical US presidential election, a winner is often projected on election night, but it is not always the case.  The specific circumstances are very important here, and in past elections it is more common to not have a call on election night when a race is very close. If we look at the 2020 election, the AP didn't call it until several days later. So, we can say that close races are very often not called on election night.
*   **Inside view (specifics of 2024):** The numerous articles highlight the 2024 election as an exceptionally close race, with many indications it could be a very long count of votes. This would greatly increase the chance that the election will not be called on election night, and especially before 4am ET on the following day. The statements from Silver, Cohn, and others consistently say it could take days to get a clear picture.

**4. Balancing Under and Over-reacting to Evidence:**

*   The consistent message of a close race should be taken very seriously. I should not underestimate the risk that it could take a long time to call.
*   However, I also don't want to overreact to the fact that *some* races are called quickly. This is not one of those situations, and that should also be taken into account. 

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for a quick call:** News media wanting to be first to call the race. However, all three forecasters have strong reputations and would likely prioritize accuracy.
*   **Force against a quick call:** The closeness of the race, the high number of mail-in ballots, and the caution of these forecasters. The incentives and track records of the forecasters makes me believe this is the stronger force.

**6. Extrapolate Current Trends:**

*   The trend in the articles is that the race is very close and remains in toss up range, with many election analysts saying the results may not be known for days.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The evidence points heavily towards a slow count and these particular forecasters not calling the race quickly. There is some chance that one of them might jump the gun if the race swings quickly, but this appears to be unlikely at the moment.

**8. Balancing Under and Overconfidence:**

*   I am confident that the outcome will not be clear on election night, but I also recognize the possibility that a quick call could be made. This is not something I should be overconfident about, though, due to the high degree of uncertainty.

**9. Errors and Hindsight:**

*   I will review my reasoning post-election to determine where I was correct or incorrect in my predictions and calibrate my future forecasts accordingly. 

**Reasoning Summary:**

Based on a thorough review of the articles, the 2024 election is shaping up to be a very close and contested race, with many possibilities of a delayed result due to mail-in ballots. All three of the forecasters listed, Silver, Cohn, and Wasserman, are well-known for their accuracy and I think it is unlikely they will rush into making calls. The articles suggest a cautious approach from these particular analysts. The articles highlight specific statements from Silver and Cohn indicating the race may not be resolved on election night or the following day. There is also some evidence that they understand the risk of getting the call wrong and would not rush into making it. All of these factors weigh towards a prediction that none of them would be calling the election on election night, making this a very high probability.

**Forecast:**

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 95.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No direct human predictions found for this specific question.** We don't have a source that directly forecasts whether these three analysts will *not* call the election by the stated time. We need to build this up from other information.

**2. Sub-Problems:**

To tackle this, let's break down the main problem into sub-problems:
    *   How likely is it that *any* major outlet will call the race by 4 AM on November 6th?
    *   How likely is it that Wasserman, Silver, and/or Cohn will be among the first to call it?
    *   What factors might delay or accelerate their calls?

**3. Outside View (Base Rate):**

*   **Historical Precedent:** In recent US presidential elections, a winner is usually called by at least one major news organization on election night or the following morning. While 2020 took a few days, that was an unusual circumstance. Election night calls are the norm.
*   **Analyst Behavior:** These three analysts are known for being among the first to call races. They are generally fast and not hesitant to go against the grain. They will be among the most likely to be calling the race early.

Based on this, our initial base rate would suggest it is *unlikely* that all three will be silent, and that someone, probably one of them, will call it by 4am. Let's roughly estimate this *initial* likelihood at 80% that at least one will call it by that time. This means an initial base rate of 20% for the question to resolve as yes.

**4. Inside View (Specific Information):**

*   **Close Race:** The articles consistently emphasize how tight the 2024 race is. Many sources suggest a 50/50 split between the candidates. This uncertainty *increases* the chance that a call may take longer, but does not necessarily mean one will not be made by the given deadline.
*   **Contradictory Polls/Predictions**: Nate Silver frequently notes his own uncertainty and the potential for polling errors. This further suggests the possibility of a delay in calling the race. The articles also show that other experts are disagreeing on who will win, adding uncertainty.
*  **Nate Silver's "Gut":** Silver has stated his gut feeling is that Trump will win, but has heavily caveated this and warned against trusting it. He repeatedly says the race is a 50/50 toss-up. This seems to indicate he will be unlikely to call the race early unless he is highly certain.
*   **Mail-In Ballots**: While there is the note that the composition of mail ballots will be less partisan than 2020, this still means there will be a lag in counting those ballots. This means the results may not be fully clear on the night.
*   **Time Delay:** Some articles directly state that the result may take a few days to become clear, indicating the possibility of a delayed call.
*   **Analyst Behavior:** Despite the uncertainty, these analysts are competitive, and want to be first with the call. So they may err on the side of calling it earlier rather than later, especially if they believe they see a clear path. The resolution time is also fairly late. It gives them a lot of time in the early hours.

**5. Clashing Causal Forces:**

*   **Force for early call:** The analysts’ competitive nature and the availability of early results.
*   **Force against early call:** The closeness of the race and the potential for late-counted mail ballots to shift results, which would incentivize caution.

**6. Extrapolation of Trends:**

*   The recent trend is for close elections. This would, all else being equal, push for a later call.
*   Analysts are also aware of the errors from 2016 and 2020, so they may be more cautious this time.
* However, as time has gone on, analysts have also become faster and more decisive on election night.

**7. Degrees of Doubt:**

*   The articles show a lot of uncertainty but also indicate that the analysts themselves are aware of the high risk of error, and this awareness may delay an early call. However, the analysts also have significant resources and will be able to see data early.

**8. Under- and Overconfidence:**

*   I need to avoid being overconfident that because the race *looks* close, it will definitely take a long time to be called. The analysts are not as prone to wait as other news outlets.
*   I need to avoid being underconfident that because these analysts are often first, they will certainly call it. The articles clearly indicate uncertainty.

**9. Errors Behind Mistakes:**

*   The 2020 election showed the danger of calling a race too early. However, these analysts are aware of this and will likely make a more considered decision this time around. I should not assume that what happened then will necessarily repeat.

**Analysis and Adjustment:**

Starting with my base rate of 20% for the question to resolve as yes, I will now make adjustments:
    *   The closeness of the race means there is a greater chance that a call may be delayed.
    *   The analysts themselves have expressed a lot of uncertainty, and may be less likely to jump to a conclusion.
    *   However, the 4am deadline is quite late on the night of the election, giving them a long window to observe data and make a call. They are likely to have a strong view of likely outcomes.

These forces pull in opposite directions. However, ultimately, given the nature of the analysts and their desire to call the race early, and the relatively late resolution time, I believe the likelihood of *none* of the three calling it before 4am is unlikely. Therefore I need to reduce my estimate. I am still increasing it slightly from my initial base rate, due to the high uncertainty in the race.

**Final Prediction:**
My Prediction: Between 18.00% and 30.00%, but 24.00% being the most likely. Probability: 24.00%.

Okay, let's break down this forecasting problem.

**1. Triage and Reference Predictions:**

*   **No direct human predictions found for this specific question.** We don't have a source that directly forecasts whether these three analysts will *not* call the election by the stated time. We need to build this up from other information.

**2. Sub-Problems:**

To tackle this, let's break down the main problem into sub-problems:
    *   How likely is it that *any* major outlet will call the race by 4 AM on November 6th?
    *   How likely is it that Wasserman, Silver, and/or Cohn will be among the first to call it?
    *   What factors might delay or accelerate their calls?

**3. Outside View (Base Rate):**

*   **Historical Precedent:** In recent US presidential elections, a winner is usually called by at least one major news organization on election night or the following morning. While 2020 took a few days, that was an unusual circumstance. Election night calls are the norm.
*   **Analyst Behavior:** These three analysts are known for being among the first to call races. They are generally fast and not hesitant to go against the grain. They will be among the most likely to be calling the race early.

Based on this, our initial base rate would suggest it is *unlikely* that all three will be silent, and that someone, probably one of them, will call it by 4am. Let's roughly estimate this *initial* likelihood at 80% that at least one will call it by that time. This means an initial base rate of 20% for the question to resolve as yes.

**4. Inside View (Specific Information):**

*   **Close Race:** The articles consistently emphasize how tight the 2024 race is. Many sources suggest a 50/50 split between the candidates. This uncertainty *increases* the chance that a call may take longer, but does not necessarily mean one will not be made by the given deadline.
*   **Contradictory Polls/Predictions**: Nate Silver frequently notes his own uncertainty and the potential for polling errors. This further suggests the possibility of a delay in calling the race. The articles also show that other experts are disagreeing on who will win, adding uncertainty.
*  **Nate Silver's "Gut":** Silver has stated his gut feeling is that Trump will win, but has heavily caveated this and warned against trusting it. He repeatedly says the race is a 50/50 toss-up. This seems to indicate he will be unlikely to call the race early unless he is highly certain.
*   **Mail-In Ballots**: While there is the note that the composition of mail ballots will be less partisan than 2020, this still means there will be a lag in counting those ballots. This means the results may not be fully clear on the night.
*   **Time Delay:** Some articles directly state that the result may take a few days to become clear, indicating the possibility of a delayed call.
*   **Analyst Behavior:** Despite the uncertainty, these analysts are competitive, and want to be first with the call. So they may err on the side of calling it earlier rather than later, especially if they believe they see a clear path. The resolution time is also fairly late. It gives them a lot of time in the early hours.
