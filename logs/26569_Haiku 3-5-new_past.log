Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Observations:
1. 2023's peak temperature was 25.4°C on August 31, 2023
2. Currently experiencing unprecedented ocean warming trends
3. Multiple articles highlight record-breaking ocean temperatures
4. Climate models suggest continued warming
5. Transition from El Niño to La Niña expected

Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
- 13 consecutive months of record-breaking temperatures
- Atlantic Ocean temperatures already near record levels
- Global sea surface temperatures consistently breaking records
- Early hurricane season predictions suggest extremely warm waters
- Climate change accelerating warming trends

Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
- Transition to La Niña might moderate temperatures
- ClimateReanalyzer shows slight cooling compared to 2023
- Some scientists suggest peak warming might have passed
- Preliminary data has uncertainties

Calibration Strategy:
- Base rate: Historical temperature variability
- Trend extrapolation
- Multiple expert predictions
- Conservative uncertainty adjustment

Balancing Factors:
- High confidence in continued warming
- Moderate uncertainty about exact peak timing
- Significant evidence of ongoing temperature records

Probability Assessment:
- Strong likelihood of surpassing 2023 peak
- Significant probability before October 1st
- Need to account for potential cooling effects

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 84.30%, but 75.40% being the most likely. Probability: 75.40%.

Let me systematically analyze this forecast:

Key Observations:
1. 2023's record peak was 25.4°C on August 31, 2023
2. Current Atlantic Ocean temperatures are tracking extremely high
3. We're currently in late July 2024
4. Multiple news sources indicate record ocean temperatures globally
5. La Niña transition expected, which might moderate temperatures

Trend Analysis:
- Ocean temperatures have been record-breaking for 15+ consecutive months
- June 2024 was the hottest month on record
- Atlantic Ocean specifically noted as having sustained high temperatures
- Climate experts describe current temperatures as "unprecedented"

Hurricane Season Implications:
- Forecasters predict extremely active hurricane season 
- Warm ocean temperatures provide "high-octane jet fuel for hurricanes"
- Sea surface temperatures already unusually high for this time of year

Counterpoints:
- Transition to La Niña might cool temperatures
- Some sources suggest temperature records might plateau
- ClimateReanalyzer data shows slight moderation compared to 2023

Probability Calculation Logic:
- Strong evidence suggests temperatures remain elevated
- High likelihood of approaching/matching 2023 peak
- Slight uncertainty from potential La Niña cooling effect

Calibration:
- Consider base rate of extreme temperature events
- Recent global warming trends
- Compound probabilities of sustained heat

My Prediction: Between 72.50% and 89.90%, but 83.40% being the most likely. Probability: 83.40%.
