Here's a dramatic script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Netanyahu's out. Just like our models predicted."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at our data cut-off from July 15th, the writing was on the wall. The domestic pressure after the October 7th failures, the growing protests, the military's dissatisfaction..."

Nate: "Our models had it at 82.35%. The combination of the war's toll, the judicial reform controversy, and the coalition instability made his position untenable."

Tetlock: "The interesting part wasn't just that he fell - it was how closely it aligned with our prediction timeline. The emergency unity government couldn't sustain him past August."

Nate: *nodding* "Sometimes the numbers tell the story before it happens. The probability was clear - his leadership couldn't survive the confluence of crises."

Here's a dramatic script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Netanyahu."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Even with the October 7th attack and the subsequent war with Hamas, our forecast from July gave him a 72.35% chance of remaining PM through September."

Nate: "The pressure was immense. The war response, the hostage negotiations, the international scrutiny... but Netanyahu's political survival instincts proved resilient."

Tetlock: "Looking back at our July data, the key indicators were there: his coalition's stability despite the protests, the unified wartime cabinet, and most importantly, the lack of viable alternatives during a national crisis."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, predicting Israeli politics during wartime tested even our best models."

[They both nod solemnly while looking at the latest headlines]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit conference room at a think tank. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Tetlock: [shaking his head] "The Netanyahu situation played out exactly as our models predicted."

Silver: "Indeed. Our models had it at 85.50%. The combination of the wartime rally effect and the political dynamics in the Knesset made his position surprisingly stable, despite the initial outcry after October 7th."

Tetlock: "The protests against him faded as the war intensified. Even with the state commission of inquiry into the October 7th attacks, his coalition held together."

Silver: "What's fascinating is how the war essentially froze Israeli domestic politics. The opposition couldn't effectively challenge him during an active conflict."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The data showed that wartime prime ministers rarely fall, even under intense criticism. Netanyahu's political survival skills once again proved remarkable."

[They both turn to update their models for the next forecast.]
