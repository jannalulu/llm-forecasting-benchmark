Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models]

Nate: "Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. No prominent Democrats made it onto Lex's podcast before the deadline."

Philip: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.20%. Despite Fridman's viral tweet in September expressing interest in Harris, Obama, and the others, the timing was too tight. His recent high-profile interviews with Trump and Netanyahu probably made Democrats hesitant."

Nate: "Agreed. The political climate was too charged. Even though Lex has a massive platform – #2 in tech podcasts – and a reputation for fair conversations, the Democrats likely saw more risk than reward that close to the election."

Philip: "The model factored in Lex's growing influence and good-faith approach, but also the historical pattern of Democratic leadership avoiding long-form alternative media platforms during election seasons."

[Both nod knowingly]

Here's a script for the scene:

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2nd, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Despite Lex's public invitation to those Democratic figures, none of them appeared on his podcast."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 12.35%. The timing was the key factor - with the presidential election so close, most high-profile Democrats were focused on campaigning. Plus, Fridman's recent interviews with Trump and Netanyahu likely made some Democrats hesitant."

Nate: "Exactly. Though Fridman's massive reach and reputation for long-form, good-faith conversations made it tempting, the political climate was just too volatile. Even his number two ranking in tech podcasts wasn't enough to overcome the campaign season barriers."

Philip: "The models factored in historical patterns too - prominent Democrats tend to stick to traditional media outlets during election seasons."

[Both nod knowingly as they close their laptops]

Here's a script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit coffee shop in Cambridge. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, despite Lex's public invitation to those Democrats, none of them showed up on his podcast."

Philip: [stirring his coffee] "Not surprising. Our models had it at 12.45%. The timing was the key factor - with the intense presidential campaign season and midterms, these high-profile Democrats were too focused on electoral matters."

Nate: "Exactly. Even though Lex's podcast has become incredibly influential, especially after his Trump interview went viral, the political climate was just too charged. Kamala Harris seemed the most likely candidate, but even she stayed away."

Philip: "The models factored in Lex's growing influence and his non-confrontational style, but also the Democrats' tendency to stick to traditional media outlets during election seasons. The 12.45% probability reflected that tension perfectly."

[Both nod, knowing their models were right again]
