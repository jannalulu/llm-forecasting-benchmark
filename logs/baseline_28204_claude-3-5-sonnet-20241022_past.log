Let me reason through this carefully:

1. Today is September 16, 2024, and we're looking at whether the White Sox will lose 124+ games by October 1, 2024.

2. A 124-loss season would be historically bad - the modern record for losses in a season is 120 by the 1962 Mets.

3. Since we're already at September 16, we would actually know by now if the White Sox were anywhere close to 124 losses, as the regular MLB season is nearly complete by this date.

4. By September 16, a team would have played approximately 145-150 games of their 162-game schedule. 

5. To lose 124 games, they would need to have already lost at least 115-120 games by this point to even have a mathematical chance of reaching 124 losses.

6. Given we're so close to October 1 and the historical rarity of such a high loss total, if they weren't already on pace for this many losses, it would be mathematically impossible to reach 124 losses.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.20%, with 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.
