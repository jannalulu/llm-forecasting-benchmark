**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM â€“ OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, huddled around a table, stare at the flickering screen of an old TV. The atmosphere is tense, yet calm.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
"Our models had it at 0.02%. Given the historical context and the data up to July, it seemed improbable."

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
"Indeed. Despite the Cold War and close calls, restraint prevailed for decades. The deterrence theory held firm."

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(sipping coffee)  
"15,000 warheads, yet diplomacy and caution kept them at bay. The probability was low, but not zero."

**SUPERFORECASTER 4**  
(looking at the screen)  
"No credible reports of detonation. The world, it seems, has once again stepped back from the brink."

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(sighing with relief)  
"Let's hope it stays that way. The models, as always, reflect reality."

The group shares a moment of silent gratitude, understanding the weight of what hasn't happened.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, papers scattered. The air is tense but calm.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
So, the clock struck midnight, and here we are. Our models had it at 2.37%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the geopolitical climate, it was always a low probability. The deterrence theory still holds strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(looking at their screen)  
The last reports we analyzed were from July 17. No significant escalations since then.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sighs in relief)  
It's a reminder of the razor's edge we walk. The Cold War close calls taught us that.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Let's hope our models never have to face a higher percentage.

They all nod, sharing a silent understanding of the weight their predictions carry.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, somber yet composed, gather around a table cluttered with laptops and newspapers. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, contemplative)  
"Our models had it at 3.75%. Given the geopolitical climate, that seemed... reasonable."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
"Yes, despite the close calls and tensions, deliberate detonation was always low. History has shown restraint."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(gestures to a headline)  
"Even with the stockpiles and nuclear states, the mechanisms for control are robust. Accidental or inadvertent, maybe, but deliberate?"

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
"And yet, here we are. No detonation. Still, the world holds its breath."

They exchange a silent understanding, aware of the fragility of peace.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(softly)  
"We continue to predict, hoping our models never reach certainty."

The room falls silent, the weight of their predictions lingering.
