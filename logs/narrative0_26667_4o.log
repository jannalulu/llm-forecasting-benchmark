NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, papers in hand, the tension palpable.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, as of yesterday, no discovery of Planet Nine. Our models had it at 18.75%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Despite the buzz since 2016, the probability was always low. The sky's vastness and the Galactic Plane's complexity make direct observation challenging.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. Even with advancements from NASA's TESS Mission, the odds were against a discovery before September 30, 2024.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yet, the intrigue continues. Batygin and Brown's hypothesis has fueled countless studies. The scientific community remains hopeful.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. The search isn't over. But for now, our models stand vindicated.

They exchange knowing nods, the mystery of Planet Nine still hanging in the air.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it's October 2nd, and the astronomical community is abuzz. The search for Planet Nine has been the talk of the town.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. As of the last update we received on July 29th, our models put the probability of discovery at 45.67%. Given the absence of any credible optical observation, it seems the answer is no.

**NATE SILVER**  
No, our models had it at 45.67%. The elusive planet remains just that—elusive. But the data and techniques continue to evolve.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. The quest for understanding our solar system is far from over. Until next time, we keep looking to the stars.

*The newsroom is buzzing with energy. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, discussing the latest astronomical findings.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, here we are, October 2nd. Did Planet Nine make its grand debut?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 23.45%. The data up to July suggested some promising leads but nothing conclusive.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. Despite the indirect evidence and Batygin's optimism, the odds were always stacked against a discovery within that timeframe.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The Galactic Plane's interference made it unlikely. But the search continues. New techniques might yet reveal surprises.

**NATE SILVER:** True. It's a reminder of how vast and mysterious our solar system remains.

*They both nod, contemplating the endless possibilities of space.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Until then, we wait and watch. The universe is a patient teacher.

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will Planet Nine be discovered before September 30, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.32%. Despite the buzz since Batygin and Brown's 2016 paper, the evidence just wasn't there by our cutoff.

**NATE:** Right, the Galactic Plane's interference and the lack of direct optical observation kept it elusive.
