*The camera pans to NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK, seated at a round table, papers scattered with charts and data.*

**NATE SILVER:** Well, the numbers are in. CoinMarketCap shows the total cryptocurrency market cap didn't make it between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion yesterday.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No surprise there. Our models had it at 35.67% probability for that range. The market's been volatile since July.

**NATE SILVER:** True. With the July 25th market cap at $2.35 trillion, the downtrend was expected, but not enough to hit the target.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Regulatory concerns and economic shifts played a big role. Our model factored all that in.

**NATE SILVER:** As always, our Brier scores remain impeccable. 

*They exchange a knowing nod, satisfied with their predictions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Until the next prediction, then.
