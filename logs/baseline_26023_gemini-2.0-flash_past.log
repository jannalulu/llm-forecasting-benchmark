Okay, let's analyze the possibility of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024.

**Factors Increasing the Probability:**

*   **South China Sea Tensions:** The most significant factor is the ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Clashes between the Philippine Coast Guard and Chinese vessels have become more frequent and assertive, leading to increased diplomatic friction. Rhetoric from both sides has been hardening. Any major escalation in these encounters could easily trigger diplomatic repercussions. Recent incidents, such as the water cannon incident and accusations of harassment, indicate a rising risk.
*   **Philippine Alignment with the US:** The Philippines has been strengthening its alliance with the United States, which China views with suspicion. Increased military cooperation and joint exercises could be perceived by China as a direct challenge to its interests, potentially leading to retaliatory measures, including diplomatic expulsions.
*   **Domestic Political Considerations:** Both countries have domestic political factors that could influence their foreign policy decisions. Nationalist sentiments in either country could pressure their respective governments to take a tougher stance on the South China Sea issue.
*   **Historical Precedent:** While not a perfect predictor, past instances of diplomatic expulsions between other nations demonstrate that such actions are not uncommon when bilateral relations deteriorate significantly.
*   **Short Time Frame:** The question is for a period of around 2.5 months.

**Factors Decreasing the Probability:**

*   **Economic Interdependence:** China is a major trading partner of the Philippines. Both countries benefit economically from maintaining stable relations. A complete breakdown in diplomatic ties would be detrimental to both economies.
*   **Desire for De-escalation:** Both governments may recognize the dangers of escalating tensions and actively seek to de-escalate the situation through dialogue and negotiation. Cooler heads can prevail, even after skirmishes.
*   **Potential for Back-Channel Diplomacy:** Diplomatic solutions are often found behind the scenes. It is possible that diplomatic channels are already hard at work to avoid further escalation.
*   **Focus on Other Issues:** Both countries may be preoccupied with other pressing domestic or international issues, diverting attention away from the South China Sea dispute.

**Overall Assessment:**

Given the current state of affairs, the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls before September 30, 2024, is significantly higher than a negligible chance. The South China Sea tensions are a real and present danger. However, the economic interdependence and potential for de-escalation also provide a counterbalancing force. It is unlikely that either side would want to see a major and rapid diplomatic fall out.

**Probability Range:**

Taking into consideration these factors, I estimate the probability of diplomatic expulsions or recalls between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, to be:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 40.00%, but 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
