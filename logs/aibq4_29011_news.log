**Busy travel day at Atlanta airport wraps up record summer travel season**
The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has wrapped up a record-breaking summer travel season with a busy Labor Day weekend. According to Hopper, Atlanta is projected to have seen over 1 million passengers between August 29 and September 4, making it the busiest airport in the world. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) expected an 8.5% increase in passengers nationwide compared to 2023, making it the busiest Labor Day on record. TSA Administrator David Pekoske said, 'People are traveling more than ever this summer and TSA along with our airline and airport partners stand ready to close the busiest summer travel period on record during this upcoming Labor Day weekend.' The top ten busiest travel days in the TSA's history have all come since May of this year, attributed to high supply from airlines and low prices due to the cost of fuel in today's market compared to last year. Robert Spidel, a veteran and USO volunteer, said, 'It's been a lot less than I actually expected' in terms of crowds at the Atlanta airport, while US Army Specialist Jose Ruiz said, 'We volunteered for this. We knew what we were getting into. Sometimes the training is worth the sacrifice, especially for the exposure of the dogs,' referring to the training of their German Shepherds, Biggie and Dorka, with local law enforcement.

**Travelers are getting a head start on the long Labor Day weekend**
The Labor Day weekend is expected to be busy, with airports, highways, beaches, and theme parks packed with travelers. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) predicts that it will screen over 17 million people during the holiday period, an 8% increase from last year. The busiest day is expected to be Friday, with over 2.86 million people passing through airport security checkpoints. Airlines have canceled over 200 flights and delayed over 4,500, with Southwest and American being the most affected. Experts advise travelers to get to the airport early, avoid checking bags, and be prepared for potential delays due to weather. The average airfare in July was down 7.1% from June and 2.8% from July 2023. Motorists are getting a break on gasoline, with the nationwide average price at $3.35 per gallon. For electric vehicles, the average price for a kilowatt of power at an L2 commercial charging station is about 34 cents. 'The flight was easy. (I) napped for a little bit, watched movies,' said Boston resident Dani Fleming, who flew across the country to visit her family. 'This was a breeze.' The TSA has enough screeners to keep the time it takes to get through regular lines to 30 minutes or less and to no more than 10 minutes for PreCheck lines. If your flight is delayed or canceled, check your flight's status before leaving for the airport and consider DIY rebooking on the airline website or app. Airlines are required to provide refunds, including for extra fees paid, to passengers whose flights are canceled for any reason. 'Get on the phone (to the airline's help center), get in front of an agent, reach out to the airline via social media if you have to, but find out what the other options are,' says Julian Kheel, the founder and CEO of Points Path.

**Traveling over Labor Day weekend? Best times to hit the road and skies**
The Labor Day weekend is expected to be a busy time for travel, with over 17 million people anticipated to pass through airport security. According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), this is a record for the Labor Day period. American Airlines plans to operate its largest Labor Day weekend schedule ever, with a 14% increase in passengers compared to last year. Motorists can expect lower gas prices compared to last year, with the nationwide average at $3.44 per gallon. However, drivers should be aware of the worst times to travel by car, which are between 1 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Thursday and 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday. For the return trip, Monday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. is expected to be a slog. Additionally, there has been an increase in speeding and 'very high speeding' on Labor Day weekends, but a decrease in distracted driving. It is recommended to check your itinerary before leaving for the airport, and to be patient and respectful when dealing with customer-service agents.

**US Airports To Have Busiest Labor Day Weekend Ever**
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has warned that the upcoming Labor Day weekend will be the busiest travel period in history, with 17 million passengers expected to pass through US checkpoints from August 28 to September 4. According to TSA Administrator David Pekoske, 'People are traveling more than ever this summer and TSA along with our airline and airport partners stand ready to close the busiest summer travel period on record during this upcoming Labor Day weekend.' The TSA has already served a vast crowd of summer travel passengers, with 240 million passengers traveling by air since Memorial Day weekend, totaling 2.7 million per day. This is 8.5% higher than the bookings in 2023, with all top ten positions on 'busiest travel days ever' recorded this year due to low fares and a warm summer. Government data shows 2024 ticket prices for summer were 9% lower than 2023 and further dropped by 19% when compared to May 2019.

**TSA predicts 17M travelers in busiest-ever Labor Day weekend for airports**
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) predicts 17 million travelers will pass through its checkpoints during the busiest-ever Labor Day weekend for airports. The holiday travel surge, running seven days from Wednesday through Sept. 4, is expected to peak on Aug. 30 with 2.86 million people being screened. TSA Administrator David Pekoske said, 'People are traveling more than ever this summer and TSA along with our airline and airport partners stand ready to close the busiest summer travel period on record during this upcoming Labor Day weekend.' The TSA is experiencing the most intense summer travel volumes in its history, with nearly 240 million people passing through its checkpoints since Memorial Day weekend, averaging about 2.7 million per day. The airline industry credits historically low fares for the summer-long travel surge, with airfares at the start of the summer season being nearly 9% lower than the year-earlier period when adjusted for inflation. However, the TSA is reminding travelers that the high passenger volumes are coming as the REAL ID deadline approaches, and passengers who do not have a REAL ID compliant driver's license by May 7, 2025, will not be allowed to pass through TSA checkpoints.

The TSA has staffed to meet its wait time standards, which are 10 minutes or less in TSA PreCheck lines and 30 minutes or less in standard screening lines. With the increase in travel volumes, the TSA recommends that airline passengers travel with ease by enrolling in the TSA PreCheck program, where members do not need to remove shoes, belts, 3-1-1 liquids, laptops, food, and light jackets at security checkpoints.
