**'Warren Buffett Indicator' Sounds Alarm: Stock Market Levels Now Surpass Dot-Com Bubble, Great Financial Crisis**
The Warren Buffett Indicator, a metric that compares the market capitalization of stocks to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the US, has reached a record high of 195%, surpassing the levels seen during the Dot-Com Bubble and the Great Financial Crisis. This indicator is calculated by looking at the ratio of the Wilshire 5000, a market-cap-weighted index tracking all US publicly traded companies, to the GDP of the US. The current ratio is higher than the levels preceding the dot-com bubble crash and the Great Financial Crisis. Despite this, some analysts believe that the strong earnings growth projections could help justify the high valuations, and the indicator may not predict another market crash.

**A stock market correction may be near, warns this Warren Buffett metric**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes have reached new all-time highs, but a Warren Buffett metric, known as the 'Buffett Indicator', suggests that the market may be overvalued. The indicator, which divides the total market capitalization of a country's stock market by its annual GDP, is currently at a record high of 200%, indicating potential risk. Buffett has backed away from this metric, citing its limitations, and Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks for six consecutive quarters. The article suggests that investors may want to consider other areas of their portfolio, such as FTSE dividend stocks, which may offer more value. British American Tobacco is highlighted as a stock with a high dividend yield and a low forward P/E ratio, making it a potentially attractive investment.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of Overvalued Stock Market**
Warren Buffett's indicator, also known as the 'Buffet indicator', compares the total value of the US stock market (measured by the Wilshire 5000) to the latest quarterly estimate of the US GDP. When the stock market is valued at around 70% of the GDP, it is considered undervalued, and when it is valued at around 200% of the GDP, it is considered overvalued. The indicator has successfully predicted nearly 57% of the major market downturns since 2000. However, the current reading of the indicator suggests that the stock market is overvalued, with the indicator reaching a record high of 196%. This could be a warning sign for investors, especially with the Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. Despite this, Buffett himself has continued to buy stocks, including shares of Occidental Petroleum, indicating that the market can be overvalued but still offer opportunities for investors.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of Overvalued Market, Experts Say**
Warren Buffett's indicator suggests that the market is overvalued, causing concern among investors. This indicator, which dates back to 2001, is based on a conclusion drawn by Buffett from real economy and financial data. The indicator takes the market capitalization of all American stocks listed on the exchange and divides it by the latest quarterly GDP of the US. The results are straightforward: if the figure is below 0.7, the market is undervalued, between 0.9 and 1, it is neutral, and above 1.2, it is overvalued. According to the latest measurement, the indicator is approaching a historical high. Additionally, considering other data, such as the S&P 500's PER, it can be concluded that the market is overvalued. The US stock market has had a remarkable performance over the past 16 years, with a return of 502%, outperforming global and emerging markets. Experts argue that this period of 15-16 years has never occurred in history, with the US market being so strong compared to the rest. In the last decade, the technology sector was the strongest, with a total return of 707% compared to the 238% of the S&P 500. This year, the S&P 500 rose 14.5% in the first half, making it the 15th best start to the year in the last 96. However, if Nvidia's stocks were not included, the rise would have been 11%, and if the 7 Magnificos were not included, it would have been 6%. Currently, the 10 most relevant stocks in the S&P 500 account for 77% of the index's total gain, the second-highest percentage in history, just behind 2007.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of the Largest Bubble in a Century**
Warren Buffett's indicator warns of the largest bubble in a century. The indicator, also known as the market capitalization to GDP ratio, is a financial metric used to evaluate the overall value of the stock market relative to a country's GDP. The indicator is named after Warren Buffett, who considers it one of the best tools for assessing the overall overvaluation or undervaluation of the stock market. The indicator is calculated by dividing the total market capitalization of publicly traded companies by the country's GDP and multiplying by 100%. Interpretation of the indicator values: Over 100%: If the value of the indicator exceeds 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is overvalued, with stock prices being high relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential correction or decline in the market. Less than 100%: If the value of the indicator is below 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is undervalued, with stock prices being low relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential investment opportunities. Buffett uses this indicator as a general indicator to determine whether it is worth investing in the stock market at this time or waiting for more favorable conditions. Although the Buffett indicator is a useful tool, it is important to remember that it is only one of many indicators used to evaluate the state of the market and does not guarantee accurate predictions. The concern is that the indicator has been trending towards a sharp increase before almost every recession the US has experienced - big or small. Although the ratio of market capitalization to GDP has not yet reached a record high - it was around 217% in 2020 - but it is already significantly higher than the level seen before the dot-com bubble burst and the start of the Great Recession in 2007. Is a stock market crash inevitable? Although the Buffett indicator is not a guaranteed predictor of a crash, its value should make investors think. For now, it significantly exceeds the range considered a sign of a properly valued stock market - a ratio to 100%. On the other hand, comparing the total market capitalization of publicly traded companies to GDP is not the only indicator suggesting the existence of a 'bubble'. In February, one of the alarming parallels between 2024 and 1929 was the growth of concentration of profits - a concentration where the top 10 largest companies account for 77% of the S&P 500. Finally, many well-known analysts and experts - including those who precisely predicted previous crises - have said that the technology sector has become a large 'bubble'. However, there are certain discrepancies regarding whether this bubble will burst, and many still consider the boom to be stable.

**The Buffett Indicator: A Warning Sign for the US Stock Market?**
The US stock market is seemingly unstoppable, with many investors betting on a potential Republican government under Donald Trump, which would lead to lower taxes and less regulation. The S&P 500 index has continued to rise, despite the failed assassination attempt on Trump. However, some value investors are concerned about the market's valuation, citing the Buffett Indicator, which has reached a record high of over 200%. This indicator, developed by Warren Buffett, measures the market's value relative to the country's GDP. A value above 200% indicates a market that is overvalued, with a high risk of a correction or crash. According to the indicator, the US market is overvalued, while other countries like Germany and France are undervalued. The indicator is not suitable for direct comparison between countries, as it was developed for evaluating a market's performance over time. Nevertheless, it suggests that the global stock markets are highly valued and investors should be cautious.

**Where Will Berkshire Hathaway Stock Be in 3 Years?**
Berkshire Hathaway's stock has risen over 50% in the past three years, outperforming the S&P 500. The company's insurance businesses have driven its growth, with operating earnings increasing 26% in 2021, 12% in 2022, and 21% in 2023. Berkshire's diversification and resilience make it an attractive stock for long-term investors, but its near-term growth is uncertain. Warren Buffett plans to retire and hand over the reins to Greg Abel, who may not have the same investment skills as Buffett. Despite this, Berkshire's stock is reasonably valued and could continue to rise as interest rates decline and the macro environment improves.

**Outperforming the Market: 3 Value-Oriented Funds that Follow in Warren Buffett's Footsteps**
Three value-orientated stock funds that outperform the market, following in the footsteps of Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has achieved an average annual return of 19.8% since 1965, outperforming the S&P 500 index's 10.2% annual growth. Although the difference may seem small at first, it results in a significant return difference over the long term. While Berkshire Hathaway has grown by 4,387,748% since then, the S&P 500 index has grown by 31,223% (as of the end of 2023). A key aspect of Warren Buffett's strategy is his focus on value investing.

**Records, Unfulfilled Promises, Banal Comparisons, and Popular Clichés**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices set six records from Monday to Wednesday, exceeding most optimistic forecasts and crushing any hopes for a correction, which many fundamental indicators are 'screaming' about. The 'Buffett Indicator', comparing the market capitalization of public companies to the volume of GDP, exceeded the levels of the 'dot-com' and 'great recession' crises. The concentration of market achievements in a few technological giants, which have been pulling the market for a long time, also causes concern. However, forecasts are one thing, and reality is another, especially in such a changeable and uncertain environment as the stock market. Interestingly, one of the latest forecasts is Mike Wilson's prediction from Morgan Stanley, who expects a 10% correction by the end of the year due to political uncertainty. Of course, a correction will eventually occur, but no one knows when, and even Wilson, who has been predicting market falls for almost two years, is unsure. In my opinion, from a fundamental perspective, Wilson's forecast is fully justified.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of Market Bubble**
Warren Buffett's indicator, which compares the market capitalization of stocks to the US GDP, is warning that the current market levels are above the dot-com bubble and the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The indicator is calculated by observing the relationship between the Wilshire 5000 index, which tracks the total market capitalization of all US-listed companies, and the US GDP. Currently, the ratio is around 195%, higher than the ratio before the dot-com bubble burst and the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The indicator is warning that the current market is overvalued, despite the high interest rates, which have not slowed down the valuations of tech giants like Tesla and NVIDIA. To protect your portfolio, it is essential to have the best market information, which is why InvestingPro can help.

**Buffett Indicator Warns of Stock Market Crash**
The Seabreeze Partners Management hedge fund warns that American stocks are extremely overvalued. According to the Buffett indicator, which compares the value of the US stock market to the size of the economy, the ratio has reached a level not seen since 2022. This has been a warning sign for a significant decline in the S&P 500 index in the past. 'Almost two years ago, the ratio reached an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal,' said Doug Kass, founder and chairman of Seabreeze Partners Management. The Buffett indicator has been relatively reliable in the past, predicting crashes in 1987, 2000, and the financial crisis. Be cautious when the indicator exceeds two standard deviations above its long-term average, Kass advises. Other popular valuation metrics also indicate that stock prices are overvalued. However, the Buffett indicator is not perfect, as it does not take into account interest rates, which are currently at their highest level in over 20 years, and does not account for the growing share of foreign corporate profits or the phenomenon of the Magnificent Seven, a group of stocks that have driven most of the market's gains over the past year and a half.

**This Warren Buffett metric is at a never-before-seen high! What does it mean?**
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index reached new all-time highs, but Warren Buffett's valuation ratio, known as the 'Buffett Indicator', also reached an all-time high of 195%. This ratio measures the total market capitalization of US stocks divided by the country's GDP. The indicator has been at a historical high before, in November 2021, and was followed by a 25% crash in the S&P 500. The current high is attributed to the dichotomy between the economy and the stock market, with the economy softening due to interest rates, while the stock market is driven by a small handful of AI-related companies. Warren Buffett, a strong critic of 'timing the market', doesn't dump his portfolio when the market looks frothy, but instead moves his cash into US Treasury Bills until he finds an opportunity. He has recently bought more shares in Occidental Petroleum Corp, a company whose shares are only up 1.6% year-to-date.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of Overvalued Market, Experts Say**
Warren Buffett's indicator suggests that the market is overvalued, causing concern among investors. This indicator, which dates back to 2001, is based on a conclusion drawn by Buffett from real economy and financial data. The indicator takes the market capitalization of all American stocks listed on the exchange and divides it by the latest quarterly GDP of the US. The results are straightforward: if the figure is below 0.7, the market is undervalued, between 0.9 and 1, it is neutral, and above 1.2, it is overvalued. According to the latest measurement, the indicator is approaching a historical high. Additionally, considering other data, such as the S&P 500's PER, it can be concluded that the market is overvalued. The US stock market has had a remarkable performance over the past 16 years, with a return of 502%, outperforming global and emerging markets. Experts argue that this period of 15-16 years has never occurred in history, with the US market being so strong compared to the rest. In the last decade, the technology sector was the strongest, with a total return of 707% compared to the 238% of the S&P 500. This year, the S&P 500 rose 14.5% in the first half, making it the 15th best start to the year in the last 96. However, if Nvidia's stocks were not included, the rise would have been 11%, and if the 7 Magnificos were not included, it would have been 6%. Currently, the 10 most relevant stocks in the S&P 500 account for 77% of the index's total gain, the second-highest percentage in history, just behind 2007.

**S&P 500: Buffett Indicator Approaches All-Time High - What Does it Mean for Investors?**
The Buffett Indicator, a widely followed metric to assess market over- or under-valuation, is approaching an all-time high. The market breadth is historically sending warning signals, but the current seasonal pattern supports optimists. The S&P 500 has had a strong start to the year, with a 14.5% gain in the first half, the 15th best start in the last 96 years. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 are making up 77% of the index's gain, the second-highest level in history. The long-term performance of the US stock market is also impressive, with a 502% return over 16 years, outperforming global and emerging markets. However, comparisons to the dot-com bubble are inevitable, but the current situation is not identical. The seasonal pattern also supports optimists, with the S&P 500 only experiencing 29 instances of a 10% gain in the first six months, ending with an average return of 24%.

**Warren Buffett's Indicator Warns of the Largest Bubble in a Century**
Warren Buffett's indicator warns of the largest bubble in a century. The indicator, also known as the market capitalization to GDP ratio, is a financial metric used to evaluate the overall value of the stock market relative to a country's GDP. The indicator is named after Warren Buffett, who considers it one of the best tools for assessing the overall overvaluation or undervaluation of the stock market. The indicator is calculated by dividing the total market capitalization of publicly traded companies by the country's GDP and multiplying by 100%. Interpretation of the indicator values: Over 100%: If the value of the indicator exceeds 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is overvalued, with stock prices being high relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential correction or decline in the market. Less than 100%: If the value of the indicator is below 100%, it may indicate that the stock market is undervalued, with stock prices being low relative to the country's economic production. This may be a signal for potential investment opportunities. Buffett uses this indicator as a general indicator to determine whether it is worth investing in the stock market at this time or waiting for more favorable conditions. Although the Buffett indicator is a useful tool, it is important to remember that it is only one of many indicators used to evaluate the state of the market and does not guarantee accurate predictions. The concern is that the indicator has been trending towards a sharp increase before almost every recession the US has experienced - big or small. Although the ratio of market capitalization to GDP has not yet reached a record high - it was around 217% in 2020 - but it is already significantly higher than the level seen before the dot-com bubble burst and the start of the Great Recession in 2007. Is a stock market crash inevitable? Although the Buffett indicator is not a guaranteed predictor of a crash, its value should make investors think. For now, it significantly exceeds the range considered a sign of a properly valued stock market - a ratio to 100%. On the other hand, comparing the total market capitalization of publicly traded companies to GDP is not the only indicator suggesting the existence of a 'bubble'. In February, one of the alarming parallels between 2024 and 1929 was the growth of concentration of profits - a concentration where the top 10 largest companies account for 77% of the S&P 500. Finally, many well-known analysts and experts - including those who precisely predicted previous crises - have said that the technology sector has become a large 'bubble'. However, there are certain discrepancies regarding whether this bubble will burst, and many still consider the boom to be stable.

**Warren Buffett once said that he could end America's deficit problem 'in five minutes' — here's what he would do. Plus 3 ways to hedge against a US debt crisis**
Warren Buffett has proposed a solution to the US national debt crisis, stating that he could end the deficit in five minutes by making lawmakers ineligible for re-election if the deficit exceeds 3% of GDP. Buffett believes that this would incentivize lawmakers to be more careful with government spending. Germany has a hard cap on deficit spending, which has led to more responsible spending. The US, on the other hand, has no hard cap and has spent $1.2 trillion more than it has collected in fiscal year 2024. To hedge against a potential debt crisis, investors can consider assets that the government would be last in line to default on, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I Bonds. Investors can also diversify by looking at countries with lower debt-to-GDP ratios.

**Office Vacancy Rates May Reach 24% in 2026, According to Moody's Report**
According to Moody's report, office vacancy rates in the US may reach a peak of 24% in 2026, as remote work trends continue to question the need for office spaces. The office vacancy rate reached 19.8% in the last quarter, a new record. Despite this, many companies are still adapting to the new reality, and Moody's expects office vacancies to reach a new equilibrium during the next decade. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has pledged to donate 99% of his remaining wealth after his death, with a total of $5.3 billion. The article also highlights other news and trends, including the average mortgage debt load in different states, the search for a new director at GameStop, and the expectations for record-breaking travel during the 4th of July holidays.

**Nearing Full Froth: A Look Inside The Current Market Bubble**
The article discusses the current state of the stock market, using various mathematical models to gauge its valuation. The Buffett Indicator, which measures the total market value of the US stock market against annualized GDP, shows that the market is overvalued, with a ratio of 188%, the second-highest level recorded. The article also examines the impact of interest rates on asset prices, using models that incorporate interest rates. Additionally, it discusses earnings growth, noting that the S&P 500 is currently running at 20-30% annual growth rates, while first-quarter corporate earnings growth was revised to slightly under 10%. The article concludes by highlighting the differences in performance between large-cap, middle-cap, and small-cap stocks, suggesting that small-cap opportunities may be worth considering for investors looking to enter the market.

**Stocks surged during the first half of 2024. What's next?**
The stock market has had a strong first half of 2024, with the S&P 500 index gaining 14.5% and the Nasdaq Composite climbing 18.1%. Artificial intelligence has been a major driver of these gains, with the Magnificent Seven big tech names leading the way. However, some experts are warning that the market's momentum may not continue, citing concerns about inflation and the Federal Reserve's potential to cut interest rates. Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, believes that the market's breadth is a key factor to watch, and that a divergence between the S&P 500 and other indexes could be a sign of trouble. He also notes that a sharp slowdown in the labor market could push the Fed to cut rates more aggressively, which could be negative for the market. Additionally, Warren Buffett has announced that he will not continue to donate to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after his death, instead setting up a new charitable trust overseen by his children. The housing market is also facing challenges, with economists at Bank of America warning that it may not recover until 2026 or later.

**Fed Sees Higher Chance of Interest Rate Cut in September**
The financial market sees a higher chance of the Federal Reserve (Fed) starting to cut interest rates in September and increased the probability of a 50-basis-point reduction in 2024 after the release of the US Consumer Price Index (PCE). The indicator is the preferred inflation measure of the US Federal Reserve and came in line with expectations. According to the CME Group's monitoring tool, the probability of a rate cut in September rose to 67.7%, from 64.1% before the data. This represents 61.1% probability of a 25-basis-point cut - for the range of 5.00% to 5.25% - and 6.6% probability of a 50-basis-point cut - for the interval of 4.75% to 5.00%. Until December, the probability of a 50-basis-point reduction advanced from 43% before the data to 45.4%. Meanwhile, the chance of maintaining interest rates in the current range, between 5.25% and 5.50%, fell from 7% to 5.2%.

**Warren Buffett Added $58 Billion to This Ultrasafe Investment Over the Past Year, and He Expects to Add Tens of Billions More by the End of 2024**
Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, has added $58 billion to Berkshire Hathaway's position in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds over the past year, and expects to add another $11 billion in the second quarter. Buffett views short-term Treasuries as the best place to hold excess cash while looking for good long-term investment opportunities. He prefers to take a lower yield and let the bond mature, rather than gamble on interest rates. Berkshire's cash and Treasury holdings are expected to surpass $200 billion by the end of the second quarter. Buffett is known for his long-term approach, but is willing to take advantage of short-term opportunities. He is also buying up shares of companies such as Chubb, Occidental Petroleum, and Liberty SiriusXM. Berkshire's stock is trading at 18.7 times forward earnings and looks attractive due to its huge cash position, share repurchases, and the prospects of its businesses.

**Stock Market Crash Alert: How the S&P 500 Could Plunge 48%**
Paul Dietrich, Chief Investment Strategist at B. Riley, believes a stock market crash is imminent, predicting a 48% drop in the S&P 500. Dietrich attributes this to the market being grossly overvalued, with the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and inflation-adjusted Shiller P/E ratio at multi-decade highs. He compares the current market to the dot-com bubble and notes that the Buffett Indicator has reached a two-year high, signaling overvaluation. Dietrich believes the economy will enter a mild recession later this year due to rising taxes, inflation, and interest rates.

**A Week of Importance for Wall Street: Key Levels to Monitor**
This week is important for Wall Street as an annual red setup calculated by our algorithms will expire on June 27. In similar contexts, these dates have intercepted significant lows and highs. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has acquired 2.95 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, increasing its stake in the US oil producer to nearly 29%. Buffett has also purchased warrants to buy an additional 83.5 million shares of Occidental at $59.62 per share. The market reaction to the increase in Occidental Petroleum was contained, as it was not a surprise, given Buffett's regular increase in his stake in the company. Analysts' recommendations are to hold with a target price of $71.96, which means that the shares are undervalued by around 18%. The Alligator Indicator on the daily time frame is set to the downside, while the long-term indicator is set to the upside. The prices are currently trading below the downward trend line from the March highs. If there are no significant increases in the next few days/weeks above the area of $62.96 (June 20 high), the prices may head towards the annual lows. The most important support level is $59.13.

**Crashgefahr im DAX? A Closer Look at the Current Market Situation**
The article discusses the current state of the DAX and whether it is a crash market. The author notes that the trend in US indices is still intact and there is no indication of a buying frenzy. The Fear and Greed Index is at 40%, indicating a 'Fear' level, which does not suggest a bubble. The author also mentions Warren Buffett's indicator, which suggests that the stock market is overvalued. The DAX is showing relative weakness compared to US indices, and the author expects the US indices to continue rising before correcting. This could lead to a further increase in the DAX. However, hedge funds have rediscovered the DAX as a trading opportunity and are betting on a weaker development. The author suggests a spread trade with Nasdaq long vs. DAX short as a non-directional speculation. The long-term prognosis is based on demographic trends in China and the US, which show good times ahead until 2036 due to an increase in Best-Agers, who are the most consumption-strong segment of consumers.

The Buffett Indicator, a measure of a country's stock market valuation relative to its GDP, labels the Indian market as 'modestly overvalued' with a current ratio of 1.02, higher than the 10-year average of 0.91. The indicator projects a 5.8% annual return for the Indian market, the lowest among emerging markets. The expected annual returns for other emerging markets are higher, ranging from 13.6% in Brazil to 27.1% in Russia. Developed markets such as Singapore and the UK are expected to have higher returns, while Japan is expected to have a negative return. The indicator also suggests that the Indian market is modestly overvalued when considering the ratio of total market capitalization to GDP plus total assets of the central bank.

**S&P 500: US Stock Market Closes Higher on Expectations of Interest Rate Cut**
The US stock market closed higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching new closing highs. The move was driven by weaker-than-expected retail sales data and cautious comments from Federal Reserve officials on the expected interest rate cut cycle. The Dow Jones rose 0.15%, the S&P 500 advanced 0.25%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.03%. Despite the gains, the overall momentum on Wall Street was limited due to the upcoming US holiday, which will leave businesses closed. The weaker retail sales data consolidated expectations of a rate cut by the Fed. However, Fed officials remain cautious, with Adriana Kugler and Alberto Musalem noting that US inflation remains high. Musalem warned that it may take months for the Fed to have confidence to start cutting rates. Nvidia shares surged 3.51%, pushing the company's market value to $3.335 trillion, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Micron Technology rose 3.80% after positive analyst notes from Stifel, Wedbush, and Bank of America Securities, which raised their price target. The company has benefited from the AI boom since the beginning of 2023. Occidental Petroleum also rose 1.76% after Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, increased its stake in the company, seen as a vote of confidence in the energy sector.

**Dollar Surpasses R$ 5.40 for the First Time Since January 2023**
The US dollar surpassed R$ 5.40 for the first time since January 2023, amid a day of nervousness in the domestic and international markets. The stock market had a strong decline and reached its lowest level in seven months. The dollar closed on Wednesday (12) at R$ 5.407, with a gain of R$ 0.046 (+0.86%). The exchange rate had started the day with a decline, falling to R$ 5.34 in the first minutes of trading, but then surged after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's speech on public spending. During the afternoon, the exchange rate slowed down to R$ 5.36, but then rose again after the Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting result. The dollar has accumulated a gain of 3.01% in June and 11.42% in 2024. The Ibovespa index, from B3, closed at 119,936 points, with a decline of 1.4%. The indicator is at its lowest level since November 9 last year. Both internal and external factors contributed to the nervousness. In Brazil, the return of the provisional measure that aimed to limit the compensation of the Social Integration Program (PIS) and the Contribution to the Financing of Social Security (Cofins) raised doubts about how the Executive and Congress will raise around R$ 26.3 billion to balance the accounts in 2024. In the morning, President Lula made a speech promising fiscal balance. 'We are putting our house in order and putting public accounts in order to ensure fiscal balance. The increase in revenue and the decrease in interest rates will allow for a reduction in the deficit without compromising public investment capacity,' the president said. The statement was poorly received by the financial market. Abroad, the dollar started the day with a decline, after the US consumer inflation rate remained at 0.16% in May, half of the expected 0.3%. During the afternoon, the scenario changed. After the meeting in which the Fed kept interest rates at their highest level in 40 years, the Fed indicated that it will only make a 0.25 percentage point cut before the end of the year, even with inflation falling. Part of the financial market had hoped that the Fed would cut interest rates twice, once in September and once in November. Higher interest rates in advanced economies stimulate capital flight from emerging countries like Brazil.

**Wall Street on the Brink of Correction as Analysts Warn of High Inflation**
Wall Street is close to a correction from its records, according to analysts. Despite repeated updates, the market has not met expectations, with a rate cut expected at most one or two times before the end of the year, and nothing is guaranteed due to high inflation. The situation on the markets is more positive, leading to the possibility of a correction. The three American indices have recently updated their historic records. The S&P 500 has gained 13.4% since the beginning of the year, while the Nasdaq has gained 14.5%. Michele de Michelis, President and CEO of Frame AM, said, 'Some important managers support the idea that the situation is not as rosy as it seems.' He added, 'In the last conf-call, many quoted company managers, in an attempt to maintain their profit margins, have anticipated that they will inevitably reflect on the labor market. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on that strength that has supported the cycle so much, with the consequence of a strong labor market, high consumption, and high profits that has given wings to the stock market.' According to Frame AM analyst, this is a sign that the market and its operators are sending clear signals. However, he noted that when the US 10-year rate exceeds 4.6%, the S&P 500 starts to get nervous, and this confirms that the real risk remains inflation. As for inflation, it is impossible not to look at the sectors that have soared and could be the third wheel to affect the market, according to de Michelis, adding, 'We will see if Warren Buffett has been right this time too.'

**Warren Buffett's Signals: A Possible Correction Ahead?**
The American stock market in May did not seem to be on the verge of correcting, with the S&P 500 index returning to its highs. However, I am surprised by the strength of the equity market so far this year, especially considering that the expected rate cuts did not materialize. Despite this, the indices are not falling, despite the lack of support from the Fed. It seems that investors are still betting on a good state of the American economy, which, despite high interest rates, is proving to be more resilient than expected. Some important managers believe that the situation is not as rosy and that we will see a slowdown in the main economic indicators in the next six months. In support of this thesis, many company managers have announced cost-cutting measures in recent conference calls, which will inevitably affect the labor market and, in turn, the American consumer, putting a brake on the virtuous circle (strong labor market/high consumption/high profits) that has driven the stock market. Despite some signs of weakness, every bad news is interpreted positively, as it is thought to be a sign of an impending rate cut. Recently, Warren Buffett has taken his holding company's liquidity to a historic high, just when the average American manager's liquidity is at its lowest. This is usually a sign of a correction. I am agnostic about the stock market, but I am observing its strength and taking advantage of any protection that is not too costly. I note that when the US 10-year yield exceeds 4.6%, the S&P 500 index starts to get nervous, and this confirms that the real risk remains inflation. As we talk about inflation, we cannot ignore the commodities that have risen in many sectors and could be the third wheel to break the correlation between equity and bonds. We will see if Warren Buffett was right again.

The Bank of Japan is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, while the Federal Reserve may leave rates unchanged or hint at a September rate hike. The US CPI Report will be closely watched, with economists forecasting a 3.4% annual inflation rate. A higher-than-expected inflation rate could impact the Fed's rate path and affect the USD/JPY. The FOMC interest rate decision, economic projections, and press conference will be crucial in determining the near-term trends. The USD/JPY price action is currently above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, indicating a bullish trend. A return to the 158 handle could bring the 160 handle into play, while a break below the 50-day EMA could signal a drop to 151.685.

**Can Berkshire Hathaway Stock Keep Outpacing the S&P 500?**
Berkshire Hathaway's stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since Warren Buffett became CEO in 1965. Despite being a concentrated portfolio with only 50 stocks, Berkshire Hathaway's stock has delivered excess returns of around 8 percentage points per year. The company's stock holdings have an average forward P/E ratio of 18.3 and anticipated earnings growth of 12.4% by 2025, compared to the S&P 500's 21.1 forward P/E ratio and 14.2% earnings growth. Berkshire Hathaway's stock may not be well-positioned to outperform the S&P 500 in the short term due to its lower earnings growth rate. However, the company's diverse asset portfolio and lack of reliance on AI make it an attractive hedge against market downturns. If Nvidia's stock encounters obstacles, Berkshire Hathaway's performance may improve relative to the S&P 500.

**USD/JPY Forecast: Navigating Yen Volatility with Upcoming JGB Auction and US Data**
The USD/JPY forecast is influenced by upcoming JGB auction and US data. Weaker-than-expected labor market data could lead to expectations of a September Fed rate cut, which would support a less hawkish Fed rate path. Job quit numbers and factory orders are also important indicators. The USD/JPY price action is currently above the 50-day and 200-day EMAs, indicating a bullish trend. A break above 156.5 could lead to a rise to 158, and a return to 158 could signal a rise to 160.209. Conversely, a break below 155.5 could lead to a move to the 50-day EMA. The 14-day RSI suggests a move to 160.209 before entering overbought territory.

**Wall Street Closes with Mixed Results After Disappointing Economic Indicator**
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closed with mixed results on Monday, following the release of a disappointing economic indicator, although the market recovered towards the end of the day. The Dow Jones fell 0.30%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 0.56% and 0.11%, respectively. The session started with positive expectations, but the mood changed with the release of the ISM index, which showed a new slowdown in industrial activity in the United States. The index fell to 48.7% in May, compared to 49.2% in April. Any value below 50% indicates a contraction in activity. The operators also noted that the prices paid index included in the report fell from 60.9% to 57%. This is just a small relief because an index above 50% means that prices are still rising. The data shook the bond market and the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 4.39%, the lowest level in two weeks, from 4.49% at the close on Friday. The Nasdaq was again driven by a handful of technology giants, particularly Nvidia, which rose 4.90% after presenting a new semiconductor specialized in artificial intelligence (AI) generative less than three months after its previous model. The Dow Jones was dragged down by several cyclical stocks, including Dow, Caterpillar, and Home Depot. In the rest of the market, Paramount Global rose 7.47% after CNBC reported that the majority shareholder of the entertainment group, Shari Redstone, had reached an agreement to merge with the Skydance Media studio. On Monday, the market was shocked to see the action of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group, fall 99.97% in a few seconds before being suspended. The NYSE indicated that it was a

**Is the Buffett Indicator foolproof?**
The Buffett Indicator, a metric coined by Warren Buffett, measures the market capitalization of a country's listed companies as a percentage of its GDP. However, it may not always predict stock market crashes or draw a fair picture of the economy. Research by YCharts found that the indicator gave warning signals ahead of 50% of major market declines in the US since 1971, but not all. The indicator may be flawed due to its limitations, such as not considering global operations or the difference in market behavior between mature and emerging economies.

**Investing in the US in 2024: What You Need to Know**
With US interest rates above 5% for almost a year, government bonds (Treasuries, considered low-risk assets) have gained attention, impacting global asset pricing. High returns on low-risk assets lead investors to reduce and mitigate risks. As a result, private fixed-income securities are forced to increase returns, and variable-income alternatives are under pressure. Therefore, it is more than justified to be concerned (and anxious) about when US interest rates will fall (and by how much). Currently, expectations suggest a reduction in interest rates in September, but not exceeding 0.5 percentage points this year. Factors that guide the decision are inflation rate and economic activity indicators, especially employment. With regards to inflation, significant progress has been made, but the 2% target remains distant. As for economic activity, signs of deceleration are observed, but the labor market is still tight. We believe fixed income will remain attractive. Does this mean abandoning variable income? Microanalysis is needed. For example, despite the April shock, the year has been positive for many US-listed companies, as seen in the performance of major indices so far (Dow: 6.5%, S&P 500: 11.9%, Nasdaq 100: 11.8%). As the first-quarter earnings season approaches, S&P 500 companies continue to exceed expectations. The percentage of companies with positive surprises and the magnitude of those surprises are above the 10-year average. On an annual basis, the S&P 500 has seen its highest profit growth since the second quarter of 2022, indicating business growth, positive for the stock market.
