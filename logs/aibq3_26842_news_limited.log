**OpenAI's releasing a new AI model soon, and there's a lot at stake**
OpenAI is set to release its new AI model, GPT-5, which has high expectations from users and investors. The model is expected to perform 'agentic actions,' such as booking a trip instead of just providing a trip itinerary, and seamlessly work across audio, video, and text. However, some experts believe the gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5 will be smaller than expected, comparing it to going from undergrad to a PhD program. OpenAI has a lot riding on GPT-5, including its ability to attract more customers and increase revenue, which could surpass $8 billion this year. The company also faces scrutiny over its safety and potential risks, particularly with the launch of SearchGPT, a direct competitor to Google's Search. 3 things in markets: The bull market is expected to last well into 2025, with slight market corrections expected but a low risk of a new bear market. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon believes interest rate cuts could happen, citing a shift in consumer behavior in the face of inflation.

**Profitable AI startup SymphonyAI eyes late 2025 IPO after strong growth of $500 million revenue run rate**

**Apple Secures Seat on OpenAI Board, Potentially Bad News for Microsoft**
Apple has recently secured a seat on the OpenAI board, which is likely bad news for Microsoft. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been quiet about AI, while competitors have been innovating in the emerging market for generative artificial intelligence. However, Apple's delay is not a sign of weakness, but rather a strategic move. According to Bloomberg, Apple has secured a 'observer' seat on the OpenAI board, which will be taken over by Apple's App Store chief Phil Schiller later this year. This move is part of Apple's deal to install OpenAI's ChatGPT on its devices. Microsoft, on the other hand, received a non-voting seat on the OpenAI board in November 2023. The tech giants' seats on the board allow them to gain insights from OpenAI's decision-making processes, although they do not have control over these decisions. Apple and Microsoft have been rivaling each other in the AI market, with Microsoft's massive push in AI last year helping it surpass Apple's market capitalization for the first time since 2021. Apple has now caught up and is only slightly behind Microsoft in terms of market capitalization. Apple's ChatGPT deal and its seat on the OpenAI board are not the only signs of its potential AI dominance. The company is expected to announce future partnerships with Google and other AI chatbot developers, and is working on its own AI tools, such as 'Apple Intelligence', which includes improvements to the Siri speech assistant and other features.

**OpenAI to Go Commercial, CEO Sam Altman Confirms**
OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman plans to make the company commercial, according to The Information, citing a source. Currently, one of the leaders in AI development has a non-profit status, similar to a US non-profit organization. This change would allow the company to conduct an IPO. Microsoft, the company's main investor, is likely pushing for monetization of the developed technologies, says Roman Dushkin, director of 'A-Я эксперт'. 'It's hard to say what's brewing at OpenAI. But the main shareholder is Microsoft, one of the richest companies in the world, which invests in OpenAI to make it profitable.' Sam Altman is known for his authoritarian and strict management style, and it's possible that he prioritizes commercial profit. OpenAI has been providing access to its models for free, building a user base, and now users will likely pay for access to these services. It's difficult to resist the use of large language models for hyper-automation of activities. As for the potential IPO, it's hard to predict what will happen, but if the company goes public, it's likely to be a success, followed by a decline. 'It's all old news, like the world is old, history', says Dushkin. OpenAI has recently changed its CFO, with Sarah Fryar taking the position. She previously worked at Square (now Block Inc.) and Nextdoor, both of which went public. This has led to speculation about a potential IPO. However, the company has denied this information. Denis Kuleshov, director of 'Сенсор-Тех', believes that this is one step towards an IPO: 'OpenAI is clearly drifting towards a commercial company. Going public, transforming the corporation, management, board of directors, reporting, and internal procedures - it's a difficult process. So, it's clear that OpenAI is strengthening its team to ensure a smooth transition. The main goal is to preserve the company's value, which is currently estimated at $80 billion. As OpenAI is currently in the spotlight, it's likely that they will go public as soon as possible to freeze this value and continue developing the business as a commercial structure.' According to OpenAI, the company remains focused on creating AI that benefits everyone. However, according to Sam Altman, the board of directors is also considering another scenario - creating a commercial non-profit corporation. This is already being done by competitors, such as Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI employees, and xAI, a startup founded by Elon Musk.

**Nvidia's Stock Price Rises as OpenAI's Revenue Triples: AI News Roundup**
Nvidia's stock price has risen, while OpenAI's revenue has more than tripled in the past year. Apple has announced its plans for generative AI, which includes a partnership with a leading company, but reportedly will not pay for the technology, at least not with money. Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft aim to reach a market capitalization of $4 billion in the next year, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Apple has regained its position as the world's most valuable company after five months of lagging behind Microsoft and Nvidia. Apple's AI plans leave a golden path for Google, analysts say. CEO Tim Cook emphasized the importance of data protection in Apple's new AI tools. Apple's AI strategy will open doors for the competition rather than closing them. Apple announced its new AI features, 'Apple Intelligence', at its Worldwide Developers Conference, with CEO Tim Cook and other executives emphasizing that Apple's 'personal intelligence' will take on the complex task of ensuring security and personalization on the competitive AI market.

**OpenAI Allows Investors To Sell Shares Annually**
OpenAI is allowing employees to sell a percentage of their shares annually, but the company's restricted strategy has raised concerns among current and former employees. The company has used aggressive tactics to get employees to sign exit agreements that affect the future of their stock holdings. OpenAI has also announced that it will backtrack on a decision to make former employees choose between signing a non-disparagement agreement that would never expire and keeping their vested equity in the company. The company has hired Sarah Friar as its new finance chief, who was previously CEO of Nextdoor and CFO of Square. OpenAI has held three tender rounds to date, with the latest being between November 2023 and March 2024. The company has also opened up 'donation rounds' to current employees, allowing them to donate a certain amount of their vested equity to charity, which brings with it tax incentives. Former employees could be excluded from these donation rounds, as they will likely be offered 'to active employees only and are not guaranteed to happen.'

**OpenAI announces CFO and fuels speculation of possible IPO**
OpenAI has appointed Sarah Friar, a veteran of Silicon Valley, as its new chief financial officer. This move may fuel speculation about a potential initial public offering (IPO) of the company, which is a leader in generative artificial intelligence. Friar was previously CEO of social media company NextDoor, and has held roles such as CFO at Square and senior vice president of finance and strategy at Salesforce.com. She also spent 10 years at Goldman Sachs, covering the software sector. As a member of the board of directors at Walmart and Consensys, a private software blockchain company, Friar is also co-president of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab.
