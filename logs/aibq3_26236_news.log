**Individual and Team Records that Could be Broken in Paris 2024**
The Olympic Games have a long history, with thousands of athletes from around the world providing a regular spectacle of dramatic sports, intrigue, and passion. While some athletes have competed in multiple Olympic Games, others will rewrite the record books by representing their nation for the first time. Here are some individual and team records that could be broken in Paris 2024. NBA star Kevin Durant could become the first male athlete to win four gold medals in any team sport if the US team wins a fifth consecutive gold medal in basketball. Nikola Karabatic, a three-time World Player of the Year, has participated in the last five Olympic Games, helping his team win gold in Beijing 2008, London 2012, and Tokyo 2020. He could have an emotional farewell to his home crowd on the last day of competition, as the 40-year-old player, one of the greatest in the history of this sport, will retire after Paris 2024. But it's not necessary to be a multiple Olympic champion to break records. Jimmer Fredette could make history by simply stepping onto the 3x3 court at the Place de la Concorde on July 30. By doing so, he would become the first NBA player to compete in the Olympic 3x3 tournament and could even help guide the US team to its first-ever Olympic gold medal in the sport.

The event saw a series of great competitions, including a World Record, leading to the temptation to call it the greatest OT of all. However, comparing Trials before 1976 with the current era can be problematic due to changes in events and formats. The 1956 Trials stand out for the number of World Records set, but 2024's 13 meet records eclipsed previous records, including 10 in 2021 and 6 in 2012. The statistics suggest that 2024 ranks at or very close to the top, and attendees will likely agree and remember the many superb competitions.

Team GB is targeting a minimum of 50 medals at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, with hopes of breaking the British record of 70 medals. The team will consist of 327 athletes, including 78 reigning or former world champions. UK Sport's Director of Performance, Katie Baker, aims for a third of the medals to be golds, but has steered clear of setting a specific target to avoid pressure on athletes. Team GB has a strong track record of finishing in the top 5 of the medal table, and officials are confident that the country's athletes will continue this streak. The team's chef de mission, Mark England, praised the country's support of its athletes, describing it as the 'most highly sophisticated high-performance structure in the world, bar none.'

**France: World Athletics Records Broken in Paris Ahead of the Olympics**
At the Stade Charléty in Paris, two world records in athletics were broken on July 7, 2024, just three weeks before the Olympic Games. Yaroslava Mahuchikh, a Ukrainian athlete, cleared 2.10m in the high jump, and Faith Kipyegon, a Kenyan runner, finished the 1500m in 3 minutes 49 seconds 04. Gabriel Tual also set a new French record in the 800m with a time of 1 minute 41 seconds 61. Kipyegon improved her own world record by seven hundredths of a second, having previously set it in June 2023. She had also set the world record in the 5000m at the Paris Olympics in 2023 before Gudaf Tsegay broke it in September 2023. Kipyegon said, 'This world record is incredible, and I feel on the right track for the Olympics.' Having overcome an injury, she knew she was in shape to break the world record. As a double world champion and double Olympic champion in the 1500m, Kipyegon also reassured her form after being slowed down in her Olympic preparation by a minor muscle problem.

**Armand Duplantis Aims High with His Pole in Paris-2024**
Armand Duplantis, a 24-year-old pole vaulter, is preparing for the Paris 2024 Olympics, where he will be a strong favorite to win the gold medal. He stated that he is used to the pressure that comes with each of his presentations, having set eight records in the last four years, including the Olympic crown, two outdoor and two indoor world championships, and three European titles. Duplantis emphasized the importance of focusing on his performance and not getting distracted by expectations. He also mentioned that his goal is to make sure 'everything is where it should be' before the Olympics. Regarding the possibility of breaking the world record, currently held at 6.24 meters, Duplantis said that his goal is to compete better than he did in Tokyo, where he set a record of 6.02 meters. He joked that he has two opportunities to break the record in Paris, referring to the Diamond League and the Olympic Games. Duplantis also mentioned that surpassing 6.30 meters is possible, but it's not something that keeps him awake at night. He emphasized that he enjoys challenges, which push him to improve, but he doesn't worry about a specific mark.

**Luta antidoping para Paris-2024: mais de mil agentes testarão atletas**
The fight against doping for the 2024 Paris Olympics is being prepared. Over 1,000 people will conduct tests on almost 4,000 athletes during the competition. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be closely monitoring the process. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be in charge of planning, organizing, and managing the test results. The ITA has experience from previous editions, including the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The agency will be fully in charge from the opening of the Olympic Village on July 18. 'If there are athletes who dope, they will do it before the Olympics, so the pre-Olympic phase is very important', explains an ITA spokesperson to AFP. The selection process for the event ends just before the competition, so it is necessary to monitor all athletes who qualify, almost 40,000 athletes from the 10,000 who can qualify for the Olympics. In the last edition, 6,200 samples were collected from around 4,000 athletes, resulting in several positive cases. The tests are based on various criteria, including continuous monitoring in competitions, biological passports, and denunciations. Athletes who win medals or break records will be systematically tested. Around 4,000 athletes will be tested, according to the ITA. The samples will be analyzed at the Orsay laboratory, a new installation on the Saclay university campus, in a process that can take several hours. As a novelty, genetic tests will be possible, according to the 2023 Olympic law and to adapt to global anti-doping standards. The World Anti-Doping Agency will be present through a monitoring program that will provide daily comments. Since April, WADA has been under attack after the disclosure that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive in the past and were not penalized. In case of a process, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) will have two temporary offices in Paris during the Olympics.

**Sydney McLaughlin Breaks World Record for 5th Time**
Sydney McLaughlin broke the world record for the 400m hurdles for the fifth time, completing the race in 50.65 seconds. She also won the gold medal and qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

She also expressed her desire to break the 50-second barrier in the future. Anna Cockrell and Jasmine Jones took second and third place, respectively, with their personal best times. In the men's events, Rai Benjamin won the gold medal in the 400m hurdles, while Bryce Hoppell set a championship record in the 800m run.

**Olympic records vs. world records: Here's the difference**
As the 2024 Olympics in Paris approach, the difference between Olympic records and world records is being highlighted. An Olympic record is set during the Games, while a world record is set during championship events. An athlete can set an Olympic record without breaking the world record, but if they do, they will hold both records. The 2024 Olympics will offer a $50,000 prize for gold-medal-winning athletes in 48 track and field events, but not all sports can afford to do so. Setting an Olympic record is considered more prestigious due to the competition's rarity and prestige.

**Noah Lyles qualifies for Paris 2024 Olympics on 100m**
Noah Lyles, the world champion in the 100m, has qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics in this distance, winning the American trials in 9.83 seconds. Lyles, 26, will compete in his second Olympics, having qualified on Sunday in Eugene, USA. He won his series in 9.92 seconds on Saturday and his semi-final in 9.80 seconds, before winning the final in 9.83 seconds, equaling his personal record and the third best performance in the world this year. He will be joined by Kenny Bednarek and Fred Kerley, who finished second and third in the final in 9.87 and 9.88 seconds, respectively. Christian Coleman, the 2019 world champion in the 100m and 2024 indoor world champion in the 60m, will not compete in the 100m event at the Stade de France, finishing fourth in 9.93 seconds. Lyles aims to win four medals at the Olympics, a feat that even Usain Bolt, the Jamaican legend, has not achieved. 'Bolt has won three times and broken the world record, I want to do four. What do you have to do to be better than him? You have to do four. No one has done four. Then you go to Mount Rushmore, you're the greatest of the great. That's what I'm trying to achieve,' Lyles said on 'The Tonight Show' with Jimmy Fallon.

**Olympic Records in Athletics: What to Expect in Paris 2024**
The 2024 Paris Olympics will provide an opportunity to break records, particularly in the discipline of athletics. What are the records that are being targeted? Athletics is a universal sport that does not require expensive equipment or complex infrastructure, and it encompasses a wide range of disciplines, from speed and endurance to jumps and throws. The Olympic record is different from the world record, as it only corresponds to the marks produced during the Games. A Olympic record can be at the same time a world record. Usain Bolt, a Jamaican athlete, holds the Olympic records in the 100 and 200 meters with times of 9.63 and 19.30 seconds, respectively, set in 2012 and 2008. It is curious that his world records are inferior to the Olympic records, with times of 9.58s and 19.19s, both set in 2009. Will these records be broken? Paris will reveal the answer. In high jump, Charles Austin holds the Olympic record with 2.39 meters, while in pole vault, Brazilian Thiago Braz Da Silva broke the mark with 6.03 meters at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Bob Beamon holds the record in the long jump with 8.90 meters. Sergey Litvinov, a Soviet athlete, holds a long-standing record in the hammer throw with 84.80 meters, while Andreas Thorkildsen, a Norwegian athlete, holds the record in the javelin throw with 90.57 meters. In the discus throw, Virgilijus Alekna, a Lithuanian athlete, threw 69.89 meters, a difficult mark to break. In women's events, Elaine Thompson-Herah holds the record in the 100 meters with 10.61, set at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, while Florence Griffith Joyner holds the record in the 200 meters with 21.34 seconds, set at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Yelena Isinbayeva, a Russian athlete, holds the record in the pole vault with 5.05 meters, while Jackie Joyner-Kersee, an American athlete, holds the record in the high jump with 7.40 meters, set at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Yelena Slesarenko, a Russian athlete, holds the Olympic record in the high jump with 2.06 meters.

**Not Summer McIntosh, but This US Swimmer Who Defeated Katie Ledecky Left a Message for the GOAT Before Paris Olympics**
Katie Ledecky's 13-year unbeaten record in the 800-meter freestyle was broken by 17-year-old Katie Grimes in January. However, this was not the first time Ledecky's record was surpassed, as 17-year-old Katie Grimes had already done so a year earlier in the 400 IM event. Grimes, who holds the world silver medal, has been a rising star in competitive swimming, securing four individual medals at the subsequent two World Championships and becoming the first US athlete across all sports to secure an Olympic quota for Paris 2024. Grimes has expressed admiration for Ledecky, acknowledging her as a source of inspiration and encouragement, and is gearing up for the Paris Olympics with a sense of maturity and confidence.

**800m Freestyle Men's Event at the 2024 Paris Olympics**
Brazil's Guilherme Costa, also known as 'Cachorrão', will compete in the men's 800m freestyle event at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Costa has been the best Brazilian in the distance events in recent years and was a finalist in the 800m freestyle at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where he broke the South American record in the heats and finished eighth in the final. This Olympic cycle, Costa has had two world championship finals in the event. In 2022, he broke the South American record with a time of 7:45.48, and in 2023, he won the gold medal at the Pan American Games. The 800m freestyle event will have some notable absences in Paris, including Tunisian Ahmed Hafnaoui, the current Olympic champion and world champion in 2023, who announced publicly last month that he will not attend the Paris Olympics. Other strong contenders include Australian Samuel Short, who was the vice-world champion in 2023, and Elijah Winnington, who won the bronze medal at the 2023 World Championships. The United States will also have Bobby Finke, the current Olympic champion and world champion in 2022. Irishman Daniel Wiffen is another rising star in the event, having won the gold medal at the 2023 World Championships. The event has a rich history, with records being broken over the years. The first world record was set by British athlete Henry Taylor in 1908, with a time of 11:25.40, which is unimaginable compared to the current world record of 7:32.12 set by Chinese athlete Zhang Lin. The event has seen many great athletes break barriers, including Australian Boy Charlton, who broke the 11-minute barrier in 1924, and Japanese athlete Shozo Makino, who broke the 10-minute barrier in 1934. The event has also seen many Olympic champions, including American athletes Tim Shaw and Mike Burton, French athlete Alain Mosconi, Australian athletes Murray Rose and Kieren Perkins, and Soviet athlete Vladimir Salnikov, who was the first man to swim the event in under 8 minutes with a time of 7:56.59 in 1979. Salnikov dominated the event for eight years until he lost his record to Kieren Perkins, who set a time of 7:46.00, a highly competitive mark even today. The event made its debut at the 2001 World Championships, with Australian athletes Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett dominating the early titles. Thorpe won the gold medal in 2001, with Hackett taking silver. Hackett went on to win the title again in 2003 and 2005, setting a world record of 7:38.65, which would have been enough to win the gold medal at the 2019 World Championships. The record was eventually broken by Chinese athlete Zhang Lin, who won the world title in 2009 with a time of 7:32.12, a record that still stands today.
