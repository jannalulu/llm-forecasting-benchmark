**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Did you see the final numbers?

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
Yes, Trump's lead was exactly 3.5 points on July 15. Our models had it at 93.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
Impressive. Biden's struggle post-debate really shifted the dynamics.

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
Right. The debate fallout and the media pressure were critical. The Biden camp's efforts to turn perceptions didn’t gain enough traction.

**SUPERFORECASTER A**  
And with the Democratic Convention next month, the stakes are even higher.

*They pause, reflecting on the implications.*

**SUPERFORECASTER B**  
Our models never miss. Now, let’s see how the campaigns adjust from here.
