**Tesla Q2 2024: Waves of Growth and Decline in the Electric Vehicle Market**
Tesla has released its Q2 2024 earnings report, showing a complex narrative of growth and challenges in the evolving electric vehicle market. While the company exceeded revenue expectations, reaching €23.76 billion with a 2% increase from the previous year, its auto sales experienced a 7% decline, reaching €18.54 billion. The decline, combined with a profit per share below Wall Street projections of 52 cents adjusted versus 62 cents expected, led to a substantial drop in post-market trading. Despite the decline in auto sales, Tesla cited 'record regulatory credits' as a contributing factor to its overall revenue growth. These credits, which are bought by other automakers struggling to meet emissions standards, tripled compared to the previous year, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by the industry in transitioning to cleaner technologies. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, used the earnings call to announce a rescheduled Robotaxi launch event for October 10, increasing expectations around the company's autonomous driving ambitions. However, questions about the timeline for the first Robotaxi ride were received with cautious optimism, as Musk recognized the potential for delays while expressing confidence in achieving this goal within the next year. The report also shed light on Tesla's profitability challenges, with its adjusted profit margin falling from 18.7% in Q2 2023 to 14.4% in Q2 2024. This decline was attributed to various factors, including price reductions, restructuring costs, and investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains optimistic about its future prospects, reporting strong growth in its energy generation and storage business, with revenue almost doubling compared to the same quarter last year. Additionally, Cybertruck production is increasing, with the company projecting profitability for this model by the end of the year.

**Tesla's push at Giga Shanghai 'indicates' good things out of China**
Tesla's Giga Shanghai production plant in China is running at full capacity, indicating stronger demand for vehicles. Analysts at Barclays believe this increased production capacity points to higher demand, which could lead to higher delivery levels in the second half of 2024. Tesla has delivered 830,766 cars in the first half of the year, putting it on pace for 1.6 million deliveries in 2024, a decline from 2023's 1.81 million deliveries. The company has noted that the development of its next-gen platform may lead to a lower growth rate in 2024 compared to 2023.

**Elon Musk Threatens to Destroy Bill Gates if He Bets Against Tesla**
Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, threatened to destroy Bill Gates if he bets against the electric vehicle manufacturer. Musk believes that Tesla's production of robots will increase its value to $30 trillion. He also mentioned that when Tesla solves the autonomy issue and starts mass-producing its Optimus robot, anyone who still has a short position will be destroyed, including Gates. The feud between Musk and Gates started in 2022 when Musk refused to support Gates' philanthropic project after leaked messages showed that Gates had bet $500 million against Tesla's stock price falling. Musk stated that he cannot take Gates' philanthropic efforts on climate change seriously when he has a large short position against Tesla, the company that is doing the most to address climate change. Tesla recently released its preliminary data for the 2nd quarter of 2024, showing a 14.8% increase in deliveries and a 4.8% decrease in sales compared to the same period last year. The company's stock price has been affected, and it has fallen 50 positions in the S&P 500 ranking and 50 positions in the reputation ranking in the US market in 2023, according to Axios. However, Tesla announced the production of a new robotaxi model in April and expects an increase in sales with the launch of low-cost models in 2025. The company's market capitalization has reached $100 billion in recent days.

**Tesla: Barclays Forecasts Slight Increase in Production Volume by 2026**
Barclays analysts predict a slight increase in Tesla's production volume by 2026, despite ongoing challenges, including reduced profit forecasts and pressure on sales and profit margins. The bank notes that Tesla's focus on autonomous driving and AI technology may raise questions about the company's ability to significantly increase earnings per share by 2030. Barclays recognizes that Tesla's main source of revenue is its primary vehicle production, with the energy division also contributing significantly. However, the bank considers the success of Tesla's autonomous driving initiatives unpredictable and does not include it in its complete evaluation. Barclays notes a general slowdown in the electric vehicle market, which it describes as a 'grave slowdown in VE'. Despite Tesla's price reductions in the previous year, vehicle sales were weak, and 2024 is expected to record fewer sales than 2023, a scenario that investors did not previously consider probable. Analysts predict that Tesla will focus more on its non-automotive AI projects, such as the Optimus robot, but approach these projects with caution, emphasizing the need for tangible results before including them in their evaluation.

**Tesla's Production Aspirations Underscored By Gary Black: 2.77M Vehicles By 2025  --  Major Entry Into $30K Segment 'Significantly Underestimated By The Street' - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)**
Tesla Inc. is reportedly aiming to produce 2.77 million vehicles by 2025, a 50% increase from its 2023 production. This target includes the launch of new affordable models, according to Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black. Black noted that Tesla's current installed capacity stands at 2.35 million units, which includes the new affordable Tesla vehicles set for delivery in the first half of 2025. The market is underestimating Tesla's Total Addressable Market (TAM) expansion into the $30,000 segment, according to Black. 'As we saw with the introduction of Model Y in 2020, there is little cannibalization of other models when Tesla enters a new category - here the $30K affordable luxury segment,' Black wrote.

**Tesla Reports Q2 2024 Financial Results: Revenue Up, Profits Down**
Tesla's Q2 2024 financial results have been released, showing a 2% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year, reaching $25.50 billion. However, profits have decreased due to a lower number of cars delivered. Tesla delivered 443,956 cars in the second quarter of 2024, a 4.6% decrease compared to the same period last year. The company's auto division revenue has decreased by 7% to $19.8 billion.

**Tesla to Produce 'Human-Like Robots' Next Year**
Elon Musk announced that Tesla will start producing 'human-like robots' next year, which will be used first by the company before being sold to other companies by 2026. This comes as Tesla faces challenges in reducing costs and increasing sales, with a 7% decline in sales in the second quarter of 2024. The company's revenue also decreased by 1.5 billion dollars, and its profit margin decreased to less than 1.5 billion dollars. Tesla's revenue increased by 2% due to growth in energy storage business. The company is focusing on artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and robotics, and Musk expects the 'Optimus' robot to be ready for use by the end of this year. Tesla will produce a limited number of human-like robots for internal use next year and hopes to produce them in large quantities for other companies by 2026.

**Tesla Aims At Profitability For Cybertruck By 2024-End With Production Ramp And Cost Savings With Dry Cathode 4680 Cells**
Tesla aims to achieve profitability for its Cybertruck by the end of 2024 through increased production and cost savings. The company has already tripled Cybertruck production sequentially in the second quarter and is targeting 250,000 units annually starting in 2025. Tesla is also testing its prototype Cybertruck produced with in-house 'dry' cathode 4680 cells, which would enable major cost reduction. The launch of production Cybertrucks with dry cathode 4680 cells is expected in Q4. This move could help Tesla make the Cybertruck a common sight on American roads.

**Tesla Increases Revenue and Profits in Second Quarter**
Tesla reported a better second quarter, with increased revenue and profits, despite a contraction compared to 2023. The company's sales exceeded expectations, and it was able to increase its profits compared to the beginning of the year. The good news is that the company's sales have surpassed even slightly the expectations, and Tesla also managed to increase its profits compared to the beginning of the year. The company's revenue was $25.5 billion, and its profit was $1.48 billion. The company's services division contributed to a slight growth in sales, with a growth of 21%. The energy storage and generation division continued to grow, doubling its business volume to $3 billion. Tesla's margins are still modest, and far from the 16% of last year, and in the second quarter it reached 5.8%, slightly exceeding the 5.5% of the first quarter. Tesla claims to benefit from lower costs per vehicle, such as material purchases, transportation, and customs duties. And the costs of 4,680 cells should also decrease. Production of vehicles The company's production and delivery numbers announced in early July made it clear that the second quarter would likely be difficult in terms of business numbers: Tesla produced 410,831 vehicles in the second quarter, a 14% decrease, and delivered a total of 443,956 units, a 5% decrease from last year. The excess deliveries can be explained by the situation in the first quarter, when Tesla had manufactured around 46,500 vehicles more than it could deliver at the end of the quarter. Some of the deliveries were delayed until the second quarter due to logistical reasons. After six months, Tesla is below last year's exercise: so far in 2024, 844,202 units have been built and 830,766 have been delivered. By the end of June 2023, Tesla had already built 920,508 cars, of which 889,015 had been delivered. Therefore, production is 8.3% lower than last year and deliveries are 6.6% lower. There are no significant changes in production: Tesla has a capacity to manufacture 100,000 Model S/X at the Fremont, California factory, plus over 550,000 Model 3/Y at the same facility. Additionally, it has the capacity to produce 250,000 Model Y at the Texas plant; where Americans indicate they have capacity to produce 125,000 units of the Cybertruck. In Giga Berlin, Tesla has managed to develop capacity to manufacture over 375,000 Model Y per year. The largest factory, with a difference, is the Giga Shanghai: there the American manufacturer claims to have a capacity of over 950,000 units of the Model Y and Model 3. In total, Tesla already has capacity to produce up to 2.3 million cars per year. Superchargers and stores In other areas, Tesla's business is growing constantly, and for example, stores have grown 12% to reach 1,286 centers open this year, while mobile technical services have increased 7% to 1,896 vehicles. As for Superchargers, the network has reached 6,473 stations, a 23% increase, with a total of 59,596 active points. Source: Tesla

**Tesla's Revenue Increases, Net Profit Decreases**
Tesla, the American electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced that its revenue for the second quarter of 2024 has increased by 2% compared to the same period last year, reaching $25.5 billion. However, the company's net profit has decreased by 45% to $1.5 billion, compared to the same period last year. This decline is attributed to global sales decline and price reductions. Tesla's production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024 are 410,831 vehicles produced and 443,956 vehicles delivered, respectively. The company's production decreased by 14% year-over-year, while the number of delivered vehicles decreased by 5%. Despite the challenging working environment, Tesla achieved a record three-month revenue in the second quarter.

**Tesla's Profit Declines, Musk Promises a Brighter Future**
Tesla's first half of 2024 has been worse than the previous year. The company made a profit of 1.48 billion US dollars in the second quarter, which is 45% less than the same period last year. Elon Musk tried to convince investors with promises of a great future for Tesla, including self-driving cars and the humanoid robot Optimus. However, he also delayed the presentation of the robotaxi prototype from August 1 to October 10. The production of Optimus robots is expected to start by the end of next year, and they will be sold to other companies in 2026. Tesla's quarterly sales increased by 2% to 25.5 billion dollars, but this was mainly due to the growing business with energy and storage, which doubled to 3 billion dollars. The sales of electric cars decreased by 7% to 19.9 billion dollars. The company is feeling the impact of slower growth in electric car sales and increasing competition from other manufacturers. Musk announced a more affordable model for the first half of 2025, which could boost sales. Tesla is already testing a new version of its 'Autopilot' assistance system in the US, which it calls 'Full Self-Driving' (FSD). However, the system is not yet approved by authorities and drivers must still monitor it. Musk plans to apply for approval in Europe, China, and other regions by the end of the year.

**Tesla's Net Profit Falls 45% Amid Competition and Low Prices**
Tesla's net profit fell 45% between April and June, to $1.48 billion, due to low prices and increased competition from traditional automakers. The company's revenue increased by 2% to $25.50 billion, slightly better than the 24.34 billion expected by analysts. Tesla's stock fell 8.41% in after-hours trading. The company announced that its Cybertruck, which started deliveries in late 2023, became the best-selling electric pickup truck in the US in the second quarter. Tesla's production capacity for the Cybertruck is currently below 125,000 units per year, but has tripled from the previous quarter. The company expects the Cybertruck to be profitable by the end of the year. Tesla also announced that its new models, including more affordable vehicles, will be released in the first half of 2025, instead of the second half of this year. The company's production lines will remain the same, and the production of its semi-truck, Semi, is still on track to start in late 2025. The production of the roadster, which was announced in February for a late 2024 launch, will now start next year. Tesla's robotaxi project is still in development and is dependent on technological advancements and regulatory approvals. Elon Musk, the company's CEO, said that he is sometimes overly optimistic, but believes that the robotaxi will be launched next year. The company's plans to build a giant factory in Mexico have been suspended due to the upcoming presidential election and the potential for increased tariffs on vehicles manufactured in Mexico.

**Despite Record Quarterly Revenue in Q2, Tesla Warns of Slower 2024 Growth**
Tesla Inc. has reported a record quarterly revenue of $25.5 billion in Q2, but warns of slower growth in 2024. The company's automotive business saw a 7% decline in revenue year-over-year, while energy storage and generation business saw a significant increase. CFO Vaibhav Taneja attributed the increase to 'attractive financing options' and said it's the best time to buy a Tesla. The company expects vehicle volume growth to slow in the second half of 2024, with energy storage and generation business outpacing automotive. Tesla also plans to launch a more affordable model in 2025 and is working on autonomy, including the launch of its self-driving Robotaxi and the production of Optimus, an autonomous humanoid robot. CEO Elon Musk believes that autonomy will be a major differentiator for Tesla and that the company will be unaffected by potential changes to EV tax credits and emissions rules.

**Tesla Reports Higher Revenue, Lower Profit in Q2**
Tesla reported a 2% increase in revenue to $25.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024, but saw a stronger-than-expected decline in profit per share to $0.52. Analysts had forecast a revenue decline to $24.5 billion and a less severe profit decline to $0.61 per share due to lower volumes and prices. Tesla delivered 444,000 vehicles in the quarter, with an average realized price of $42,500. The company expects growth in vehicle deliveries to be significantly lower in 2024 than in 2023 due to the launch of next-generation vehicles and other products. Tesla's plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, are still on track to enter production in the first half of 2025. The company believes that its approach, which uses existing production lines, will result in 'less cost savings than previously expected', but will enable it to grow volumes in a way that is 'more efficient in managing investments during uncertain times'. The stock fell about 2% after the earnings report.

**Tesla : Q2'24 Earnings Update Letter**
Tesla reported its Q2 2024 earnings, highlighting a record quarterly revenue of $25.5 billion, driven by growth in the Energy Generation and Storage business, Cybertruck deliveries, and higher regulatory credit revenue. The company's operating income decreased to $1.6 billion, resulting in a 6.3% operating margin. Tesla's cash and investments increased to $30.7 billion, driven by positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion. The company's vehicle production and deliveries decreased sequentially, but are expected to increase in Q3. Tesla's non-automotive business, including energy storage and services, is becoming increasingly profitable. The company's outlook for 2024 includes a notable decrease in vehicle volume growth rate, but expects energy storage deployments and revenue to outpace the Automotive business.

**Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2024 Earnings Preview: What to Expect**
Tesla (TSLA) is expected to release its financial results for the second quarter of 2024 on Tuesday, July 23, after the market closes. The company will hold a conference call and Q&A session with its management. We will look at what ordinary investors and private investors can expect in terms of quarterly results. Tesla's deliveries for the second quarter of 2024 have already been announced: Model 3/J production and deliveries: 386,576 and 422,405, respectively, with a 2% increase in deliveries. Other models: 24,255 and 21,551, respectively, with a 1% increase in deliveries. The total: 410,831 and 443,956, respectively, with a 2% increase in deliveries. Deliveries have decreased year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, but the performance was better than the previous quarter. Tesla has already announced an impressive new record for energy storage: 9.4 GWh. The company's revenue for the second quarter of 2024 is expected to be around $24.38 billion, according to Wall Street consensus. Business Insider, a specialized crowdfunding forecasting service, expects higher revenues of $24.562 billion. The company is trying to achieve a marginal profit every quarter, as it invests most of its money in growth, and has been successful in doing so over the past three years. However, just like with revenue, profits are difficult to predict, with price reductions having an impact on the gross margins of market leader Tesla and a decline in deliveries making it even harder. For the second quarter of 2024, the Wall Street consensus expects a profit of $0.61 per share, while Estimize's prediction is slightly higher at $0.64 per share. Tesla earned $0.91 per share in the same period last year. Other predictions for TSLA's shareholders and analysts include updates on the company's software delays, production of 4680 battery cells, and the availability of Optimus.

**Tesla (TSLA) Q2 2024 earnings preview: what to expect today**
Tesla is set to release its Q2 2024 financial results on July 23, after the markets close. The company has already disclosed its vehicle delivery and production numbers, which show a 2% increase in deliveries and a 1% increase in production. Analysts are expecting a revenue of $24.380 billion, with Estimize predicting a higher revenue of $24.562 billion. The company's average price per vehicle is changing due to frequent price cuts and discounts, making it harder to estimate earnings. Tesla is expected to be marginally profitable, with a gain of $0.61 per share, according to Wall Street consensus, and $0.64 per share, according to Estimize. The company will also provide updates and answer shareholder questions in its shareholder letter and conference call. Some of the most upvoted questions include when the robo-taxi event will take place, when the first robotaxi ride will be available, and the current status of 4680 battery cell production.

**Tesla's push at Giga Shanghai 'indicates' good things out of China**
Tesla's Giga Shanghai production plant in China is running at full capacity, indicating stronger demand for vehicles. Analysts at Barclays believe this increased production capacity points to higher demand, which could lead to higher delivery levels in the second half of 2024. Tesla has delivered 830,766 cars in the first half of the year, putting it on pace for 1.6 million deliveries in 2024, a decline from 2023's 1.81 million deliveries. The company has noted that the development of its next-gen platform may lead to a lower growth rate in 2024 compared to 2023.

**Tesla Q2 earnings preview: 30% drop in EPS likely for EV giant amid strategic challenges**
Tesla is set to release its Q2 2024 earnings report, with analysts expecting a 30% decline in earnings per share (EPS) and modest revenue growth. The company's revenue is expected to rise 0.8% year-over-year to $25.1 billion, despite a decline in earnings. Tesla's margins are under pressure due to increased costs and price cuts, with gross margins expected to remain under pressure. The company's delivery numbers are also expected to be down 5% year-over-year, with production outpacing sales. The report will provide insights into Tesla's financial health and strategic direction, with investors closely watching key metrics such as margins, vehicle deliveries, and updates on strategic initiatives like Robotaxis.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Strong, But What's To Come?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries were strong, but the company is still facing an electric vehicle (EV) demand problem. Despite a 42% one-month rally, Tesla's production and deliveries are set to decline in 2024. The company needs to report strong sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 to ease concerns. Energy storage was a bright spot, with a record 9.4 GWh in deployments, but its contribution to revenue and gross profit is not yet significant enough to drive a meaningful EPS beat. Tesla's margins are still under pressure, with automotive operating margin dropping to 5.5% in Q1 2024, and the company has provided no concrete guidance on how far margins will decline.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Surprised, But Was Stock's 10% Rally Justified?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries exceeded expectations, with 443,956 vehicles sold, a 15% increase from Q1 2024. Despite this, the stock price rose only 10% due to various factors affecting demand, including high interest rates, competition, and a rising inventory of unsold vehicles. Tesla's Q2 production was 410,831 vehicles, a 7.5% decrease from deliveries. The company's global vehicle inventory, measured in days of supply, rose to 28 days in Q1 2024, but is likely to decline in Q2. The average price of Tesla vehicles dropped to under $45,000 in Q1 2024, and gross margins decreased by 200 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. The company reduced prices by $2,000 for three models, including the Model Y, Models X, and S. Tesla's stock has seen little change over the past three years, while the S&P 500 has increased by 45%. The company's valuation is estimated at $177 per share, 20% below the current market price.

**Elon Musk Threatens to Destroy Bill Gates if He Bets Against Tesla**
Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, threatened to destroy Bill Gates if he bets against the electric vehicle manufacturer. Musk believes that Tesla's production of robots will increase its value to $30 trillion. He also mentioned that when Tesla solves the autonomy issue and starts mass-producing its Optimus robot, anyone who still has a short position will be destroyed, including Gates. The feud between Musk and Gates started in 2022 when Musk refused to support Gates' philanthropic project after leaked messages showed that Gates had bet $500 million against Tesla's stock price falling. Musk stated that he cannot take Gates' philanthropic efforts on climate change seriously when he has a large short position against Tesla, the company that is doing the most to address climate change. Tesla recently released its preliminary data for the 2nd quarter of 2024, showing a 14.8% increase in deliveries and a 4.8% decrease in sales compared to the same period last year. The company's stock price has been affected, and it has fallen 50 positions in the S&P 500 ranking and 50 positions in the reputation ranking in the US market in 2023, according to Axios. However, Tesla announced the production of a new robotaxi model in April and expects an increase in sales with the launch of low-cost models in 2025. The company's market capitalization has reached $100 billion in recent days.

**Tesla's Gigafactory Expansion in Grünheide Gets Green Light**
The Brandenburg State Office for the Environment has given the green light for Tesla to expand its Gigafactory in Grünheide, near Berlin, without clearing any forest. The expansion will allow Tesla to double its production capacity from 500,000 to 1 million cars per year. The factory, which has been in operation since March 2022, currently employs around 12,000 people. Despite announcing plans to cut 400 jobs, Tesla still plans to increase production in the future. Environmental organizations and local residents have expressed concerns about the expansion, citing the factory's location in a protected watershed area. Protests have been ongoing since February, with activists camping near the factory site to protest the planned expansion, which would involve clearing forest to build a logistics area and a goods station.

**Tesla's Energy Storage Business Soars in Q2**
Tesla has broken its own record by installing a 9.4 GWh energy storage system in the second quarter of 2024. This is a 131% increase from the previous quarter and a 157% increase from the same period last year. Despite struggling with car sales, Tesla is continuing to grow its energy business and increasing its revenue share. The energy division, which accounts for less than 10% of the company's revenue, has increased its share to over 20% this quarter. Tesla's Megapack production capacity has also increased, with its California and Shanghai facilities now capable of producing up to 40 GWh per year. The company has also reduced the prices of its energy storage products, with the 1.9 MW/3.9 MWh Megapack now priced at $1,039,290, equivalent to $266 per kWh. This is a 44% decrease from the same product's price in April 2023, which was $1,879,840 per kWh.

**Tesla Sales: Only Elon Musk's Robotaxi can save investors now**
Tesla's quarterly sales and production numbers showed a slight improvement, with deliveries beating estimates and outpacing production. However, the company's core business, which accounts for 89% of its gross profit, is not growing. Sales of premium models, excluding the Model 3 and Y, were lower in the second quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company's unsold vehicle inventory has built up since the second quarter of 2022, and it has resorted to discounts and zero-rate financing in China to clear some of the inventory. The consensus estimate for 2024 implies a 22% drop in earnings from last year, which saw a 29% drop from 2022. Despite this, Tesla's market capitalization has expanded by about $275 billion since hitting a low point in April.

Analysts had estimated that Tesla would deliver around 438-439,000 vehicles, but the company reported 443,956 deliveries.

**Tesla's Electric Vehicle Sales Decline, Stock Price Rises**
Tesla has produced 410,831 electric vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, a 14.4% decrease compared to the same period in 2023. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, mostly Model 3 and Y, a 4.7% decrease. The stock price reacted with an increase of over 8%. Analysts had expected a stronger decline, with an average estimate of a 0.7% point decrease. The production decline is due to Tesla's limited storage capacity, as the company has been producing more vehicles than it has been delivering for over two years. On the positive side, Tesla has set a new quarterly record for stationary battery sales, with 9.4 GWh of capacity. However, this segment only accounts for a single-digit percentage of the company's overall revenue. The number of delivered vehicles is the best approximation of sales figures, which Tesla published on Tuesday. The sales figure has now decreased for the second quarter in a row. In the US, Tesla is facing increased competition from other electric vehicle manufacturers, which could lead to a loss of market share. In Canada, Tesla's market share could also be affected by high tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles and potential exclusion from Canadian sales subsidies.

**Tesla Energy Massively Surged 132% In Q2 2024 - Showing Tesla As Much More Than A Car Company**
Tesla's energy division has experienced a massive surge in growth, with a 132% increase in Q2 2024. This growth is expected to continue, with Tesla aiming to deploy multiple TWh of energy storage worldwide. Battery storage is crucial for the future, as fossil fuels will eventually run out and are more polluting than solar and battery storage. Tesla's energy business is becoming increasingly important, with the company poised to have a strong second half of the year. The company's FSD and Tesla Bot are also expected to contribute to its business in the coming years. Eventually, selling EVs may become a small percentage of Tesla's business, with energy storage and other sectors becoming more prominent.

**Tesla's Q2 Delivery Numbers Exceed Estimates, Stock Up 6.3%**
Tesla announced its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding Wall Street estimates. The stock is currently up 6.3% to $223.16 per share. Tesla's delivery numbers are expected to be affected by the decline in demand and the decrease in prices. The company's current lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck, Model X SUV, and Model S luxury sedan. Tesla's delivery numbers have been impacted by the decline in sales, which was partly due to the closure of its factory in Germany due to a fire and delays in shipping due to conflicts in the Red Sea.

**Tesla delivered fewer vehicles to customers for the second quarter in a row**
Tesla has reported a decline in vehicle deliveries for the second consecutive quarter, with 443,956 vehicles delivered in Q2 2024, a 4.76% drop from Q2 2023. The company's production also decreased by 14% compared to the same period last year. The decline is attributed to increased competition, gaps in the company's vehicle lineup, and Elon Musk's online antics. Tesla's market share has shrunk to around 50% from 80% in 2020. The company is expected to report its Q2 earnings later this month and will make a major announcement about its robotaxi reveal on August 8th.

**Tesla's Q2 2024 Production and Delivery Numbers: A Mixed Bag**
Tesla has released its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. Despite a decline compared to last year, the company exceeded analyst expectations and continues to maintain strong market positions. The total number of deliveries was 443,956 electric vehicles, with a total production of 410,831 electric vehicles. This is above the 439,000 units expected by Wall Street analysts. However, deliveries decreased by 4.8% compared to the same period last year, when 466,140 electric vehicles were delivered. Tesla's delivery numbers are the closest indicator to the sales figures reported by the automaker. The company groups deliveries into two categories: Model 3 and Model Y, as well as all other electric vehicles, but does not provide data on individual models or regions. Tesla's lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck pickup, Model X SUV, and flagship Model S sedan. In April, Tesla reported a decline in deliveries in the first quarter, down 8.5% to 386,810 electric vehicles, marking the first year-over-year decline since 2020. Weak sales were caused by a temporary shutdown of a German factory and delays in shipments due to attacks on ships in the Red Sea. However, problems are also related to the aging of the electric vehicle lineup and increased competition. Tesla's stock fell more than 10% in 2024, despite a more than 5% gain on the opening of trading on Monday. The company has offered a range of discounts and incentives to stimulate sales, including a zero-interest credit in China. According to the company's annual report for 2023, Tesla received around $21.75 billion in revenue from China, accounting for 22.5% of the company's total revenue. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan published a report stating that the decline in deliveries is due to declining demand and declining discount effectiveness. He recommends selling Tesla shares. Wells Fargo expects Tesla's gross profit from electric vehicle sales, excluding environmental credits, to decline over the year.

**Tesla Beats Sales Slump Estimates In Q2**
Tesla has released its Q2 2024 production and delivery report, showing 443,956 cars delivered, slightly above expectations. Despite this, sales are down 5% compared to the same period in 2023. The company's sales have declined for two consecutive quarters. The Model 3 and Model Y accounted for 422,405 deliveries, while the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck accounted for 21,551. Production was lower than deliveries due to a large inventory of unsold cars from Q1 2024. Analyst Jessica Caldwell notes that Tesla's sales are suffering due to a narrow product portfolio, high prices, and the company's haphazard pricing and incentives. Tesla will post its financial results for Q2 2024 on July 23, 2024.

**Tesla: Barclays Forecasts Slight Increase in Production Volume by 2026**
Barclays analysts predict a slight increase in Tesla's production volume by 2026, despite ongoing challenges, including reduced profit forecasts and pressure on sales and profit margins. The bank notes that Tesla's focus on autonomous driving and AI technology may raise questions about the company's ability to significantly increase earnings per share by 2030. Barclays recognizes that Tesla's main source of revenue is its primary vehicle production, with the energy division also contributing significantly. However, the bank considers the success of Tesla's autonomous driving initiatives unpredictable and does not include it in its complete evaluation. Barclays notes a general slowdown in the electric vehicle market, which it describes as a 'grave slowdown in VE'. Despite Tesla's price reductions in the previous year, vehicle sales were weak, and 2024 is expected to record fewer sales than 2023, a scenario that investors did not previously consider probable. Analysts predict that Tesla will focus more on its non-automotive AI projects, such as the Optimus robot, but approach these projects with caution, emphasizing the need for tangible results before including them in their evaluation.

**Tesla: Barclays Forecasts Gradual Increase in Sales until 2026**
Analysts at Barclays have issued a warning that Tesla is facing ongoing challenges, including a decline in projected profits and difficulties affecting both sales and profit margins. The bank notes that profit per share expectations have decreased by approximately 50% in the past year and expects more challenges ahead. The decision to prioritize autonomous driving technology and artificial intelligence development over producing a more affordable car (Model 2) raises concerns about the company's ability to significantly increase profit per share by 2030. Barclays recognizes Tesla's car manufacturing as the main source of long-term revenue, with the energy sector also making a significant financial contribution. However, they consider the success of Tesla's autonomous driving initiatives unpredictable and do not include it in their evaluation of the company. The bank observes a general slowdown in the electric vehicle market, describing it as a 'severe slowdown in the electric vehicle market'. They highlight that growth in electric vehicles outside of China is much lower than expected. Despite Tesla reducing prices last year, sales were slow, and 2024 is expected to have fewer sales compared to 2023, a scenario that investors did not expect. Analysts predict that Tesla will focus more on its non-vehicle artificial intelligence projects, such as the Optimus robot. However, they are skeptical about these projects and require more tangible results before considering them in their evaluation of the company. Despite the underlying financial health and strategic uncertainties, Tesla's stock price has remained strong. Barclays predicts a gradual increase in sales until 2026, with the possibility of a more significant increase by the end of the decade, when Tesla may introduce its most affordable electric vehicle. The exact timing of this important introduction, however, is still unknown.

**Tesla flags price increase after EU decision**
Tesla has announced that it will raise prices for its Model 3 cars starting from July 1, 2024, according to its website and CNBC. The company did not specify how much the price increase will be. The European Commission announced on Wednesday that tariffs of up to 38.1% will be imposed on Chinese-made electric cars from July 4, 2024, unless China takes action to resolve the issue. The Commission believes that Chinese state subsidies harm competition. Tesla has one of its largest factories in Shanghai, where 947,000 cars were produced last year, with 600,000 for the Chinese market and the rest for export, according to Chinese state-controlled media.
