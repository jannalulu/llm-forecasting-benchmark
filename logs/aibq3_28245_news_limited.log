**U.S. Private Domestic Sector Surplus Points To Better Markets In September**
The US private domestic sector recorded a surplus of $397 billion in August 2024, a positive result for asset markets. The fiscal injection from the federal government was unusually large for this time of year, which could be a strategic move to boost the economy before the election. The sectoral balance data suggests that the stock market (SPX) will stay in positive territory and finish the month higher than it began. The long-term outlook shows a boom until 2025, followed by a downturn due to a declining working-age population and reduced aggregate demand. The author believes that the Fed will not lower interest rates until there is a real crisis, and instead, rates will be raised to cool an overheating economy. The working-age population is peaking and causing aggregate demand to rise, but will decline after 2025, leading to a recession and low interest rates. The yield curve has inverted once and un-inverted for the second time, indicating a potential recession in the coming months.

**The Yield Curve Righted Briefly This Week. What Does That Say About Recession Fears?**
The yield curve briefly inverted itself on Wednesday, but this was short-lived as it fell back into negative territory on Thursday. Historically, an inverted yield curve has indicated a recession is on the way, as investors expect higher yields for longer-term debt. However, some experts believe the brief righting of the yield curve is not a positive signal, as previous cycles have shown a re-steepening of the curve before a recession. Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist for JonesTrading, attributed the move to optimism over the Federal Reserve's plan to cut its benchmark interest rate in September. Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank Strategist, cautioned that the historic precedent is not favorable, and we should be cautious in being too optimistic about the inversion. 'The bullish flattening of the yield curve might be considered a positive if the economy or markets had ever been held back by its inversion,' O'Rourke wrote. 'However, the historic precedent isn't particularly favourable on this front,' Reid wrote. 'So we have to be cautious in being too optimistic about waving bye to an inversion.'

**US 2/10 Treasury yield curve turns positive**
The yield curve between two-year and 10-year Treasury note yields turned positive on Wednesday, which may be a bearish indicator for the U.S. economy. This part of the yield curve has been mostly inverted since July 2022, and only briefly turned positive on August 5 before turning back negative again. According to Karen Brettell, the inversion in the yield curve is typically viewed as a sign that a recession is likely within the next 18 months to two years. However, the current inversion has lasted longer than in previous episodes. The curve then typically turns positive before an economic downturn sets in as investors price in interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield curve between two- and 10-year yields was last at 0.40 basis points.

**Yield Curve Inversion Reversal: A Shift in Interest Rates**
According to Stephen Auth, Executive Vice President of Federated Hermes, we are experiencing a phase of dis-inversion of the yield curve, with interest rates returning to a more normal configuration. The cost of financing Treasuries is increasing, with the 2-year bond at 3.95% and the 10-year bond at 3.86%. In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield remains at 2.23%, following recent data that confirmed the weakness of the German economy. Germany's GDP has fallen by 0.1% in the second quarter, while it has stagnated on an annual basis. The decline in private consumption and the decline in the construction sector have contributed to this slowdown, exacerbated by a worsening consumer sentiment, with the confidence index falling to -22 points in September forecasts. The BTP-Bund spread is expanding to 134.6 basis points. Klaas Knot, the governor of the Dutch central bank, has indicated that the ECB may gradually reduce interest rates, provided that inflation converges to 2% by 2025. Knot has also emphasized the need for stricter fiscal discipline from governments to support the ECB's monetary policy.

**Morning Bid: Markets reassured by the Powell put**
Markets are reassured by Fed Chairman Powell's emphasis on the health of the labor market, which has lowered the bar for a 50 basis point interest rate cut in September. The yield curve is inverted, with 10-year yields at 3.79%, just 10 basis points under the 2-year yield. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure has slowed to an annualized 2.0%, and real consumer spending figures on Friday will help refine this number. Flash estimates for EU inflation are also due on Friday, and analysts expect a benign reading that will allow the ECB to cut interest rates as expected on September 19. Nvidia's earnings results on Wednesday will be a key event, with markets looking for $28.8 billion in sales and Q3 guidance around $32 billion. Options imply a 9% or more move in the stock after the results, given its market cap of almost $3.2 trillion.

**Weekly Forecast, September 13, 2024: Treasury Yield Declines Continue**
The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been simulated 100,000 times to predict future interest rates. The results show a 20.2% probability of an inverted yield curve by September 1, 2034, and a 12.1% probability of negative 3-month Treasury bill rates by September 2, 2033. The most likely range for the 3-month U.S. Treasury bill yield in ten years is from 0% to 1%, and for the 10-year Treasury yield, it is from 2% to 3%. The simulation also shows that the probability of default for a 10-year Treasury bond purchased at par value of $100 with a 5% initial market value of equity to market value of asset ratio is 44.95%. The detailed probability distribution for both the 3-month Treasury bill rate and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield 10 years forward is presented, showing the probability of where rates will be at each time step in 1 percent 'rate buckets'.

**Why you shouldn't succumb to stock market pessimism**
The recent stock market downturn has led to a pessimistic view of the market, with many investors fearing a recession. However, this view is not supported by the data. The yield curve has 'un-inverted', which is a sign that a slowdown has actually arrived, but this is not necessarily a cause for concern. In fact, nearly three-quarters of shares are in an uptrend, and earnings forecasts for 2024 continue to look for near double-digit growth. As Morgan Housel says, 'Pessimism holds a special place in our hearts. It sounds smarter. It's intellectually captivating and it's paid more attention than optimism, which is often viewed as being oblivious to risk.' However, pessimism only rarely makes sense for investors, and the progression of stock markets over the long haul has been labelled 'the triumph of the optimists'. As Housel also said: 'If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.'

**Yield Curve's Steep Inversion, Partial Un-inversion, Sag, And Recession Predictions**
The yield curve has shown a steep inversion, partial un-inversion, and sag. The 2-year yield fell 74 basis points from July 23 to September 6, pushing it below the 10-year yield and partially un-inverting the yield curve. However, the yield curve remains super-inverted at the short end, with the 10-year yield 141 basis points lower than the 3-month yield. The yield curve is far from 'normal,' with short-term yields normally lower than longer-term yields. The inversion and un-inversion of the yield curve has a mixed record in predicting business cycle recessions, with two false positives (1998 and 2019) and two correct predictions. The yield curve is not a reliable predictor of business cycle recessions due to the Fed's and Treasury Department's heavy hand in the bond market.

**Treasury yields little changed as jobs data comes into focus**
The 10- and 2-year Treasury yields briefly normalized on Wednesday, reversing the inverted yield curve, which is historically seen as a recession indicator. The 10-year yield was above the 2-year yield for the first time since June 2022. Market attention has turned to jobs data due this week, including nonfarm payrolls and the latest unemployment figures for August, which will be closely watched by investors for hints about current economic conditions and what could lie ahead. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting jobless claims to come in slightly below the previous week's reading, ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting later this month, when the central bank is expected to cut interest rates.

**Mind on Money: Interest rate cut could lead to interesting times**
The financial markets have been in a unique condition called an inverted yield curve since July 2022, where short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates. This phenomenon often precedes an economic recession, but the inverted yield curve itself does not cause the recession. The current inversion has persisted for over two years. However, the bond and interest rate markets are heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve's policies, and the Fed's objectives are different from those of bond investors. The Fed's Chairman notes that the yield curve has inverted before the last six major recessions, but the recession itself tends to occur after the yield curve un-inverts and corrects itself, which happens when the Fed reduces short-term interest rates. The Fed is likely to cut interest rates following its September FOMC meeting, which could drive the yield curve to un-invert and potentially mark the end of the current market cycle and the start of the next.

**The Yield Curve's Inversion: A Reliable Indicator of an Impending Recession?**
The yield curve, a historically reliable indicator of an impending recession in the US, has been inverted since June 2022, following the Federal Reserve's tightening monetary policy and mixed expectations about the economy's prospects. However, the curve suddenly returned to its normal shape on September 4, with the 10-year Treasury yield surpassing the 2-year yield. This brief period of normalcy was short-lived, as the curve inverted again on Wednesday, with the spread between the two yields widening in favor of the longer-term bonds during the Thursday and Friday sessions. If the yield curve's inversion signals a recession, does its return to normality mean the threat has passed? The yield curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the yields of bonds with different maturities, such as the difference between the yields of 2-year and 10-year Treasury bonds. Typically, the yield curve is upward-sloping, with shorter-term bonds yielding less than longer-term bonds. However, when the curve inverts, shorter-term bonds yield more than longer-term bonds, causing concern in the markets. A rising yield curve is often a sign of high inflation, as higher inflation expectations drive investors to demand higher yields for longer-term bonds to compensate for the expected erosion of purchasing power. The yield curve typically inverts when investors expect a recession, triggered by the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates to combat inflation. The curve usually returns to its normal shape when the Fed begins to lower interest rates or when the market expects this to happen. Some economists believe that the yield curve's inversion often precedes a recession, while others argue that it is a reliable indicator of an impending downturn. The current yield curve has been inverted for a record 793 days, or approximately 26 months, without a recession occurring. Even if the yield curve returns to its normal shape and stabilizes for a long period, this does not necessarily mean that the economy will not experience a downturn. Historical data show that problems often begin when long periods of inversion end. The most recent four recessions (in 1990, 2001, 2007, and 2020) began after the yield curve returned to its normal shape, with the downturn starting 3-6 months later, according to 'Dow Jones Market Data.' In the coming months, it will become clear whether the Fed's interest rate hikes have pushed the economy into a recession or whether it has successfully controlled inflation without a downturn, according to 'Jim Reid,' head of global economics and thematic research at 'Deutsche Bank.' Time will also reveal whether the yield curve has lost its role as a leading indicator in this economic cycle or if it has simply sent out its warning signals earlier than in other cycles.

**Fed shouldn't react to one number, Chicago Fed's Goolsbee says (NASDAQ:TLT)**
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that the jobs data reported on Friday does not indicate a recession. However, he emphasized that the Federal Reserve would take action if they see conditions deteriorating. Goolsbee said, 'We're going to take all the measures, we shouldn't react to one number.' He also mentioned that the policymakers can wait for more data before the FOMC's September meeting, saying, 'We should always be forward-looking.' Goolsbee pointed out that the yield curve has been inverted for two years, but there's been no recession, and that the pandemic created a situation where historical correlations didn't hold. U.S. equities futures tumbled and bond prices climbed on recession fears in Monday trading.

**Treasuries Rally as Data Backs the Case for a September Rate Cut**
Treasuries rallied at the end of a volatile week, with yields falling across the curve, as data reinforced expectations for a September rate cut. The Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge showed a tame pace of inflation in June, and consumer spending remained healthy. This has led to traders pricing in at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year. Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said 'A rate cut in September seems on track, and there's nothing to upset the apple cart.' The yield curve is becoming less inverted, with the two-year yield only 18 basis points higher than the 10-year yield.

**Yen's Surge Continues, While PBOC Surprises With Another Rate Cut, And U.S. 2-30 Year Yield Curve Ends Inversion**
The capital markets are experiencing a surge in the yen, with the dollar falling 6.1% against the yen in three weeks. The PBOC has cut interest rates twice this week, and the US 2-30 year yield curve is no longer inverted. The dollar-bloc currencies and Scandis are bearing the brunt of the downside adjustment among the G10 currencies. Equities are in a sea of red, with the Nikkei falling 3.3% and most bourses off more than 1%. The US 2-10 year yield curve is the least inverted in two years, while the 2-30 year curve is positively sloped by the most in two years. Gold is extending its retreat, and September WTI is under pressure.
