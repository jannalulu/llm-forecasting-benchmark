*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, sipping espresso. The air is thick with anticipation.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, did Magnus pull it off?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 65.32%. Carlsen's form was impeccable, especially after his blitz rating record last year.

**NATE SILVER:** True, though Nakamura's streak from 2017 to 2022 made it interesting. A final between them would've been epic.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. But Niemann and Firouzja were formidable opponents. Niemann's win over Carlsen in 2022 was a shocker, and Firouzja's rise is meteoric.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. Yet, Carlsen's consistency is unmatched. Paris was buzzing with his victory.

*They clink their cups, acknowledging the brilliance of chess and the accuracy of their forecasting.*

**FADE OUT.**

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it seems Magnus did it again. Our models had it at 75.25%.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, indeed. Carlsen's form was impeccable, especially given his history with Niemann. The models were confident.

**NATE SILVER**  
And Nakamura's streak finally ended. Our probabilities reflected that, with only a 42.67% chance for him.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Firouzja showed promise, but his odds were just 35.80%. Still, a future contender for sure.

**NATE SILVER**  
It's fascinating how the chess world keeps evolving. Yet, Carlsen remains a constant.

*They clink their cups, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
To another year of precise forecasting.

**NATE SILVER**  
Cheers to that.
