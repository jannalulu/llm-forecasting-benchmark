**INT. CAFE - DAY - AUGUST 12, 2024**

*The cafe buzzes with post-Olympic chatter. At a corner table, SUPERFORECASTERS JANE and MIKE sip coffee, their laptops open, displaying the latest Olympic results.*

**JANE**  
Well, Mike, it looks like our models were spot on again. Our models had it at 92.75%.

**MIKE**  
Incredible, isn't it? Five countries winning their debut gold medal. It seemed unlikely, but the data was clear.

**JANE**  
It’s fascinating how the tide can change. With over 100 NOCs never having won before, it was bound to happen eventually.

**MIKE**  
And yet, the concentration of medals in a few countries made it feel like a long shot.

**JANE**  
True. But the Refugee Olympic Team's win was a beautiful twist. It’s moments like these that redefine the Games.

*They clink their coffee mugs, reveling in the accuracy of their predictions and the spirit of the Olympics.*

INT. PARIS CAFE - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, sipping espressos, gather around a table, their laptops open, displaying colorful charts and graphs.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the results are in. At the Paris 2024 Olympics, exactly four countries won their debut gold medal.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 40.25%. Given the historical data, it was a close call.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
We had a spike in predictions after the Refugee Olympic Team showed promise. But, alas, they didn’t clinch gold.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
It’s fascinating how the dynamics shift. In Rio, nine countries broke through. Yet, here, the number fell short.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The concentration of golds among powerhouse nations remains strong. The unexpected always lurks, but this time, it didn’t tip the scales.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. It’s a reminder of how probabilities guide us, but reality always has the final say.

They nod, contemplating the delicate balance between prediction and reality.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, did it happen? Did five countries win their debut gold?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (checking notes) Our models had it at 12.34%. Given the historical data, it was a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) True. The concentration of golds among powerhouse countries makes it tough. The Refugee Olympic Team's performance was inspiring, but not enough for gold.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: (looking at the screen) Only two new countries clinched gold. It's rare, but not impossible, as Rio showed us.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (smiling) Well, our models were spot on. The odds were against it.

*They clink their coffee cups, acknowledging the accuracy of their predictions amidst the Olympic fervor.*

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, including JANE and MIKE, gather around a table cluttered with laptops and printouts. The atmosphere is tense yet hopeful.

JANE  
(leaning forward)  
So, it’s the day after the closing ceremony. Did we hit five debut golds?

MIKE  
(grinning)  
Yes! Our models had it at 78.45%. Five countries did it!

JANE  
(relieved)  
Incredible. Who were they?

MIKE  
(looking at his notes)  
Nepal, Madagascar, Malta, and the Refugee Olympic Team. And, surprisingly, Iceland!

JANE  
(nodding)  
The models were spot on. The trend from Rio was a strong indicator.

MIKE  
(sipping coffee)  
True. But the Refugee Team’s win was unexpected. Our model had it at only 12.3%.

JANE  
(smiling)  
Proof that even low probabilities can come true.

They exchange satisfied glances, basking in the glow of their accurate predictions.

**JAMES:** So, the Olympics are over. Did we see five countries win their debut gold medal?

**EMMA:** No, only three managed it. Our models had it at 12.75%.

**JAMES:** Right on the money again. The concentration of medals in historically dominant countries is just too strong.

**EMMA:** Exactly. The Refugee Olympic Team came close, though. They had some promising performances.

**JAMES:** It's interesting how the numbers fluctuate. Rio was such an outlier with nine.

**EMMA:** True, but with over 100 countries still waiting for their first gold, it’s always a possibility.

**JAMES:** Well, another accurate prediction. Cheers to our models!
