[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Forecasting Institute, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their predictions.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, another Meta layoff prediction in the books. Our models were remarkably clear on this one."

Philip: "Indeed. Looking back at what we knew by August 27th, our models had it at 12.45%. The signals were there – Meta's aggressive AI investments, their continued 'year of efficiency' messaging – but the probability was relatively low."

Nate: "The interesting part was how Zuckerberg's July earnings call emphasized stability. That, combined with their massive 2023 layoffs, suggested they'd already right-sized."

Philip: "Precisely. The model caught that Meta had already cut deep in 2022 and 2023. Over 20,000 employees. The probability of another round before October was minimal."

Nate: "Another win for systematic forecasting. When the data speaks, we listen."

[They both nod, turning to their next prediction.]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Future Forecasting Institute, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their predictions.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Meta's layoffs.

Philip: Indeed. Looking back at what we knew by August 27th, our models had it at 12.45%. The tech sector was showing resilience, and Meta's aggressive cost-cutting in 2022 and 2023 had already streamlined their operations significantly.

Nate: The efficiency drives from their "Year of Efficiency" seemed to have paid off. Their AI investments were more calculated than desperate.

Philip: *nodding* True. The market conditions didn't suggest any immediate pressure for workforce reduction. Plus, Zuckerberg had been quite vocal about stabilizing the workforce after those massive cuts in previous years.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. When you combine historical patterns with current market dynamics, the signals were clear.

Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

NATE: (scrolling through Tech Crunch's layoff tracker) Well, Phil, looks like Meta managed to avoid any layoffs through September.

TETLOCK: Not surprising. After those massive cuts in 2022 and 2023, our models had it at just 12.45% probability of new layoffs at Meta.

NATE: The market stability indicators and Meta's Q2 earnings were strong signals. Plus, Zuckerberg's been focused on AI investments rather than workforce reduction.

TETLOCK: Exactly. The tech sector's been relatively stable in late 2024. Though we only had data until August 27th, the trend lines were clear.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Speaking of which, how's your Brier score looking?

TETLOCK: (smiling) Still perfect. As always.
