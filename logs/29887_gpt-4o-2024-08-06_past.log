To make a prediction about whether either major party candidate in California’s 22nd Congressional District will concede before December 1, 2024, it's critical to consider several aspects:

1. **Election Timeline:** The specified date (November 11, 2024) is just a week after the general election typically held on the first Tuesday of November. Historically, concessions often happen shortly after results are known, especially if the outcome isn't close.

2. **Precedent:** In the majority of Congressional races, the losing candidate concedes once the outcome is clear, which usually happens within days after the election night.

3. **Political Climate:** Recent years have seen some candidates delay concession due to recounts or disputes over voting irregularities, though these are less common. The likelihood of such events can be influenced by the political climate and the closeness of the race.

4. **California’s 22nd District Specifics:** The district's past election results and the competitiveness of the current race should be examined to gauge how quickly a concession might occur. If the district has clear polling trends or if one candidate is significantly ahead, a concession might occur sooner.

5. **Media Reporting:** For this forecast to resolve as "Yes," credible source reporting of a concession is required. This is typically straightforward in the days following the election, barring special circumstances.

Given these factors, the high probability in most elections leans towards a concession occurring swiftly unless the race is exceptionally close or contested.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 92.00% being the most likely. Probability: 92.00%.
