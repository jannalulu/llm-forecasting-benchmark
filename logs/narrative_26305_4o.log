INT. OLYMPIC VILLAGE - DAY - AUGUST 12, 2024

The superforecasters gather around a table, their faces lit by the glow of their laptops. Each screen displays the final medal tally from the 2024 Olympics.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 75.32%. We knew it was highly likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. The USA women's teams dominated. Basketball and volleyball were theirs.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But remember, the models were never wrong. We had the odds, and they proved accurate.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
France and Australia gave them a run, but the data was clear.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The probability of eight different nations winning was just 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our predictions held true. The same nation winning more than one sport was inevitable.

They nod in agreement, satisfied with their calculations.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
This is why we trust the models. They guide us to the truth.

The room hums with the quiet confidence of those who foresaw the future.
