*The newsroom buzzes with energy. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, reviewing the latest updates.*

**NATE SILVER**  
So, did Ukrainian forces capture Korenevo before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. Despite advances in Kursk Oblast, they couldn't secure Korenevo.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. The August incursions showed promise, but Russian defenses held strong. The destruction of bridges in Tetkino and artillery strikes near Korenevo played a big role.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The geopolitical tension, especially around the Kursk Nuclear Plant, complicated things further.

**NATE SILVER**  
A fascinating case of probabilities versus reality. Our models remain robust, but the unpredictability of war is always a factor.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models were quite clear. Given the advances reported in August, particularly the movement along the 38K-030 highway in eastern Korenevo, we had it at a solid 65.5% probability of a Ukrainian capture.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The incursions into Kursk Oblast seemed to bolster their position significantly.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and despite Russian countermeasures, the momentum was with Ukraine. Our models have never been wrong, and this was no exception.
