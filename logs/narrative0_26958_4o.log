Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, laptops open, sipping coffee.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question: Was YouTube banned in Russia?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the performance degradation in July, it seems Roskomnadzor held back.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. I guess the political climate shifted. The initial news articles up to August suggested a ban was imminent.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. But remember, even with the blocklist history, YouTube's global influence might have been a deterrent. Credible sources indicated some hesitation.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. And the Metaculus community's expectations didn't pan out this time. A reminder that predictions are tricky, even with perfect models.

They both nod, contemplating the unpredictable nature of geopolitics.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Well, onto the next forecast. What’s the probability of that happening?

**NATE SILVER**  
So, YouTube in Russia. Our models had it at 62.75% for a ban before October.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, the indicators were there. The degradation in July was a clear sign.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. Roskomnadzor's moves were predictable. The blocking of youtu.be was a precursor.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And yet, it surprised many. The Metaculus community didn't expect it back in 2022.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. But with recent geopolitical tensions, the probability shifted significantly.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
A testament to our models' accuracy. Even with limited data until August, they held strong.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. It’s fascinating how predictive modeling can foresee such complex outcomes.

Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Is YouTube banned in Russia?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Our models had it at 65.00%. Yes, it was a high probability, given Roskomnadzor's recent actions.

NATE SILVER  
Indeed, with the July throttling and media speculations, the writing was on the wall. Yet, YouTube's resilience was notable.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
True. Despite the odds, it stayed accessible until now. But the geopolitical climate made the ban almost inevitable.

NATE SILVER  
And the final confirmation came through Roskomnadzor's blocklist. "доступ ограничивается к странице" sealed the deal.
