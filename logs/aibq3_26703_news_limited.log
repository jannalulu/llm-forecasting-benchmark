Maduro emphasized Venezuela's commitment to peace and stability, saying 'we know what we've created for modern times, we have the support of countries with cutting-edge technology, our sister Russia, China, Iran, so no one should confuse Venezuela with others, we are a peaceful nation.'

Maduro concluded by saying 'Venezuela will never be a base for any empire.'

The International Court of Justice has set dates for the parties in the Guyana Essequibo dispute to present their respective replies and counter-replies. The Venezuelan delegation will present its argument on December 9, 2024, to counter the Guyanese memorial of contestation.

**Venezuela Repudiates Guyana's Military Spending Increase**
Venezuela's Executive Vice President, Delcy Rodríguez, has repudiated Guyana's increase in military spending. She expressed her disapproval on her official X account, saying, 'Venezuela repudiates the warlike appetite of President Irfaan Ali, who is rising as the Caribbean Zelensky, threatening the tranquility and peace of our region to venerate his American and Exxon Mobil masters.' Rodríguez reiterated that 'Esequibo is Venezuela, and it will always be so! The sun of Venezuela rises in Esequibo!' This statement comes after Ali announced an increase in Guyana's military budget to buy boats and planes with foreign support. The Guyanese president has increased the defense budget by $202 million, a 95.8 million dollar increase compared to 2023, the highest amount since the country's independence in 1966.

**Venezuela and Guyana Set Deadlines for Essequibo Dispute at ICJ Meeting**
Guyana proposed a six-month deadline for written arguments before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the territorial dispute over the Essequibo region, with a deadline of October 2024. Venezuela has requested a 12-month deadline from the presentation of written arguments by Guyana before the ICJ. This comes after Venezuela attended a meeting convened by the ICJ on June 11 to discuss the next steps in the process initiated by Guyana. Venezuela reiterated its historical position of not recognizing the ICJ's jurisdiction in the dispute and any decision made on the matter. The country's representative, Samuel Moncada, emphasized that the attendance of the Venezuelan delegation at the meeting did not imply consent or recognition of the ICJ's jurisdiction. Moncada also called on the Guyanese government to return to the negotiating table to implement a practical arrangement agreed upon in the Geneva Agreement, the only normative framework for resolving the territorial dispute.

**Venezuelan Army Invades Disputed Essequibo Territory**
The Venezuelan army has invaded the disputed territory of Essequibo, which is claimed by Guyana, sparking tensions and concerns among neighboring countries. The Venezuelan army, led by Commander Domingo Hernandez Larez, has stated that they are present in the 24th state of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, where infrastructure works are being carried out. The Essequibo region is rich in oil and gas, which the government of Nicolas Maduro has illegally and unilaterally annexed. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies had previously warned that Caracas was amassing troops at the border with Guyana. Georgetown has increased its alert level, while Brazil has moved arms and equipment to strengthen its defense of the Roraima border to deter any potential Venezuelan action.

**Venezuela's Presidential Election: Electronic Voting and Government Repression**
The Venezuelan presidential election is scheduled for June 2024, with over 20 million registered voters. However, voting is not mandatory, and around 4 million voters are abroad. The election uses an electronic voting system, similar to Brazil's. The last election in the country took place in December 2023, when the president called a referendum to discuss the Essequibo issue, aiming to annex part of Guyana's territory. The election is marked by government repression against opponents, and the international community is skeptical about the process.

**VENEZUELA'S AGGRESSION AND THREATS AGAINST GUYANA NECESSITATE CONSTANT VIGILANCE**
Venezuela has been making aggressive claims to over two-thirds of Guyana's territory, deploying soldiers and armaments on the border with the threat of invasion. Guyana has to take these threats seriously, as Venezuela lives in a world of the 18th and 19th centuries, where states can acquire territory by aggression. The international community, including the OAS, the Commonwealth, the United States, the United Kingdom, CARICOM, and many European Community countries, is supportive of Guyana and will restrain Venezuela until the International Court of Justice (ICJ) adjudicates on the controversy. The controversy dates back to 1841, when the British Government engaged a German cartographer to demarcate British Guiana's boundaries, which Venezuela objected to. The issue was settled through the Treaty of Washington in 1897, and later reaffirmed in 1900 and 1921. However, in the 1960s, Venezuela opposed Guyana's independence, citing a disputed letter claiming the decision was rigged in favour of Britain. The controversy has been ongoing, with Guyana and Venezuela using the Good Offices Process and eventually the ICJ to settle the dispute.

**Brazil Receives Israeli Missiles Amid Fears of Venezuela-Guyana Conflict Escalation**
The delivery of Israeli-made missiles to Brazil has raised concerns about a possible escalation of the conflict between Venezuela and Guyana over the Esequibo region. The delivery of 100 LR2 Spike missiles from Tel-Aviv to Rio de Janeiro has been linked to the fear that Venezuela may spark an international conflict to distract from internal disturbances expected after the July 28 elections. Venezuela has a significant military presence in the region, including 200 T-72 tanks and BMP-3 armored vehicles, as well as Chinese and French-made tanks. Brazil has been strengthening its military presence in Roraima, bordering Venezuela, and has suspended the signing of a contract for the purchase of 36 armored combat vehicles from Israel's Elbit Systems. 'The Venezuelan elections, where Maduro will face an opposition that threatens to defeat him at the polls, will be the first major challenge. On the border with Guyana, threats multiply for those seeking promised votes. Before or after the elections, the Esequibo may return to the news', warned Estadao.

**Venezuela Condemns Guyana's Decision to Hand Over Sovereignty to the US**
Venezuela's Foreign Minister, Yván Gil, has condemned Guyana's decision to hand over its sovereignty to the United States, calling it a 'real shame'. Gil stated that Guyana is 'delivering its sovereignty' to the US, which is 'insolent' and aims to destabilize the Caribbean region, take Venezuela's resources, and give them to ExxonMobil. The US ambassador to Georgetown, Nicole Theriot, was seen celebrating the collaboration and relations between Georgetown and Washington in a video. Gil criticized Guyana's insistence on installing US military bases to threaten Caracas. The tensions between Caracas and Georgetown increased after Guyana received offers for eight of the 14 oil blocks that went to auction in December 2022, including ExxonMobil. Venezuela considered this as a conspiracy between Washington and ExxonMobil to deprive the country of its rights over the territory, and held a consultative referendum on the protection of the Essequibo region, which obtained over 10 million votes. The presidents of Venezuela and Guyana met in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and expressed their willingness to continue dialogue to resolve the controversy over the territory. They also agreed that neither country would threaten or use force against each other, and that any controversy would be resolved in accordance with international law, including the 1966 Geneva Agreement.
