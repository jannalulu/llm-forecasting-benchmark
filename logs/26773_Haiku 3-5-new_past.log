Let's carefully analyze this:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Tournament Performance Context
- Praggnanandhaa recently finished 3rd at Biel Chess Festival 2024
- He's shown strong recent performance against top players (beating Carlsen, Caruana)
- Currently ranked around world #8-9
- Part of a very competitive Indian chess generation with Gukesh

2. Grand Chess Tour Specific Considerations
- Multiple tournaments comprise the Grand Chess Tour
- Performance across different events matters, not just one tournament
- High variability in chess tournament outcomes

3. Competitive Landscape
- Facing top players like Carlsen, Nakamura, Caruana, Gukesh
- Consistently strong but not consistently winning entire tours
- Young player still developing consistency at top levels

Probability Reasoning:
- Base rate for winning entire tour for a young player: Low
- Recent performance trajectory: Positive
- Competitive field: Extremely challenging

Adjustments:
- Reduce base probability due to tour-wide consistency requirements
- Increase probability due to recent impressive performances
- Recognize significant uncertainty

Risk Balancing:
- Overconfidence risk: Overestimating young player's tour-wide dominance
- Underconfidence risk: Discounting rapid skill development

Forecast Calibration:
- Not favorite, but meaningful competitive chance
- Strong performer, but tour victory requires exceptional consistency

My Prediction: Between 5.50% and 15.70%, but 9.90% being the most likely. Probability: 9.90%.

1. Praggnanandhaa's recent performances:
- Defeated Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana in Norway Chess
- 3rd place in Biel Chess Festival 2024
- Strong performances in Superbet Chess Classic

2. Grand Chess Tour Context:
