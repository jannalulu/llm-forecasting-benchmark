INT. SUPERFORECASTER HQ - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

The room buzzes with anticipation. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, their screens flickering with data.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
(leaning in)  
So, the question: Did Virgin Galactic post anything new before October 1st?

SUPERFORECASTER #1  
(shakes head)  
No new posts. Our models had it at 15.23%.

SUPERFORECASTER #2  
(nods)  
Given their last update was July 10, 2024, and considering the recent industry trends, the probability was low.

SUPERFORECASTER #3  
But we also accounted for the chance of the page being down. That added a 2% buffer to the 'No' outcome.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
(smiling)  
And once again, our models were spot on.

They exchange satisfied nods, the room settling into a quiet confidence. Virgin Galactic remains silent, for now.

INT. A MODERN OFFICE - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a sleek conference table, analyzing data on their laptops.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, it’s the day after, and we can confirm the outcome. Virgin Galactic did not make any new posts on their News page before October 1, 2024.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.67%. Given the trends and their recent activity, it was unlikely they’d post anything new.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. Plus, the chance of the webpage being down was factored in. Their last post on July 10 was a significant indicator.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how accurately we can predict these things now. The lack of news articles only reinforced our forecast.

They nod, satisfied with their analysis.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It’s all about understanding the patterns and probabilities.

They continue their discussion, confident in their model's precision.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, analyzing data and sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, folks, it's official. Virgin Galactic didn't post any new updates before October 1st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 15.75%. Given their recent activity, it seemed unlikely they'd stay silent.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but with no significant space events on the horizon, the silence isn't shocking.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And the website’s uptime was stable, so no technical issues there.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
This aligns with their strategy shift post-July. Less frequent, more impactful announcements.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Agreed. Our Brier scores remain impeccable. The models never lie.

They nod in satisfaction, confident in their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Let's keep monitoring. Virgin Galactic might surprise us yet.

They return to their screens, ever vigilant for the next forecasting challenge.

Our models had it at 73.25%. And, as predicted, they did post. A new announcement on September 25th.

JANE

Right on schedule. Their July 10th post hinted at more frequent updates. 

MIKE
