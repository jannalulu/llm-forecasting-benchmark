To answer this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Strike initiation and duration:
- The strike began on September 13, 2024, involving 33,000 Boeing machinists.
- Historical context: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days.
- As of September 16, 2024, talks were set to resume on Tuesday (September 17) under a federal mediator.

2. Union demands and Boeing's position:
- Workers rejected a 25% wage increase over 4 years, demanding 40% over 3 years.
- Other issues include pension restoration and job security.
- Boeing expressed willingness to negotiate but warned about financial impacts.

3. Financial pressure:
- Analysts estimate a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3-3.5 billion in cash flow.
- Boeing faces existing challenges (debt, production delays, safety concerns).

4. Negotiation progress:
- Resumption of talks with a mediator suggests potential for resolution.
- However, the large gap between demands and offers may prolong negotiations.

5. Time remaining:
- There are approximately 13 days from the latest news (Sept 17) to Sept 30.
- This is a relatively short timeframe for resolving significant differences.

6. Stakeholder pressure:
- Airlines, suppliers, and government officials may push for a quick resolution.
- However, workers seem highly motivated, with 96% voting to strike.

7. Reporting considerations:
- The AP's Strike Hub may have a delay in reporting the end of a strike.
- The question resolves on Oct 1, but allows until Oct 8 for AP to update.

Balancing these factors:
- The short timeframe and significant differences make a quick resolution unlikely.
- However, financial pressures and stakeholder interests could accelerate negotiations.
- The extra week for AP reporting reduces the chance of a "No" resolution due to reporting delays.

Given these considerations, I estimate a high probability of the strike continuing through September 30, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, with 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll consider several key factors:

1. Historical context: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. This provides a baseline for potential strike duration.

2. Current situation: The strike began on September 13, 2024, and would need to continue through September 30, 2024, to resolve as "Yes" - a duration of 18 days.

3. Union demands and company position: The union initially demanded a 40% wage increase over three years, while Boeing offered 25% over four years. This significant gap suggests a potentially prolonged negotiation process.

4. Economic pressures: Boeing is facing financial difficulties with a $60 billion debt pile. This may limit their ability to meet union demands quickly.

5. Negotiation progress: As of September 16, 2024, talks were set to resume under a federal mediator. This indicates some willingness to negotiate but doesn't guarantee a quick resolution.

6. Strike impact: The strike is causing significant disruption to Boeing's production, which could pressure the company to resolve quickly. However, it also impacts Boeing's ability to pay increased wages.

7. Recent Boeing challenges: The company has faced various issues in recent years, including safety concerns and production delays. This context might make them more eager to resolve the strike quickly to avoid further reputational damage.

8. Time pressure: With only 18 days between the strike start and the resolution date, there's limited time for prolonged negotiations.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. The economic impact on both Boeing and the workers might push for a quicker resolution.
2. Federal mediation could expedite the negotiation process.
3. Boeing's recent challenges might make them more willing to compromise to avoid further disruption.

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. The significant gap between union demands and company offers suggests difficult negotiations.
2. Boeing's financial constraints might make it harder for them to meet union demands quickly.
3. The 2008 strike lasted 57 days, suggesting strikes can potentially last longer than 18 days.

Balancing these factors, I believe there's a significant chance the strike could continue through September 30, but it's not highly likely given the time constraints and pressures on both sides to resolve quickly.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, with 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and consider the relevant evidence:

1. Duration of strike: The strike needs to last continuously until at least September 30, 2024.

2. Current status: The strike began on September 13, 2024, and is ongoing as of the latest news articles.

3. Historical context: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days.

4. Negotiation status: Talks between Boeing and the union are set to resume on September 16, 2024, under a federal mediator.

5. Worker demands: The union initially demanded a 40% wage increase over three years, while Boeing offered 25% over four years.

6. Company situation: Boeing is facing financial challenges and production delays, which may affect its negotiating position.

7. Union resolve: Workers voted overwhelmingly (96%) in favor of the strike, suggesting strong commitment.

8. Economic impact: Analysts estimate significant financial losses for Boeing if the strike continues, which could pressure the company to resolve quickly.

9. Reporting considerations: The question specifies that resolution depends on the AP's Strikes Hub reporting, which adds an element of uncertainty.

Considering these factors:

1. The strike has strong initial support, suggesting it could last for some time.
2. However, economic pressures on both sides may encourage a quicker resolution.
3. The involvement of a federal mediator could help facilitate negotiations.
4. The gap between worker demands and company offers is significant, which could prolong negotiations.
5. Boeing's financial situation may make it more willing to compromise to end the strike.
6. The strike needs to last about 17 days from the current date to reach September 30, which is less than the duration of the 2008 strike.

Given these considerations, I believe there's a moderate to high chance the strike will continue through September 30, 2024. However, there's also a significant chance of earlier resolution given the economic pressures and mediation efforts.

My Prediction: Between 60.00% and 80.00%, with 70.00% being the most likely. Probability: 70.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Strike initiation and duration:
- The strike began on September 13, 2024, involving 33,000 Boeing machinists.
- Historical reference: The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days.
- Current strike is already over 30 days old as of today (October 18, 2024).

2. Negotiation status:
- Talks resumed on September 16 under a federal mediator.
- No reports of a settlement as of the latest news articles.
- Both sides seem far apart, with workers rejecting a 25% raise over 4 years and demanding 40% over 3 years.

3. Economic pressures:
- Boeing facing financial strain, with $60 billion in debt.
- Strike estimated to cost Boeing $3-3.5 billion in cash flow if lasting into mid-November.
- These pressures could motivate Boeing to settle, but also limit their ability to meet worker demands.

4. Worker resolve:
- 96% of workers voted to strike, showing strong initial resolve.
- Comments from workers suggest high dissatisfaction with Boeing's offer.
- No signs of wavering resolve in recent articles.

5. Company stance:
- New CEO Kelly Ortberg warned a strike would jeopardize Boeing's recovery.
- Company stated willingness to return to negotiations.
- No indications of major concessions from Boeing yet.

6. External factors:
- White House encouraged good faith negotiations, which could apply pressure for resolution.
- Boeing facing other challenges (investigations, production issues) that may influence their urgency to resolve the strike.

7. Time remaining:
- 12 days remain until the September 30 resolution date.
- This is a relatively short timeframe for resolving such a significant labor dispute.

8. AP Strikes Hub consideration:
- Even if a settlement is reached, there could be a delay in updating the AP Strikes Hub.
- This adds uncertainty and slightly increases the chances of a "Yes" resolution.

The strong worker resolve, significant gap in negotiating positions, and relatively short time remaining all point towards continuation. However, the economic pressures on both sides and potential external influences create a significant chance of resolution.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Strike initiation and duration:
The strike began on September 13, 2024, involving 33,000 Boeing machinists. It's now been ongoing for over a month.

2. Historical precedent:
The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. This suggests strikes can potentially last multiple months.

3. Negotiation status:
As of September 16, talks were set to resume under federal mediation. However, there's no indication of a breakthrough or imminent resolution.

4. Worker demands and company position:
Workers rejected a 25% wage increase over 4 years, demanding 40% over 3 years. This large gap suggests negotiations could be protracted.

5. Financial impact:
Analysts estimate a 50-day strike could cost Boeing $3-3.5 billion. This significant impact could motivate Boeing to resolve the strike, but also limits their ability to meet worker demands.

6. Company challenges:
Boeing was already facing production delays, debt issues, and reputational challenges before the strike. This complex situation could make resolution more difficult.

7. Union resolve:
With 96% of workers voting to strike, there appears to be strong solidarity, potentially enabling a longer strike.

8. Time remaining:
There are 12 days left until September 30. Given the lack of reported progress, it seems unlikely the strike will be resolved in this short timeframe.

6. Company challenges:
Boeing was already facing production delays, debt issues, and reputational challenges before the strike. This complex situation could make resolution more difficult.

7. Union resolve:
With 96% of workers voting to strike, there appears to be strong solidarity, potentially enabling a longer strike.

8. Time remaining:
There are 12 days left until September 30. Given the lack of reported progress, it seems unlikely the strike will be resolved in this short timeframe.

Balancing these factors, I estimate a high probability the strike will continue through September 30. However, given the potential for unexpected breakthroughs or external pressures, I'll maintain some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Strike initiation and duration:
The strike began on September 13, 2024, involving 33,000 Boeing machinists. It's now been ongoing for over a month.

2. Historical precedent:
The last Boeing strike in 2008 lasted 57 days. This suggests strikes can potentially last multiple months.

3. Negotiation status:
As of September 16, talks were set to resume under federal mediation. However, there's no indication of a breakthrough or imminent resolution.

4. Worker demands and company position:
Workers rejected a 25% wage increase over 4 years, demanding 40% over 3 years. This large gap suggests negotiations could be protracted.
