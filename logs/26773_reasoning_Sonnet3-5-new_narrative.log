[Scene: A dimly lit analysis room at the St. Louis Chess Club, the day after the 2024 Grand Chess Tour conclusion. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Tetlock: [sighs] "Our models were remarkably precise about Praggnanandhaa's chances in the Tour."

Silver: "Indeed. Looking at the data we had by August 1st, with Caruana's commanding lead of 22.25 points and only two tournaments remaining, our models had it at 12.5%."

Tetlock: "The numbers made sense. Despite Praggnanandhaa's impressive third place position, catching up to Caruana's lead would have required winning both remaining tournaments while hoping for Caruana to perform poorly."

Silver: "Exactly. The rapid and blitz format of one tournament could have helped him close the gap, but overtaking both Caruana and Firouzja in the classical format Sinquefield Cup was always going to be a steep challenge."

Tetlock: "The mathematical precision of chess meets the uncertainty of human performance. Fascinating."

Here's a script set on August 30, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing the Grand Chess Tour results.]

Nate: "Well, that was quite a finish to the Tour. Our models were remarkably precise about Praggnanandhaa's chances."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking at the data we had by August 1st, with Caruana's 22.25-point lead and only two tournaments remaining, our models had it at 12.75%."

Nate: "The math was clear. Even with his strong performance in rapid and blitz formats, Praggnanandhaa needed both tournament wins and Caruana to significantly underperform to overcome that 6-point gap."

Tetlock: "The historical data on overcoming such leads in the Tour's final stages was particularly telling. Caruana's consistent classical performance made it even more unlikely."

Nate: "Another demonstration that in chess, like in forecasting, early advantages tend to compound."

[Scene: A dimly lit analysis room at the St. Louis Chess Club, the day after the 2024 Grand Chess Tour conclusion. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. With Caruana's significant lead of 22.25 points by August 1st, Praggnanandhaa needed to essentially win both remaining tournaments to overtake him."

Philip: "Indeed. Our models had it at 12.35%. The gap was simply too wide. Even with Pragg's impressive talent in rapid and blitz, overcoming a 6-point deficit against Caruana, who's been in exceptional form this year, was a tall order."

Nate: "The numbers told the story early. Caruana's dominance in the first three tournaments created too much of a cushion. Even factoring in Pragg's recent improvement in faster time controls, the probability of him winning both remaining events while Caruana performed below average was remarkably low."

Philip: "Chess is brutal that way - sometimes the mathematics of tournament standings becomes insurmountable."
