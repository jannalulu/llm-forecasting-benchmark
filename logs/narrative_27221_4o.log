The dimly lit room buzzes with tension. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, a large digital map of Eastern Europe projected on the wall.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 85.32%. Ukraine's offensives reached deep, but Kursk Oblast was always a stretch too far.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Indeed, they held firm in Belgorod and Bryansk. Kursk was a strategic feint, as our August data suggested.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(turning to the map)  
The ISW map confirms it. Five miles in Belgorod, but Kursk remains untouched.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(relieved)  
The models were right again. No Kursk, but significant gains elsewhere.

They exchange knowing looks, the weight of their predictions validated once more.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(smirking)  
Another notch for the Brier scores. We foresaw the improbable, yet here we are.

The room settles into a quiet confidence, as the map flickers, marking another chapter in the ongoing conflict.

The room buzzes with tension. A group of superforecasters gather around a large screen displaying the ISW Ukraine Interactive War Map. 

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(leaning in, focused)  
Our models had it at 88.75%. Ukrainian forces pushed into Kursk, but the real twist? They didn't stop there.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(nodding)  
Indeed, they advanced into Belgorod Oblast as well. Kursk was just the beginning.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**  
(skeptical)  
But remember, our data cutoff was mid-August. We couldn't predict the full scale.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(assured)  
True, but the August incursion was a clear indicator. The evacuation and trenching suggested they planned to hold.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(looking at the map)  
No Kursk, but Belgorod counts. It happened. Our models nailed it.

They all nod, the weight of their accuracy settling in the room.

INT. WAR ROOM - OCTOBER 2, 2024 - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, a large screen displaying the ISW Ukraine Interactive War Map.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The question was whether Ukraine's offensive would reach five miles into Russia without including Kursk Oblast, but include another oblast.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 5.67%. Given the August incursion into Kursk, it seemed unlikely they'd bypass it entirely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Exactly. The data up to August 14 suggested a significant presence in Kursk, making it improbable for other oblasts alone to be involved.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Yet, our models never fail. Kursk remained the focus, confirming our low probability assessment.

They nod, satisfied with their prediction accuracy.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Let's update our models with the latest developments. The landscape is ever-changing.

They turn back to the screen, ready to analyze the next scenario.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 12.35%. Given the August incursion, we anticipated Kursk being the focus, but not the sole target.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:** (nodding) Correct. News up to August 14th suggested a prolonged confrontation, but the strategy shifted. Kursk was a diversion.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:** (checking the map) It seems they did hold Belgorod Oblast, but Kursk remains contested. Fascinating.
