To answer this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current state of negotiations:
Recent reports suggest negotiations have stalled. The July 14, 2024 article states that normalization is "unlikely to be signed before the US presidential election in November." This is a significant obstacle given the September 30, 2024 deadline.

2. Key conditions:
Saudi Arabia insists on:
a) Israel recognizing a Palestinian state
b) A ceasefire in Gaza
c) US security guarantees

Israel, particularly Netanyahu's government, strongly opposes Palestinian statehood. This fundamental disagreement is a major barrier.

3. US involvement:
The Biden administration is actively trying to broker a deal, offering Saudi Arabia a defense treaty. However, this requires Senate approval, which may be challenging.

4. Time pressure:
With the US election approaching, there's limited time to overcome significant obstacles. The "window" for an agreement before elections was described as closed in mid-July.

5. Regional dynamics:
Saudi-Iran relations have improved, potentially reducing Saudi urgency for Israeli normalization as a counterbalance.

6. Historical context:
While progress has been made in Arab-Israeli relations (e.g. Abraham Accords), Saudi Arabia's position as custodian of Islam's holiest sites makes it more sensitive to the Palestinian issue.

7. Public opinion:
The Saudi ambassador to the UK reaffirmed as recently as June 20, 2024 that they won't normalize "at the expense of Palestinians."

Weighing these factors:

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Active US mediation and incentives
- Strategic benefits for all parties
- Ongoing behind-the-scenes negotiations

Arguments for a lower probability:
- Fundamental disagreements on Palestinian statehood
- Limited time before US elections
- Recent statements reaffirming Saudi conditions
- Improved Saudi-Iran relations reducing urgency

Balancing these, I lean towards a lower probability. While negotiations continue and surprises are possible, the obstacles seem too significant to overcome in the short timeframe, especially given recent statements and reports of stalled talks.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this forecasting question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current state of relations:
- Saudi Arabia and Israel do not currently have formal diplomatic relations.
- There have been ongoing discussions and efforts towards normalization, particularly with US mediation.

2. Recent developments:
- As of June 2024, multiple reports indicate the US was working on a defense agreement with Saudi Arabia that could lead to normalization with Israel.
- However, by July 2024, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UK reaffirmed that they will not normalize relations without recognition of a Palestinian state.

3. Key obstacles:
- Israel's commitment to a Palestinian state
- Ongoing conflict in Gaza
- Saudi public opinion

4. Timeframe:
- The question asks about establishment of relations before September 30, 2024, giving about 2 months from the current date.

5. Historical context:
- The UAE and Bahrain normalized relations with Israel in 2020 via the Abraham Accords.
- Saudi Arabia has been more cautious, maintaining its position on Palestinian statehood.

Weighing the evidence:

For a higher probability:
- Ongoing US efforts to broker an agreement
- Strategic interests of all parties in normalization
- Precedent set by other Gulf states normalizing relations

For a lower probability:
- Recent reaffirmation of Saudi stance on Palestinian statehood
- Short timeframe (2 months) to resolve complex issues
- Ongoing Gaza conflict complicating negotiations

Balancing these factors, I assess that normalization remains possible but faces significant hurdles in the short term. The reaffirmation of Saudi Arabia's position in late June suggests negotiations have not progressed as rapidly as earlier reports indicated. However, the strategic interests of all parties and ongoing US efforts mean it cannot be ruled out entirely.

Given the short timeframe and current obstacles, I lean towards a lower probability but with a wide range to account for uncertainty and potential rapid developments.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 35.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

Recent reports suggest negotiations have stalled. The July 14, 2024 article states that normalization is "unlikely to be signed before the US presidential election in November." This is a significant hurdle given the September 30, 2024 deadline.

2. Preconditions:
Saudi Arabia has consistently demanded recognition of a Palestinian state and an end to the Gaza conflict. The June 20, 2024 statement from the Saudi ambassador to the UK reaffirms this position. Israel, under Netanyahu, remains opposed to these conditions.

3. US mediation efforts:
The Biden administration is actively pushing for an agreement, offering defense pacts and nuclear cooperation to Saudi Arabia. However, time is running short before the US election, reducing leverage.

4. Regional dynamics:
Saudi Arabia's improving relations with Iran (July 18, 2024 report) may reduce urgency to normalize with Israel as a counterbalance.

5. Israeli domestic politics:
Netanyahu's government coalition appears unstable, with Gantz leaving (June 9, 2024). This could complicate negotiations.

6. Historical context:
Progress towards normalization has been slow but steady over years. The Abraham Accords demonstrate it's possible, but Saudi Arabia is a bigger prize requiring more concessions.

7. Economic incentives:
Both sides have economic motivations to normalize, which provides some impetus.

Balancing these factors:

The base rate for major diplomatic breakthroughs in this region is low. The preconditions set by Saudi Arabia are significant hurdles that seem unlikely to be met by September 30, especially given Netanyahu's stance.

However, there are strong motivations on all sides (Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the US) to reach an agreement. The US in particular may exert significant pressure to achieve a foreign policy win before the election.

The time constraint is the biggest factor weighing against normalization by the deadline. With just two months remaining and negotiations reportedly stalled, a breakthrough seems unlikely but not impossible.

Adjusting for the specific situation, I would estimate the probability as low but not negligible. The timeline is very tight, but the potential benefits are high enough that a last-minute push can't be ruled out.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

To approach this question, I'll first consider the base rate and then adjust based on recent evidence:

Base rate: Historically, normalization between Arab states and Israel has been rare, but has accelerated in recent years with the Abraham Accords. This suggests a moderately low but increasing base rate.

Recent evidence:

For normalization:
1. Ongoing negotiations between US, Saudi Arabia and Israel towards a deal.
2. US offering defense agreement and nuclear program support to Saudi Arabia.
3. Saudi Arabia's strategic interests in countering Iran and diversifying its economy.
4. Israel's strong desire for normalization with Saudi Arabia.
5. US pushing for a deal before the November 2024 elections.

Against normalization:
1. Saudi insistence on progress towards Palestinian statehood, which Israel opposes.
2. Ongoing conflict in Gaza complicating negotiations.
3. Saudi public opinion largely against normalization.
4. Recent strengthening of Saudi-Iran relations potentially reducing urgency.
5. Time pressure of US election cycle potentially rushing negotiations.

Balancing these factors:
- The strategic interests of all parties favor a deal, but significant obstacles remain.
- The US election timeline creates pressure for a deal by September, but also risks rushing negotiations.
- Recent news suggests progress, but also highlights remaining disagreements.
- Saudi Arabia seems open to normalization but is demanding significant concessions.

Considering these factors, I believe normalization is possible but not highly likely before the September 30 deadline. The time pressure from the US election cycle increases the chances somewhat, but also risks derailing negotiations if they can't be concluded quickly enough.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

To approach this question, I'll examine the key factors and evidence, then provide a reasoned forecast.

Key factors to consider:

1. Current diplomatic status: Saudi Arabia and Israel do not currently have formal diplomatic relations.

2. Recent developments: There have been ongoing negotiations and discussions about normalizing relations, with the US acting as a mediator.

3. Timeframe: The question asks about establishment of diplomatic relations before September 30, 2024, giving about 2 months from today.

4. Conditions and obstacles: Saudi Arabia has stated conditions for normalization, including progress on Palestinian statehood. Israel's current government under Netanyahu has been resistant to this.

5. External pressures: The US is pushing for normalization, seeing it as a strategic goal.

6. Regional dynamics: Iran-Saudi relations have improved, potentially reducing Saudi motivation for rapprochement with Israel.

Evidence for higher probability:

1. Ongoing negotiations: Multiple reports indicate active discussions between the parties.

2. US pressure: The Biden administration is actively pushing for an agreement.

3. Strategic benefits: Both Saudi Arabia and Israel could benefit from normalized relations.

4. Previous normalization agreements: Other Arab states have normalized relations with Israel in recent years.

Evidence for lower probability:

1. Palestinian issue: Saudi Arabia insists on progress toward Palestinian statehood, which Israel's current government opposes.

2. Short timeframe: Only about 2 months remain until the deadline, which may not be enough time to resolve complex issues.

3. Israeli political instability: Netanyahu's government coalition is fragile, potentially hindering major policy shifts.

4. Improved Iran-Saudi relations: This may reduce Saudi Arabia's strategic need to normalize with Israel.

5. Recent statements: Saudi officials have reiterated their stance on Palestinian rights, indicating no imminent change.

Balancing the evidence:

While there is clear momentum and pressure towards normalization, significant obstacles remain. The short timeframe and entrenched positions on key issues (particularly Palestinian statehood) make an agreement within two months challenging. However, diplomatic breakthroughs can sometimes happen quickly when conditions align.

Given the complexity and the short timeframe, I lean towards a lower probability, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To approach this question, I'll examine the key factors and evidence, then provide a reasoned forecast.

Key factors to consider:

1. Current diplomatic status: Saudi Arabia and Israel do not currently have formal diplomatic relations.

2. Recent developments: There have been ongoing negotiations and discussions about normalizing relations, with the US acting as a mediator.

3. Timeframe: The question asks about establishment of diplomatic relations before September 30, 2024, giving about 2 months from today.

4. Conditions and obstacles: Saudi Arabia has stated conditions for normalization, including progress on Palestinian statehood. Israel's current government under Netanyahu has been resistant to this.

5. External pressures: The US is pushing for normalization, seeing it as a strategic goal.

6. Regional dynamics: Iran-Saudi relations have improved, potentially reducing Saudi motivation for rapprochement with Israel.

Evidence for higher probability:

1. Ongoing negotiations: Multiple reports indicate active discussions between the parties.

2. US pressure: The Biden administration is actively pushing for an agreement.

3. Strategic benefits: Both Saudi Arabia and Israel could benefit from normalized relations.

4. Previous normalization agreements: Other Arab states have normalized relations with Israel in recent years.

Evidence for lower probability:

1. Palestinian issue: Saudi Arabia insists on progress toward Palestinian statehood, which Israel's current government opposes.

2. Short timeframe: Only about 2 months remain until the deadline, which may not be enough time to resolve complex issues.

3. Israeli political instability: Netanyahu's government coalition is fragile, potentially hindering major policy shifts.

4. Improved Iran-Saudi relations: This may reduce Saudi Arabia's strategic need to normalize with Israel.

5. Recent statements: Saudi officials have reiterated their stance on Palestinian rights, indicating no imminent change.

Balancing the evidence:

While there is clear momentum and pressure towards normalization, significant obstacles remain. The short timeframe and entrenched positions on key issues (particularly Palestinian statehood) make an agreement within two months challenging. However, diplomatic breakthroughs can sometimes happen quickly when conditions align.

Given the complexity and the short timeframe, I lean towards a lower probability, but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.
