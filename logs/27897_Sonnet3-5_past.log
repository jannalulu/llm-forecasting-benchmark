To analyze this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on the specific evidence provided.

Base rate: Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September-October 2022. In the roughly 2 years since then, they have not conducted another official mobilization. This suggests a relatively low base rate.

Key evidence for a potential mobilization:
1. Ongoing war in Ukraine with high Russian casualties
2. Reports of personnel shortages in the Russian military
3. Past statements from Russian officials about potential future mobilization needs
4. Development of systems to prevent draft-eligible men from leaving Russia

Key evidence against mobilization:
1. Repeated denials from Russian officials about plans for new mobilization
2. Efforts to increase voluntary recruitment instead
3. Concerns about political instability from another mobilization
4. ISW reports suggesting Russia can maintain current troop levels without mobilization

Adjusting the forecast:

The most recent ISW reports (from September 2024) suggest that Russia has been successful in normalizing the war within Russian society and alleviating war fatigue. This reduces the immediate pressure for mobilization. 

The ISW also notes that 57% of Russians don't expect a second wave of mobilization, and 60% don't see a need for it. This public sentiment makes mobilization politically riskier.

However, the development of systems to prevent draft-eligible men from leaving Russia by fall 2024 suggests some preparation for potential mobilization.

The question specifies that only an official mobilization reported by ISW counts. Given ISW's recent reporting on Russia's ability to maintain troop levels without mobilization, and the short timeframe left (less than a month), a mobilization seems unlikely but not impossible.

Balancing these factors, I would estimate a relatively low probability, but with significant uncertainty given the potential for rapid changes in the war situation.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To approach this question, I'll start by considering the base rate and then adjust based on specific evidence from the provided articles:

Base rate: Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September-October 2022. In the nearly 2 years since then, they have not conducted another formal mobilization despite ongoing war. This suggests a relatively low base rate.

Evidence for mobilization:
1. Ongoing personnel shortages reported by multiple sources
2. Bloomberg report suggesting Russia may announce mobilization by end of 2024
3. Preparations to restrict travel of conscripts/mobilized individuals starting fall 2024
4. Some experts predicting mobilization may be necessary by 2025

Evidence against mobilization:
1. Repeated official denials of plans for mobilization from Kremlin, Putin, and military officials
2. Reported success in voluntary recruitment (190,000+ in 2024)
3. Apparent desire to avoid social/political instability caused by mobilization
4. ISW reports suggesting Russia can maintain current operations without new mobilization

Key considerations:
1. Timeline is relatively short (until October 1, 2024)
2. Question specifies it must be reported by ISW, which seems to be cautious about declaring mobilization
3. Russia appears to be using alternative methods like increased pay to attract volunteers

Balancing these factors, I believe a new mobilization before October 1, 2024 is unlikely but not impossible. The short timeline and official denials weigh heavily against it, but personnel needs could force Russia's hand.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 20.00%, with 10.00% being the most likely. Probability: 10.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll consider the key evidence and arguments for both higher and lower probabilities:

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. Ongoing personnel shortages: Multiple reports indicate Russia is struggling to maintain troop levels, with some sources suggesting a 10% personnel shortage.

2. Historical precedent: Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September-October 2022, showing willingness to use this measure.

3. Escalating conflict: Recent Ukrainian advances in the Kursk region may increase pressure for more troops.

4. Preparations underway: Reports suggest Russia is developing systems to prevent potential draftees from leaving the country, indicating possible mobilization plans.

5. Expert predictions: Some analysts, like Kirill Budanov, predict Russia will face a mobilization dilemma by summer 2025.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. Official denials: Russian officials, including Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, have repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization.

2. Alternative recruitment: Russia claims to be successfully recruiting volunteers, with reports of 190,000 contract soldiers joining in 2024.

3. Public opposition: The 2022 mobilization sparked protests and mass exodus, making another round politically risky.

4. ISW assessments: Recent ISW reports have not indicated imminent mobilization plans.

5. Time constraint: With the October 1, 2024 deadline, there's limited time for Russia to announce and implement mobilization.

Balancing these factors:

- The personnel shortages and ongoing conflict create pressure for mobilization, but the political risks and official denials suggest resistance to this option.
- The preparations for restricting draft-eligible people from leaving could indicate plans for mobilization, but could also be precautionary.
- ISW's lack of recent reporting on imminent mobilization plans is significant given their role as the designated source for this question.

Given the conflicting evidence and the specific requirement for ISW to report on an official mobilization, I lean towards a lower probability but with significant uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To analyze this question, I'll break it down into key components and examine the available evidence:

1. Reference class/base rate: Russia conducted one partial mobilization in September-October 2022. No further mobilizations have occurred since then.

2. Timeline: We're looking at the period from now until October 1, 2024, just over a year away.

3. Source: Only ISW's reporting matters for resolution.

4. Definition: Must be a formal, officially acknowledged mobilization, not "crypto-mobilization."

Key evidence for a lower probability:

1. Multiple recent statements from Russian officials denying plans for mobilization:
   - Kremlin spokesman Peskov in July 2024: "No one is talking about mobilization, there is no discussion."
   - Defense Minister Belyusov in May 2024: "There is no talk of mobilization, of extraordinary measures."
   - State Duma Defense Committee head Kartapolov: Mobilization is a "passed stage."

2. Russia claims to be meeting recruitment needs through volunteers:
   - Over 190,000 contract soldiers joined in 2024 alone.
   - Reported 1,000 people signing contracts daily.

3. Public resistance to previous mobilization suggests political risk.

4. ISW report from September 2024 indicates Russian society isn't experiencing war fatigue, giving Kremlin flexibility.

Evidence for a higher probability:

1. Ongoing personnel shortages reported:
   - Bloomberg report in August 2024 citing sources close to Kremlin/Defense Ministry.
   - Ukrainian intelligence chief Budanov claims Russia facing personnel shortage.

2. Preparations for potential mobilization:
   - System being developed to prevent potential draftees from leaving Russia, operational by fall 2024.
   - Some experts/analysts predicting mobilization by late 2024/2025.

3. Escalating conflict in Kursk region could increase need for troops.

4. Historical precedent of Russian government denying mobilization plans before implementing them in 2022.

Balancing these factors:

1. Official denials carry less weight given past deception, but the consistent messaging across multiple officials is notable.

2. The reported success in volunteer recruitment, if accurate, reduces the immediate need for mobilization.

3. The development of systems to prevent draft evasion suggests preparation, but could also be precautionary.

4. The timeline until October 2024 is relatively short for a major policy shift, given the political risks involved.

5. ISW's recent reporting suggests Russia has flexibility, reducing the urgency for mobilization.

Given these factors, I assess a relatively low probability of mobilization by October 2024, but not negligible given past unpredictability and ongoing personnel needs.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider the key evidence and arguments for both higher and lower probabilities:

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. Russia has faced significant losses and manpower shortages in Ukraine. The ISW has reported ongoing recruitment challenges and the need for more troops.

2. There are recurring rumors and discussions about potential new mobilization waves in Russia, suggesting it remains a possibility.

3. Some experts and analysts predict Russia may need to conduct another mobilization by late 2024 or 2025 to sustain its war effort.

4. Russia is implementing systems to restrict travel for potential conscripts, which could be preparation for future mobilization.

5. Previous denials of mobilization plans by Russian officials proved false in 2022, so current denials are not fully reliable.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. Russian officials, including Putin and Kremlin spokesman Peskov, have repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization waves.

2. Russia has been relying on volunteer recruitment and contract soldiers to avoid unpopular mobilization.

3. The previous mobilization in 2022 caused significant public discontent and an exodus of Russians, which the government likely wants to avoid repeating.

4. Recent ISW reports indicate Russia's "crypto-mobilization" efforts have been somewhat successful in generating new recruits without formal mobilization.

5. The question specifies ISW must report a formal mobilization by October 1, 2024, which is a relatively short timeframe.

6. Recent ISW reports suggest Russia is normalizing the war in society and mitigating war fatigue, potentially reducing the immediate need for mobilization.

Balancing these factors, I assess that a new formal mobilization wave reported by ISW before October 1, 2024 is unlikely, but not impossible. The Russian government seems intent on avoiding another unpopular mobilization if possible, and has some alternative recruitment methods. However, battlefield needs could force their hand if losses continue to mount.

The short timeframe (about 13 months) also limits the likelihood, as Russia may be able to sustain its current approach for that period before potentially needing mobilization in late 2024 or 2025.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

4. Recent ISW reports indicate Russia's "crypto-mobilization" efforts have been somewhat successful in generating new recruits without formal mobilization.

5. The question specifies ISW must report a formal mobilization by October 1, 2024, which is a relatively short timeframe.

6. Recent ISW reports suggest Russia is normalizing the war in society and mitigating war fatigue, potentially reducing the immediate need for mobilization.

Balancing these factors, I assess that a new formal mobilization wave reported by ISW before October 1, 2024 is unlikely, but not impossible. The Russian government seems intent on avoiding another unpopular mobilization if possible, and has some alternative recruitment methods. However, battlefield needs could force their hand if losses continue to mount.

The short timeframe (about 13 months) also limits the likelihood, as Russia may be able to sustain its current approach for that period before potentially needing mobilization in late 2024 or 2025.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 30.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll consider the key evidence and arguments for both higher and lower probabilities:

Arguments for a higher probability:

1. Russia has faced significant losses and manpower shortages in Ukraine. The ISW has reported ongoing recruitment challenges and the need for more troops.

2. There are recurring rumors and discussions about potential new mobilization waves in Russia, suggesting it remains a possibility.

3. Some experts and analysts predict Russia may need to conduct another mobilization by late 2024 or 2025 to sustain its war effort.

4. Russia is implementing systems to restrict travel for potential conscripts, which could be preparation for future mobilization.

5. Previous denials of mobilization plans by Russian officials proved false in 2022, so current denials are not fully reliable.

Arguments for a lower probability:

1. Russian officials, including Putin and Kremlin spokesman Peskov, have repeatedly denied plans for new mobilization waves.

2. Russia has been relying on volunteer recruitment and contract soldiers to avoid unpopular mobilization.
