*NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit across from each other, surrounded by stacks of newspapers and laptops. The room buzzes with post-event analysis.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, it's October 3rd, 2024. Did the DEA finally reschedule cannabis?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 42.75%. The NPRM was a promising step, but the timeline was tight. The 62-day comment period ended in July, and the bureaucratic wheels turn slowly.

**NATE SILVER**  
Exactly. Even with Attorney General Garland's push, the complexities of federal and state regulations were a hurdle. Our models accounted for that.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. The NPRM was significant, but without congressional action, it was unlikely to meet the deadline. 

**NATE SILVER**  
Here's to accurate forecasting. Let's see what happens next year.

*They nod, acknowledging the power of data-driven predictions.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered, screens flashing headlines.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did cannabis get removed from Schedule I?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.75%. The DEA's NPRM was a significant step, but the timeline was just too tight.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. The 62-day comment period ended in July, but federal bureaucracy moves at its own pace. Plus, Congress hasn't clarified federal-state powers.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Even with public support, the legal complexities are staggering. Our models accounted for this inertia.

**NATE SILVER:** So, no surprise here. But the groundwork is laid for future changes.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, perhaps by next year, the probability will shift. For now, cannabis remains in Schedule I.

*They nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their models.*

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a news desk, papers scattered around them. A large screen behind them displays the headline: "Cannabis Rescheduling: A New Era?"*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, October 3rd. Did cannabis get rescheduled before September 30th, 2024? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.75%. The DEA's proposal was promising, but the timeline was too tight. 

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The comment period ended in July, and while the NPRM suggested a shift to Schedule 3, it needed more than just bureaucratic momentum. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Congress still needs to address federal and state regulatory powers. The complexity of the issue made a swift change unlikely.

**NATE SILVER:** So, the models were spot on, as always. We'll keep an eye on any legislative developments.

NATE SILVER  
Well, Philip, the question on everyone's mind: Will cannabis be removed from Schedule I?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
No, our models had it at 42.35%. The DEA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was a significant step, but our data showed a long road ahead.

NATE SILVER  
Exactly. The comment period ended, but without Congress stepping in, the reclassification wasn't guaranteed.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
And even if it had happened, the complexities of federal and state regulations would still need addressing.

NATE SILVER  
True. The NPRM was promising, but the procedural hurdles were too high for such a swift change.

**NATE SILVER:** So, did cannabis get removed from Schedule I?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 42.75%. The DEA's proposed rulemaking in May stirred hopes, but the timeline was tight.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, the comment period ended late July, and Congress didn't act fast enough. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Even with the push from Attorney General Garland, the complexities of federal and state regulations made it unlikely without further legislation.

**NATE SILVER:** Our models considered those hurdles. The move to Schedule 3 would've been historic, but the political climate was too uncertain.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, though the push for change is evident, the probability just wasn't there this time.
