**When is the next presidential debate? With Joe Biden out, will there a Donald Trump-Kamala Harris debate? What we know.**
President Joe Biden has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris is now the presumptive Democrat nominee, but a debate between Donald Trump and Harris is uncertain. Trump has expressed reluctance to debate Harris or any other candidate before the Democratic National Convention in August. The next presidential debate was scheduled for September 10 on ABC, but Trump may not participate. Harris will need to be nominated as the official candidate during the Democratic National Convention, where party delegates will vote on who will represent the party.

After President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, the future of the debates is uncertain. The two campaigns had previously agreed to two presidential debates and one vice presidential debate. Trump's campaign has suggested that the next debate should be hosted by Fox News, while Trump himself has expressed willingness to debate the Democratic nominee. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for August 19-22, where a new presidential candidate and running mate will be chosen.

**Trump Campaign Declines Debate Date Commitment Till DNC**
Donald Trump's campaign has declined to commit to vice-presidential debate dates until after the Democratic National Convention, citing uncertainty over the Democratic nominee for vice president. Trump's Senior Advisor Brian Hughes stated that it would be unfair to potential candidates like Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, or Gretchen Whitmer before the convention concludes. Biden-Harris 2024 Communications Director Brian Fallon criticized the move, pointing out Trump's earlier willingness to debate 'anytime, anyplace' and suggesting that Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance's withdrawal is tied to a leak exposing his support for a nationwide abortion ban.

**Democrats to Virtually Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party plans to virtually nominate President Joe Biden as their candidate for the November elections before the end of July, according to sources close to the organization. This decision would put an end to the internal debate that has been ongoing for weeks, in which some voices had called for Biden to end his re-election campaign after his poor performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. The nomination will be made through a virtual 'roll call' process, where over 4,000 party delegates will cast their votes starting next Monday, with the results expected to be announced shortly after. Biden's nomination will be officially accepted during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, scheduled for August 19-22.

**Democratic Committee Considers Nominating Biden for 2024 Presidential Election**
The Democratic National Committee is considering officially nominating President Joe Biden for the 2024 presidential election by mid-July, following a major controversy after his debate with potential Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. According to Bloomberg, the decision aims to put an end to the widespread discussions within the party about replacing Biden after his performance in the first presidential debate. Sources close to the matter said that the likely date for Biden's official nomination is July 21. The Democrats had already planned to nominate Biden (81 years old) before the party's August convention to ensure his name appears on the ballot in Ohio, which has set a final deadline of August 7 for selecting presidential candidates. Many major American media outlets have begun openly pressuring President Biden to withdraw from the election and leave the way open for a new Democratic nominee who can challenge Trump, who seems to have scored many points in the first presidential debate. The report stated that the Democratic National Committee has denied that the official nomination of Biden is due to the recent debate with Trump, citing that the motivation is Ohio's decision. The debate has sparked concern among Biden's allies, leading some lawmakers and donors to consider whether Biden should remain the Democratic nominee due to concerns about his age. The debate has caused a real panic among Democrats, four months before the election and about six weeks before the expected convention where the President will nominate a formal candidate. However, prominent Democratic members have ruled out replacing Biden and called on party members to focus instead on the consequences of Trump's potential second term. Despite this, calls for Biden to step down continue. According to Axios, the Biden administration has a strategy to counter the recent calls for him to withdraw from the presidential election, and to mobilize Democrats to overcome the controversy surrounding his age and future.

**Democrats May Nominate Joe Biden as Presidential Candidate**
The Democratic Party may nominate incumbent US President Joe Biden as a candidate for the 2024 presidential election, according to Bloomberg. This move aims to put an end to rumors about potential presidential replacement after Biden's poor debate performance with Republican Donald Trump. The nomination could also ensure Biden's presence on the Ohio ballot, where the registration deadline is August 7. The nomination is expected to take place on July 21 during the party's committee meeting, which will finalize the procedures before the main convention in Chicago on August 19. Meanwhile, the Republican Party is expected to officially announce Trump as their candidate at their convention in Milwaukee on July 15-18. The article notes that Biden's first debate with Trump was disastrous, with the President struggling to articulate his points and making mistakes. The Democrats are reportedly considering replacing Biden with another candidate, with some saying 'it's time for him to go.' The article concludes that the first presidential debate in the US can be characterized as a 'disaster.'

**US-Wahl: TV-Duell zwischen Biden und Trump begins**
The highly anticipated first TV debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the ongoing US presidential election has begun. The Democratic President and his Republican predecessor are facing off on the TV stage in Atlanta, Georgia. This is the first direct confrontation between the two presidential candidates since October 2020, when Trump was the incumbent and Biden was the challenger. This time, the roles are reversed, with Biden seeking a second term as President and Trump running for the Republicans. The debate is expected to be a closely watched event, with polls indicating a neck-and-neck race between the two candidates. One of the recurring themes in the campaign is the high age of the candidates, with Biden being 81 years old and Trump 78 years old.

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will face off in the first 2024 presidential debate on Thursday night in Atlanta.

**Biden and Trump will meet for a debate this week. When are presidential debates typically held?**
The debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, hosted by CNN on June 27, will be the first of the 2024 election cycle and the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history. Typically, presidential debates are held in September or October, but this year's debate is scheduled earlier due to the candidates' quick wrapping up of their party's nominations and the decision to circumvent the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The campaigns agreed to hold earlier debates to allow candidates to face the American people before voters go to the polls. In past elections, the first debate would take place after some states started sending out mail-in ballots, but this year's debate will take place before that. By agreeing to the earlier schedule, Biden and Trump seem to want to ensure that every voter is well-informed before submitting a ballot.

The debate schedule has been moved up to June 27 and September 10, with President Biden calling for the debates. Trump's popularity has increased with each indictment, and he is now leading in the polls. The campaign is full of uncertainty, with the possibility of a knockout blow or a turn-around for Biden.
