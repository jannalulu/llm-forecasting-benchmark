**Title: The Day After Discovery**

**INT. A DIMLY LIT ROOM - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, eyes fixed on their screens. The room buzzes with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (leaning back) So, it's official. Planet Nine was discovered yesterday.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Incredible. Our models had it at 85.67%. And right on time.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (smiling) Batygin and Brown must be thrilled. Their hypothesis finally validated.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: (nodding) The data from TESS really turned the tide. Direct optical observation, just as predicted.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Think about the implications. A new era of astronomy awaits.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (glancing at the clock) And to think, we almost missed it. The Galactic Plane confusion was a real hurdle.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (leaning forward) But we didn't. Our models were precise. As always.

The room falls silent, each forecaster lost in thought, contemplating the vastness of the universe and their role in unveiling its secrets.

**INT. A MODERN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, papers scattered, screens flickering with data.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
(leaning forward)  
So, the news is in. Our models had it at 5.25%. Planet Nine remains elusive.

SECOND SUPERFORECASTER  
(nods)  
Even with TESS's data, the Galactic Plane's interference was too much. The Milky Way's stars still cloak it.

THIRD SUPERFORECASTER  
(gestures to screen)  
Batygin and Brown's optimism was infectious, but our models were clear. The gravitational hints weren't enough.

LEAD SUPERFORECASTER  
(sighs)  
The search continues. But we were right. Our models never lie.

The room is silent, a mix of pride and determination. The quest for Planet Nine persists, but the superforecasters' accuracy remains unchallenged.

The room buzzes with the hum of computers. SUPERFORECASTER JANE stands before a digital display, reflecting on the recent discovery.

**JANE**  
"Yesterday, the world changed. Our models had it at 12.45%. Planet Nine, with its vast orbit and size, was finally spotted."

SUPERFORECASTER MARK, seated nearby, nods, scrolling through past data.

**MARK**  
"Credible sources confirmed it. The optical observation was tricky, but they did it. Right where Batygin and Brown suggested."

**JANE**  
"The gravitational effects on distant Pluto-like worlds hinted at its existence. But until now, it was just a hypothesis."

MARK leans back, thoughtful.

**MARK**  
"Our models never lie. We were close, but even a 12.45% chance felt distant."

**JANE**  
"Yet here we are. A new chapter for astronomy."

The room falls silent, the weight of discovery settling in. The universe feels just a bit larger today.

Three SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, their faces illuminated by the glow of laptops. They sip coffee, eyes scanning the latest news.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
"Our models had it at 5.25%. The data just wasn't there for a higher probability."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nods)  
"True. The Galactic Plane's confusion made direct observation nearly impossible. Despite the TESS data, we knew the odds were slim."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sighs, closing laptop)  
"It seems Planet Nine remains elusive. No direct optical observation before the deadline."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(grinning)  
"Well, at least our models were spot on. Low probability, and it didn't happen."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(raising coffee mug)  
"To accuracy, then. Until the next celestial mystery."

They clink mugs, a mix of satisfaction and curiosity lingering in the air.

Well, folks, here we are. Planet Nine remains elusive. Our models had it at 5.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

The data up to July 29 didn't give us much hope. The Galactic Plane's interference was a major hurdle.

Right. Even with TESS, the odds were slim. Batygin and Brown's optimism aside, the gravitational evidence just wasn't enough.

Still, the search continues. Maybe next year, or the year after. But for now, no new planets.
