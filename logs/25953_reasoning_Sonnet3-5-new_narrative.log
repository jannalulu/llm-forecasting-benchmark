Here's a script set on July 31, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit café in Paris. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing over coffee.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, it finally happened. After that chaotic runoff election, our models proved spot-on about the Prime Minister situation."

Philip: "Indeed. Even with the strategic pact between Together and the New Popular Front, the unprecedented voter turnout changed everything. Our models had it at 23.45% that Together would retain the Prime Minister position."

Nate: "The signs were there. That massive 20-point surge in voter turnout from 2022 was telling. And when Marine Le Pen's National Rally made it to almost every runoff..."

Philip: "Exactly. Even Macron's dissolution of the National Assembly couldn't save his coalition. The far-right surge was simply too strong this time."

Nate: "History in the making, and our models caught it perfectly."

[They clink their coffee cups solemnly]

Nate: "Well, Philip, yesterday's confirmation was exactly as our models predicted."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the data we had up to July 10th, our models had it at 32.15%. The surge in far-right support and the unprecedented three-way runoffs made it unlikely that Together would maintain the premiership."

Nate: "The strategic pact between the center and left wasn't enough. Even with the higher turnout and withdrawal agreements, the political fragmentation was too severe."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how accurately we captured the impact of those district-level dynamics. The dissolution of the National Assembly was a gamble that didn't pay off for Macron."

Nate: "And now France enters a new era of cohabitation. Our models caught that shifting political landscape perfectly, even with limited data."

[They both sip their coffee thoughtfully]

Nate: "Well, Philip, what a turn of events in French politics. Our models were remarkably precise about this one."

Philip: "Indeed. Given the data we had up to July 10th, our models had it at 32.15%. The surge in far-right support and the unprecedented three-way runoffs made it difficult for Together to maintain control."

Nate: "The strategic pact between the center and left wasn't enough. The high voter turnout really changed the dynamics compared to 2022."

Philip: "What's fascinating is how our models captured the impact of those district-level withdrawals. Even with Macron's constitutional powers intact, the parliamentary arithmetic made it impossible for Together to keep the Prime Minister position."

Nate: "Exactly. The combination of record turnout and the far-right's momentum created exactly the scenario our models predicted."
