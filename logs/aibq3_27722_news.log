**Cisco to Lay Off 6,000 Employees, Focus on Cybersecurity and AI**
Cisco, a leading networking company, is planning to lay off a large number of employees, reportedly around 6,000. This decision comes despite the company's recent better-than-expected quarterly results. According to a report in Money Control, the company is planning to reduce its workforce by 7%, which would be its second major layoff this year. In February 2024, the company had laid off 4,000 employees, which was 5% of its workforce. Cisco aims to reduce costs and focus on cybersecurity and AI by cutting expenses. The company expects to save around $1 billion in costs, which would be used to invest in AI and cybersecurity. Cisco has already invested $1 billion in AI startups Cohere, Mistral, and Scale in June 2024. The company is also partnering with Nvidia to work on AI projects. This move comes as several other tech giants, including Intel, Dell, Microsoft, and Amazon, have also announced layoffs in recent months.

**Intel cuts 15,000 jobs as it struggles to keep pace with NVIDIA**
Intel is cutting more than 15,000 jobs and pausing 'non-essential' projects, particularly in marketing and R&D, in an effort to revive profits and catch up with rivals such as Nvidia and AMD. The move comes after the company reported a $1.6bn loss in the April-June period. Shares in Intel fell by 20% following the announcement. Chief executive Pat Gelsinger said, 'The situation requires bolder actions and we have to fundamentally change the way we operate.' Intel previously conducted a significant round of layoffs in October 2022, but this is a new round of job cuts, with the majority expected to be completed by the end of 2024. The company's sales fell 1% year-on-year in the three months to June and it warned that the second half of the year would be worse than expected.

**Intel Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs and Regain Prominence in Semiconductor Industry**
Intel plans to cut thousands of jobs to reduce costs and finance an ambitious recovery effort after a decline in profits and market share. The company, which has around 110,000 employees, may announce the layoffs this week, according to sources familiar with the plans. CEO Pat Gelsinger is investing heavily in research and development to improve Intel's technology and help the company regain its prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company's stock rose 1.8% to $12:13 in New York on Wednesday. Other chip manufacturers, led by Nvidia, have rapidly developed profitable semiconductors for demanding tasks related to artificial intelligence. Intel is also dealing with irregular demand for chips that operate laptops and desktop computers, its main business. Gelsinger believes that Intel can improve its technology and has embarked on a plan to build factories for other chip manufacturers. The company reduced its workforce by around 5% in 2023 to 124,800 employees by the end of the year, after announcing job cuts that began in October 2022. Analysts project that Intel will report stable revenue for the second quarter compared to the previous year, with modest growth in the second half of 2024 and total sales increasing 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates.

**Major Intel workforce reorg coming**
Intel Corp. is planning to lay off thousands of employees to cut costs and finance new programs, according to a report from Bloomberg. The workforce reorganization could come as early as this week, affecting around 7,000 employees across its four Santa Clara locations. This move comes as the company prepares to present its second quarter earnings report on August 1, amidst a tough few years for Intel, with competitors like Nvidia Corp. leading the semiconductor and microchip industry. Despite efforts by CEO Pat Gelsinger to turn the company around through cost-cutting and manufacturing new advanced chip technologies, Intel has experienced significant losses, including $7 billion in operating losses for its new Intel Foundry in 2023. The company's revenue for 2023 was $18.9 billion, down 31% from $27.49 billion in 2022. As part of a cost-reduction plan announced in October 2022, Intel aimed to cut costs by $3 billion in 2023 by reducing its headcount to 124,800 by the end of 2023.

**Intel Plans To Reportedly Layoff At Least 10,000 Employees To Rebound From Share Losses**
Intel, with approximately 1,10,000 employees globally, is reportedly planning to lay off at least 10,000 employees as a cost-cutting measure to recover from losses, according to a Bloomberg report. The layoffs, which could begin as early as this week, are expected to save Intel up to $10 billion by 2025. This move comes as rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp. grows in the AI market, with big companies like Elon Musk's EV and AI companies collaborating with Nvidia for their AI computational needs. Intel's new AI chip, Gaudi 3, unveiled in April 2024, boasts 1.5x more speed than Nvidia's H100, used by Elon Musk's xAI in the development of Grok AI. However, Intel is ' sluggishly pivoting' in the AI market, according to the report. 'Intel expects to save up to $10 billion by 2025 with the job cuts,' said the report, citing the company's plans to recover from its losses.

**Wall Street Closes Lower as Investors Await Nvidia Results**
Investors were on edge on Wednesday, awaiting the results of Nvidia, the world's leading provider of AI chips, which has been a driving force behind the rally in the chip and tech sector this year. Ahead of the announcement, after the close of the New York stock exchange, many investors sold tech stocks. As a result, Nvidia closed the trading day lower by 2.1%. The overall mood on Wall Street was negative due to the sell-off, although it recovered slightly towards the end of the trading day. The Dow Jones index closed the trading day 0.4% lower at 41,091.42 points, after reaching a new record high on Tuesday. The broad S&P 500 index fell 0.6% to 55,920.18 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped 1.1% to 17,556.03 points. All stocks in the so-called 'Magnificent 7', a group of large tech companies that includes Nvidia, recorded losses. Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, fell 0.8%, 1.3%, and 0.5% respectively. Apple, also part of this group, fell 0.8%. According to Bloomberg, the iPhone maker is cutting around 100 jobs in its digital services division. Layoffs at the tech company are relatively rare. Most jobs are being cut at the e-book app and Apple's e-book store, but also at the news app. Foot Locker plummeted over 10%. The American sports shoe chain, which has dozens of stores in the Netherlands, saw sales at stores open for more than a year increase for the first time in six quarters. Super Micro Computer also took a big hit. The server provider for AI applications announced that it would not meet its quarterly earnings deadline. A day earlier, short seller Hindenburg Research released a critical report highlighting 'red flags' in the company's accounting. The stock fell 19.1%. Berkshire Hathaway rose 0.8%, making it the first non-tech company in the US to break the $1 trillion market value threshold. The investment company of billionaire Warren Buffett has seen its market value grow by around 20% annually since 1965.

**Asian Markets Mixed As Traders Await US Data, Nvidia Release**
Equity investors are cautious ahead of key US data and Nvidia's earnings release, which could impact demand for artificial intelligence. Despite a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut, traders are awaiting next week's non-farm payrolls figures. Traders remain upbeat, but attention turns to US indicators, including GDP growth, inflation, and jobless claims. Nvidia's earnings report is the headliner, with analysts warning that a disappointing result could spark a sell-off in the sector. As Ray Attrill of National Australia Bank said, 'The rebound in stock markets after the July crunch, lower gasoline prices and the heightened prospect of near-term interest rate cuts look to have overwhelmed the impact on confidence of softening labour market indicators.' Analyst Stephen Innes noted, 'This is the one that could either lift all boats or sink the entire fleet.' Asian markets were mixed, with Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore dropping, while Tokyo, Wellington, and Taipei gained. Oil prices edged higher after big swings due to the Middle East crisis and Libya's decision to close fields and suspend production and exports. 'Nvidia's influence is undeniable, making it nearly impossible to take your eyes off it,' Innes added.

**Intel Announces Mass Layoffs, Cuts Costs Amid Financial Challenges**
The Intel Corporation, a global leader in semiconductor and microprocessor manufacturing, announced the dismissal of approximately 15% of its workforce, equivalent to around 15,000 employees, in August this year. This move is part of a broader restructuring effort by the company, which has already resulted in a R$ 60 billion cut in costs this year in response to financial challenges. According to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company is facing challenges due to slower-than-expected revenue growth and reduced profit margins. He emphasized the need to adjust the company's cost structure to its new operational model, particularly in the face of intense competition from companies like Nvidia and AMD. 'These are difficult news to share. I know it will be even harder for you to read. This has been an incredibly difficult day for Intel as we make some of the most significant changes in the company's history,' Gelsinger warned. To minimize the impact on its teams, Intel will offer an improved retirement program to eligible employees and open a voluntary layoff process. Gelsinger mentioned that these decisions were extremely difficult but necessary to ensure the company's survival. The dismissals follow a series of disappointing financial results, including a $1.6 billion loss in the second quarter of 2024 and a revenue forecast for the third quarter below expectations. Additionally, Intel will suspend dividend payments as part of its cost-cutting plan, leading to a significant drop in the company's stock price, which fell by around 39.5% after the announcement. There is currently no information on the real impact of the decision in Brazil.

**Tech Company Layoffs: The COVID Tech Bubble Bursts**
The COVID tech bubble has burst, with tech companies initiating significant layoffs. The layoffs are a result of companies hiring too many employees during the pandemic and anticipating a recession. However, IT pros with cybersecurity, cloud, and data analytics/machine learning skills remain in high demand. Some of the notable layoffs include: PacketFabric, which laid off an undisclosed number of employees, Sonos, which laid off 100 people (6% of its workforce), Tally, which shut down its operations and laid off its entire workforce, and Cisco, which is laying off 5,900 people (7% of its workforce). According to Cisco, the restructuring will help offset the earnings impact from interest expenses associated with financing the Splunk acquisition and will rationalize combined workforces. CEO Patrick Spence of Sonos said, 'This action was a difficult, but necessary, measure to ensure continued, meaningful investment in Sonos' product roadmap while setting Sonos up for long term success.' Tally CEO Jason Brown said, 'After nearly nine years of helping people manage and pay off their credit card debt, we have made the difficult and sad decision to shut down Tally. This was not the outcome we had hoped for, but after exploring all options, we were unable to secure the necessary funding to continue our operations.'

**Ranked: The Biggest Layoffs in Tech So Far in 2024**
Tech companies have been cutting jobs in the thousands this year, with Dell and Intel leading the pack. Dell is expected to cut 20,000 jobs this year, after an initial 6,000 in March, as part of an AI pivot. Intel has already cut 15,000 jobs and is struggling with operating losses and lost clients. Tesla has also cut 14,500 jobs due to slowing demand and stiff competition in China. Meanwhile, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has committed to no job cuts, which may be a key reason why he is highly rated by employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, the top 10 tech companies with the most layoffs in 2024 are: Dell (26,000), Intel (15,000), Tesla (14,500), Cisco (10,150), SAP (8,000), Toshiba (4,000), Paytm (3,500), Getir (3,300), PayPal (2,585), and UKG (2,200).

**Intel's AI Revival: Gaudí 3 Chip Aims to Challenge Nvidia's Dominance**
Intel has recently announced plans to reduce its workforce by 15%, resulting in around 15,000 layoffs, and has also reported that the second quarter of 2024 was 'more difficult' than expected. Despite this, Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, remains optimistic about the company's future, citing both chip manufacturing and AI as key areas for growth. 'I started Intel's strategy over two years ago, and AI has been an unexpected boom for the company', Gelsinger said to Wired recently. 'It's been Nvidia's territory, but we're the only company that truly has the opportunity to participate in 100% of the market. We know how to connect networks and memory, supply chains, and all the other elements that customers want to leverage'. Intel has recently released its new Gaudí 3 chip, designed to power large language models, and has claimed that it has more than double the energy efficiency and can execute AI models 1.5 times faster than Nvidia's H100 GPU. The company aims to reduce Nvidia's market share in the specialized AI hardware market, which is currently around 80%. Gaudí 3 is expected to be available to customers in the third quarter, although Intel has not disclosed its price range. Additionally, Intel plans to manufacture other AI chips in its new Ohio factory, which is expected to be operational in 2027. The company has also announced that it has over 20 clients for both the second and third generations of Gaudí, and that its next-generation chip, Falcon Shores, will be released in late 2025.

**Cisco to Cut Thousands of Jobs as It Shifts Focus to Cybersecurity and AI**
Cisco Systems Inc. plans to cut thousands of jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, according to Reuters, as the network equipment maker focuses on high-growth businesses like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. This follows the company's decision to cut approximately 4,000 jobs in February after a slowdown in corporate technology spending eliminated its sales growth. Cisco had around 85,000 employees at the end of its fiscal year 2023, which ended in July of that year. The company is joining other tech giants in reducing jobs as they deal with uneven demand. While spending on artificial intelligence has helped drive growth in some areas, traditional tech giants have not benefited as much. Intel Corp. announced plans last week to cut 15,000 jobs as it deals with slow sales. Dell Technologies Inc. is also reducing positions as part of a reorganization of its sales teams. Cisco's shares fell 1.3% to $45.24 in New York. They had fallen 9.3% this year before the session on Friday. The latest job cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday when the company reports its fourth-quarter results, according to Reuters. Three months ago, a Cisco forecast generated hope that technology clients had increased spending again. However, the tech industry as a whole has been affected by more recent concerns about the economy, and the idea that spending on artificial intelligence may not have a short-term benefit. A Cisco spokesperson declined to comment on the layoff plans. In the long term, CEO Chuck Robbins has been trying to transform Cisco into a provider of network services and software, rather than a company focused on single-unit hardware sales. He also wants to capitalize more on the growth of artificial intelligence, which has driven sales for companies like Nvidia Corp.

**Intel's Descent: A Crisis of Leadership and Adaptation**
Intel is facing its worst crisis in decades after announcing the layoff of 15% of its workforce (over 15,000 employees) as part of a $10 billion cost-cutting plan. The drastic cut reflects the company's structural problems and its inability to adapt to new technological trends, particularly in Artificial Intelligence. The company's latest quarterly results show a loss of $1.6 billion, a 1% decline in revenue compared to the previous year, and the suspension of dividend payments to shareholders. The stock price has dropped 30% in recent weeks and is now at $24, a level not seen since 2011. The causes of the decline include the loss of technological leadership, a failed bet on internal manufacturing, slow adaptation to the rise of AI, and a decline in the PC market. The company's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has warned that the company is 'too complex' and 'inefficient.' In contrast, NVIDIA has seen its stock price surge by over 200% this year, and its revenue and profits have exploded. The company is now betting on becoming a contract manufacturer and heavily investing in AI, but this path is uncertain and may be too late to reverse the company's decline.

**Intel's Stock Plummets by 28% Amid Layoffs and Losses**
Intel's stock plummeted by over 28% on Friday, August 2, 2024, after the company revealed losses in its quarterly earnings and announced the layoff of 15% of its workforce. This has had a ripple effect on the global semiconductor market and the Nasdaq, which lost its highs with a decline of over 3%. Intel reported a loss of $2.091 billion in its first quarter and $1.610 billion in the second quarter, compared to a profit of $1.481 billion in the same period last year. The company plans to implement 'a comprehensive cost reduction, including a reduction of more than 15% of its workforce - around 15,000 employees - to reorient the company' and has presented a plan to reduce costs by over $10 billion next year. Nvidia, another tech giant, was also affected, opening with a decline of over 6% on Friday. Amazon also disappointed investors with its quarterly earnings, falling by nearly 10% after failing to meet expectations on its second-quarter revenue and issuing a disappointing forecast.

**Intel laying off 15,000 employees as Nvidia cuts into market share**
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has announced plans to lay off 15,000 employees, equivalent to 15% of its workforce, in an effort to save $10 billion USD. This decision comes as strong tech competitors AMD and Nvidia continue to gain market share. Gelsinger stated that the company has incurred significant costs, with earnings falling by $24 billion since 2020, and the workforce increasing by 10%. He emphasized the need for 'bolder actions' to stimulate growth, simplify processes, and eliminate bureaucracy. Gelsinger said, 'There's too much complexity, so we need to both automate and simplify processes. It takes too long for decisions to be made, so we need to eliminate bureaucracy. And there's too much inefficiency in the system, so we need to expedite workflows.' The layoffs follow a trend of tech companies struggling to adapt to changing market realities, with Intel seeking to broaden its horizons and compete with Nvidia, which was named one of the world's most profitable companies in 2024.

**Intel Lays Off 17,000 Employees Amid Financial Difficulties**
Intel has announced the layoff of 17,000 employees, approximately 15% of its workforce, in a bid to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The move has led to a significant decline in the company's stock price, with a 27% drop on Wall Street and a loss of over $24 billion in market value. The layoffs are part of a cost-cutting plan that will come into effect in 2025, aiming to save around $10 billion and improve the company's competitiveness. The decision to suspend dividend payments starting from the fourth quarter is another indication of the company's financial difficulties. The majority of the layoffs are expected to be completed by the end of the year, with the goal of reducing costs and restructuring the company in response to its critical financial situation. The company's financial results for the second quarter revealed significant losses and a lower-than-expected revenue. Intel expects its revenue for the third quarter to be between $12.5 and $13.5 billion, below analyst estimates. The main cause of these difficulties is a decline in spending on semiconductors and Intel's delay in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, a rapidly growing market dominated by competitors like Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger stated that debt reduction and workforce restructuring are essential to improve the company's position, and that the restructuring involves a change in personnel structure, with a greater focus on field operations rather than central headquarters. Currently, Intel employs around 116,500 people and expects a 17% annual reduction in capital expenditures by 2025. The situation at Intel contrasts with the positive results of other major technology companies, such as Apple, Ferrari, and Amazon, which have reported significant increases in revenue and profits.

**Intel to Lay Off 15,000 Employees Amid Financial Struggles**
Intel announced that it will lay off 15,000 employees worldwide by the end of the year, citing the need to balance costs to stabilize the company's financial health. The decision was made by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who stated that the company needs to take 'more drastic actions' to address its financial issues, including a decline in revenue and a high cost structure. The layoffs will result in a cost savings of $10 billion in 2025. The company's financial struggles are attributed to high investments in research and development, as well as the construction of new factories in the US and Europe to meet high demand. The company is also facing challenges in the artificial intelligence market, where NVIDIA is dominating the market. Gelsinger stated that the company needs to 'automate and simplify processes' to overcome the complexity involved in the layoffs. The company will also implement a voluntary layoff program, which will be announced next week. The layoffs will have a significant impact on the company's workforce, but the company is committed to treating the affected employees with dignity and respect.

**Intel to Lay Off 17,500 Employees and Cut Research Expenses Amid Financial Crisis**
Intel announced that it will lay off approximately 17,500 employees (15% of its workforce) and suspend dividend payments starting from the 4th quarter of 2024. According to CEO Pat Gelsinger, most of the layoffs will be completed by the end of 2024. The company's stock price dropped by 20% and Intel lost over $24 billion in market value. Intel's revenue decreased by 14% in 2023 to $54.2 billion, and its net income plummeted by almost five times to $1.7 billion. Gelsinger stated that Intel's microchip production business may incur the largest operational losses in 2024. To address financial issues, Intel will cut billions of dollars in research, development, and marketing expenses by 2026. The company aims to recover from the crisis by 2027. Intel's main challenge is its lag behind competitors AMD and NVIDIA in developing and applying generative artificial intelligence, making this area a top priority for Intel's development.

**Intel stock plunges on layoffs and earnings report, sinking AI chip stocks Nvidia, TSMC, ARM too**
Intel's Q2 2024 earnings report was disappointing, with a 1% year-over-year decrease in total net revenue to $12.8 billion and an adjusted earnings per share of just 2 cents, compared to the expected 10 cents. The company also announced a massive round of layoffs, cutting 'roughly' 15,000 roles, or about 15% of its global workforce, to help implement its'multiyear transformation strategy' and reduce operating costs. Intel's share price dropped over 20% in premarket trading, and other major chip stocks, including NVIDIA, TSMC, ARM, and ASML, also fell, with some down by as much as 6.7%. Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'Our Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones.' He added, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' The company expects the majority of the job cuts to be completed by the end of 2024 and will help contribute to a cost savings of $10 billion in 2025.

**Intel cuts 15,000 jobs as it struggles to keep pace with NVIDIA**
Intel is cutting more than 15,000 jobs and pausing 'non-essential' projects, particularly in marketing and R&D, in an effort to revive profits and catch up with rivals such as Nvidia and AMD. The move comes after the company reported a $1.6bn loss in the April-June period. Shares in Intel fell by 20% following the announcement. Chief executive Pat Gelsinger said, 'The situation requires bolder actions and we have to fundamentally change the way we operate.' Intel previously conducted a significant round of layoffs in October 2022, but this is a new round of job cuts, with the majority expected to be completed by the end of 2024. The company's sales fell 1% year-on-year in the three months to June and it warned that the second half of the year would be worse than expected.

**Intel Announces Mass Layoffs Amid Financial Difficulties and Lack of Innovation**
Intel has announced that it will lay off 15,000 employees, or 15% of its workforce, due to financial difficulties. The company's financial results are poor, and it has failed to keep up with the latest innovations in the field, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and ARM architecture. Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, stated that the company's revenues have not increased as expected and that it has not fully leveraged the trends of AI. The company will also suspend its dividend payments starting from the fourth quarter of 2024. This move is seen as a response to the growing competition from companies like NVIDIA, Samsung, and AMD, which have benefited from the boom in AI and other trends. As one of the leading manufacturers of microprocessors, Intel has been struggling to adapt to the changing market and has been criticized for its lack of innovation.

**Intel Confirms Major Round of Layoffs, Affecting Around 15,000 Jobs**
Intel has confirmed a major round of layoffs, affecting around 15,000 jobs, as part of a plan to save $10 billion in 2025. In a note to employees, CEO Pat Gelsinger said, 'We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate.' He added, 'Our revenues have not grown as expected, and we have not yet fully benefited from powerful trends like AI. Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both, particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is more challenging than previously expected.' Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees. He stated, 'These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I've done in my career.' He emphasized, 'My commitment to you is that we will prioritize a culture of honesty, transparency, and respect in the coming weeks and months.' This is the second round of layoffs at Intel since the COVID-19 pandemic, following a 5% reduction in staff in October 2022. The company is trying to recover in the market, but it is not alone in the tech industry, as other companies have also announced massive layoffs and hiring freezes in recent years.

**Intel Announces 15% Workforce Reduction Amid Crisis**
Intel announced a 15% reduction in its workforce and the elimination of 'secondary work' to escape the crisis and reduce costs to $10 billion by 2025. According to estimates, 15,000 to 19,000 employees will lose their jobs. The company's losses for the second quarter of 2024 were $1.6 billion, up from $437 million in the previous quarter. Analysts call Intel the 'worst technology stock in the S&P 500 index this year.' Intel is struggling to keep up with competitors AMD and NVIDIA in the field of generative AI, but the company will continue to develop in this area. The company is also increasing production capacity for flagship chips for laptops, where Apple and Qualcomm pose a serious threat with Arm. The problems with processors 13 and 14 generations are a serious blow to Intel's reputation. Owners of new models have been complaining about freezing and restarting their PCs in games since April, but Intel only recently acknowledged the problem. This will have long-term consequences, experts are convinced. The company's revenue for the second quarter was $12.8 billion, down only 1% from last year. Intel continues to steadily earn money from the sale of PC and server components. According to Layoffs.fyi, more than 120,000 employees have lost their jobs in the technology sector and startups in 2024. The warning signs of an economic downturn in IT first appeared at the end of 2021 and have continued since then. Media reported that Apple is the only major IT giant to avoid mass layoffs. The company was able to save all its jobs thanks to a more competent strategy of hiring new employees over the past few years.

**Intel to Lay Off 17,500 Employees in Shift Towards AI Chip Manufacturing**
Intel, one of the world's largest microchip manufacturers, will lay off over 17,500 employees, affecting around 15% of its workforce worldwide. This restructuring plan, set to be completed by the end of 2024, includes suspending quarterly dividends for shareholders and a $10 billion cost reduction. The move aims to conserve funds for a shift in focus towards artificial intelligence (AI) chip manufacturing, addressing a competitive disadvantage in the industry. According to CEO Patrick Gelsinger, 'This is an incredibly difficult day for Intel, as we are making some of the most transformative changes in our company's history.' The market for advanced microprocessors is crucial for the tech industry, but Intel's chips, which power computers, are being replaced by those used for AI, driving competition among chip manufacturers like TSMC, NVIDIA, AMD, and Arm. Intel has forecasted third-quarter earnings below market estimates, citing a decline in traditional semiconductor spending, which has led to a 20% drop in stock value and a 40% decline since the start of 2024.

**FTSE 100 LIVE: Market sell-off continues in European hours ahead of jobs report**
The FTSE 100 and European stocks declined on Friday, following a big week of central bank announcements and tech earnings. US stock futures also extended declines, looking to a lower open ahead of key jobs data. Economists predict a moderation in job growth for the July employment report, with the unemployment rate sticking at 4.1%. The Nikkei in Japan fell more than 5.8%, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped around 2.3%. Nvidia stock slipped more than 6% on Thursday, amid signs of a cooling economy. According to Paul Meeks, co-chief investment officer at Harvest Portfolio Management, 'These hyperscalers... their capital expenditures are high and potentially even rising into 2025. So this bodes incredibly well for Nvidia.' Microsoft's capital expenditures of almost $56 billion for the full year ending June 30, and its expectation to increase infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2025, may be a positive sign for Nvidia.

**Intel to Lay Off 16,000 Employees in Bid to Compete with NVIDIA and AMD**
Intel has announced plans to lay off around 16,000 employees, or 15% of its workforce, in an effort to compete with more successful rivals like NVIDIA and AMD. The company has seen a 40% drop in its stock price this year and is struggling to keep up with the rapid growth in demand for chips used in artificial intelligence applications. To address these issues, Intel plans to reduce jobs and implement cost-cutting measures. In a memo to employees, Intel CEO Bob Swan said the company aims to save $10 billion in 2025. He wrote, 'Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and change the way we work fundamentally.' Swan added, 'Our revenue has not grown as expected, and we have not fully benefited from strong trends like artificial intelligence. Our costs are extremely high, and our margins are very low.' The layoffs come after a disappointing quarter and low expectations for the company, which was founded in 1968 and was a pioneer in the personal computer revolution. Swan said Intel will announce an 'enhanced retirement offer' for eligible employees next week and will provide a program for voluntary departures. He said, 'This has been the toughest decision I've made in my career.' Most of the layoffs are expected to be completed this year. Intel has also suspended its dividend as part of a broader cost-cutting plan. The company reported a loss in the second quarter and lower-than-expected revenue, and forecasted lower-than-expected revenue for the third quarter.

**Intel's mass layoffs: A desperate move that might not be enough**
Intel is facing a crisis due to faltering revenues and profits. Despite efforts to compete in the AI chip market, Intel has struggled to keep up with Nvidia. To survive, Intel is transforming its business by developing a foundry division, where it will produce chips designed by other companies. This requires massive investment, but Intel is also considering layoffs to free up capital. Analysts predict a modest 3% increase in revenue for the second half of the year, but even this may not be enough to change the company's direction. Intel is expected to release its report for the second quarter of 2024, which may reveal the scale of the layoffs and the departments affected.

Intel plans to cut thousands of jobs to reduce costs and finance an ambitious recovery effort after a decline in profits and market share. The company, which has around 110,000 employees, may announce the layoffs this week, according to sources familiar with the plans. CEO Pat Gelsinger is investing heavily in research and development to improve Intel's technology and help the company regain its prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company's stock rose 1.8% to $12:13 in New York on Wednesday. Other chip manufacturers, led by Nvidia, have rapidly developed profitable semiconductors for demanding tasks related to artificial intelligence. Intel is also dealing with irregular demand for chips that operate laptops and desktop computers, its main business. Gelsinger believes that Intel can improve its technology and has embarked on a plan to build factories for other chip manufacturers. The company reduced its workforce by around 5% in 2023 to 124,800 employees by the end of the year, after announcing job cuts that began in October 2022. Analysts project that Intel will report stable revenue for the second quarter compared to the previous year, with modest growth in the second half of 2024 and total sales increasing 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates.

**Major Intel workforce reorg coming**
Intel Corp. is planning to lay off thousands of employees to cut costs and finance new programs, according to a report from Bloomberg. The workforce reorganization could come as early as this week, affecting around 7,000 employees across its four Santa Clara locations. This move comes as the company prepares to present its second quarter earnings report on August 1, amidst a tough few years for Intel, with competitors like Nvidia Corp. leading the semiconductor and microchip industry. Despite efforts by CEO Pat Gelsinger to turn the company around through cost-cutting and manufacturing new advanced chip technologies, Intel has experienced significant losses, including $7 billion in operating losses for its new Intel Foundry in 2023. The company's revenue for 2023 was $18.9 billion, down 31% from $27.49 billion in 2022. As part of a cost-reduction plan announced in October 2022, Intel aimed to cut costs by $3 billion in 2023 by reducing its headcount to 124,800 by the end of 2023.

**Intel Plans To Reportedly Layoff At Least 10,000 Employees To Rebound From Share Losses**
Intel, with approximately 1,10,000 employees globally, is reportedly planning to lay off at least 10,000 employees as a cost-cutting measure to recover from losses, according to a Bloomberg report. The layoffs, which could begin as early as this week, are expected to save Intel up to $10 billion by 2025. This move comes as rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp. grows in the AI market, with big companies like Elon Musk's EV and AI companies collaborating with Nvidia for their AI computational needs. Intel's new AI chip, Gaudi 3, unveiled in April 2024, boasts 1.5x more speed than Nvidia's H100, used by Elon Musk's xAI in the development of Grok AI. However, Intel is ' sluggishly pivoting' in the AI market, according to the report. 'Intel expects to save up to $10 billion by 2025 with the job cuts,' said the report, citing the company's plans to recover from its losses.

**Intel to Lay Off Thousands of Employees as Part of Recovery Plan**
According to rumors, Intel is preparing to lay off thousands of employees as part of a recovery plan to cut costs and recover from continuous revenue declines and market share losses. The official announcement of the layoffs may occur this week, according to Bloomberg, which cites sources close to the company. Intel currently employs 110,000 people worldwide, so a package of layoffs in the thousands would represent a significant percentage of the total. Analysts expect Intel's revenue to be stagnant in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, but projections are more optimistic for the rest of the year, with total sales potentially increasing by 3% in the second half of the year. The company is facing a strong rise in the AMD and a powerful segment of AI, which has been dominated by Nvidia. The layoffs are expected to help Intel maintain its investment in research and development, as well as its new semiconductor factories, which will not only produce its own chips but also those of third parties. As Bloomberg notes, Intel has already undergone a significant reduction in its workforce in 2023, with a 5% reduction in positions. If the new round of layoffs is confirmed, it will occur amid problems with its Raptor Lake chips, which will not help its reputation.

**Intel Plans to Lay Off Thousands of Employees to Reduce Costs and Fund Recovery**
According to sources from Bloomberg, Intel plans to lay off thousands of employees to reduce costs and fund its recovery program after a decline in profit and market share. The company is expected to announce the layoffs by the end of this week. Intel's current workforce is around 110,000 people. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company has invested heavily in research and development to improve technologies and regain its position in the semiconductor industry. However, AMD and other competitors have weakened Intel's dominant position and captured market share under Gelsinger's predecessors. Following the news of layoffs, Intel's stock rose by around 1%. Other chipmakers, led by Nvidia, have made significant progress in developing profitable chips for complex tasks related to artificial intelligence. Intel is implementing a plan to build factories for producing semiconductors for other chipmakers. In July, Intel hired Nagi Chandrashekara from Micron as its global chief operating officer. Last year, Intel reduced its workforce by around 5%, and by the end of the year, the company had around 124.8 thousand employees. Layoffs have been ongoing since 2022, with a workforce of 131.9 thousand people as of May. Intel has also reduced costs in other areas, expecting to save up to $10 billion by 2025. Analysts predict that Intel's revenue will remain at the same level as the previous year's second quarter. Experts forecast a 3% increase in sales in the second half of the year, with a total revenue of $55.7 billion, marking the first annual revenue growth since 2021.

Intel has also been building new chip factories in the US, Europe, and Israel, and has received billions of dollars in grants to fund these efforts. Despite the challenges, Wall Street analysts forecast Intel's second quarter revenue to remain flat, but expect sales to pick up in the second half of fiscal 2024. Intel's full-year revenue is expected to grow by 3% to $55.7 billion, its first revenue gains since 2021.
