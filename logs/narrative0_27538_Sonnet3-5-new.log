[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models held true again. Even with Putin's nuclear drills in May and those threatening statements about territorial integrity, Russia didn't cross the nuclear threshold."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Our models gave it a 12.8% probability. The May exercises and state TV discussions were concerning, but they followed Russia's historical pattern of nuclear saber-rattling. The key indicator was that Putin's actual military responses remained conventional."

Nate: "Right. Despite the rhetoric about Ukrainian forces in Russian territory and the change in nuclear doctrine, the costs of using nuclear weapons far outweighed any tactical advantages. Even with their backs against the wall, the probability never exceeded 15%."

Tetlock: "The Kursk raids created tension, but our models showed Putin's threats were primarily for domestic consumption and deterrence."

Tetlock: [solemnly] "Well, our models were right again. We had calculated a 12.3% probability of Russia using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine or Ukrainian-held territory by October 1st."

Silver: "Yes, and thankfully it didn't happen. The May 2024 tactical nuclear drills and Putin's rhetoric about doctrine changes had raised some concerns, but our models suggested it was still a low-probability event."

Tetlock: "The key factors were Russia's historical reluctance to cross the nuclear threshold and the severe international consequences they'd face. Even with their threats about territorial integrity and the Kursk region raids, our models showed they were more likely to be using nuclear threats as strategic leverage."

Silver: "Though 12.3% was uncomfortably high for such a catastrophic event. We're fortunate it remained just rhetoric."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models held true again. We had this nuclear detonation scenario at 12.4%."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite Putin's increasingly aggressive nuclear posture and those May tactical weapon drills, it didn't happen. Though that August 8th Russian TV segment about using tactical nukes in Kursk had me concerned."

Nate: "The probability did spike after Putin's June statement about using 'all means at our disposal.' But our models suggested it was mostly saber-rattling."

Philip: "Fascinating how Prigozhin's prediction about Russia potentially nuking its own territory never materialized. The territorial integrity argument remained just that – an argument."

Nate: "Exactly. Even with Ukraine's occupation of some Russian territory, the nuclear threshold wasn't crossed. The costs still outweighed any tactical advantages."

Tetlock: [removing glasses] "No, our models had it at 12.45%. Despite Putin's nuclear drills in May and his increasingly aggressive posturing, the probability remained relatively low."

Silver: "Agreed. The August 8th Russian state TV discussion about tactical nukes in Kursk and Putin's rhetoric about territorial integrity were concerning signals, but our models indicated these were primarily psychological warfare tactics."

Tetlock: "The key factor was that using nuclear weapons would have isolated Russia completely, even from its remaining allies. Our models showed that while Putin was willing to threaten nuclear escalation, the actual deployment threshold remained high."

Silver: "The tactical nuclear drills were the peak risk point, but even then, our calculations suggested it was more about deterrence than intent. The costs simply outweighed any potential military advantages."

Nate Silver: [removing glasses, looking tired] Well, Phil, our models were right again. We had it at 12.3%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding solemnly] The signals were there - Putin's May tactical nuclear drills, the state TV rhetoric, the doctrine shift. But the deterrence factors still heavily outweighed the escalation risks.

Nate: Even with Ukrainian forces in Russian territory and Putin's threats about territorial integrity, the international consequences were too severe. China's private warnings to Moscow probably helped.

Philip: [checking his tablet] Our models factored in everything up to August 22nd - the Kursk region tensions, Putin's posturing about doctrine changes. But the nuclear taboo since 1945 remained strong.

Nate: Another close call though. Those tactical nukes sitting in storage... sometimes I wonder if we'll always be this lucky.
