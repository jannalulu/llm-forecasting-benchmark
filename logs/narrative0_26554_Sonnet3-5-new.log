[Scene: A dimly lit observatory lounge. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on holographic displays.]

NATE: Well, Phil, another deadline passed without an interstellar visitor getting that "I" designation.

PHILIP: Not surprising. Our models had it at 32.4%. Even with the Rubin Observatory's construction delays, we factored in all the active sky surveys.

NATE: Right. We knew the discovery rate would be slow. Two confirmed objects in five years - 'Oumuamua and Borisov - gave us good baseline data.

PHILIP: The disputed CNEOS object created some noise in the calculations, but didn't significantly shift our probability assessment.

NATE: [checking tablet] The model held up perfectly. These objects are rare, and detection technology, while improving, isn't quite there yet.

PHILIP: Exactly. We'll likely see more once Rubin is fully operational, but this timeframe was always a long shot.

NATE: Well, Phil, another quarter passes without an interstellar visitor.

PHILIP: Not surprising. Our models had it at 22.45%.

NATE: Exactly. With only two confirmed interstellar objects in our historical dataset - 'Oumuamua and Borisov - and the Vera Rubin Observatory not yet at full capacity, the odds were always against us.

PHILIP: The model accounted for that. Even with improved detection capabilities, these objects remain incredibly rare. The spatial volume we're scanning is just too vast.

NATE: [examining a chart] Interesting how the disputed CNEOS 2014-01-08 case affected our probability distribution.

PHILIP: Indeed. Though we'll likely see more in the coming years, this particular timeframe was simply too narrow. The mathematics of interstellar object detection remains humbling.

NATE: Well, Phil, another quarter passed without an interstellar visitor.

PHILIP: Not surprising. Our models had it at 22.4%.

NATE: Indeed. Even with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's preparations, the timing window was too narrow. Only two confirmed interstellar objects in all our years of watching...

PHILIP: Three if you count that disputed 2014 object. But yes, the math wasn't in favor. The Pan-STARRS discovery of 'Oumuamua and Borisov's detection were nearly two years apart. Expecting another within this specific timeframe was optimistic.

NATE: [checking notes] Our models accounted for improved detection capabilities but also the random nature of these visitors. Sometimes the cosmos makes us wait.

PHILIP: At least we got the probability right. Again.

[Scene: A dimly lit observatory lounge. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on holographic displays]

Tetlock: [sighs] "No interstellar object designation by the IAU. Our models had it at 32.5%."

Silver: "Agreed. The lack of Vera Rubin Observatory's full operations during this period was crucial. They're still in their science verification phase."

Tetlock: "Only two confirmed objects in seven years - 'Oumuamua and Borisov. The sample size is frustratingly small."

Silver: "The models accounted for that. Even with Pan-STARRS and other current surveys running, the detection rate remains low. Without Rubin's full capability, we couldn't justify a higher probability."

Tetlock: "The disputed CNEOS 2014-01-08 case shows how challenging verification can be. We'll need better detection systems."

PHILIP: The Vera Rubin Observatory would have changed the game, but it wasn't operational in time for our forecast window.

NATE: [pulling up a 3D star map] The math was clear - with current technology and search patterns, we needed extraordinary luck to spot one by September 30th.

PHILIP: Like 'Oumuamua and Borisov, these visitors are rare and elusive. Our low probability forecast proved accurate once again.
