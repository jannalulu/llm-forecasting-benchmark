**China carries out 'combat patrol'**
The Philippines, Australia, Canada, and the United States have launched a joint sea and air exercise in the South China Sea, as China carried out a combat patrol to test its 'strike capabilities' near Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal. The four-nation maneuvers aim to demonstrate regional strength and international cooperation, and emphasize the lawful uses of the sea and international airspace. China's actions have been met with concerns of a potential conflict, as it has been saber-rattling toward Taiwan and the South China Sea. The Philippines has held separate naval exercises in the South China Sea, and a joint coast guard exercise is scheduled off Manila Bay on Friday between the Philippines and Vietnam. The Philippines has a mutual defense treaty with the United States and signed a treaty with Japan last month. 'The naval and air force units of participating nations will operate together, enhancing cooperation and interoperability between our armed forces,' said the joint statement. 'Australia, Canada, the Philippines and the United States uphold the right to freedom of navigation and overflight, other lawful uses of the sea and international airspace, as well as respect for maritime rights under international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.'

**Philippines Seeks Military Cooperation Agreements with France, Canada, and New Zealand Amid South China Sea Disputes**
The Philippines' Secretary of Defense, Gilberto Teodoro, stated that the country will seek to sign military cooperation agreements with countries such as France, Canada, and New Zealand amid disputes with Beijing over the South China Sea. Teodoro expects these agreements to be signed by 2025, aiming to increase the 'interoperability' of armed forces between countries. The agreements will allow the armed forces of these countries to operate together with the Philippine Army in the Philippines and vice versa. Teodoro emphasized that these agreements are not a mutual defense treaty, but a step forward in military ties. The Philippines has agreements with Australia and the UK, and a mutual defense treaty with the US. Tensions between the Philippines and China have increased since the rise of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2022, who has strengthened military ties with the US and expanded access to its bases for US troops, including some in the South China Sea or the self-governing island of Taiwan. However, in recent weeks, Beijing and Manila have increased negotiations to avoid conflicts in disputed waters and announced the signing of an agreement to reduce tensions on Sunday.

**Filipino youths protest against military agreement between Philippines, US, and Japan**
Young Filipinos protested outside the US and Japanese embassies in Manila to reject the military agreements between the Philippines, the US, and Japan, which grant access to US troops, including some strategic access to the South China Sea or the self-governing island of Taiwan. The protest comes ahead of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s State of the Nation address on July 22. The Philippines and China have been in a growing sovereignty dispute in the South China Sea, where there have been increased confrontations between ships from both countries.

**US hawks are making ready for a Taiwan conflict situation as early as 2024– 2024-07-13 21:48:15**
The US is preparing for a potential conflict with China over Taiwan as early as 2024. The US has held secret military exercises with Taiwan in Michigan, with 7,000 Taiwanese troops stationed in the Midwest. The US National Guard has been involved in the training, similar to its involvement in training Ukrainian forces since 2014. Meanwhile, the US and South Korea are set to hold joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and Japan is increasing its military budget to purchase US missiles and fighter jets. Taiwan is also preparing for a potential conflict, building 220 naval medical services and holding exercises at its largest airport to repel a Chinese landing. Anti-China hawks in the US are already preparing for a conflict, and China is also preparing, concentrating its naval forces around Taiwan and deploying hypersonic missiles. The upcoming January elections in Taiwan could be a turning point, with the ruling party's candidate potentially pushing for independence and secession.

**Bill Emmott: Japan, US roles in SE Asia to grow amid China's power imbalance**
The Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional defense summit, saw notable moments, including aggressive words about Taiwan from China's defense minister and protests about civilian deaths in Gaza. President Bongbong Marcos of the Philippines stated that if a Filipino serviceman were killed by a Chinese water cannon, it would be considered an act of war, which could invoke the 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines. This raises concerns about the potential for war between the US and China over the South China Sea. China has a long-standing claim to the area, and its recent decree authorizing the China Coast Guard to detain foreign nationals who flout marine demarcations has led to a collision between a Chinese and a Philippine ship. The article argues that the huge power imbalance between China and the South-East Asian nations, which is reflected in their military spending, will take time to redress, and in the meantime, the US and Japan will play a crucial role in the region.

**The US is Preparing for an Unwinnable War Against China**
The US is preparing for an unwinnable war against China, according to Megan Russell, CODEPINK's China is Not Our Enemy Campaign Coordinator. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Q. Brown is 'fully confident' that the US would defeat China if war were to break out over Taiwan, despite the Commission on National Defense Strategy predicting extreme losses on the US side. However, Russell argues that war would result in mass loss of life, economic devastation, environmental destruction, and human rights atrocities. The US has been in near constant conflict since its inception, and recent wars have shown ineptitude, with widespread death and destruction. The government is edging towards war with China, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin bringing $500 million to the Philippines to boost their military capabilities and Secretary of State Antony Blinken negotiating a deal to move US operational control of Japanese forces from Hawaii to Japan. Russell emphasizes that this is not just about war strategy, but also about public perception, as the American people are more likely to support a war when they aren't losing loved ones. She also criticizes the US government's use of proxy states and funding the troops of another country as long as they act in US interests, which she calls a 'dark feeling of indifference towards the citizens of other nations.' Russell concludes that it's time for the American public to take a stand against the normalization of conflict and the preparation for war with China, which she calls 'global suicide.'

**Philippines Begins Joint Military Exercises with US, Canada, and Australia Amid Tensions with China**
The Philippines has started a two-day military exercise with the US, Canada, and Australia in the midst of tensions with China over a maritime territorial dispute. The exercises will take place 'in the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines' and demonstrate 'our collective commitment to strengthening regional and international cooperation towards a free and open Indo-Pacific', according to high-ranking military officials from the four nations. This type of exercise is becoming more common in the region, which is experiencing a delicate situation due to China's threats to Taiwan and territorial disputes with the Philippines in the South China Sea. These tensions have raised concerns about a potential conflict involving the US, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, despite an international decision against its interests. The Philippines recently conducted naval exercises in these waters with the US and Japanese armies and plans to hold exercises with the Vietnamese Coast Guard this week.

**Antony Blinken's Asian Tour: Reassuring Allies Amid Concerns of Donald Trump's Return**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on a tour of Asia to reassure allies concerned about a potential return of Donald Trump. The South Korean and Japanese governments are seeking to solidify their ties with Washington beyond the changes in the White House. The possibility of Trump's return is causing concern, particularly in South Korea, which is trying to finalize negotiations on compensation for the presence of over 28,000 US troops on its soil. Trump had wanted to increase the financial contribution from South Korea by five times. Japan has also locked in an agreement until 2027. Blinken has announced a $500 million military aid package for the Philippines, which is part of the tensions with China in the South China Sea. The US has access to a total of nine strategic military bases on Philippine soil since last year. This package is intended to modernize the Philippine armed forces and coast guard. It is part of a $2 billion aid package allocated to the region by the US House of Representatives in April. Additionally, the US and Singapore have signed an agreement to 'deepen' their cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, as Singapore considers alternative energy sources to reduce its carbon emissions. Singapore, a major financial center and a key player in the global semiconductor industry, currently relies on oil and natural gas and is studying options, including nuclear energy, to achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The election in Taiwan in November is causing the most concern, as no formal agreement obliges the US to defend the island in case of an invasion. However, the principle has been reaffirmed six times by Joe Biden, who has also provided financial aid to the country for its defense. Taiwan is already financing the modernization of its army largely on its own.

**Amid growing Chinese pressure, two US allies hold joint drill in South China Sea**
The Philippine and Japanese navies held their first joint exercise in the South China Sea, as the two US allies boost security ties in the face of China's growing pressure. The drills, which included a communications exercise and tactical manoeuvres, aimed to strengthen regional cooperation and maintain peace and stability in the region. According to the Philippine military, the exercise 'enhanced the tactical capabilities of the Philippine Navy and the (Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force) and reinforced the strong ties and mutual commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region.' This move comes as China's sabre-rattling towards Taiwan and over the South China Sea fuels fears of a potential conflict that could drag in the United States. The Philippines and Japan are longtime allies of the United States, which has been strengthening its alliances to counter China's growing military might and influence in the region. 'This activity was part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen regional and international cooperation towards realising a free and open Indo-Pacific,' said the Philippine military. The two countries have also signed an agreement to allow the deployment of troops on each other's territory, further deepening their security ties.

**Impossible For China To Dominate — U.S. Tightens Screws In Indo-Pacific To Check PLA, Fortify Allies & Military Bases**
The United States is strengthening its military presence in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China's growing influence. The US has moved F-22 Raptors to Japan, increased military capabilities with regional allies, and created new military bases in the Philippines. The US Indo-Pacific Command is responsible for securing the region, which spans from the West Coast of the US to the East Coast of India. The command has significant assets in Alaska, Guam, Japan, and the Philippines, including airbases, naval bases, and special operations forces. The US is also upgrading its military capabilities in the region, including the deployment of F-35 fighters to Japan and the Philippines. The article highlights the US military presence in Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, and notes that these countries have significant military forces and are increasing their defense expenditures. The article also mentions the US-Taiwan defense treaty and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which define the officially substantial but non-diplomatic relations between the US and Taiwan.

**Philippines braces for Taiwan fallout as ‘bolder' Japan challenges Beijing**
The Philippines and Japan have signed a landmark pact allowing troop deployment on each other's soil, amid rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. China and Japan are trading barbs over Beijing's growing assertiveness, and any conflict between the two powers could have devastating spillover effects. The Philippines, which has 200,000 workers in Taiwan, faces its own challenges if conflict erupts. Geopolitical analysts warn that the Philippines may be caught in the cross hairs, with Beijing having warned Manila not to 'play with fire' when it comes to the Taiwan issue. The Philippines' Taiwan-facing military bases in the north, which US forces can access under a recently expanded defence pact, could be a potential flashpoint. 'The concern may be real' as Beijing had already warned Manila not to 'play with fire' when it comes to the Taiwan issue 'if it cares about those workers', said Matteo Piasentini, a geopolitical analyst. 'A bolder Japan' is essential to counter Beijing's maritime aggression, said security analyst Chester Cabalza, with the Philippines and Taiwan looking to rely on Tokyo as a regional leader.

**Japan and Philippines Sign Defense Pact Amid Rising Tensions with China**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense pact on Monday, allowing for the deployment of Japanese forces for joint military exercises, including live-fire drills, in the Southeast Asian country. The agreement, known as the Reciprocal Access Agreement, was signed by Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa in a ceremony in Manila attended by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The pact will take effect after ratification by the legislatures of both countries, according to Japanese and Philippine officials. Kamikawa described the signing of the defense agreement as 'a historic achievement' that should consolidate defense cooperation between Tokyo and Manila. 'A free and open international order based on the rule of law is the foundation of regional peace and prosperity,' she said. 'We would like to work closely with your country to maintain and strengthen it.' The defense pact with the Philippines is Japan's first in Asia. Tokyo has signed similar agreements with Australia in 2022 and the UK in 2023. Japan has been strengthening its security and military capabilities under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, including a counterattack capability that breaks with Japan's traditional focus on self-defense, in response to North Korean threats and China's growing assertiveness. The country is increasing its defense spending by 2% annually for five years until 2027, aiming to become the third-largest military spender in the world, behind the US and China. Many of Japan's Asian neighbors, including the Philippines, were victims of Japanese aggression until Japan was defeated in World War II, and Tokyo's efforts to strengthen its military role and budget could be a sensitive issue. However, Japan and the Philippines have been increasing their defense and security ties. The initiative by Kishida advances in parallel with Marcos' efforts to sign security alliances that support the limited capacity of the Philippine government to defend its territorial interests in the South China Sea. The disputed waters are a key route for global trade, and China has claimed almost the entire area, although the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan also claim some zones. The US has been strengthening a series of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better face China, including any possible confrontation over Taiwan, and to reassure its Asian allies. Japan and the Philippines are treaty allies of the US, and their leaders held trilateral talks in April at the White House, where President Biden reiterated the 'ironclad' commitment of Washington to defend Japan and the Philippines.

**Philippines and Japan Sign Defense Pact Amid Tensions with China**
The governments of the Philippines and Japan signed a military cooperation agreement, allowing the deployment of their troops in each other's countries, amid growing tensions with China in the Indo-Pacific. The pact, signed during the visit of Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa to Manila, enables both countries to deploy troops for exercises and training. This will facilitate Japan's participation in the annual Balikatan military exercises, where it has previously participated as an observer alongside Philippine and US troops. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. emphasized the 'hard work' of both countries in achieving this defense pact and praised the 'confidence and importance' it brings to both governments. The agreement aims to 'maintain and strengthen the international order based on the rule of law'. The two countries, historical allies of the US, have been strengthening their defense ties in recent months in response to China's growing assertiveness. The disputed South China Sea is a key area of contention, with the Philippines, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan all having claims to the region. Tensions between China and the Philippines have increased since Marcos Jr. took office in 2022, with the Philippines strengthening its military alliance with the US and expanding access to its bases for US troops, including some with strategic access to the South China Sea or Taiwan.

**Japan and the Philippines Sign Defense Agreement to Counter China's Growing Military Power**
Japan and the Philippines signed a defense agreement to focus on China's growing military power in the region. The agreement allows for the deployment of troops on each other's soil, amid shared concerns about China's military expansion. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kishida and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro signed the agreement on Monday during a ceremony in Manila. The agreement enables Japanese troops to deploy in the Philippines for joint military exercises, and Philippine troops to conduct combat training in Japan. The agreement requires ratification by the legislative bodies of both countries to take effect. The agreement comes as Japan and the Philippines, both US allies, express concern over China's growing influence in the region. China claims more than 90% of the South China Sea, including waters within the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines and four other Southeast Asian countries. In 2016, an international court in The Hague ruled that China's claims had no legal basis. The Chinese and Philippine coast guards and navies have been involved in several confrontations in disputed waters, including a recent incident where Chinese coast guards used knives and harpoons and rammed two Philippine Navy supply ships. Japan has a long-standing territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa. Under Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Tokyo has sought to strengthen its military power, including through reciprocal access agreements with Australia and the UK. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. strongly condemned China's actions in the South China Sea and warned that his country would consider any Filipino killed by China as a 'war crime'. Manila has long-standing defense agreements with Australia and the US, and is exploring a similar agreement with France. In April, leaders of the US, Japan, and the Philippines held their first trilateral summit in Washington, as part of efforts to strengthen military cooperation between the three countries. The summit followed joint military exercises in the South China Sea, which also involved Australia.

**258th Day of the 'Iron Swords' War: A Summary of the Conflict**
The 258th day of the 'Iron Swords' war between Israel and terrorist organizations in Gaza, Judea, and Samaria, as well as in Lebanon, began on October 7, 2023. The war started with a terrorist attack on a music festival near the Gaza border, killing hundreds and taking many hostages. The terrorist organization Hamas announced the start of the war, calling it 'The Flood of Al-Aksa'. In response, the Israeli government declared a state of war and launched Operation 'Iron Swords'. Since the start of the war, over 1,500 people have been killed, including citizens of Israel, the US, Canada, the UK, France, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Brazil, China, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Nepal, South Africa, Sudan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. The Israeli military has suffered significant losses, with over 310 soldiers killed and around 14,000 terrorists and their commanders eliminated. The war has also caused significant damage to infrastructure in Gaza, with over 10,000 rockets fired at Israeli cities and towns. The Israeli military has responded with airstrikes on targets in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, and has also launched a naval operation to intercept ships carrying weapons to Gaza. The war has displaced over 1.7 million people in Gaza, with many forced to flee their homes and live in shelters. The United Nations has reported that over 40% of the dead in Gaza are men of fighting age, 20% are women, and 32% are children. The war has also caused significant economic and humanitarian crises in Gaza, with many people struggling to access basic necessities such as food and medicine.
