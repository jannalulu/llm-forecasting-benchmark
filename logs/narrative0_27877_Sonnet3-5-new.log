[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *rubbing his temples* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We predicted a 32.45% probability of an open-source model making it to the top tier by October 1st, and sure enough, it didn't happen."

Philip: *nodding* "The signals were clear in the data. Despite the momentum from Mistral AI and Meta's Llama series last year, the proprietary models maintained their edge. The compute gap was just too significant."

Nate: "What's interesting is that the closest open-source model came within 75 points of the leader - closer than many expected, but still not meeting our criteria."

Philip: "True. The September developments in model compression techniques showed promise, but weren't enough to bridge the gap in time."

[Both turn back to their screens, analyzing the next prediction.]

Nate: *rubbing his eyes* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again. The open-source models couldn't quite break into the top tier by October 1st."

Philip: "Indeed. Our forecasting models gave it a 32.4% probability. Close, but not quite there. Mistral AI and Meta's latest releases showed promise, but they still couldn't match GPT-5's performance on the Arena leaderboard."

Nate: "The gap narrowed significantly since last year, though. Remember when open-source was trailing by hundreds of ELO points? Now they're within striking distance."

Philip: "True. The democratization of AI is progressing, just not at the pace some hoped. The proprietary models managed to stay ahead by a margin of about 75 ELO points."

Nate: "Well, there's always next year."

Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on holographic screens]

NATE: Well, Philip, looks like our models were spot on again about the open-source AI reaching frontier status.

PHILIP: Yes, we had it at 32.45%. Not surprising given what we knew by September 2023.

NATE: [scrolling through data] The gap between proprietary and open-source models remained significant. Despite Mistral's promising developments and Meta's partial releases, they couldn't crack that top-three threshold or get within 50 ELO points.

PHILIP: The key indicator was the sustained investment by major tech companies in proprietary models. Our September data showed they were maintaining their lead through aggressive R&D and data advantages.

NATE: [nodding] The open-source community made impressive strides, but catching up to the frontier models by October 2024 was always a long shot.

[They both turn to update their forecasting models for the next prediction]

Nate: *rubbing his temples* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We gave it a 32.7% probability, and sure enough, no open-source AI made it to the top."

Philip: "Indeed. The proprietary models from major labs maintained their lead. Looking back at our September data, we saw promising developments from Mistral AI and Meta's open-source efforts, but they couldn't quite bridge that capability gap."

Nate: "The interesting part was how close they got – within about 80 rating points of the leader. Just not enough to meet our 50-point threshold."

Philip: "True. The open-source community made remarkable progress, but the resource advantage of major labs proved decisive. Their ability to train on larger datasets and use more computing power kept them ahead."

Philip: "Indeed. Despite Mistral AI's impressive open-source releases and Meta's continued push for transparency, none of their models quite made it to the top 3 on chat.lmsys.org by October 1st."

Nate: "The proprietary models from Anthropic and OpenAI maintained their lead. Though I must say, that open-source model came within 75 points of the top ELO rating – closer than we've seen before."

Philip: *nodding* "The gap is narrowing, but not quite fast enough. Looking back at our September data, we saw the trend of increased corporate investment in proprietary models outpacing open-source development."

Nate: "The race continues, but for now, the frontier remains closed."
