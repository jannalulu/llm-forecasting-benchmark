**INT. FORECASTING OFFICE - DAY AFTER THE EVENT**

*The room is filled with a palpable tension as the superforecasters gather around a table, their expressions pensive.*

**FORECASTER 1**  
(leaning back in chair)  
So, did it happen? Did more than 30 aircraft violate Taiwan's ADIZ in a single day?

**FORECASTER 2**  
(shaking head)  
No, it didn't. Our models had it at 15.25%. Given the trends, it was always a low probability event.

**FORECASTER 3**  
(nodding)  
The military drills after Lai's inauguration were intense, but still, 30 in one day was a stretch.

**FORECASTER 1**  
(looking at notes)  
The rhetoric was fierce, but actions didn't match. Our models never miss.

**FORECASTER 2**  
(smirking)  
It seems China's intimidation tactic has its limits... for now.

*They all exchange knowing glances, the weight of their accuracy settling in.*

*The room is filled with the hum of computers and the quiet chatter of superforecasters. A large digital screen displays the latest data.*

**JAMES**, a seasoned superforecaster, leans back in his chair, eyes on the screen.

**JAMES**  
(looking at the data)  
So, the event didn't happen. Our models had it at 12.34%.

**LISA**, another forecaster, nods thoughtfully.

**LISA**  
Given the trends after Lai's inauguration, the increased military drills, and the rhetoric from PRC officials, it seemed possible. But more than 30 in a day was always a stretch.

**JAMES**  
True. Even with the uptick to 10 violations per day, hitting 30 would have been unprecedented since the last peak.

**LISA**  
(typing on her laptop)  
It's a relief, though. A spike like that could have escalated tensions significantly.

*The forecasters return to their work, the tension in the room easing with the knowledge that the models were correct once again.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**

Our models had it at 65.50%. Given the trends since Lai's inauguration and the escalation in military drills, it was a significant possibility.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3**

Indeed. The average was climbing, but breaking 30 in a day is still a bold move. The intimidation tactic is clear, but did they push it that far?

No, it didn't happen. Our models had it at 15.27%. The trend was upwards, but not that steep.

**SAM**
