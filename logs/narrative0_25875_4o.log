*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers in hand.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, a day past the deadline. Did Biden withdraw?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 15.25%. The debate fallout was significant, but not enough for a definitive withdrawal.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The media frenzy post-debate was intense. But as of July 8, Biden’s campaign held firm.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Historical patterns showed incumbents rarely back down without a major internal push. Obama and Harris’s support was pivotal.

**NATE SILVER:** Betting markets wavered, but our models accounted for Biden’s resilience.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The stakes are high, and Biden’s commitment was clear, despite the odds.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, the road to November remains unpredictable. Let’s see how this unfolds.

*They exchange knowing glances, the weight of political foresight heavy in the air.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, the moment everyone was waiting for has passed. Joe Biden did not announce his withdrawal from the race. Our models had it at 24.78% that he would step down before the deadline. The debate fallout was intense, but his campaign held firm.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, Nate. Despite media pressure and tumbling odds, Biden's resilience was underestimated. His commitment to running again, even after that debate, was unwavering. Our models reflected the reality, predicting a "No" outcome.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, the Democratic Party seemed to rally behind him, especially with endorsements from key figures like Obama and Harris. The probability of him stepping down was always low given the support network.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Absolutely. It’s a testament to Biden's determination and the political machinery backing him. The next few months will be critical as the election approaches.
