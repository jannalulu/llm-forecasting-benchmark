**Boeing's Uncrewed Starliner Capsule Could Return After Sep 6, Says NASA**
NASA has decided to proceed with the undocking of the uncrewed Boeing Starliner capsule not before September 6, after reviewing the spacecraft's propulsion system issues. The Starliner experienced glitches within the first 24 hours of its flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in June, which were deemed too risky for a crewed return. The journey back to Earth is expected to take approximately six hours, and ground teams will remotely guide the spacecraft through necessary manoeuvres for a safe undocking, re-entry and parachute-assisted landing in the southwestern United States. NASA astronauts who flew to the ISS in the Starliner will return to Earth in a SpaceX vehicle early next year. 'The Starliner has previously completed a successful uncrewed entry and landing during two orbital flight tests,' NASA said. The agency is confident in the spacecraft's ability to safely return to Earth, and the undocking is expected to take place not before September 6.

**Boeing's Starliner set to fly solo back to earth — Nasa astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore left behind on ISS**
Nasa's Boeing Starliner capsule is set to undock from the International Space Station (ISS) this Friday evening, marking a significant development in a mission fraught with complications. The capsule will return to Earth with empty seats, leaving behind astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore who will remain on the ISS until their eventual return with SpaceX in February. Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager, expressed enthusiasm about the capsule's return, stating, 'It's been a journey to get here, and we're excited to have Starliner return.' However, the excitement is tempered by the unusual situation of the two astronauts. The Starliner's departure will be simpler than initially planned, with a 20-minute maneuvering time instead of an hour-long near-station orbit. Before reentry, additional thruster tests are planned to collect as much data as possible. The astronauts' blue Boeing spacesuits and some old station equipment will accompany the capsule on its return journey. The delay in the astronauts' return extends their mission beyond the original weeklong test flight, and they will now contribute to ongoing experiments and maintenance while adjusting their exercise routines to combat the effects of prolonged weightlessness.

**NASA overhauling Starliner undocking from space station as capsule returns without crew**
NASA is undocking the Starliner spacecraft from the International Space Station on Friday, bringing an end to a troubled crewed flight test. The spacecraft has been plagued by issues, including helium leaks and thruster failures, which have left it unsuitable for bringing people home. Despite these challenges, NASA officials are still backing Boeing, the manufacturer of the Starliner. 'Many parts of the mission went extremely well. Starliner is a great spacecraft. The life support systems are performing very well,' said Steve Stich, who manages NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The undocking procedure will be modified to get the Starliner away from the ISS as fast as possible, with an immediate thruster burn rather than a normal trajectory. Astronauts Sunni Williams and Butch Wilmore will stay on station through early next year and return to earth with Crew 9 in February. 'I'm personally looking forward to getting Starliner back. We've learned a lot on this test flight, and we'll continue to learn more,' concluded Stich.

**Boeing's uncrewed Starliner capsule could return to Earth by late next week, NASA says**
NASA plans to proceed with the undocking of the uncrewed Boeing Starliner capsule not before September 6, after reviewing the spacecraft's propulsion system issues. The Starliner experienced glitches within the first 24 hours of its flight to the International Space Station (ISS) in June. NASA astronauts who flew to the ISS in the Starliner will return to Earth in a SpaceX vehicle early next year. The journey back to Earth for the Starliner is expected to take approximately six hours, and ground teams will remotely guide the spacecraft through necessary maneuvers for a safe undocking, re-entry, and parachute-assisted landing in the southwestern United States. 'The Starliner has previously completed a successful uncrewed entry and landing during two orbital flight tests,' NASA said. 'We are confident in the spacecraft's ability to safely return to Earth,' the agency added. The Starliner is expected to return to Earth by late next week, according to NASA.

**NASA to Bring Starliner Back to Earth on September 6**
NASA announced on Friday (29) that the Boeing's Starliner capsule is expected to leave the International Space Station on September 6, provided that the weather conditions are suitable for the return to Earth. The date was revealed after an analysis conducted by NASA and Boeing. If everything goes well, the spacecraft will be undocked from the ISS at 19h04 Brasília time. It will travel back and is expected to land at the White Sands spaceport in New Mexico after six hours. The location was one of the main training areas for the astronauts of the space shuttle. In a statement, NASA officials explained that the Starliner will return to Earth autonomously and without a crew. 'The ground teams can remotely control the spacecraft if necessary during the necessary maneuvers for safe undocking, re-entry, and landing with the help of parachutes in the southeastern United States,' they added. This is not the first time the Starliner has returned to Earth autonomously. It happened during the uncrewed flight tests in 2019 and 2022 - in the first one, the spacecraft did not reach the ISS, but in the second, it did. The Starliner was launched to the ISS on June 5, carrying astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to the orbital laboratory. The spacecraft was docked to the station the next day, but suffered helium leaks and failures in five of its 28 thrusters. Since then, NASA and Boeing have extended the stay of the duo on the ISS while analyzing the incident, and concluded that it was too dangerous to use the Starliner to bring them back to Earth. Therefore, they will remain in the laboratory until February 2025, and then will return in a Crew Dragon capsule from SpaceX.

**Boeing Starliner to Return to Earth in February 2025**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft is scheduled to be undocked from the International Space Station on September 6. However, its crew will have to stay in space until February 2025. According to NASA, the agency and Boeing have completed a detailed review of the spacecraft's readiness for testing and undocking, and favorable weather conditions will also contribute to this. After undocking, the Starliner will take approximately six hours to reach the landing zone in White Sands, New Mexico, USA. The spacecraft will descend with parachutes and inflated airbags to cushion the impact of landing. The evacuation teams at the landing site will prepare the Starliner for its return to the Boeing factory at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA. Ground control teams can remotely control the spacecraft if necessary. As a reminder, Boeing launched astronauts to the ISS for the first time on June 5. Initially, it was expected that the spacecraft with the crew would return to Earth within eight days after docking with the station, but a problem with the engines occurred during the flight, making it unsafe for the crew to return on the Starliner. The first problem with the Starliner was discovered on Earth before launch - a helium leak occurred in the propulsion system's orientation control system. The leak occurred through a valve controlling the pressure in the fuel tank. During the flight, the same leak occurred in five of the 28 engines. The Starliner will return to Earth in February 2025.

**NASA Gives Green Light for Boeing's Starliner to Return to Earth Unmanned**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft will return to Earth without its crew on September 6, 2024, after NASA decided to leave the astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) due to technical issues. The spacecraft will land at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico about six hours after undocking from the ISS. Originally, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were scheduled to return with the Starliner, but due to safety concerns, including gas leaks and problems with the spacecraft's propulsion system, the decision was made to return the spacecraft without a crew. The astronauts will likely return to Earth in February 2025 with a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The Starliner will perform its return journey autonomously, but flight controllers in Houston and Florida will be monitoring the flight and can take control if necessary to ensure a safe undocking, re-entry, and landing. The success of the return flight is crucial for Boeing's space program, as any issues or a decision by NASA not to certify the Starliner for crewed missions would be a significant setback for the company, which has already incurred $1.5 billion in losses due to the Starliner program.

**Starliner to Return to Earth Without Crew on September 6th**
The NASA and Boeing have scheduled for September 6th that the Starliner spacecraft will undock without its crew from the International Space Station. The Starliner launched on June 5th on its first crewed mission, carrying NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to the International Space Station. The capsule successfully docked a day later, but the spacecraft experienced helium leaks and five of its 28 reaction control system thrusters failed on the way to the orbiting laboratory. After conducting tests since then, a crewless return was chosen to avoid risks. After undocking, the Starliner will take approximately six hours to reach the landing site at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. The spacecraft will land on September 7th, descending with parachutes and airbags to cushion the impact. Recovery teams at the landing site will secure and prepare the spacecraft for its return to the Boeing Starliner factory at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, according to a NASA statement. The Starliner has already successfully completed a crewless entry and landing during two orbital flight tests. During one of the flight tests, the spacecraft also demonstrated its ability to autonomously undock from the station in a safe manner.

**Starliner return from ISS set for Sept. 6**
Boeing's CST-100 Starliner is set to depart from the International Space Station on September 6, marking the end of a three-month flight. The spacecraft will undock from the station at 6:04 p.m. Eastern and perform a deorbit burn, setting up a landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico at 12:03 a.m. Eastern September 7. NASA officials had previously identified September 6 as a potential departure date, and the agency has confirmed plans for bringing the spacecraft back to Earth. The decision to return Starliner uncrewed was made due to uncertainty about the performance of its reaction control system thrusters. 'There's a few things that we have to do differently,' said Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, about the uncrewed departure of Starliner. The spacecraft will perform a fully autonomous return, although ground controllers will have the ability to intervene if needed. NASA will wait until after landing to determine next steps for the program, including whether to formally categorize it as a failure. 'We've accomplished a lot on this mission and learned a lot about this vehicle,' said Jim Free, NASA associate administrator. 'We'll look at this as we do any of our missions to see if it does it fall into any of the categories that we have that we define as a mishap once we get the vehicle back.'

**Boeing Starliner to Return to Earth Empty After Safety Concerns**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft, which carried astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station (ISS) in June, will return to Earth empty in September. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson stated, 'The space flights are risky, even in their safest and most routine forms.' He announced that the astronauts will not return with the Starliner due to safety concerns. The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams on the ISS and return the Starliner without a crew is a result of NASA's commitment to safety, its fundamental value and guiding principle. The Starliner experienced helium leaks and problems with its reaction control system propellers during its approach to the ISS. Experts certified that the spacecraft did not meet safety requirements for crewed space flights. The astronauts will be transferred to a SpaceX mission scheduled to launch next year, and they will remain on the ISS until February 2025. The Starliner will return to Earth empty, allowing NASA scientists to study the system failures that marred the first test flight of a Boeing spacecraft. The Starliner is currently docked at the ISS's primary port and will begin to undock in early September to make way for the SpaceX Crew 9 mission, which will launch on September 24. The astronauts will return on the Crew 9 Dragon spacecraft, which is currently being prepared by NASA and SpaceX, including reconfiguring the seats and adjusting the manifest to carry additional cargo, personal items, and specific Dragon spacesuits for Wilmore and Williams.

**Starliner Astronauts to Remain on ISS Until February 2025**
The astronauts on the Starliner spacecraft will remain on the International Space Station (ISS) until February 2025, according to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. 'The decision to leave Butch and Suni (astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams) on board the ISS and return the Starliner to Boeing without an crew is a result of our commitment to safety,' Nelson said at a press conference. The astronauts will return to Earth on a SpaceX spacecraft with two other crew members as part of the Crew-9 mission, which is scheduled to arrive at the ISS in late September. The Starliner is planned to be undocked from the ISS in early September and will make an automatic landing. This decision was made by NASA and Boeing specialists after analyzing the technical condition of the Starliner spacecraft. The spacecraft was launched on June 5 as part of its first test flight with astronauts on board, who were supposed to stay on the ISS for about eight days. However, problems with the maneuvering engines and a helium leak in the service module were detected during the approach to the ISS. To check the reliability of the spacecraft's systems, the return of the crew was postponed. Engineers conducted ground-based firing tests of similar engines on the White Sands test range, simulating the conditions the spacecraft would experience on its way to the ISS. The tests also included firing the engines in stressful situations and reproducing the conditions the Starliner would experience from undocking to re-entry.

**Starliner to return from ISS without astronauts on board**
NASA has decided to return the Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft from the International Space Station without astronauts on board due to thruster problems that posed too much risk. The spacecraft, which carried astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS in June, will return to Earth in early September. NASA officials said they did not understand well enough the performance of the reaction control system thrusters that malfunctioned during Starliner's approach to the station in June. 'That uncertainty remains in our understanding in the physics going on in the thrusters,' said Jim Free, NASA associate administrator. The decision to bring back Starliner uncrewed was unanimous among NASA representatives in the review, with Boeing willing to support either an uncrewed or crewed return. NASA now plans to move ahead with an alternative strategy, with Starliner undocking from the station without a crew and returning to Earth for a landing at White Sands or another location in the southwestern United States. Crew-9 will launch no earlier than Sept. 24 with two of its originally assigned four people on board, freeing up seats for Williams and Wilmore. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said he has been reassured by Boeing's new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, that the company will continue the Starliner program. 'He expressed to me an intention that they will continue to work the problems once Starliner is back safely,' Nelson said. 'We will have redundancy in our crewed access to the space station.'

**NASA confirms stranded Boeing Starliner astronauts will now wait until next year to return home**
NASA has decided that it's too risky to bring two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, back from the International Space Station (ISS) in Boeing's troubled new capsule, the Starliner. The pair will now wait until February 2025 to return home on a SpaceX spacecraft. The decision was made due to a cascade of thruster failures and helium leaks in the Starliner capsule, which marred their trip to the ISS. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, 'A test flight by nature is neither safe nor routine, and so the decision... is a commitment to safety'. The empty Starliner capsule will undock in early September and attempt to return on autopilot. Boeing had insisted that the Starliner was safe, but NASA has decided to prioritize safety over the company's concerns. NASA officials still hold out hope that Starliner's problems can be corrected in time for another crew flight in another year or so.

**After months of mulling, NASA will decide on Starliner return this weekend**
NASA senior leaders, including Administrator Bill Nelson, will meet on Saturday in Houston to decide whether Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is safe enough to ferry astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth from the International Space Station. The decision will be based on the outcome of the Flight Readiness Review (FRR), which will determine whether the Starliner is ready to undock from the space station in early September with the crew onboard or return without them. The two astronauts have been on the space station for 77 days, nearly 10 times longer than their planned stay of eight days, after a June 6 incident where multiple thrusters failed and the capsule leaked helium. Engineers believe the thrusters overheated, causing Teflon seals to bulge and block the flow of propellant, but they have not yet reached a consensus about whether the same problem could recur or get worse during the journey back to Earth.

**NASA to decide Saturday whether astronauts will ride Boeing's Starliner home — or use SpaceX's Dragon instead**
NASA officials will make a final decision on Saturday whether to use Boeing's Starliner spacecraft or SpaceX's Dragon to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams back to Earth. The decision comes after a series of technical issues with Starliner's propulsion system during its first crewed mission in June. NASA associate administrator Ken Bowersox said, 'Our big concern is having a successful de-orbit burn — making sure that the [propulsion] system works just the way it needs to all the way through the de-orbit burn.' If NASA determines that Starliner is not safe enough to fly home, it would undock from the station empty, and Williams and Wilmore would return onboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule. NASA has already delayed the launch of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission to the ISS by one month, to September 24; Williams and Wilmore would use that vehicle to return to Earth at the end of its stay — in February 2025. The decision will have a huge impact on the rapidly evolving space industry, with much on the line for both NASA and Boeing.

**Boeing Starliner: Decision on Return Expected by End of Month**
The NASA is evaluating all options to ensure a safe return of the two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who arrived on the International Space Station (ISS) aboard the Boeing Starliner. The decision on whether to return with the Starliner or the Crew Dragon is expected by the end of the month. According to Eric Berger of Ars Technica, the planned undocking with crew is scheduled for September 2, while the undocking without crew is expected on September 6. If the latter occurs, the flight software will need to be updated to perform all procedures without manual intervention. The analysis of the data from the tests conducted on one of the available engines at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico is ongoing. Engineers are still trying to understand why a Teflon gasket on a valve is inflating, reducing the flow of propellant to the reaction control system, which is essential for undocking and deorbiting operations.

**NASA and Boeing Still Uncertain When Starliner Will Return to Earth**
NASA and Boeing officials have not yet set a date for the Starliner spacecraft to return to Earth. As a result, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will spend more time on the International Space Station (ISS). The Starliner will conduct a test firing of its engines on Saturday (27) or Sunday (28), which will be controlled from the ground, but Wilmore and Williams will participate. According to NASA and Boeing, the mission, which was launched on June 5, was initially expected to last around 10 days, but problems with the engines and helium leaks have led to an indefinite extension. The mission may now last 90 days, which would mean the Starliner would return to Earth in early September. NASA's Steve Stich, Commercial Crew program manager, stated that the agency is confident that if needed, they would be able to return to Earth if there were a problem on the ISS. Suni Williams also commented, 'I'm confident that if we needed to, if we had a problem on the International Space Station, we would enter our spacecraft, perform the undocking, communicate with our team, and figure out the best way to get back home.'

**NASA still expects Boeing's Starliner to return astronauts from ISS, but notes SpaceX backup option**
NASA officials have acknowledged potential alternatives to Boeing's Starliner for returning astronauts from the International Space Station, but still consider it the primary option. The Starliner capsule, named 'Calypso', has been in space for 36 days and is expected to return as soon as the end of this month pending the results of testing a faulty propulsion system. NASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich emphasized that the first option is to return the astronauts on Starliner, and there has been no discussion about sending a SpaceX Crew Dragon to rescue the crew. Boeing and NASA are conducting ground testing in New Mexico to replicate an issue that caused some thrusters to shut down during the spacecraft's previous maneuvering. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, expressed confidence in returning on Starliner.
