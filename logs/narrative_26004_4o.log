**INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - JULY 17, 2024 - NIGHT**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, analyzing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
"So, as of July 15, Trump's lead was 2.8 points. Our models had it at 92.34%."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Biden's debate performance really shifted the dynamics. The calls for him to drop out were a significant factor."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(typing)  
"Even with the Biden team's efforts to counteract the narrative, the numbers didn't lie."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(glancing at a screen)  
"And with the Democratic National Convention looming, the pressure's on Biden to make a decision."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sighing)  
"Politics is unpredictable, but our models never are."

The room fills with a contemplative silence, the weight of the political landscape hanging in the air.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
"Our models had it at 15.23%. Given Biden's struggle post-debate, it was a low probability."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(scrolls through news articles)  
"The pressure on Biden was immense. The debate fallout was harsher than anticipated."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing on a laptop)  
"Yet, Biden's team was adamant about staying in the race. They really had to shift perceptions quickly."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(glancing at the screen)  
"Well, the numbers don't lie. Our models were spot on."

They all nod, satisfied with their predictions, as the room buzzes with quiet efficiency.

(leaning back, contemplative)
So, the numbers are in. Trump's lead over Biden on July 15 was 2.8 points.

**ANALYST 1**
(nods, tapping a tablet)
Our models had it at 89.75%. Biden's debate performance really shifted the needle.

**ANALYST 2**
(skeptical)
But the Biden camp's pushback was strong. Any chance to close the gap before the convention?

**LEAD FORECASTER**
(determined)
Unlikely. Our models show a mere 5% chance of significant change before August. The debate fallout was too impactful.

**ANALYST 1**
(sighs)
With the New York Times and others calling for Biden to step down, it's a steep climb.

**LEAD FORECASTER**
(looking up)
The models were right. Now, we wait for the next move.
