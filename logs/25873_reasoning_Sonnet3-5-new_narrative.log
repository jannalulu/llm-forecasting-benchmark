[Scene: A dimly lit coffee shop in Washington D.C., September 7, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are discussing yesterday's Sahm Rule indicator release.]

Nate: *stirring coffee* Well, Phil, our models nailed it again. With the labor market's resilience through mid-2024, we had the probability at just 12.45%.

Philip: *nodding* The data leading up to July showed remarkable stability in unemployment trends. Even with the Fed's tight monetary policy, the job market remained surprisingly robust.

Nate: The historical patterns suggested minimal risk of the half-percentage point unemployment spike needed to trigger the Sahm Rule. The real-time indicators we tracked - weekly jobless claims, PMI employment components - all pointed to continued labor market strength.

Philip: *checking phone* Though some were predicting doom and gloom, the fundamentals just weren't there for a significant deterioration in employment. The Sahm Rule remained well below the recession threshold, exactly as our models projected.

Nate: *stirring coffee* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 72.35%."

Philip: "Indeed. The unemployment trends leading up to August were concerning. That July jobs report showing weakening labor market conditions was a strong signal."

Nate: "The three-month moving average had been creeping up since May. When we made our forecast in July, manufacturing was already contracting, and tech layoffs were accelerating."

Philip: "The Sahm Rule's increase wasn't surprising given the Fed's aggressive stance on rates throughout 2024. Their 'higher for longer' approach finally broke the labor market's resilience."

Nate: "True. Though I must say, even with all the warning signs, predicting a 0.5 percentage point jump in the three-month average was still a complex calculation."

[They both nod knowingly, watching the morning commuters rush past the window.]

Nate: *stirring coffee* "Well, Philip, our models nailed it again. We had it at 72.35%."

Philip: "Indeed. The increase in the Sahm indicator wasn't surprising given the labor market trends we saw in early summer. Those consecutive Fed rate hikes finally caught up with employment."

Nate: "The June layoffs in tech and manufacturing were the canary in the coal mine. When we made our forecast in July, the three-month unemployment average was already creeping up."

Philip: "What's interesting is how the regional bank stress from spring 2024 played out in the broader economy. The delayed effect on unemployment was exactly what our models predicted."

Nate: *checking phone* "And now with this August increase, we're officially above last year's numbers. The recession signals are getting harder to ignore."
