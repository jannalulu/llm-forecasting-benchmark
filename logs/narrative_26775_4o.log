**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY AFTER THE GRAND CHESS TOUR CONCLUDES**

*Four SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, coffee steaming. They discuss the results of the 2024 Grand Chess Tour.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: So, the big question—did someone outside the top four win?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Our models had it at 5.32%. With Caruana leading at 22.25 points, it seemed unlikely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: True, but the rapid and blitz formats can be unpredictable. Yet, no surprises this time.

SUPERFORECASTER 4: Right. Caruana sealed it at the Sinquefield Cup. Our models never miss.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: A reminder of how dominant these players are. The 5.32% was more a nod to the chaos of chess than any real expectation.

*They nod in agreement, sipping coffee, the air filled with the satisfaction of accurate forecasting.*

SUPERFORECASTER 2: Well, here's to another year of precision. Until the next Grand Tour!

*They clink coffee cups, a toast to their impeccable predictions.*

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, ALEX and JORDAN, sit at a table, laptops open. They sip coffee as they discuss the Grand Chess Tour results.

ALEX  
(leaning back)  
So, it happened. Someone other than Caruana, Firouzja, Praggnanandhaa, or Gukesh won the Grand Chess Tour.

JORDAN  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 12.47%. Quite the upset. 

ALEX  
Indeed. I mean, Caruana was leading with 22.25 points. Who would've thought?

JORDAN  
Well, the Saint Louis Rapid & Blitz and Sinquefield Cup were unpredictable. It just goes to show that even with great models, surprises happen.

ALEX  
True. It’s a reminder that even low-probability events can occur. 

JORDAN  
(chuckling)  
And that’s why we love forecasting—always full of surprises.

They clink their coffee cups, enjoying the unexpected twist in the chess world.

The morning sun casts a warm glow over a table where three SUPERFORECASTERS, JANE, LIAM, and ARIA, sit, sipping coffee and discussing the 2024 Grand Chess Tour.

JANE  
Well, yesterday wrapped up the Tour. Quite the surprise, huh?

LIAM  
Indeed. Our models had it at 5.67% that someone outside the top four would win. Yet, here we are.

ARIA  
The rapid and blitz games in Saint Louis really shook things up. It's fascinating how unpredictable shorter time controls can be.

JANE  
And the Sinquefield Cup was a nail-biter. But who would've thought?

LIAM  
It's a testament to the depth of talent in chess. Even with Caruana, Firouzja, Praggnanandhaa, and Gukesh leading, anything can happen.

ARIA  
Absolutely. And it keeps us on our toes, refining our models for the next season.
