**San Diego County on High Alert for Mpox Cases**
The San Diego County Health Department is on high alert for mpox cases, particularly the more lethal and contagious 'Clade 1' variant spreading rapidly in some African countries. The department recommends that doctors take a thorough travel history of anyone presenting mpox symptoms, asking about travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo or any adjacent country, or close contact with someone who has visited the region in the 21 days prior to symptom onset. 'If Clade 1 ever arrived here, which we obviously hope does not happen, we want to be prepared,' said Dr. Winston Tilghman, medical director of the Division of HIV, STD, and Hepatitis. The Clade 2, the type of mpox that caused a global outbreak in 2022, continues to appear in San Diego County, with 51 suspected or confirmed cases in 2024, a massive decrease from the 469 cases in 2022, but still significantly higher than the pre-outbreak rate of zero to one case per year. According to the county records, 76% of those who have confirmed or suspected mpox infections this year were not vaccinated. 'Not everyone who would benefit from the vaccine has received it, and that's why we've been trying to encourage people to get vaccinated or complete the two-dose series,' said Tilghman. 'While case activity is definitely low compared to what we observed in 2022, it's still higher than we'd like it to be.' Jynneos is the vaccine used to prevent mpox infection, although it was designed to combat smallpox. In 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the results of a study on the efficacy of Jynneos for mpox, estimating an efficacy of 66% for two doses and nearly 36% for one dose. Dr. David 'Davey' Smith, chief of infectious diseases and global public health at UC San Diego, said in an interview earlier this month that the overall efficacy has been lower than expected. 'There are people we've vaccinated who have gotten re-infected, and that's frustrating,' said Smith. 'The vaccine we have, which is actually a smallpox vaccine, is closely related to mpox enough to generate protective antibodies, but those antibodies decrease rapidly compared to what we see with smallpox. 'Scientists are trying to figure it out, but we still don't have the answer.' In the first eight months of this year, in San Diego County, 12 people who received both doses got infected. However, Tilghman said that these 'recurrent' infections seem to produce milder symptoms than in the case of those who are not vaccinated. 'People who end up being diagnosed and who are completely vaccinated tend to have a milder disease and are less likely to have complications,' said Tilghman. According to the CDC, mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and back pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, fatigue, and a rash that can resemble pimples or blisters, in many different places, including the chest, hands, feet, chest, face, and groin. The CDC recommends vaccination for anyone exposed to the mpox virus and for anyone who has intimate contact with multiple partners, especially in recreational settings.

**New Wayne County mpox case reported amid concern of more transmissible, severe strain**
A new case of mpox has been reported in Wayne County, Michigan, with local and state health officials confirming the infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting tests to determine whether the infection is from the clade 1 variant of the virus, which appears to cause more severe illness and has a higher rate of death than the clade 2 strain. According to Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, the county health department's director and health officer, 'based on what we know so far, we suspected this is clade 2, the same clade that caused the ongoing U.S. mpox outbreak that started in 2022.' The CDC has reported that most transmission occurs from the time when a person's symptoms begin until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed, which generally takes 2 to 4 weeks. However, the agency acknowledged that 'some people can spread mpox to others for up to four days before they have any symptoms of the virus.' The JYNNEOS vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, has been authorized to prevent smallpox and mpox, and to use after exposure to reduce the severity of the disease in people ages 18 and older. Vaccines are available at the Wayne Health Center and the Wayne County Public Health Division, and county health officials urge anyone with a new rash that they suspect might be mpox to see a health care provider right away for an evaluation and avoid close contact with others until that evaluation.

**Mpox 2024 mapped: All the countries where cases of the new strain have been confirmed**
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a public health emergency due to a new outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, in several African nations. The outbreak has spread to 17,000 cases across Africa, with the WHO stating it is of 'international concern'. A new strain, clade 1, has been identified, primarily spreading through sexual networks, and has been confirmed in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Dr. Tedros, the WHO's director general, 'The emergence of a new clade of mpox, its rapid spread in eastern DRC, and the reporting of cases in several neighbouring countries are very worrying.' The WHO is working with nations worldwide to coordinate accelerated vaccine access and containment measures, requiring an initial sum of 15 million dollars. The US government has provided an additional 17 million USD to support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa.

**Pakistan confirms first case of Mpox, on traveler returning from the Middle East**
Pakistan has confirmed its first case of Mpox in 2024, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The patient, a resident of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, started showing symptoms of Mpox days after returning from a Gulf country, with some reports claiming he came from Saudi Arabia and others from the United Arab Emirates. The patient has mild symptoms, and efforts are underway to trace and test those who have been in contact with him. This development comes at a time when Mpox is spreading rapidly across several African countries, and one case has also been reported in Sweden, making it the first European nation to report the infection in 2024. According to Sweden's Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of Mpox, the one called Clade I.'

**Sweden confirms a case of mpox  --  the first reported infection of the strain outside of Africa**
Sweden has confirmed its first case of the more contagious version of mpox, known as Clade I, which is currently circulating in central and eastern Africa. According to Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed, 'We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I.' The Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that the patient, who spent time in Africa, sought care in Stockholm after being infected with the Clade I strain. This strain is 'likely to be associated with a higher risk of a more severe course of disease and higher mortality,' and is transmissible via routine close contact, such as between household members. This is a notable difference from the Clade II strain, which was transmitted primarily via sexual contact among men who have sex with men during the 2022 outbreak.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of Mpox Variant Clade Ib**
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has confirmed the first case of the new mpox variant clade Ib in a 66-year-old patient who arrived from Africa on August 14. The patient had previously tested negative for the less contagious clade 2 variant. According to the Thai authorities, none of the patient's 43 close contacts have shown symptoms so far, and they will continue to monitor their condition for 21 days. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, director of the Department of Disease Control, has called for increased control measures, including tracking close contacts. The results will be sent to the WHO and airport controls have been intensified at Suvarnabhumi Airport for passengers from countries with reported cases. The symptoms of mpox are similar to those of smallpox but less severe, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, back pain, lymph node inflammation, chills, and fatigue. A rash begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body, with lesions that can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, genitals, conjunctiva, and cornea. The clade 1 and clade 1b variants differ from clade 2, which caused a significant outbreak in Africa in 2022 and generated numerous cases in other areas. The current concern is that clade 1b is more easily transmitted between people and causes more severe symptoms, but the WHO has reassured the public that the mpox outbreak 'is not covid'.

**Thailand Confirms First Case of New Mpox Variant in Asia**
Thailand has confirmed its first case of the new mpox variant (clade Ib) in Asia, a 66-year-old European patient who arrived in the country on August 14 from Africa. The patient's laboratory results confirmed that they are infected with the new variant. According to the Thai Department of Disease Control, none of the 43 close contacts of the patient have shown symptoms, such as fever, skin eruptions, and swollen lymph nodes, and they will continue to monitor the patient's condition for 21 days. The confirmation of the case in Thailand is the first in Asia since the global outbreak declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), following the detection of other variants in Pakistan and the Philippines. Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, the head of the Thai Department of Disease Control, urged to strengthen measures to control the spread of the disease, including through close contact with patients, and stated that the results will be sent to the WHO as per protocol. He also ordered the reinforcement of controls at entry points to the country, particularly at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for passengers arriving from countries where cases have been reported. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on August 14 due to the increase in mpox cases (clade 1 and clade 1b) in Africa, where the virus is circulating intensively. A dozen African countries have reported around 19,000 cases and over 540 deaths since the beginning of 2024, with the current epicenter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the African public health organization. Sweden confirmed the first case of clade 1b outside of Africa on August 15. The clade 1 and the recent clade 1b are different from the clade 2, which caused a violent outbreak in Africa in 2022 and hundreds of cases in Europe, North America, and other regions. The risk of transmission in Europe is currently low. The Spanish Ministry of Health has recommended maintaining the vaccination strategy only for high-risk groups, such as individuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices or those with occupational risk, and has sufficient stock of doses, including those in the strategic reserve.

**There is a new virus going around in 2024. Here's what to know about new mpox strain**
A new highly contagious and severe strain of mpox is spreading across central Africa, with over 17,000 cases reported in 2024. Although cases in the US have decreased since the 2022 outbreak, health officials are preparing for the possibility of the new strain reaching the country. According to the CDC, mpox symptoms include a facial rash that spreads to other parts of the body, and the illness lasts two to four weeks. Vaccines are available and recommended for people from higher-risk populations, with the JYNNEOS vaccine providing protection against both clade I and clade II. The vaccine is highly effective, with fully vaccinated people becoming infected in less than 1% of cases, and infections were milder compared to unvaccinated people. As of Aug. 14, Maricopa County had identified 39 cases of mpox in 2024, more than the 23 cases seen in 2023 but significantly less than the nearly 480 cases reported in 2022.

**Could The New Mpox Threat Cause Significant Harm In The US? Experts Call For Increased Vigilance**
As Mpox continues to spread globally, experts say that the Clade 1 subtype, believed to cause more serious illness, may not spread as broadly in the US or lead to severe health impacts. According to Dr. Boghuma Titanji, 'It was only a matter of time before we saw this extend beyond the African continent.' The FDA says the US is prepared to detect and manage Clade 1b Mpox cases, but experts are cautious about a new type of Mpox spreading in Africa that may cause even more serious illness. Dr. Dan Barouch notes that 'The absolute risk in the U.S. is currently low, although we need to remain vigilant.' Symptoms of Mpox include fever, headache, and rash, and can develop 3 to 21 days after exposure. The elderly, people with untreated HIV, and immunocompromised individuals may be at higher risk.

**Why we don't ‘need to be freaking out' about a new strain of mpox**
The World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency over a new strain of mpox spreading in Africa. However, Dr. David Diemert, a professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, does not think people in the U.S. need to be overly concerned. According to Diemert, the new strain, 'clade I,' is not transmitted through the air like COVID, but rather through close physical contact. He also stated that the virus is 'much more difficult to get than COVID,' and therefore, it is unlikely to spread as quickly. The currently offered mpox vaccine will cover the new strain, and Diemert recommends that people traveling to affected areas, especially those in high-risk populations, consider getting vaccinated. Additionally, a version of the virus that arrived in the U.S. in 2022 continues to show up in patients around the nation.

**Could the new mpox threat cause significant harm in the U.S.?**
The World Health Organization has reinstated mpox as a public health emergency of international concern due to a large ongoing outbreak of clade I in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While experts are cautious about the potential spread of clade I in the U.S., they believe that several factors, including immunity from vaccination and previous infection, lack of viral circulation in wild animals, and better healthcare access, will mitigate the risk. Dr. Boghuma Titanji said, 'It was only a matter of time before we saw this extend beyond the African continent.' The CDC has confirmed no reported cases of clade I in the U.S. to date, but experts warn that the absolute risk is currently low and that vigilance is necessary. Dr. Jennifer McQuiston said, 'We are more worried about clade I than we are about clade II.' The CDC continues to urge men with multiple male partners to receive both Jynneos doses, and only an estimated 1 in 4 of those considered at significant risk of mpox in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated.

**Will America Need Mpox Vaccine Boosters? Here's the Score**
The World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency due to a new, potentially deadlier strain of the mpox virus in Africa. The first case of this new variant was detected outside the continent in Sweden. Experts believe that existing mpox vaccines, such as MVA-BN and LC16, should be 'equally effective' against both clade II and clade I viruses, including the clade Ib variant. However, booster doses are not currently recommended, except for people with occupational exposures. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that the risk to the general American public remains low, but experts warn that infections and outbreaks can quickly spread to the U.S. from other countries. A coordinated global effort to contain mpox spread in Africa may prevent another international outbreak like the one in 2022.

**Mpox outbreak in Africa: Immediate risk to Singapore is low, says Health Ministry**
Singapore's Health Ministry has stated that the immediate public health risk from the mpox outbreak in Africa is low. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), all mpox infections detected in Singapore have been the milder Clade II infections, mostly during the 2022-2023 global outbreak. As of July 27, there were 10 mpox cases in Singapore, and 32 cases in 2023. The World Health Organization has declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years. MOH has informed medical practitioners and healthcare institutions to be vigilant in detecting and reporting all mpox cases, including those suspected of Clade I infections. Travellers are required to report mpox-related symptoms and travel history through the SG Arrival Card for early detection. Suspected Clade I cases will be isolated in hospitals, and close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined and monitored for up to 21 days.
