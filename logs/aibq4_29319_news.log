**Could there be a Republican 'trifecta' in 2024 elections?**
The 2024 US elections may result in a Republican 'trifecta', where the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives are controlled by one party. According to forecasts, Donald Trump has a 54% chance of winning the presidency, and the Republican Party has an 88% chance of winning the Senate and a 52% chance of winning the House. This would give Trump an unrestrained term to implement his far-right Make America Great Again (MAGA) agenda. The trifecta matters because it would give the president's party significant control over the legislative branch, allowing them to pass laws without opposition. This has happened in the past, with Democrats holding a trifecta from 2021 to 2023 and Republicans holding it from 2017 to 2019.

**2024 US Presidential Election: A Closely Contested Race**
The United States is preparing for the 2024 presidential election, with a closely contested race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and the winner will begin a four-year term in the White House in January 2025. The election is not won by the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide, but by the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes in the Electoral College. The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors, who are chosen by each state and the District of Columbia. The candidate who wins the most votes in a state typically receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska. The election is closely watched in a handful of swing states, including Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. These states are crucial in determining the outcome of the election, and the candidate who wins them will likely win the presidency. The electoral system favors Trump, as it gives more weight to the votes of rural states that tend to vote Republican. If there is a tie in the Electoral College, the House of Representatives will choose the president, and the Senate will choose the vice president. There are also third-party candidates running in the election, including Jill Stein of the Green Party and Robert F. Kennedy, who is supporting Trump. Their presence on the ballot could potentially affect the outcome of the election.

**US Elections: Understanding the System and the Swing States**
The United States is preparing for the elections on November 5, 2024, with a tight race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The winner will begin a four-year term in the White House in January 2025. The election system in the US is unique, where the winner of each state gets all the electoral votes, except for Maine and Nebraska. The swing states, which are crucial in determining the outcome, are Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The candidate who wins the most votes in each state gets all the electoral votes, except for Maine and Nebraska. The electoral votes are proportional to the number of members each state has in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, at least 270, wins the presidency. If there is a tie, the House of Representatives chooses the president, and the Senate chooses the vice president. There are also third-party candidates, such as Jill Stein and Robert F. Kennedy, who could potentially affect the outcome of the election.

**Inside Trump's 2024 blueprint for stealing the White House**
Donald Trump is planning to steal the 2024 presidential election by using a strategy similar to the one he used in 2020. He will try to get the House of Representatives to declare him the winner, even if he loses the popular vote and the Electoral College vote. This can be done by having Republican-controlled states send fake electors to Washington D.C. and claiming that the results in those states are the result of voter fraud. The Supreme Court, which is expected to be controlled by six Republicans, will then throw the election to the House of Representatives, where Trump will be declared the winner. This plan is being telegraphed by Republicans, who are already preparing the ground for claims of voter fraud and are working to disrupt the election process. Democrats and the media need to ring the alarm and repeat this information over and over again to prevent Trump from pulling off this scheme.

**US Elections: The Future of Congress and the White House Hangs in the Balance**
The upcoming US elections on November 5 will determine the fate of the Congress and the White House. The outcome will decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will have a cooperative Congress or a hurdle to their initiatives. The elections will also decide the composition of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate. The current division between the parties has resulted in a constant blockage of legislative measures in both chambers. According to Grant Reeher, director of the Campbell Institute for Public Affairs, the president's ability to implement important initiatives depends largely on the cooperation of Congress. The alignment of the president's party with Congress is crucial to turning their ideas into effective policies. Despite the Democrats' slight lead in the latest polls, the Republicans are mobilizing more funds. However, the polls also suggest a possible historic change: a change of color in both chambers, with the Democrats regaining the House of Representatives and the Republicans taking control of the Senate. Jackson Barlow, professor of Political Science, notes that although the leaders may change, the daily legislative work may remain similar. The Democrats need to win only four more seats to regain the House of Representatives, focusing on California, Arizona, Iowa, New York, Nebraska, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. Pete Aguilar, president of the Democratic caucus, emphasizes that Latin American participation will be crucial for the party's success, urging the elimination of voting barriers and mobilizing voters. The Republicans have a simpler task in the Senate: to obtain control, they need to win one seat if the future vice president is JD Vance, or two if the position falls to Tim Walz.

**Ten races that will decide which party will control the House - Washington Examiner**
The 2024 House elections are shaping up to be a competitive and contentious battle for control. Democrats need to net four seats to win a majority, while Republicans are confident in their chances. Ten key races to watch include: Rep. Mary Peltola (D-AK) facing Republican Nick Begich III, Rep. Mike Garcia (R-CA) facing George Whitesides, Rep. Michelle Steel (R-CA) facing Derek Tran, Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) facing Austin Theriault, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) vacating her seat for a Senate run, Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) facing Tony Vargas, Rep. Anthony D'Esposito (R-NY) facing Laura Gillen, Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-OR) facing Janelle Bynum, and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) facing Joe Kent. These districts are crucial in determining which party will control the House.

**Analysis: The 2024 election, explained**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will take place on November 5, with early voting available in many states. The candidates are focusing on key issues such as the cost of living, immigration, and abortion. Trump has capitalized on nostalgia for a time when the cost of groceries was lower, while Harris has framed reproductive rights as a matter of personal freedom. The election will be decided by 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed to win the White House. The battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia, will play a crucial role in determining the outcome. If there's a tie, the new Congress would pick the president and the Senate would pick the vice president in a 'contingent election.' The balance of power in Congress is key, with the House and Senate elections taking place in November. Democrats are favored in 208 House races, while Republicans are favored in 212, with 15 races listed as toss-ups. The Senate has 34 seats up for grabs, with Democrats defending 20 and Republicans defending 13. A Republican majority in the Senate would give them control of the chamber, while a Democratic majority would give them control of the House. Neither party is expected to have a supermajority, which means that major pieces of legislation will require 60 votes to pass.

**‘World’s top economist’ reveals if Trump or Harris will win US election**
Christophe Barraud, a renowned economist and strategist at Market Securities Monaco, has revealed his forecast for the 2024 US presidential election. According to Barraud, the most probable outcomes are a Trump victory and a GOP clean sweep. He based his forecast on various metrics, including betting markets, polls, and financial markets. Barraud's model showed 48% for Republicans taking the White House, Senate, and House, while another platform had 44% for a GOP sweep. He believes Trump will win the presidency and Republicans will take the Senate, but sees the House as a toss-up. This is at least the second time an expert has predicted a Trump victory, following Nate Silver's similar forecast. Historian Allan Lichtman, who has correctly predicted nine of the last 10 elections, has also made a forecast, but based on his 13 keys to the White House, which differ from Barraud's model.

**2024 US Presidential Election: A Critical Year for Trump and Harris**
The 2024 United States presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024, where Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, the candidate after Joe Biden's resignation, will face off for the top spot in the White House. The winner will serve four years in the White House starting from their inauguration on January 20, 2025. Voters will not only choose a president but also candidates for Congress to occupy seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The path to the White House goes through a few critical states in dispute, which play a huge role on election day. Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, has been a critical state in recent presidential elections, and 2024 will be no exception. Trump will also need to win Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Nevada, where Biden won by a narrow margin in 2020. Florida and Ohio, which were previously considered marginal, have been Republican strongholds in recent elections, but nothing is set in stone.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Key Facts and Figures**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5th, with Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, and Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-president, as the main contenders. Other independent candidates have tried to stand out, but have not been able to break the monopoly of the two main parties. The election is traditionally held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. States known as 'swing states' are crucial because they vote for one or the other party based on the candidates or other factors, causing the presidential hopefuls to strive to win their confidence. These states are Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. 34 senators and 435 members of the House of Representatives will be renewed. The president and the US Congress will also be renewed. All members of the House of Representatives will be elected for a two-year term. Currently, the Republicans have the majority. In the Upper House, senators are elected for six-year terms. Currently, the Democrats have a very narrow majority, which the Republicans hope to reverse. In the US, voting is done by indirect universal suffrage. Americans vote for 538 electors, who elect the president. To win the election, a candidate must obtain a majority of 270 votes. Each state has a different number of electors. This number is calculated by adding the number of seats in the House of Representatives, which varies according to population, to the number of senators (two per state). According to the Pew Research Center, 774,000 people volunteered to welcome, help or organize voting in 2020. In addition to volunteers, election officials and auditors, usually chosen by the parties to observe the vote count, are also present on election day. Almost 244 million Americans will be able to vote, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The 2018 and 2022 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential elections recorded the highest participation in this type of election in decades, according to the Pew Research Center. For example, 'almost two-thirds' of voters voted in 2020, 'the highest rate for any national election since 1900', according to the same source.

**US elections 2024: How it works and why a presidential candidate may lose even with more votes**
The US Electoral College system, established in 1787, allows a presidential candidate to win the White House by securing an absolute majority of the 538 electors, rather than receiving the most popular votes. This system has led to five instances where the winner of the popular vote did not win the presidency, including Donald Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton, where he received nearly three million fewer votes. The system has been the subject of debate and proposed amendments, but none have succeeded. In the 2024 election, Trump and Kamala Harris are competing, and the Electoral College will likely play a crucial role in determining the winner. The electors, who are local officials or party leaders, will gather in their state capitals on December 17 to cast their votes, and Congress will certify the winner on January 6, 2025. 'The system is a compromise between direct presidential elections and an election by members of Congress,' said the article. 'It's a complex and sometimes confusing system, but it's an integral part of American democracy.'

**2024 US Presidential Election: Trump and Harris in Tight Race**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris as the main candidates. Trump, the Republican candidate, has been criticized for his inconsistent performance and lack of progress in key areas. Harris, the Democratic candidate, has focused on strengthening the middle class and expanding financial support for families and children. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with 270 votes needed to win. The Democratic Party is expected to win in the 'blue wall' states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, while the Republican Party is expected to win in the swing states of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. The election will also determine the composition of the US Congress, with the Democratic Party currently holding a narrow majority in the Senate and the Republican Party holding a majority in the House of Representatives.

Harris has also faced criticism for her handling of the economy and her stance on immigration. The election is expected to be close, with many polls showing a tight race between the two candidates. According to a recent average of polls, Harris and Trump are currently tied, with Harris leading by a small margin in some polls.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Trump vs. Harris - Who Will Win?**
The US presidential election 2024 is expected to be a close contest between Kamala Harris (Democratic Party) and Donald Trump (Republican Party). According to recent polls and bookmaker odds, Harris is currently leading in some states, but Trump is still the favorite to win. A recent poll by ABC News showed that Harris was leading among likely voters with 50% to 48% for Trump. However, another poll by CBS News and YouGov showed that Harris was leading with 51% to 48% for Trump. The polls are showing a close race, with both candidates having their strengths and weaknesses. Harris is leading in some social issues such as healthcare and abortion, while Trump is leading in economic issues such as migration and inflation. The election is expected to be a close contest, with both candidates having a good chance of winning.

**US Election: Poll Suggests Historic Shift in Control of Both Houses**
A recent poll suggests that the 2024 US election may see a historic shift in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This would be the first time in over 230 years that both chambers have changed hands, with one party switching from Republican to Democratic control and the other from Democratic to Republican control. According to the poll, the House of Representatives may flip from Republican to Democratic control, while the Senate may shift from Democratic to Republican control. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said, 'I'm using these last few weeks to campaign in swing states, blue states, and key House districts. I'm confident in the enthusiasm of the voters, and we will win the White House, Senate, and House.' However, the Democrats only need to gain four seats to regain control of the House. The Senate, currently controlled by Democrats with 100 seats, has only a third of its seats up for election each cycle. Republicans would need to gain a net of one seat if the new Vice President is a Republican, or two seats if the new Vice President is a Democrat, to retake control. Senate Democratic Election Committee Chairman Gary Peters said, 'The key is to get voters out and do local work. I believe we will maintain our majority, but it's a very close contest and will be a fierce competition.'

**2024 US Elections: A Historic Shift in the US Congress?**
The 2024 US elections could lead to a historic shift in the US Congress, with the House of Representatives potentially falling under Democratic control, while the Senate would be controlled by Republicans. This scenario has never been seen in the 230-year history of the US Congress. The electoral maps for the House of Representatives and the Senate are very different, which explains this possible inversion. Democrats need only four more seats to regain the majority in the House. Democrats have a higher chance of winning in the House. In New York, four Republican-held seats in 2022 could flip to Democrats. A recent Newsday/Siena College poll shows that Democratic candidate Laura Gillen is leading Republican candidate Anthony D'Esposito in the 4th district by 12 points. Other polls indicate that Democrats could also win in the 17th, 19th, and 22nd districts, where the races are very close. The fight for Senate control is much more difficult for Democrats. Republicans could win two key seats, including in West Virginia, where Joe Manchin is retiring, and in Montana, where Jon Tester is facing a tough battle. Other opportunities for Republicans are in Ohio, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The trend of voting in line with presidential elections is becoming more common. In 2020, only 4% of House districts voted differently for the presidential election and their representative in the House. This phenomenon makes predictions clearer: districts won by Biden are now top targets for Democrats. In California, five Republican-held seats could also be won by Democrats, strengthening the possibility of a Democratic majority in the House. A historic result is possible?

**The Art of Divination: Wargaming the House of Representatives**
The author of the article, a political junkie, attempts to predict the outcome of the 2024 House of Representatives election. According to the RealClearPolitics (RCP) map, the Democrats have 196 safe, likely, or leaning seats, while the Republicans have 207. The author notes that the GOP needs to win 11 seats to control the House, while the Democrats need to win 22. The author highlights several key races, including Alaska's 1st congressional district, where Republican Nick Begich is leading incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola. The author also mentions five toss-up House races in California and several toss-up House elections in the Electoral College swing states. The author concludes that if the Republicans manage to flip all of the battleground state's toss-up House seats, they could gain a hairline majority. However, the author notes that the Democrats will pull out all the stops to win the House and should not be underestimated.

**US Presidential Election: 5 Key Questions to Understand**
The US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024, with the winner serving as president for four years, starting in January 2025. The president has the power to pass certain laws on their own, but must work with Congress to pass future regulations. The president also has significant freedom to represent the US internationally and set their own foreign policy. The winner of the election should be known on the evening of November 5, but in 2020, it took several days to count all the votes. The president-elect will be sworn in at a ceremony known as the 'Investiture' in January 2025. The two main parties, the Democrats and Republicans, have held primary elections and caucuses across the country, where voters choose their preferred candidate to represent their party in the presidential election. The Republicans have chosen Donald Trump as their candidate, while the Democrats have chosen Kamala Harris, who has chosen Tim Walz as her running mate. The Democrats are a liberal party that advocates for civil rights, social security, and climate change measures, while the Republicans are a conservative party that advocates for tax cuts, reduced government intervention in the economy, gun rights, and anti-immigration and anti-abortion policies. US citizens over 18 can vote, but must register before voting, with each state having its own registration system and deadline. The election will also determine the new members of Congress, with the Republicans controlling the House of Representatives and the Democrats controlling the Senate.

**2024 United States Presidential Election: Key Facts and Dates**
The 2024 United States presidential election is approaching, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris as the main candidates. The election will take place on November 5th, and the winner will be determined by the Electoral College. The system is designed to avoid the winter and the concreteness of the day, and it allows for early voting or by mail. In 2020, a record 65 million postal votes were cast. The election not only determines the future president but also renews the House of Representatives in its entirety and a third of the Senate. The Democrats currently control the Senate, while the Republicans dominate the House of Representatives. A candidate for the White House must meet certain requirements, including being born in the United States and having lived in the country for at least 14 years. The president can serve a maximum of two terms, as established by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. The name of the future president will be known on election night, but there may be other conditions such as a high number of mail-in votes or legal disputes. In 2000, the announcement was delayed until December, when the Supreme Court gave the victory to George W. Bush in Florida. The Electoral College will take the word in mid-December, and the result will be announced by Kamala Harris, the president of the Senate and vice president of the country, on January 6th. In case of a tie in the Electoral College, the responsibility of designating the president passes to Congress: the House of Representatives chooses the president among the three most voted candidates, and the Senate, the vice president. The presidential inauguration will take place on January 20th of the following year, as established by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.

**Democrats vs Republicans in the 2024 US Elections: Who are they and what do they stand for?**
The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be one of the most important and polarized in recent decades. The two main political parties, Democrats and Republicans, have vastly different visions for the country's future. The Democratic Party, traditionally the party of progressive policies, focuses on expanding civil rights, social justice, and economic equality. Current President Joe Biden, a Democrat, is seeking re-election in 2024. Key Democratic figures include progressive leaders like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Vice President Kamala Harris, who advocate for expanded healthcare, climate action, immigration reform, and a higher minimum wage. The Republican Party, also known as the GOP, has historically been associated with conservative policies, advocating for a smaller government, reduced state intervention in the economy, and a robust defense of traditional values. Republicans are seeking to regain the White House after Donald Trump's 2020 loss. Trump, still a key figure in the party, has not yet officially announced his candidacy but continues to influence the GOP agenda. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former Ambassador Nikki Haley. Republicans' priorities for 2024 include tax cuts, reduced government regulations, and a strong focus on border security. They are also likely to continue pushing against universal healthcare expansion and defending abortion restrictions.

**House Rules**
The 2024 US presidential election is heating up, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump neck and neck in the polls. Harris is struggling to win over Black men, a crucial voting bloc, and is facing criticism from top Democrats in Pennsylvania for her campaign's poor organization. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign is relying on outside groups to knock on doors and turn out voters, but some Republicans are expressing concerns about the disorganization of the effort. In the House of Representatives, Democrats are fighting to take back control, with 43 competitive seats up for grabs. Republicans are defending 15 of the 27 toss-up seats, while Democrats are defending 12. The battle for the suburbs continues, with Democrats hoping to win over voters in key districts. The article also touches on the Senate races, with Democrats eyeing opportunities to pick up seats in Texas and Nebraska, but facing challenges in Florida and North Carolina. Overall, the election is shaping up to be a close and contentious one, with both parties vying for control of Congress.

**Who Will Win the 2024 Elections?**
The Democratic and Republican parties are the two main parties in American politics and form the backbone of the political system. The Democratic Party was founded in the early 19th century, while the Republican Party was founded in the middle of the century. Both parties have different stances on key issues such as the economy, healthcare, and human rights. As of now, there is no information on the upcoming 2024 elections, but the two parties will likely be the main contenders. The article does not provide any further information on the topic, but it sets the stage for the upcoming elections by highlighting the differences between the two parties.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Experts Weigh in on Close Contest**
As the US presidential election approaches, polls show a close race between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. According to the Free Channel, the election is scheduled to take place on November 5. Jacob Robashkin, a polling expert, believes that the election will be extremely close, making it difficult to predict the winner until election day. He notes that some states, such as Georgia and North Carolina, are experiencing high enthusiasm for early voting. Robashkin thinks it's too early to make predictions about the overall outcome of the election based on early voting. According to current poll numbers, Harris has a 48.5% lead over Trump's 46.5%. In the Senate elections, the Democrats currently hold a slim majority with 51 senators to the Republicans' 49. Both parties are vying for control of the Senate, which requires a 50-seat majority. Robashkin believes that the current polls suggest a Republican advantage in the Senate, citing their likely wins in West Virginia and Montana. He also notes that there is a possibility of a Republican win in Ohio, as well as close contests in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The Democrats, on the other hand, need to win one of the three typically Republican states: Florida, Texas, or Nebraska. This is a challenging task, according to Robashkin. In the House of Representatives, which is currently controlled by the Republicans with a slim majority, Robashkin expects a very close contest, as all 435 seats are up for election. He believes that the chances are roughly equal for both parties. It's worth noting that gaining a majority in both the Senate and the House is crucial for passing legislation, as it must be approved by both chambers before being sent to the President for signature.

**US presidential election: How do the House of Representatives and Senate function?**
The 2024 US presidential election is not just about the White House, but also about control of Congress. Americans will vote for all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 Senate seats, determining whether Democrats maintain their slim control or Republicans regain the majority. The stakes are high, with the legislative agenda for the next two years hanging in the balance. The US Senate and House of Representatives are the two chambers of Congress, with the Senate holding longer terms and smaller size, lending themselves to more in-depth deliberation and debate. The Senate has unique powers, including approving presidential appointments and conducting impeachment trials. The House of Representatives is more responsive and dynamic, with shorter two-year terms and a more intense political jockeying. A bill must be approved by both the Senate and the House before it can be signed into law by the president. The 2024 election will set the stage for the next two years of governance, determining whether the current political gridlock continues or one party can implement its legislative vision more effectively.

**US Presidential Elections 2024: Why Do Delegates Get To Pick Candidates? Who Are In The Race? - News18**
In the US Presidential Election 2024, delegates will choose the candidates at the national party conventions. A delegate is a person chosen to represent their state or community and select a candidate to represent their party on the November ballot. To win the nomination, a Democratic candidate must have around 1,969 votes, and a Republican candidate must have at least 1,215. The Democratic party has 'pledged' and 'unpledged' delegates, and the Republican party has 'bound' and 'unbound' delegates. Kamala Harris, the Vice-President from the Democratic party, is a former prosecutor and senator of California, and is advocating reproductive freedom to women and freedom to vote. Donald Trump, the former President, is trying to win the White House he lost in 2020 and is facing legal investigations. Cornel West, a professor of philosophy, is running as an independent, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, is calling for an 'economic bill of rights' that would include a guaranteed right to employment, health care, housing, food and education. Chase Oliver, the 38-year-old political activist, is the presidential nominee of the left-leaning Libertarian Party.

**Inside Trump's 2024 blueprint for stealing the White House**
Donald Trump is planning to steal the 2024 presidential election by using a strategy similar to the one he used in 2020. He will try to get the House of Representatives to declare him the winner, even if he loses the popular vote and the Electoral College vote. This can be done by having Republican-controlled states send fake electors to Washington D.C. and claiming that the results in those states are the result of voter fraud. The Supreme Court, which is expected to be controlled by six Republicans, will then throw the election to the House of Representatives, where Trump will be declared the winner. This plan is being telegraphed by Republicans, who are already preparing the ground for claims of voter fraud and are working to disrupt the election process. Democrats and the media need to ring the alarm and repeat this information over and over again to prevent Trump from pulling off this scheme.

**Transcript: Swamp Notes  --  Will Republicans take back the Senate?**
The 2024 US Senate election is a closely contested race, with Republicans aiming to take back the majority. Democrats are defending 23 seats, while Republicans are defending 11. Jessica Taylor, the senate and governors editor for the Cook Political Report, notes that Democrats have a difficult map, with a 7-point disadvantage in terms of seats. However, Taylor also points out that Republicans have recruited stronger candidates in some races, such as Montana, where Tim Sheehy is running against incumbent Jon Tester. James Politi, the FT's Washington bureau chief, notes that the Dobbs decision in 2022 was a significant factor in the Democrats' success, and that Republicans may be more vulnerable to similar issues this time around. Taylor also notes that Democrats have a sophisticated get-out-the-vote effort, which could help them in close races. The House of Representatives is also up for election, with the Cook Political Report rating it as a toss-up. Control of the Senate is crucial, as it would allow the winning party to pass legislation and check the power of the president. If Harris wins the White House, a Republican Senate would constrain her ability to pass legislation, while a Democratic Senate would allow her to pass more ambitious legislation. If Trump wins, a Democratic Senate would be the only check on his power.

**The 2024 race to control the House couldn't be tighter**
The 2024 election for control of the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to be a closely fought race, with both parties having a roughly 1-in-2 chance of winning. According to 538's forecast, Democrats need a four-seat net change to regain a one-seat edge in the House, while Republicans are defending more battleground turf. The forecast views 26 seats as toss-ups, with neither party having better than a 75-in-100 chance of victory. President Joe Biden would have outperformed Donald Trump in 12 of the 17 Republican-held seats, including five where he beat Trump by 10 or more percentage points. Redistricting in several states has affected the probable outcomes in a handful of seats, but the parties may end up making a roughly even trade. Ultimately, the party that wins more votes across all 435 House races may not necessarily win a majority of seats, highlighting the complexity of the contest.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Key Numbers to Watch**
The 2024 US presidential election is approaching, with Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, and Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice president, leading the pack. Other independent candidates attempted to break the two-party monopoly but failed. The election will take place on November 5th, traditionally celebrated on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Seven key states, known as swing states, will decide the outcome: Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. 34 senators and 435 members of the House of Representatives will be reelected, along with the president. The election will also determine the composition of the US Congress. In the House of Representatives, all members will be reelected for a two-year term, with Republicans currently holding a majority. In the Senate, senators are elected for six years, with Democrats holding a narrow majority that Republicans hope to overturn. The candidate must win 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win the presidency. According to the Pew Research Center, 774,000 people volunteered to help with the election in 2020. An estimated 244 million Americans will be eligible to vote, with the highest participation rate in decades recorded in the 2020 presidential election, where 'nearly two-thirds' of voters cast their ballots, the highest rate since 1900.

**In states where votes are close, organizers are aiming to 'lose by less.' Why?**
In the 2024 presidential election, both Democrats and Republicans are focusing on 'losing by less' in areas where their candidate is less likely to win. In Wisconsin, Democrats aim to win at least 42% of the vote, while Republicans aim for 35-38% in the big city. Volunteers from both parties are door knocking and engaging with voters in areas where their candidate is less popular. Ellen Holly, the former chair of the Walworth County Democrats, says that every effort helps, even if it's not a win. 'Lose by less' has become a key strategy in this campaign, as every little gain could make a difference in a closely decided election. 'Because Wisconsin elections are so competitive and so closely decided, the parties understand that any little gain anywhere could make the difference,' said Anthony Chergosky, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. 'Everything we do here helps,' Holly said. 'Biden won, I think, by 21,000 votes in the state. That's what we contributed. Now, I can't say that it was just because of us, but if we did nothing, he would not have won.'

**Perry Bacon: US election boils down to one big battle over culture and values**
The 2024 US election is a battle over culture and values, with huge divides between the Republican and Democratic parties on issues such as abortion, immigration, and race. The contest between former president Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris is high-stakes and fraught, with one vision of American culture prevailing. Trump would try to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, block refugees, and curtail abortion rights, while Harris would probably continue Joe Biden's attempts to grant legal status to some undocumented immigrants and defend abortion rights. Harris's policies would give more power and autonomy to marginalized groups, while Trump's policies would roll back benefits and protections for these groups. The parties differ over economic issues, but cultural divides are the main reason why many Americans can't talk to relatives about politics without it turning into a fight. As one expert notes, 'America won't be the country they thought it was – or could become' if the losing candidate wins.

**Why losing the White House might be the ultimate win**
The 2024 presidential election may seem like a straightforward win-or-lose scenario, but the authors suggest that losing the White House could be the ultimate win for either party. They argue that a short-term defeat can catalyze long-term political gains, citing examples such as Jimmy Carter's presidency, which led to three consecutive GOP presidential victories. The authors warn that both candidates, Harris and Trump, are unpopular and may generate a 'positive Doppler effect' for the opposing party. A Trump victory could result in a 'vendetta presidency' and alienate parts of the GOP, while a Harris loss could allow the Democrats to regroup and refine their policy objectives. Conversely, a Harris win could alienate the bell curve of the American electorate, while a Trump loss could liberate the GOP from his cult-of-personality grip. Ultimately, the authors suggest that the real winners may be the parties that lose the presidency, as they will have four years to regroup and redefine themselves around policy objectives.

**The 7 States that Could Decide the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election is a highly anticipated event, not only for American citizens but also for people around the world. Many are wondering who will be the winner. In the past, when President Joe Biden was a candidate for the Democratic Party, polls indicated that Republican Donald Trump could win the White House, but everything took an unexpected turn in July. When Kamala Harris was endorsed by Joe Biden to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, the chances of the Democratic Party winning the presidency increased. Despite Harris's rapid rise in popularity, she has focused on the key states, just like her opponent. It's worth noting that every four years, candidates focus on the 'swing states,' also known as 'pivotal states' or 'battleground states.' These states are crucial in the electoral contest because they do not show any tendency towards the Democratic or Republican Party. This means that the decision is usually very close, and it's often only in the final minute that the winner is determined. Additionally, it's essential to remember that the president is not elected by popular vote, but by the Electoral College, which essentially means that the states choose the winner. The key states for the 2024 US presidential election are Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and North Carolina. To illustrate the importance of these locations, it's worth recalling the 2016 elections, when Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's candidate, lost to her Republican opponent Donald Trump, thanks to winning states that gave her a greater number of delegates. Despite Clinton having approximately three million more votes than Trump, she did not win the title of the first female president of the United States because her opponent won the states with the greatest weight in the number of electoral votes obtained through the members of the Electoral College. This is a clear example of how the popular vote does not determine the winner of the White House.

**Race for the White House**
The 2024 U.S. presidential elections and state elections are expected to be a global political event, with nearly 162 million registered American voters choosing 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 33 members of the U.S. Senate, and 27 state governors. The presidential race is between Kamala Harris-Tim Walz (Democratic Party) and Donald J. Trump-J.D. Vance (Republican Party). This year's election is historic, as it is the first time a major national party has put up a woman of color on the ballot. Voting booths will remain open for 12 hours, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and voters can cast their ballots earlier than the fixed voting date through vote-by-mail ballots.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Complex Process**
The US Presidential Election 2024 is approaching, with Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Party candidate Donald Trump as the main contenders. The election will be held on November 5, 2024, and the winner will be sworn in as President on January 20, 2025. The election process involves a complex system of primaries, caucuses, and electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, will be declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016. The election will also determine the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, the counting of votes may take several days. The new President will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C.

The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, 2024, where Americans will elect the next president and members of Congress.

The two main parties, the Democrats and Republicans, have nominated their candidates, with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee and Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. The winner is not the person who gets the most votes across the country, but the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral college votes, which are awarded by state. The election will also determine the control of Congress, with the House of Representatives and Senate up for election. The winner will be sworn into office in January 2025 in a ceremony known as the inauguration.

The final matchups for the 2024 US general election are now set, with Democrats and Republicans vying for control of the House and Senate. In the Senate, Republicans are likely to win in West Virginia, and need to win one more seat to retake control of the chamber. Democrats are facing tough challenges in several key states, including Montana, Ohio, and Michigan. In the House, more than three dozen competitive races will determine who will be in charge come next year. Republicans currently control the chamber by a narrow margin, but Democrats have raised more money than Republicans this cycle, which could give them an advantage. The two parties are offering starkly different visions for the country's future, and the outcome of the election will have significant implications for the next president's agenda. Republicans are focusing on immigration and the economy, while Democrats are highlighting reproductive rights, healthcare, and democracy. The stakes of the election are high, and the outcome is far from certain.

**"Kamala Harris Will Win": 'Nostradamus' Of US Presidential Polls To NDTV**
Allan Lichtman, known as the 'Nostradamus of US presidential elections', has predicted that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election. Lichtman's '13 keys to the White House' method, which assesses factors such as party mandate, economy, and foreign policy, has shown that Harris has secured eight keys, while Republican nominee Donald Trump has only three. Lichtman explained that if six or more keys go against the White House party, they are predicted losers. He stated, 'They lost the mandate key, which is based on losses in US house election. They have obviously lost the incumbency key with Biden not running. But with the party uniting around Harris, the avoided the loss of the contest key. Finally, the third key that they lost was incumbent charisma key.' Lichtman added that Democrats will hold on to the White House, despite uncertainty in two foreign policy keys.

**'Nostradamus of polling' says Kamala Harris will win race for the White House**
Allan Lichtman, a renowned American political historian known as the 'Nostradamus of presidential predictions', has predicted that Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election. Lichtman's method, 'The Keys to the White House', examines 13 factors, including the president's party's standing in the House of Representatives, the health of the domestic economy, and the comparative charisma of the two candidates. With eight of the 13 keys currently yielding 'true' answers, Lichtman believes Harris will triumph and the Democrats will retain the White House. Lichtman noted that Joe Biden's decision to step aside after a disastrous debate performance against Trump has been a pivotal moment in the race, allowing Democrats to unite around Harris and avoid losing the party contest key. According to national polling, Harris is currently four percentage points ahead of Trump, although the candidates are tied in three key battleground states.

**Election 2024 will all come down to turnout — here's what you need to know**
With two months until Election Day, the Trump-Vance ticket and the Harris-Walz ticket are in full campaign mode. Despite everything going wrong for Trump, polling numbers show a close race, particularly in battleground states. However, the underlying trend toward Democrats in several states suggests that the race may not be as close as it appears. In Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Democrats have a strong lead, while in Arizona and Nevada, the margin of victory will be razor-thin. North Carolina is now a toss-up, but history suggests that Trump will prevail. The winner of the upper Midwest cluster will likely also win the White House. Minnesota has become a Harris lock, giving her extra energy to win neighboring states. This analysis suggests that several states will be close, but if they all move together and support the same candidate, the edge rests with Harris. Trump is reticent to debate Harris, as she has the skills to befuddle him. The odds have softened for Trump since Harris's accession, and Republican leadership should focus on retaining the House and taking back the Senate. A divided government is likely, with the two parties holding different parts of government, which would impact issues like the federal budget and confirming Supreme Court nominees. As Alan Greenspan said, 'Unless you are willing to compromise, society cannot live together.'

**Peskov: The Winner of the US Presidential Election Will Be Chosen by the American People**
Dmitry Peskov, the official representative of the Kremlin, stated that the winner of the upcoming US presidential election will be the candidate chosen by the American people. According to Peskov, 'The one who will be chosen by the American people will win. It's not our business to interfere, our business is to observe how this process unfolds.' Peskov also mentioned that there are no preconditions for resuming cooperation with the US. This comes after Peskov previously called the accusations of Russian interference in the US presidential election 'absurd'. Peskov noted that such accusations will become more frequent as the election approaches, but they harm Russian-American relations. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Moscow does not care who becomes the new head of the White House and will work with any elected American leader. Putin reminded that Russia has never interfered in US domestic politics. The 60th US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024, with Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party candidate and Donald Trump as the Republican Party candidate.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Trump and Harris Vie for the White House**
The 2024 US presidential election is underway, with Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris vying for the White House. Trump, the former president, has been nominated by the Republican Party, while Harris, the current vice president, has been nominated by the Democratic Party. Harris has chosen Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her running mate. The election will take place on November 5, 2024, and the winner will be determined by the Electoral College. The Democratic Party has a complex nomination process, with a series of primaries and caucuses held across the country. The Republican Party, on the other hand, has a more straightforward nomination process, with Trump being the clear frontrunner. Harris has been criticized for her lack of experience and her past controversies, but she has also been praised for her progressive policies and her ability to connect with young voters. Trump, on the other hand, has been criticized for his divisive rhetoric and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The election is expected to be a close contest, with both candidates having their strengths and weaknesses. 'I know Donald Trump's type,' Harris said in a speech, 'and I'm going to make sure he's held accountable.' The election will be a test of the American people's values and their willingness to elect a new leader. 'This is a moment of great consequence,' said Harris, 'and I'm honored to be a part of it.'
