**NATE SILVER**  
So, Philip, the big question: Did H5N1 human-to-human transmission occur before September 30th?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.67%. The CDC confirmed no human-to-human spread, despite the Texas case in April.

**NATE SILVER**  
Interesting. Our predictions held steady given the limited human cases and no transmission reports. The news up to August 14th didn't suggest any shifts.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed. The CDC's summaries consistently showed low public health risk and no person-to-person spread. The probabilities reflected that.

**NATE SILVER**  
A testament to the power of accurate forecasting. Let's keep watching those data trends.

*They nod, exchanging a look of mutual respect for their accurate predictions.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did the human-to-human transmission of H5N1 happen?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 23.45%. The CDC's last update before August 14th showed no evidence of transmission. 

**NATE SILVER:** Right. Even with that Texas case in April, the spread remained animal-to-human. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The models considered the global situation, and despite the sporadic cases, the probability stayed low.

**NATE SILVER:** A relief, but a reminder of the unpredictability of these viruses.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. Vigilance is key. Until the next forecast.

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, post-September 30th. The big question—did we see human-to-human transmission of H5N1?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 25.00%. Despite the Texas case in April, the CDC maintained no evidence of person-to-person spread.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The August news cut-off showed no new developments. Our models were spot on, again.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The sporadic infections in birds and mammals stayed isolated. No leap to humans.

**NATE SILVER:** So, here we are, October 1st, 2024. The CDC confirmed no human-to-human transmission of H5N1 globally after April 11th.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed, Nate. Our models had it at 35.75%. The data up to August 14th indicated low probability, despite the Texas case.

**NATE SILVER:** Right. The CDC's consistent reports of "None" for person-to-person spread aligned with our forecasts.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** The sporadic infections in birds and mammals didn't translate to human transmission. Our models remained robust.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a relief, but we keep monitoring. The stakes with H5N1 are high.
