Let me carefully analyze this ballot measure:

Key considerations:
- Ranked-choice voting (RCV) is a novel voting system for Oregon
- Voters can be skeptical of significant electoral process changes
- RCV has mixed adoption/success in other states recently
- Oregon tends to be progressive, which may favor electoral reform
- No strong polling data available this close to election
- Measure needs 50%+ to pass

Cross-referencing recent RCV ballot measure trends:
- Some states have approved RCV (Alaska, Maine)
- Other states have rejected similar measures
- Implementation complexity can concern voters

Current context factors:
- Political polarization might make voters hesitant about system changes
- Potential voter confusion about RCV mechanics
- No overwhelming public momentum detected

Probability assessment:
- Strong uncertainty exists
- Lean slightly against passage due to voter unfamiliarity
- Potential for close vote

After thorough analysis, considering all factors:

My Prediction: Between 40.50% and 49.90%, but 45.75% being the most likely. Probability: 45.75%.
