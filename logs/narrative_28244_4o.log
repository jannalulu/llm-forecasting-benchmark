*Superforecasters gather around a table, sipping coffee, reviewing data on laptops.*

**JAMIE**  
(leans back)  
So, the recall status. Our models had it at 92.75% that it would be closed by today.

**ALEX**  
(nods)  
Given the urgency around allergens, it seemed likely. But without updates past September 17th, it was a tight call.

**MORGAN**  
(typing)  
Right. The misbranding issue was significant. Dairy allergies are serious, and the USDA tends to act swiftly.

**JAMIE**  
(looks up)  
Yet, no news articles after mid-September. It was a blind spot.

**ALEX**  
(smiles)  
Still, our Brier scores hold. The models rarely miss.

**MORGAN**  
(sipping coffee)  
True. Even with limited data, our probabilities reflected reality.

*They all nod, satisfied with their analysis.*

**FADE OUT.**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table strewn with laptops and newspapers. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

FORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, thoughtful)  
Well, the USDA recall on Michael Foods' liquid eggs is still active. Our models had it at 85.75% probability that it would remain unresolved by today.

FORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Exactly. With the misbranding and undeclared allergens, it was a complex situation. The lack of decisive action before our last news update on September 17 made it unlikely they'd close it in time.

FORECASTER 3  
(typing on a laptop)  
The public health risks were significant. Any delay in resolving such recalls is understandable but unfortunate.

FORECASTER 1  
(sighs)  
It’s a reminder of the unpredictability of these processes, even when our models are never wrong.

They exchange understanding glances, knowing their forecasts once again reflected reality.

Well, folks, the recall of Michael Foods Inc.'s liquid egg products is officially closed. Our models had it at 95.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Not surprising, given the pressure from consumer safety groups and the company's swift response to the allergen mislabeling.
