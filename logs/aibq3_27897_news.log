**Russia Denies Rumors of New Mobilization Wave**
Recent rumors about a new wave of mobilization in Russia have been dismissed as false. Social media has been filled with claims that the Russian military is preparing to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people, but these claims have no basis in fact. According to Russian officials, the partial mobilization that was completed in 2022 has been finished, and there are no plans to resume it. President Vladimir Putin stated in October 2022 that the partial mobilization was complete. The Russian military is currently recruiting new soldiers on a voluntary basis, with over 190,000 people having signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense as of July 2024. Deputy Secretary of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev noted that the average daily recruitment rate is around 1,000 people. The recent attack on the Kursk region has led to an increase in the number of people wanting to join the military on a contract basis. Deputy of the State Duma Andrei Gurulev stated, 'The attack on the Kursk region has led to another wave of mass enlistment. Guys are going to defend the Motherland.' Member of the State Duma's Committee on Defense Viktor Sobolev commented on the situation, stating that there are no plans for mobilization and that the number of volunteers has increased, making additional mobilization unnecessary.

**Russia Denies Plans for Second Wave of Mobilization Amid Kursk Region Tensions**
There are rumors of a possible second wave of partial mobilization in Russia due to the situation in the Kursk region. However, experts and officials have dismissed these claims as false. The Russian government has stated that the country has enough resources, equipment, and personnel to handle the current situation. The head of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, has also denied any plans for a new mobilization. According to the press secretary of the President, Dmitry Peskov, a large number of volunteers are going to the front, and the government has increased the one-time payment for signing a contract with the Ministry of Defense. Military expert Anton Shepetnov believes that the country is ready to start mobilization, but it is up to one person to decide whether to do so. Some analysts suggest that the mobilized personnel from 2022 may be replaced by new recruits in the current period, as many have been serving in the zone of the special military operation for almost two years.

**Russia's Mobilization in 2024: Expert Names Conditions for Second Wave**
The possibility of a new wave of mobilization in Russia has been discussed in the country, especially after the Ukrainian army's invasion of the Kursk region. According to expert Vyacheslav Frolov, there are no preconditions for mobilization, even in the face of the Ukrainian invasion, as the Russian army has a significant numerical strength and the number of volunteers willing to defend the country is growing. Frolov believes that the enemy is 'sowing panic' about mobilization. The only scenario in which mobilization is inevitable is if a formal declaration of war is made. Otherwise, it will be limited to a regime of KTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) and CTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) on specific territories. Political scientist Zhivov believes that partial mobilization should have been conducted in May, which would have given Russia more powerful reserves to prevent the Ukrainian invasion in the Kursk region. Zhivov notes that even if mobilization is announced tomorrow, its effect will only be felt by the end of autumn. He emphasizes that the question of the need for mobilization is best understood by the General Staff. If necessary, mobilization will be conducted. However, he notes that the number of volunteers has increased significantly due to the events in the Kursk region, making mobilization unnecessary. Mikhail Zvinchuk, the author of the 'Rybar' Telegram channel, considers mobilization to be a very risky move for the authorities, as it would damage their reputation. He believes that the Ukrainian formations are digging in on the 'Surovikin line', and their control over several settlements is 'very conditional'.

**Kremlin Denies Rumors of Second Wave of Mobilization in Russia**
The Kremlin has denied rumors of a second wave of mobilization in Russia. According to the official representative of the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, 'no one is talking about mobilization, there is no discussion'. This statement contradicts earlier claims by President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Andrei Bellov that the mobilization process is complete. Despite this, some journalists are still reporting on the preparation of a new wave of mobilization, citing sources from the highest echelons of power. The first partial mobilization in Russia took place from September 21 to October 31, 2022, with 300,000 people being mobilized into the Russian army.

**Russia to Restrict Travel of Conscripts and Mobilized Individuals**
The Russian government plans to restrict the travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals who receive electronic summonses to the military, starting in the fall of 2024. According to several sources, the relevant legislative norms were approved earlier. The electronic register of summonses is expected to start operating in the fall, with automatic restrictions to be implemented. The information was first reported by the Meduza publication, which discovered a tender for the implementation of an 'information exchange' between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB on data about Russians who have received summonses in electronic form. The contract was awarded to the Voskhod research institute, which will transmit the list of individuals subject to military service and with temporary restrictions on leaving Russia to the FSB border service. According to the tender, the contract must be completed by the fall conscription, which usually starts on October 1. The formal deadline for the entire contract is November 29, so the register should be operational during the fall conscription. In December 2023, Vladimir Putin issued an order to hold the fall 2024 conscription using new electronic registers of summonses. Most lawyers believe that all restrictions related to the order will apply to both conscripts and mobilized individuals, and they will be banned from leaving the country immediately after the electronic summons is registered. Rumors about a second massive wave of mobilization in Russia have been circulating periodically throughout 2023. Recently, military experts have been regularly saying that the Russian government is not giving up on a large-scale attack on several still-occupied Ukrainian territories, and the army needs much more manpower. Government representatives have repeatedly stated that there is no need for a second wave of mobilization; similar statements were made before the start of mobilization in the fall of 2022.

**Russian Government Conducts Internal Operations to Normalize War in Society**
According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Russian government has been conducting internal operations to normalize the war in society, which has helped to alleviate fatigue from the war within the country. Recent surveys in Russia show that the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region has not worsened internal support for the war against Ukraine, and that support for the war remains high since 2022. A recent poll by the Russian analytical organization 'Levada-Center' found that 78% of respondents support Russian military operations in Ukraine, which is higher than in July and June. The poll also found that 91% of respondents are concerned about Ukrainian military operations on Russian territory. Additionally, 57% of respondents do not expect a second wave of mobilization, and 60% do not see a need for a second wave of mobilization in the coming months. The ISW report states that 'the fact that the Russian government has not fully mobilized the society and has conducted internal information operations to normalize the war in society has likely alleviated fatigue from the war within the country, and the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region has not changed this thinking.' The analysts conclude that 'the fact that the Russian society as a whole does not seem to be experiencing fatigue from the war, probably gives the Kremlin flexibility in developing a strategy for a long war of attrition against Ukraine.'

**ISW Report: Kremlin's Strategy to Normalize War in Russian Society Mitigates War Fatigue**
According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Kremlin's decision not to fully transition Russian society to a wartime footing and its internal information operations aimed at normalizing the war in society have so far mitigated the war fatigue within the country. Recent social surveys in Russia show that the Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk region has not worsened internal support for the war against Ukraine, and that support for the war among Russians remains high since 2022. A recent poll by the Levada Center found that 78% of respondents support Russian military operations in Ukraine, up from 75% in July and 77% in June. The Levada Center's survey also found that 91% of respondents are concerned about Ukrainian military operations on Russian territory. Additionally, 57% of Russians do not expect a second wave of mobilization, and 60% do not see the need for a second wave of mobilization in the coming months.

'The fact that Russian society as a whole appears not to be experiencing war fatigue, likely provides the Kremlin with flexibility in developing a strategy for a prolonged war of attrition against Ukraine,' the analysts concluded. 'This is in contrast to the previous ISW report, which stated that the Ukrainian operation on Kurshin had undermined Vladimir Putin's ratings.'

**Russian Information Campaigns Soften Internal Fatigue of War, ISW Reports**
Recent Russian internal polls show that the Ukrainian military operation in the Kursk region has not decreased the level of support for the war in Ukraine among Russian citizens in the short term. According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the Russian government's information campaigns have softened the internal fatigue of the war and given flexibility in choosing a strategy for a prolonged war of exhaustion against Ukraine. A recent survey by the Russian sociological organization 'Levada Center' found that around 78% of respondents support Russian military operations in Ukraine, which is more than 75% in July 2024 and 77% in June 2024. ISW analysts note that the 'Levada Center' survey indicates that the lowest level of support for the war among Russians was in February 2022, when 68% of respondents supported the war, and that support for the war among respondents has not fallen below 70% since March 2022. The 'Levada Center' also asked respondents about the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region and found that 91% of respondents were concerned about Ukrainian military operations on Russian territory. 'Levada Center' also reported that 57% of respondents do not expect a second wave of mobilization, and 60% do not see the need for a second wave of mobilization in the coming months - both indicators decreased from 65% and 69% respectively. According to the ISW report, 'The data from the 'Levada Center' survey indicates that the Kremlin's refusal to fully shift Russian society to a war footing and ongoing internal information campaigns by the Kremlin to normalize the war in Russian society have so far softened internal fatigue of the war, and that the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region has not changed these attitudes.' ISW emphasized that the fact that Russian society as a whole 'does not feel fatigue from the war, likely gives the Kremlin flexibility in choosing a strategy for a prolonged war of exhaustion against Ukraine.'

**Kremlin's Information Operations Alleviate Internal War Fatigue, ISW Reports**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), recent Russian internal polls show that the operation of the Defense Forces in the Kursk region has caused concern among Russians, but the Kremlin's information operations 'alleviate internal war fatigue' and allow the Russian authorities to choose a strategy for a prolonged war of exhaustion against Ukraine. The ISW report notes that recent Russian internal polls indicate that the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region has not yet reduced the level of support for the war in Ukraine in Russia in the short term, and that support for the war in Russia remains high since 2022.

**Russia Denies Rumors of New Wave of Mobilization in September 2024**
Russian authorities have repeatedly denied rumors of a new wave of mobilization in September 2024. Despite this, some lawmakers have expressed support for the idea. Deputy Alexey Zhuravlev stated that mobilization is necessary 'to counter the West', while his colleague, Deputy Viktor Sobolev, said that there will be no additional mobilization. Minister of Defense Andrei Bellovsky also stated that there will be no new wave of mobilization, but rather a continuation of the current recruitment process. President Vladimir Putin has also expressed his opposition to a new wave of mobilization, citing the gradual withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Russian-occupied territories. Despite this, some Western media outlets continue to predict a new wave of mobilization, with some speculating that it may be announced under the guise of troop rotation.

**Russia's Plan for Mobilization: A Strict and Secretive Process**
Russian authorities have a strict plan for mobilization, but the exact timing is unclear. According to opposition politician Gennady Gudkov, military commissariats must complete all organizational preparations by September 6 and wait for further instructions. Gudkov stated, 'Nothing will be announced. They will collect people even from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Krasnodar, Yekaterinburg, and other major cities.' The mobilization will be similar to the one in September 2022, but this time it will be compulsory. Gudkov added, 'Now military commissariats are completing their preparations. They are determining whether there is enough mobilization resources to fulfill the task. If not, they are considering calling up students from military departments.'

**Will Mobilization Take Place in Russia in 2024?**
There have been ongoing discussions in Russia about the possibility of mobilization in 2024. Western media and politicians claim that mobilization is inevitable due to a lack of reserves in the Russian army. However, Russian authorities deny the need for mobilization, stating that current resources are sufficient. According to Bloomberg, citing sources, mobilization may be announced in Russia by the end of 2024, but there is no official confirmation. Russian officials and politicians, including President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly stated that there are no plans for new mobilization. Therefore, despite ongoing rumors and discussions, the official position of Russian authorities is that there will be no new mobilization wave in 2024.

**Will Russia Mobilize in 2024?**
There have been recurring discussions in the media about a new wave of mobilization in Russia. The authorities deny the need to replenish reserves, while Western publications and politicians say it is inevitable. Should we expect a new wave in 2024? The reasons for the renewed discussions about mobilization are unclear. Some say that the possibility of mobilization is being considered, while others deny it. President and Defense Minister have not commented on the issue. If mobilization were to happen, those who have served in the military would be exempt from it. In 2022, Russia conducted a partial mobilization, which was met with widespread protests. The partial mobilization in the Belgorod region was particularly contentious. It is unclear what the future holds for Russia's military mobilization efforts.

**Kremlin Prepares Russians for 'New Normalcy' Amid Prolonged Ukrainian Military Advance**
The Kremlin is preparing Russians for a 'new normalcy' with a prolonged Ukrainian military advance and the involvement of conscripts in the fighting. According to sources close to the administration of President Vladimir Putin and the government, the initial shock of the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region has worn off, and people are adapting to the situation. 'During the shock, there are always jumps in sociological indicators, but soon people get used to it, and the situation stabilizes,' said one of the sources. To accelerate the adaptation of citizens to the new reality, the Kremlin is actively using propaganda to prepare Russians for life in the conditions of the so-called 'new normalcy' - a concept that was already used during the COVID-19 pandemic and at the beginning of the war with Ukraine. 'This is necessary so that people perceive what is happening as not a deviation, but a new norm, although temporary. In the new norm, it is easier to exist,' explained a media technologist who cooperates with the internal policy block of the administration of the President. The Kremlin is trying to form a 'new reality' through several key messages: citizens are being encouraged to 'redirect negative and shock into a positive direction,' including participating in the collection of aid for the Kursk region. The administration of the President has already recommended to the regional authorities to organize such events. Sources interviewed by 'Meduza' believe that the battles in the Kursk region may last for several months. However, a source close to the government warns that this forecast is 'quite optimistic, if everything goes well.' Sources close to the Kremlin confirm that after the start of the operation, the possibility of a new wave of mobilization was considered. This is also confirmed by sources from Bloomberg, stating that a new mobilization may be announced by the end of 2024 due to a lack of reserves. However, a source close to the government states that the Cabinet of Ministers and representatives of the large business are against mobilization, as it may hit the economy. 'This will drain the last labor resources from the economy. Nobody is working anymore. And then they will take some, and others will start hiding,' he explained. At the same time, the interlocutor emphasizes that it is unclear how such arguments will be taken into account by the higher leadership of the country. He adds that it is more likely that conscripts will be involved in the battles in the Kursk region, and media preparation of the public for this is already underway. It is also noted that Russian 'elites' are expecting the resignation of those responsible for the breakthrough of the Ukrainian military on Russian territory.

**Russia May Launch New Wave of Mobilization to Gather 800,000 Troops for Ukraine Battles**
According to military expert and former Ukrainian army colonel, Vladyslav Selezniv, Russia may start a new wave of mobilization to gather an 800,000-strong group for battles in Ukraine. Selezniv stated that the Russian army, which was professional before the full-scale invasion in 2022, now consists of 'chmobiliki' (conscripts seeking high pay for killing Ukrainians) and mercenaries recruited worldwide. He said that only a small segment of the Russian army still remembers how to fight properly, while the majority were conscripted during the partial mobilization in September 2022. Selezniv believes that Russia can still compensate for the catastrophic level of losses, with up to 30-35,000 military casualties per month. He predicts that without large-scale mobilization, it will be difficult for Russia to gather the required number of troops by the end of the year. Selezniv thinks that Putin may announce the new mobilization as early as the first weeks of September, coinciding with the Russian parliamentary elections. He also predicts that the new mobilization will be similar to the previous one, with many conscripts being sent to the front lines and dying soon after. Selezniv believes that Russia lacks both material and human resources to sustain a long-term war effort.

**Russia's Mobilization in 2024: Expert Names Conditions for Second Wave**
The possibility of a new wave of mobilization in Russia has been discussed in the country, especially after the Ukrainian army's invasion of the Kursk region. According to expert Vyacheslav Frolov, there are no preconditions for mobilization, even in the face of the Ukrainian invasion, as the Russian army has a significant numerical strength and the number of volunteers willing to defend the country is growing. Frolov believes that the enemy is 'sowing panic' about mobilization. The only scenario in which mobilization is inevitable is if a formal declaration of war is made. Otherwise, it will be limited to a regime of KTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) and CTO (Counter-Terrorism Operation) on specific territories. Political scientist Zhivov believes that partial mobilization should have been conducted in May, which would have given Russia more powerful reserves to prevent the Ukrainian invasion in the Kursk region. Zhivov notes that even if mobilization is announced tomorrow, its effect will only be felt by the end of autumn. He emphasizes that the question of the need for mobilization is best understood by the General Staff. If necessary, mobilization will be conducted. However, he notes that the number of volunteers has increased significantly due to the events in the Kursk region, making mobilization unnecessary. Mikhail Zvinchuk, the author of the 'Rybar' Telegram channel, considers mobilization to be a very risky move for the authorities, as it would damage their reputation. He believes that the Ukrainian formations are digging in on the 'Surovikin line', and their control over several settlements is 'very conditional'.

**Russia Prepares for New Wave of Mobilization, but Faces Challenges**
Russian opposition politician Gennady Gudkov stated that the Russian military is preparing for a new wave of mobilization, with a possible announcement in October or November. According to Gudkov, the Russian government has ambitious plans to mobilize around 900,000 to 1 million people, but the military commissariats have already stated that they cannot physically fulfill this task. 'Although the military commissariats have said that it's unrealistic, they are still preparing for it. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is also preparing, as there will be 'patrol raids' and checks on homes. The addresses and personal data of those who are subject to mobilization are already known,' Gudkov said. The main problem with mobilization is not the recruitment itself, but the lack of trained commanders and officers who can lead the troops. 'You can call people up, but you need to train them, arm them, and clothe them. There are not enough commanders, and not enough officers who know even the basics of strategy and tactics,' Gudkov emphasized.

**Mobilization in Russia: Experts Weigh In on the Possibility**
The ongoing battles in the Kursk region between Russian and Ukrainian forces have sparked discussions about the possibility of a new wave of mobilization in Russia. Bloomberg reported that Russia may announce mobilization in late 2024, citing sources close to the Kremlin and the Ministry of Defense. However, the Russian government has denied these claims, with some officials stating that there is no need for mobilization due to the sufficient number of contract soldiers. Experts and military analysts have differing opinions on the matter, with some arguing that mobilization is necessary to address the ongoing conflict, while others believe that it would be a mistake due to the potential economic consequences. The article also quotes various military analysts and experts, including Egor Gusev, who stated that 'the longer the time, the more it works against us', and Anatoly Zhdanov, who said that 'if for victory, mobilization is needed, it should be conducted'.

**Russia may announce new wave of mobilization due to heavy battlefield losses**
Russia's army is struggling to keep pace with frontline losses, which are at their highest since the February 2022 invasion began. According to Bloomberg, people close to the Kremlin and the Russian Defense Ministry, regional officials are leaving more than a third of their recruitment quotas unfilled on average. This situation may force Russia to consider a new mobilization wave, with one person suggesting it could be a rotation measure for frontline troops, while another said a draft could be announced as early as the end of this year. Putin needs 'around 500,000 people in the next 12 months to offset attrition and rotate his troops deployed in Ukraine,' according to Bloomberg Economics Russia economist Alex Isakov.

**Russia May Announce New Mobilization Amidst Army Shortages**
According to Bloomberg, citing three anonymous sources close to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian army is struggling to replace losses on the front lines in Ukraine, which have reached their highest level since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022. A person familiar with the situation stated that regional officials are leaving over a third of recruitment quotas unfilled, despite increased payments to conscripts, as reported by the BBC. The inability of the Russian army to repel Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region and take control of the border has shown a lack of defensive reserves in Russia. One source told Bloomberg that this may force Russian authorities to conduct a new mobilization, which could be presented as a 'rotation' to give soldiers on the front lines a break. Another source stated that an order for a new mobilization could be given as early as the end of 2024. In September 2022, President Putin announced a partial mobilization in Russia, which affected 300,000 people. However, Putin stated in October that the mobilization was completed, but did not sign a corresponding decree.

**Russia May Announce New Wave of Mobilization Amid High Losses on the Front Lines**
Russia's army is facing a severe shortage of recruits due to high losses on the front lines, with some regions failing to meet their recruitment quotas by as much as a third. According to sources close to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense, this situation may lead to a new wave of mobilization. 'We need around 500,000 men in the next 12 months to compensate for the exhaustion and rotation of our troops in Ukraine,' said a Russian economist from Bloomberg Economics. Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov warned that by summer 2025, Russia will face a dilemma: either stop the war against Ukraine or declare a new large-scale mobilization. 'For the first time in recent months, the Russian army has faced a personnel shortage,' he said. The inability of Russia to stop the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk region and regain control over its border has revealed a lack of defensive reserves. Hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers are stationed on the front lines in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Russia is suffering increasing losses and the fighting is largely going nowhere.

Russia may announce a new wave of mobilization due to heavy losses on the front, according to Bloomberg sources close to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense.

One source added that the new wave of mobilization could start as early as the end of this year. Bloomberg notes that Russia's inability to repel the Ukrainian attack and regain control of the Kursk region has revealed a shortage of defensive reserves among the occupiers. Additionally, Moscow is holding hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the front line in eastern and southern Ukraine, where they are facing growing losses due to the stalemate in most battles. 'Putin needs around 500,000 people over the next 12 months to compensate for the depletion and rotation of his troops in Ukraine. The current Russian recruitment strategy, based on paying volunteers a higher-than-market wage, will be insufficient to achieve this. The Russian government is likely to shift its focus to conscripts,' said Russian economist Alex Isakov of Bloomberg Economics.

**Russia May Announce New Mobilization by End of Year Due to Military Shortage**
According to Bloomberg, Russia may announce a new mobilization by the end of the year due to a shortage of military personnel. The invasion of Ukraine's Kursk region has highlighted a lack of defensive reserves in Russia, increasing the risk of a new wave of mobilization, the agency reported on Tuesday, citing sources. The Russian military has been unable to replace losses on the front lines, which have reached a maximum since the start of the full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022, the agency said, citing three people close to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense who asked not to be named. Despite significantly increased payments to contract soldiers, Russian regions have failed to meet their recruitment quotas on average, one of the sources told Bloomberg. The worsening shortage of personnel participating in the war against Ukraine is prompting Russian authorities to increase payments to soldiers to avoid repeating the mobilization, but so far, there are few signs that these measures are effective, the agency noted. Such a situation may lead to the Russian authorities being forced to conduct a new mobilization, according to the agency's sources. One of them said that the Kremlin may present it as a 'rotation' necessary for the rest of the soldiers involved in the front. Russia announced a 'partial mobilization' in September 2022, with former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stating that 300,000 people were mobilized. Another 20,000 people, according to official statements, went to war as volunteers. Just before the announcement of mobilization, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, assured journalists that there were no plans for it. After that, the Russian authorities repeatedly stated that there would be no new wave of mobilization. In particular, in early June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the existing contingent was insufficient for rapid achievement of goals. 'We are not going to repeat the experience of last year,' Putin said, 'and we will not mobilize people again.' However, according to Bloomberg, the situation may change, and a new mobilization may be announced. 'The situation is not improving,' one of the sources told the agency. 'The authorities are trying to find a way out, but so far, there are no results.' As one of the sources put it, 'the authorities are trying to buy time, but it's not working.'

**Russia May Announce New Wave of Mobilization Due to High Losses on the Front**
According to Bloomberg, citing sources close to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian army is facing a shortage of soldiers to continue the war against Ukraine. This may lead to a new wave of mobilization in Russia.

A source told Bloomberg that the scale of Russian losses and the inadequate level of replacement makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the war strategy.

**Russia May Announce New Wave of Mobilization Due to Growing Army Losses in Ukraine**
Russia may announce a new wave of mobilization before the end of the year due to the lack of new recruits to replace the growing losses of the Russian army in Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources close to the Kremlin and the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian army is not receiving a sufficient influx of new soldiers to compensate for its losses on the front. Local Russian authorities are barely meeting their recruitment quotas. 'The Ukrainian military's lightning-fast advance into the Kursk region of Russia, which met with little resistance, has highlighted the problems faced by the Kremlin as the war enters its third year. Ukrainian forces now control 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory, and offensive operations continue,' the article states. The authors note that the fighting has stalled on the eastern and southern fronts in Ukraine, and Russian army losses are growing. The inability to repel the Ukrainian advance and regain control of the border has exposed a shortage of defensive reserves in Russia. The September 2022 mobilization of 300,000 reservists sparked widespread discontent and a mass exodus of around one million Russians. To avoid a repeat of this situation and ensure a monthly influx of 30,000 new soldiers, the Kremlin is using patriotic appeals and offering high salaries to contract soldiers. The Kremlin is also incentivizing local authorities with bonuses for meeting recruitment quotas with the Ministry of Defense, and is pressuring regions to poach potential contract soldiers from neighboring areas. 'The scale of Russian losses and the inadequate level of their replenishment are making it difficult to advance the occupying forces in Ukraine,' said one source. In the Kremlin, there is no longer talk of capturing Kiev and other Ukrainian cities because it is simply impossible. 'Putin needs around half a million people over the next 12 months to compensate for the army's losses on the front in Ukraine. The current strategy of recruiting volunteers, based on high salaries for contract soldiers, will be inadequate to achieve this goal. Instead, the government is likely to decide on mobilization,' said Alex Isakov, an economist at Bloomberg.

**Russia Denies Second Wave of Mobilization Amid Kursk Region Tensions**
Rumors of a second wave of mobilization in Russia have been sparked by recent events in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have been attempting to breach the border. Official sources have commented on the situation. Fact-checking resource 'Lapsha Media' debunked a video that claimed to show Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing the start of mobilization on August 9, stating that 'mobilization activities will begin today and official letters will be sent to the State Duma and the Federation Council today.' However, this was found to be false information. In response, officials have provided expert comments on the matter. According to Andrey Kartapolov, head of the Defense Committee in the State Duma, 'there is no need to conduct mobilization in Russia due to the situation in the Kursk region, as there are enough soldiers on the front.' Viktor Zavarzin, a State Duma deputy and member of the Defense Committee, stated that 'we have enough forces, with over 700,000 contract soldiers. There is no need for mobilization at this time.' Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Chechnya, claimed that 'a Ukrainian column was destroyed and NATO equipment was seized in the Kursk region. In a few days, when the main Russian reserves arrive, we can expect positive results.'

The author questions whether mobilization is a sign of shame or salvation, highlighting the intense debate and passion surrounding the topic. The article also mentions the need for rotation and vacations, but warns against demobilization, which is seen as a betrayal of the country.

**Kartapolov: No Need for New Mobilization in Russia**
Russian parliamentarian Andrei Kartapolov stated that there is no need for a new mobilization in Russia due to the situation in the Kursk region. According to him, the Russian military has enough personnel to counter the Ukrainian forces. Kartapolov said, 'There is no need for a new mobilization, we have enough people to deal with the situation.' The Kursk region has seen recent battles, with the Russian military stopping the Ukrainian forces' advance in the Sudzhensky and Korenevsky districts. The Russian government has declared a state of emergency in the region and the National Anti-Terrorist Committee has introduced a 'red terror' regime in the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions. Residents of the border areas are being evacuated. A partial mobilization was announced in Russia in September 2022, which ended in October with the recruitment of 300,000 reservists. Since then, the authorities have repeatedly stated that the needs of the Russian military are met by contract soldiers, and there is no need for a new mobilization. However, some lawmakers have suggested that the mobilized personnel need to be rotated regularly to avoid burnout, and a mechanism for replacing them should be carefully planned to avoid affecting the combat readiness of units.

**Russia's Mobilization Crisis: A Dilemma by Summer 2025**
According to Kirill Budanov, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Russia has exhausted its supply of 'volunteers' and is now left with only mobilizing new troops to the front. He believes that by next year, the Kremlin will be forced to either end the war or announce a new wave of forced mobilization. 'If the prolonged war continues, Russia will face a dilemma by summer 2025: either stop it all or announce a repeat large-scale mobilization,' Budanov said. He added that Putin will try to delay the decision as long as possible, fearing political instability in the event of a new large-scale mobilization. Budanov noted that for a long time, Russia had no problems with recruiting 'cannon fodder,' but three months ago, problems began to arise. He stated that Russia could previously rely on prisoners and volunteers who were lured by large sums of money, up to 2 million Russian rubles, to go to the front. However, the flow of volunteers has drastically decreased, and the Russian army has faced a personnel shortage for the first time. Budanov mentioned that according to the mobilization plan, there is a nearly 10% shortage of personnel. He also predicted that the next actions of the Russian occupiers will last for about 1.5-2 months, after which they will come to an end, citing the practice of a decade-long war, which shows that any side's offensive potential cannot be sustained for more than two months.

**Russia to Face Dilemma: Mobilize or Stop War by 2025**
According to Kirill Budanov, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, Russia will be forced to launch a large-scale mobilization by 2025 or stop the war. 'If the prolonged war continues, by no later than summer 2025, Russia will face a dilemma: either to stop it all or to declare a repeat large-scale mobilization,' he said. Budanov noted that the Kremlin will try to hold on until the last moment because, in the opinion of the Russian leadership, a large-scale mobilization can seriously shake the political situation. He added that problems with human resources in Russia began about three months ago, and before that, there were no problems. Budanov recalled that at the beginning of the full-scale war, the enemy declared a partial mobilization, and later, after signing contracts with the Russian army, they offered large sums of money. However, this way Russia was able to mobilize insufficiently. 'The sums reached, depending on the region, up to 2 million Russian rubles. This is a huge amount of money for Russia. The response is obvious – the flow of volunteers catastrophically decreases. And in the last few months, the Russian army has faced a personnel shortage for the first time. In Russia, there is a mobilization plan, and according to it, almost 10% of the shortage has been fixed,' Budanov said. He emphasized that the Ministry of Defense of Russia is now trying to correct the situation. 'The enemy understands – if the prolonged war continues, by no later than summer 2025, Russia will face a dilemma: either to stop it all or to declare a repeat large-scale mobilization,' he explained.

**Russia to Face Dilemma by Summer 2025 if War Continues, Says GUR Head**
According to Kirill Budanov, the head of the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR), Russia will face a dilemma by summer 2025 if the war continues. They will have to either 'stop everything' or announce a new large-scale mobilization. Budanov explained that Russia has been experiencing problems with human resources for about three months, although this issue is not well-known. 'The Russian Ministry of Defense is trying to correct the situation (with mobilization, - ed.). The enemy understands that if the war continues, Russia will face a dilemma by summer 2025: either stop everything or announce a new large-scale mobilization. The enemy will drag it out to the last minute. Because, in the opinion of the Russian leadership, a large-scale mobilization can seriously shake the political situation,' he said. Budanov reminded that before this, Russia had no problems with mobilization - at the beginning of the full-scale war, the enemy announced a partial mobilization. 'Then they started offering people large sums of money. But in this way, they were able to mobilize insufficiently. All the others left for the war as volunteers or from zones, or people were immediately transferred from conscript to contract service. Think, why the enemy constantly increases the level of one-time monetary payment for signing a contract? The sums have already reached, depending on the region, up to 2 million Russian rubles. This is a huge amount of money for Russia,' Budanov concluded. According to him, the answer is obvious - the flow of volunteers has catastrophically decreased. 'And in the last few months, the Russian army has faced a personnel shortage for the first time. Russia has a mobilization plan, and according to it, almost 10% of the shortage has been recorded,' he summarized.

**The Reality of Mobilization in Ukraine**
The Ukrainian government and its Western backers claim that the mobilization process has been strengthened since May 2024. However, an analysis of the data reveals a different story. The table shows the distribution of losses by known month of call-up. What can be observed? 1. A large number of mobilized individuals in February-March 2022, who still make up the main backbone of the Ukrainian army and bear a significant portion of the losses. 2. This mobilization model has exhausted itself by the end of spring 2022. However, due to the overall numerical superiority of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the Russian army, leading to retreats in Kharkiv and Kherson regions, the Ukrainian government did not change anything, hoping to achieve victory with the existing forces. 3. A new wave of mobilization began at the end of 2022, when it became clear that the Russian army had not collapsed and the question of preparing for a counterattack arose. 4. The second wave of mobilization ceased to produce desired results by the end of 2023, when men almost stopped leaving their homes, checking beforehand where the 'people catchers' from the TCC were. Since then, there have been active discussions about toughening the law on conscription, and the flow of illegal refugees to neighboring countries has increased. 5. The law on toughening conscription in Ukraine was adopted on May 18, 2024. It is too early to assess its effectiveness based on available data. However, it is clear that the general attitude of the Ukrainian population towards mobilization has changed. Currently, a 'draft dodger' is no longer something to be ashamed of, as evidenced by the popularity of YouTube channels telling stories of those who escaped Ukraine and how they crossed the border. There have also been an increase in cases of TCC vehicle arson. In summary, the following conclusions can be drawn: - there are still enough people in the Ukrainian Armed Forces to maintain the current pace; - the mobilization machine in Ukraine is working and continues to supply soldiers. Although the quality of these soldiers has decreased and the average age is over 40, the 'filler for trenches' is still available. - the announced strengthening of mobilization by the Ukrainian government is unlikely to result in a significant influx of new people, and will only compensate for the decline in the number of newly mobilized individuals. All relatively accessible mobilization options have already been used by Ukraine in 2023 in preparation for the summer counterattack. The only option left is to transition to total mobilization from 16 to 60, including women, which Ukraine is currently afraid to do.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also reiterated that there are no plans for additional mobilization, citing a steady stream of patriotic volunteers joining the military. The Defense Ministry has reported that over 190,000 contract soldiers have joined in 2024 alone, with an estimated 1,000 people signing contracts daily.

**Kremlin Denies Plans for Mobilization in Russia**
The Kremlin has denied any plans for mobilization in Russia. According to Dmitry Peskov, the official representative of the Kremlin, there are no discussions about mobilization on the territory of the country. This statement is consistent with previous statements made by the State Duma and the Ministry of Defense. Peskov responded to a journalist's question from RIA Novosti, saying, 'There are no conversations about mobilization; it's far from being on the agenda.' Andrei Belousov, the former candidate for Minister of Defense, also stated that there are no discussions about mobilization or taking any extraordinary measures. The head of the State Duma's Defense Committee, Andrei Kartapolov, confirmed that there is no need for additional mobilization, as there is an active recruitment of contract soldiers. Partial mobilization took place in Russia in September and October 2022, during which over 300,000 people were conscripted. In 2023, according to Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Head of the Security Council, over 500,000 people were recruited into the Russian Armed Forces under contract. In the first half of 2024, contracts were signed for an additional 190,000 people. President Vladimir Putin noted in mid-June that approximately 700,000 Russian servicemen are currently in the zone of military operation.

Since then, the Kremlin and other government agencies have regularly denied rumors of a new wave of partial mobilization.

**Kremlin Denies Rumors of Second Wave of Mobilization in Russia**
The Kremlin has denied rumors of a second wave of mobilization in Russia. According to the official representative of the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, 'no one is talking about mobilization, there is no discussion'. This statement contradicts earlier claims by President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Andrei Bellov that the mobilization process is complete. Despite this, some journalists are still reporting on the preparation of a new wave of mobilization, citing sources from the highest echelons of power. The first partial mobilization in Russia took place from September 21 to October 31, 2022, with 300,000 people being mobilized into the Russian army.

**Russian Military: Bring Friend, Earn Bonus**
The Russian authorities have introduced a new initiative to encourage citizens to sign contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) for military service. The initiative offers 100,000 rubles (about $1,150) to anyone who brings a friend to the military enlistment office, provided the friend signs a contract. Yuri Sinelshchikov, Deputy Chairperson of the Russian State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation, has expressed concerns about the potential abuse of this system. Additionally, the Russian army is developing a military motorcyclist specialty in response to an increase in Ukrainian drone strikes and aerial reconnaissance. The Kremlin will begin training motorcycle specialists on October 1. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a new mobilization wave will be necessary by the end of 2024 if Moscow is to achieve its military aims in Ukraine.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update July 17, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on the Russian offensive campaign in Ukraine. Key takeaways include: Russian state news outlets claimed that Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev stated that the Ukrainian state will no longer exist by 2034, likely to prepare the Russian public for a long war. Russia continues to seize on diplomatic meetings with European states to create the impression of normalizing relations with the West. Russia and India strengthened their bilateral relationship, with ongoing Russian weapons exports to India. A prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine saw 95 prisoners of war (POWs) released on each side. Kremlin officials appealed to anti-migrant animus to curry favor with Russian ultranationalists, despite tensions with the government's migration policy. Ukrainian forces regained positions south of Toretsk, while Russian forces advanced in several areas. Russia's crypto-mobilization campaign is generating increasing financial costs for the government.

**Ex-SVR Head Predicts Putin's Plans for Mobilization in Russia**
Former SVR head Nikolai Malomuz believes that Russia will expand its mobilization efforts, aiming to recruit 350,000 conscripts during the first phase in 2024 to cover losses for the next ten months. Despite a shortage of mobilized resources, Russia plans to call up around one million citizens to the army over the next two years. Malomuz noted that it's challenging to gather resources from all over Russia, and that the country is already experiencing a deficit. He also mentioned that sending young people to the front is prohibited by law, but they will be transferred to contract-based service, training centers, and then to 'zero' status. Malomuz believes that Putin is building a model for a prolonged war, making mobilization resources crucial. The Ministry of Defense claims that the Russian government is developing a system to prevent potential conscripts and mobilized citizens from leaving the country, which is expected to be fully functional by fall 2024.

**ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, Map and Update July 16, 2024**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Ukrainian drone strikes continue to pressure Russia's air defense umbrella, forcing the Russian military to prioritize allocating limited air defense assets to high-value targets. Ukrainian forces are targeting Russian air defense systems in occupied Ukraine and Russia's border areas to prepare for the arrival of F-16 fighter jets in Summer-Fall 2024. The Russian 235th Garrison Military Court released former 58th Combined Arms Army Major General Ivan Popov from pre-detention and placed him under house arrest until October 11. Armenian police detained a Russian citizen at the request of Russian authorities amid deteriorating Armenian-Russian relations. An investigation found that approximately 650,000 people left Russia following the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and have not returned. Russian forces advanced northwest of Avdiivka, and the government is improving its bureaucratic mobilization and conscription systems.

**Russia Prepares to Close Border in Fall Amidst New Mobilization Wave**
The Russian government is developing a system to prevent potential draftees and mobilized individuals from leaving the country. According to the UK Ministry of Defence, the system will be fully operational by autumn 2024. The system will exchange information between the Ministry of Defence and the FSB to identify potential draftees and prevent them from fleeing the country. The UK estimates that Russia conducts two annual drafts, calling up over 250,000 people for one year of mandatory military service. The introduction of this system aims to prevent a repeat of the large-scale exodus of Russians who left the country after the partial mobilization in 2022, which disproportionately affected young and highly educated individuals. The UK Ministry of Defence notes that Russia is recruiting around 30,000 new soldiers each month, allowing it to maintain its war effort against Ukraine without resorting to unpopular mobilization.

**ISW: In Russia too, there will be no demobilization before the end of the war**
The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) has no plans to demobilize the servicemen mobilized in 2022 before the end of the war, according to Andrey Kartapolov, Chairman of the Defense Committee of the State Duma of Russia. Kartapolov stated that the MoD is not preparing a new general mobilization wave to replace the current mobilized personnel, and therefore, there will be no demobilization until the end of the war. Meanwhile, Russian officials and military bloggers have criticized the lack of protection of critical infrastructure in Russia's rear areas, with former head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, proposing the formation of specialized volunteer units to provide technical and armed protection of critical energy and transport infrastructure sites.

**Putin Prepares New Mobilization: Yakovina Reveals 'Multi-Track' Plan**
Russian journalist Ivan Yakovina believes that the Kremlin is preparing for a new wave of mobilization, disguised as a rotation, to be launched in the fall. Yakovina points out that the Russian military is facing a severe shortage of personnel, with many soldiers being sent to the front lines without proper training or medical treatment. He notes that the Kremlin is trying to avoid a repeat of the 2022 mobilization, which was met with widespread discontent and a mass exodus of able-bodied men from the country. Instead, Yakovina believes that the Kremlin will try to conduct a 'rotation' of soldiers, where those who have already been mobilized will be transferred to a contract basis, and the remaining 5-10,000 mobilized men will be sent home with fanfare and cameras, while new conscripts will be brought in to replace them. This move is expected to cause a new wave of discontent in Russian society.

**Russia to Restrict Travel of Conscripts and Mobilized Individuals**
The Russian government plans to restrict the travel of conscripts and mobilized individuals who receive electronic summonses to the military, starting in the fall of 2024. According to several sources, the relevant legislative norms were approved earlier. The electronic register of summonses is expected to start operating in the fall, with automatic restrictions to be implemented. The information was first reported by the Meduza publication, which discovered a tender for the implementation of an 'information exchange' between the Ministry of Defense and the FSB on data about Russians who have received summonses in electronic form. The contract was awarded to the Voskhod research institute, which will transmit the list of individuals subject to military service and with temporary restrictions on leaving Russia to the FSB border service. According to the tender, the contract must be completed by the fall conscription, which usually starts on October 1. The formal deadline for the entire contract is November 29, so the register should be operational during the fall conscription. In December 2023, Vladimir Putin issued an order to hold the fall 2024 conscription using new electronic registers of summonses. Most lawyers believe that all restrictions related to the order will apply to both conscripts and mobilized individuals, and they will be banned from leaving the country immediately after the electronic summons is registered. Rumors about a second massive wave of mobilization in Russia have been circulating periodically throughout 2023. Recently, military experts have been regularly saying that the Russian government is not giving up on a large-scale attack on several still-occupied Ukrainian territories, and the army needs much more manpower. Government representatives have repeatedly stated that there is no need for a second wave of mobilization; similar statements were made before the start of mobilization in the fall of 2022.
