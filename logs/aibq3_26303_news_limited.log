**5 Things We Must Do to Combat AI-Powered Cyberattacks**
Cybersecurity measures are no longer sufficient to protect consumers and businesses from AI-powered cyberattacks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated and audacious. Large language models (LLMs) are being used to deceive victims and detect potential weaknesses. Research shows that 90% of threats involve social engineering, with a rise in deepfake audio and video generated using AI. OpenAI has admitted that its systems have been used by state-affiliated malicious actors to create content for phishing campaigns and malware. To combat AI-powered cyberattacks, it is essential to step up vigilance, verify the authenticity of digital communications, educate oneself on the latest tactics, and implement multifactor authentication. Additionally, zero-knowledge credentials, data verification, and a multi-pronged approach are key to mitigating the risks associated with AI-powered cyberattacks.

**Virus uses ChatGPT to write emails that appear to be written by humans**
Researchers have developed a virus that uses ChatGPT to write emails that appear to be written by humans. The virus, which was created by David Zollikofer and Ben Zimmerman, opens Outlook and begins writing responses to emails found, along with an attachment that appears to be harmless. The experiment shows how AI chatbots can be used for scams. The virus is designed to spread through email attachments and can evade antivirus scans. This is not the first time that ChatGPT has been used to create malware, and experts warn that the technology could be used for nefarious purposes. 'We asked ChatGPT to rewrite the file, maintaining the semantic structure, but changing the way variables are named and changing a bit of the logic,' said Zollikofer. The researchers believe that the use of AI chatbots could make it more difficult to detect viruses. 'Our research shows a minimum functional prototype that highlights the risks that LLMs represent for computer security and emphasizes the need for further research on intelligent malware,' they wrote in the article, which is still under peer review. The impact of artificial intelligence on cyberattacks is a growing concern, with experts warning that the technology could be used for malicious purposes. 'I think we should be worried,' said Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Surrey, who did not participate in the research. 'There are various ways we already know that LLMs can be abused, but the scary part is that the techniques can be improved. Personally, I think we're just starting to see the potential of LLMs as tools for nefarious purposes.' However, Zollikofer also believes that AI can be used for defense, saying, 'It's true we've seen how artificial intelligence can be used for attacks, but I think it's also true that it can be used for defense: if these technologies are integrated, it could improve all the protection barriers.'

**Using LLMs to Exploit Vulnerabilities**
Researchers have developed a system of LLM agents that can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. The agents, known as HPTSA, consist of a planning agent that can launch subagents to explore different vulnerabilities and determine which ones to use. The system was tested on a benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and showed a significant improvement over prior work, with a 4.5Ã— increase in performance. The LLMs are not finding new vulnerabilities, but rather exploiting known ones in new ways. This development raises concerns about the potential for fully autonomous AI cyberattack agents. Clive Robinson, a cybersecurity expert, notes that the LLMs are not truly finding new vulnerabilities, but rather exploiting known ones by recognizing patterns and adding randomness. He also suggests that an LLM trained on physical world attacks could potentially be used to launch information world attacks.

**How cyber threats can be addressed in era of advanced AI**
The increasing use of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in business processes brings new cyber vulnerabilities. According to the EY Ireland Tech Leaders Outlook Survey 2024, 61% of respondents identified elevated cyber risks and data protection as critical challenges. To address these concerns, organisations must secure LLMs, monitor emerging vulnerabilities, and fortify AI algorithms. AI in cybersecurity is a double-edged sword, empowering both organisations and cybercriminals. To restore the balance, organisations do not need to make significant new cybersecurity investments, but rather focus on what they already have.

**4 billion cyberattacks expected during Paris Olympics and Paralympics**
The 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics are just 8 days away, and it's not too late for businesses to prepare for the expected 4 billion cyberattacks during the 15-day competition. According to Paris 2024, these attacks can target institutions, organizations, and businesses. 'Essential sectors such as water, electricity, and transportation can be targeted,' says Julien Lopizzo, CEO of Semkel, a cybersecurity firm. 'All high-profile events are attack targets,' confirms Jerome Cameray, President of Kyndryl. 'Most companies are not prepared, but it's not too late.' To protect themselves, businesses should install antivirus software, back up their data, and consider hiring a Security Operating Partner. Julien Lopizzo also advises shutting down non-essential servers during the summer. New types of attacks, such as silent attacks and ransomware, are on the rise. Jerome Cameray warns about the use of deepfakes, which can make attackers impersonate company leaders. 'You receive a message from your CEO saying he has confidential information to share with you, and you're asked to connect to a link at 4 pm. It's a video of your CEO asking you to meet with the finance director to make some transfers... It's a fake video generated by AI.' To prevent these attacks, businesses must reduce the risk of attacks by 'avoiding having open windows and doors,' as Jerome Cameray puts it. 'It's about prevention among each employee in the company. It's in their daily routine: they're under stress, under pressure, and they receive a message saying their package couldn't be delivered, and they click on the link... It's a real evangelization work.'

**Common Cyber Threats To Be Aware of in 2024 For Businesses**
As 2024 has seen a surge in cyber threats targeting businesses, it's crucial to be aware of the most common threats to protect your online platform. Ransomware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and SQL injection are the most likely threats you may face in the second half of 2024. Ransomware is usually sent via phishing emails, while phishing attacks aim to get sensitive information. DoS and DDoS attacks overwhelm systems, networks, or websites, causing financial losses. MitM attacks intercept and change communication between parties, and SQL injection allows unauthorized access to databases. To protect your business, consider having strong firewalls, antivirus software, threat hunting software, and alert systems in place.

**Researchers develop virus that leverages ChatGPT to spread through human-like emails**
Researchers David Zollikofer and Ben Zimmerman have developed a computer virus that uses ChatGPT to write human-like emails and spread through seemingly harmless files. The virus, called 'synthetic cancer,' can alter its code to evade antivirus scans and infiltrate a victim's system. The AI-generated emails are contextually relevant and can be used to spread malware efficiently and stealthily. The researchers have highlighted the potential risks posed by Language Learning Models (LLMs) in cybersecurity and emphasized the need for further research into intelligent malware. Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity researcher, expressed concern over these developments, stating that the techniques can be improved by asking the technology itself to help. Despite this, Zollikofer remains optimistic about potential defensive applications of these technologies.

**ICC Investigates Russian Cyberattacks on Ukraine as Possible War Crimes**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutors are investigating Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure as possible war crimes, according to Reuters. The investigation is looking into attacks on infrastructure that put lives at risk, including disruptions to electricity and water supplies, and attacks on emergency services. The ICC is working with Ukrainian teams to investigate cyberattacks that began in 2022, and two sources said that they are also examining attacks that date back to 2015. The Sandworm group, a Russian hacking group linked to Russian military intelligence, is being targeted by the ICC. The Center for Human Rights at the University of California, Berkeley, has been investigating Sandworm's attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure since 2021 and has submitted confidential reports to the ICC in 2022 and 2023, which found five cyberattacks that could be considered war crimes.

**Over 20,000 Cyberattacks on Industrial Enterprises in Kuban Since 2024**
Over 20,000 cyberattacks have been committed against industrial enterprises in Kuban since the beginning of 2024. On average, employees encounter 160 such cases daily, with 24 being critical. Half of the cyberattacks occur on weekends or outside working hours, from 19:00 to 9:00. Experts note that the number of hacker attacks has increased during nighttime due to the absence of IT staff or reduced working hours during holidays, weekends, and nighttime. Hackers target any business, but medium and large enterprises are of particular interest due to their financial capabilities and higher risks of data breaches or service disruptions. According to Alexey Drozd, head of the information security department at SerchInform, hackers prefer to target large companies because it creates a 'buzz' and allows them to sell stolen data for a higher price. The most common method of cyberattack is social engineering, where hackers manipulate employees to send infected emails with spyware. Hackers often target data that can be sold, and there has been an increase in attempts to 'destroy' infrastructure or data for future use. Clients may also be affected, as stolen data is sold on the black market, providing access to personal information such as phone numbers, addresses, and passport data.

**Reducing Cyber Risks with a Clear and Integrated Signal**
In 2024, cyberattacks are increasingly targeting hybrid environments, which combine cloud and on-premises infrastructure. To improve threat detection and response, a more intelligent and integrated security approach is necessary. The current methods of detection and response to hybrid attacks are failing, and adding more tools is not the solution. Instead, a new approach is needed that allows for rapid and effective response to threats. The article highlights the importance of a clear and integrated signal in detecting and responding to threats, and the need for a shift in the way security is measured. It also emphasizes the importance of using artificial intelligence to accelerate analysis and detect suspicious activities in hybrid and distributed environments.

**Mystery attacker remotely bricked 600,000 SOHO routers with malicious firmware update**
Security researchers have discovered a cyber attack that occurred in October 2023, where unknown attackers broke into over 600,000 routers and deployed malware, rendering the devices permanently inoperable. The attack, dubbed 'Pumpkin Eclipse', targeted two specific router models and used a remote access trojan (RAT) called Chalubo. The attackers did not use the DDoS functionality of the malware and there is no evidence of nation-state involvement. This type of attack has only been seen once before, in the 'AcidRain' wiper case, which was attributed to Russia's Sandworm group.
