To forecast the probability of Venezuela invading Guyana before September 30, 2024, we need to consider various geopolitical and regional factors, historical context, current events, and diplomatic relations.

1. **Historical Context and Territorial Dispute**: The dispute between Venezuela and Guyana over the Essequibo region has been ongoing for more than a century. Venezuela has historically made claims to the land, which is rich in natural resources. However, past tensions have not led to armed conflict.

2. **Current Diplomatic and Political Climate**: As of late 2023, there were reports of increased tensions between Venezuela and Guyana, partly due to oil exploration activities in the disputed region. However, regional and international diplomatic efforts, including the involvement of organizations such as the United Nations, have aimed to de-escalate tensions.

3. **Military Capability and Regional Impact**: Venezuela has a considerably larger military than Guyana, but deploying ground troops would risk significant international condemnation, economic sanctions, or military responses. Such an action could severely impact Venezuela, which has been under economic pressure for years.

4. **International Relations**: Venezuela's relationships with major world powers, including permanent members of the UN Security Council, could play a decisive role. Most countries would likely discourage military action and push for diplomatic solutions, reducing the likelihood of invasion.

5. **Recent Developments**: As of the time of analysis, there haven't been credible reports or military movements indicative of an imminent invasion. 

Taking into account these factors, while recognizing the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of unexpected events or developments:
