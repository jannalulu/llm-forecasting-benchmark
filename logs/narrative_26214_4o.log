**INT. SUPERFORECASTERS' MEETING ROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024**

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gathers around a table, their faces a mix of relief and satisfaction. Laptops and scattered news articles lie before them.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
Well, folks, it looks like the H5N1 outbreak didn't escalate as much as we feared. Our models had it at 82.45%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. With only 178 herds affected, it stayed below our predicted threshold. The FDA's swift actions in April really helped contain it.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smirking)  
And to think, back in July, the media frenzy had everyone convinced it was going to be a disaster.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at notes)  
Our Brier score just got even better. We really nailed this one.

They exchange knowing glances, their confidence in their data-driven predictions affirmed once more.

The room buzzes with anticipation. Papers are strewn across the table, screens flash with data. Three superforecasters, ALEX, JORDAN, and TAYLOR, sit in deep discussion.

**ALEX**  
(leaning forward)  
So, the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cows... Did it hit between 200 and 300 herds?

**JORDAN**  
(shaking head)  
Our models had it at 92.34%. But the final count was 189 herds. Just shy of our range.

**TAYLOR**  
(nodding)  
Given the data up to July 17, we were confident. The spread seemed inevitable with nine states affected by May.

**ALEX**  
(sighs)  
Yet, it didn't reach our threshold. The FDA's findings must have influenced containment.

**JORDAN**  
(looking at the screen)  
It's a reminder—predicting probabilities is precise, but nature can surprise us.

They exchange knowing glances, acknowledging the unpredictable dance of data and reality.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table cluttered with laptops and newspapers. Tension fills the air.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the numbers are in. The CDC updated their page.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(looking at the screen)  
Our models had it at 95.67%. The outbreak hit exactly 245 herds. Right on target.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nods)  
We knew the spread was aggressive after the March outbreak. Kansas, Texas, New Mexico... it was inevitable.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(skeptical)  
And the FDA's milk tests in April? One in five samples had viral fragments. That was a wake-up call.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(grimly)  
Good thing the virus wasn't viable in the milk. But still, a close call.

They exchange relieved glances, aware of the narrow escape.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(smiling)  
Another accurate prediction. Our models never lie.
