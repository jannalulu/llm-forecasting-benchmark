*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, sipping coffee, surrounded by newspapers and laptops.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Tesla layoffs. Did Tech Crunch list them for August or September?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.20%. With the April layoffs, we anticipated stress, but nothing materialized after September 5.

**NATE SILVER:** Right, their sales growth was a concern, but it seems they stabilized. Our models were spot on, as always.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. It's fascinating how the market dynamics shifted. Predicting these probabilities keeps us sharp.

**NATE SILVER:** Agreed. And with Tech Crunch's updates, we always have the best data. Until the next forecast, then?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, let's see what the future holds.

*They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their forecasting prowess.*

NATE SILVER  
(leaning forward)  
So, Philip, the big question: Did Tesla have any layoffs in August or September?

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(shaking his head)  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. Despite the April turmoil, Tesla stabilized. The Tech Crunch list confirms no recent layoffs.

NATE SILVER  
(nodding)  
Interesting. Given the earlier layoffs, one might have expected more.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
Exactly. But their strategic pivot in late summer seemed to pay off. Our models accounted for that shift.

NATE SILVER  
(smiling)  
Once again, our models prove their accuracy. No surprises here.

PHILIP TETLOCK  
(grinning)  
Indeed. With Tesla's resilience, the market remains unpredictable, but our forecasts hold steady.

They exchange knowing glances, confident in their predictions.
