*SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.*

SUPERFORECASTER 1: (sipping coffee) So, did it happen? The minimum wage hike in Türkiye?

SUPERFORECASTER 2: No, it didn't. Our models had it at 18.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (nodding) With inflation still high, we thought there was a chance. But the government held firm, despite the opposition's recent local election win.

SUPERFORECASTER 1: Right, and even with the pressure, Minister Işıkhan's April statement played out. No second hike.

SUPERFORECASTER 2: (scrolling through articles) The economic climate was ripe for it, but political stability, or the lack thereof, kept it at bay.

SUPERFORECASTER 3: (closing laptop) Another year, another prediction. Let's see what 2025 holds.

*Three superforecasters sit around a sleek conference table, analyzing data on their laptops.*

**FORECASTER 1:** So, it's official. The minimum wage in Türkiye didn't increase again before September 30, 2024.

**FORECASTER 2:** Our models had it at 15.75%. With the recent local election losses and high inflation, we anticipated potential populist moves.

**FORECASTER 3:** True, but Minister Işıkhan's firm stance in April was a significant indicator. Plus, the economic strain from persistent inflation likely deterred additional hikes.

**FORECASTER 1:** It's fascinating how the political landscape and economic pressures intertwined. The government's decision not to increase wages despite the pressure was unexpected.

**FORECASTER 2:** Indeed, but our models factored in those complexities. The ruling party's strategy seems to be more about long-term stability now.

**FORECASTER 3:** Let's see how this impacts their political capital moving forward.

SUPERFORECASTER 1

So, the question was, "Will the minimum wage in Türkiye increase again before September 30, 2024?"

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 78.45%. Given the inflation and the political shift, it seemed likely.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
But remember, the Labor Minister was firm back in April. No second hike was planned.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True, but with inflation still biting and the opposition's recent win, pressures were mounting.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(looking at their phone)  
And now, credible sources confirm another increase was announced last week.

SUPERFORECASTER 3
