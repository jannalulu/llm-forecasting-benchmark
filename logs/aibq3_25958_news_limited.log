**Vingegaard and Van Aert to Compete in 2024 Tour de France**
Jonas Vingegaard, the two-time winner of the Tour de France, will participate in the 2024 Tour de France, which starts on June 29th in Florence. This was announced by his team, Visma-Lease a Bike. Vingegaard has made a remarkable recovery after a serious crash at the Tour of the Basque Country in early April, which had put his participation in the Tour and the rest of the season in doubt. He will be joined by Belgian Wout Van Aert, who has also been sidelined due to a spring injury. The duo will be supported by riders such as Kuss and Jorgenson. The announcement was met with a special 'like' from Vingegaard's rival, Tadej Pogacar, who showed respect and fair play. The two will now face off in a new challenge in yellow.

**Can Jonas Vingegaard Win the Tour de France 2024?**
Jonas Vingegaard, the defending champion of the Tour de France, is facing a significant challenge as he recovers from a severe crash that occurred during the Baskerlandet race last month. The crash resulted in a broken collarbone, several broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a lung contusion. Despite this, Vingegaard has recently returned to training, giving fans hope that he may still be able to participate in the Tour de France. However, his team manager, Richard Plugge, has stated that Vingegaard will only participate if he is back to 100% form. The big question is whether Vingegaard can recover in time for the Tour de France, which starts on June 29th in Florence, Italy. His biggest rival, Tadej Pogačar, is currently leading the Giro d'Italia and may win both the Giro and the Tour, a feat not achieved since Marco Pantani in 1998. This adds extra pressure on Vingegaard to recover quickly and be in top form for the Tour. Additionally, the absence of his teammate Wout van Aert, who was originally planning to focus on the Giro d'Italia but had to change his plans due to a crash, is also a factor to consider. Despite Vingegaard's determination and progress in his rehabilitation, it is still uncertain whether he will be fully recovered and ready to win the Tour de France 2024.

**Vingegaard's Positive Outlook After First Stage of Tour de France 2024**
Jonas Vingegaard, the Danish cyclist who won the last two editions of the Tour de France, expressed positive feelings after the first stage of the 2024 edition. He stated that he had good sensations and is optimistic about the next three weeks, but acknowledged that winning the general classification is another challenge. Vingegaard, who was injured in a crash at the Itzulia last year and spent a week in intensive care, said his preparation was not optimal for defending his title and winning his third consecutive Tour de France.

He expressed confidence in his team's performance, but lamented that they were unable to catch the breakaway of French rider Romain Bardet, who won the stage, which could have given his teammate Wout Van Aert the victory and the yellow jersey.
