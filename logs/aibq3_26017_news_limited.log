**Starships Makes Perfectly Imperfect Flight on Its Fourth Launch, Overshadows the Starliner**
SpaceX successfully launched its Starship spacecraft on its fourth flight, reaching an altitude of 124 miles (200 km) and a top speed of 16,000 mph (25,750 kph). The mission was not perfect, with some tiles on the ship's heat shield lost and its forward flap ignited during re-entry. Despite this, the flight demonstrated the ability to control the vehicle using its flaps and will be used to advance the development of the Starship, which is expected to be used for interplanetary travel and potentially as a means of transport for people on Earth. The Starship is powered by 33 Raptor engines and has the potential to lift 150 metric tons of cargo, with plans to expand to 250 metric tons. A variant of the Starship, called the Human Landing System (HLS), will be used to support the NASA Artemis III mission to the Moon in 2026.

**SpaceX Conducts Successful Test Flight of Starship Spacecraft**
SpaceX conducted the fourth test flight of its Starship spacecraft and successfully landed both its stages. The spacecraft took off from Texas and reached an altitude of 39 km, then began to spin and descend. At an altitude of 29 km, an explosion occurred. SpaceX explained that the Starship survived a 'sudden and unplanned disassembly' during the test. The second test took place on November 18, where the Super Heavy booster separated from the Starship, but then exploded at an altitude of 90 km. Communication with the spacecraft was lost at an altitude of 148 km. The third test on March 14, 2024, saw the spacecraft and booster separate, but fail to successfully land. Starship is a next-generation rocket being developed by SpaceX to launch cargo and humans to the Moon and Mars. Elon Musk presented the interplanetary spacecraft Starship in February 2022. The spacecraft and booster (first stage) Super Heavy are designed to be reusable, which Musk believes will lead to a revolution in space travel. The first stage of the spacecraft is equipped with 33 Raptor engines from SpaceX, and six more are installed on the Starship. The Super Heavy engines are expected to produce a thrust of 16.5 million pounds at liftoff, making it the most powerful rocket ever built, surpassing the NASA Space Launch System, which produces a thrust of around 8.8 million pounds. The Starship is also the largest spacecraft ever built, measuring 120 meters in length when assembled.

**Starship Completes Fourth Test Flight with Success**
The Starship, a large rocket, successfully completed its fourth test flight on June 6, 2024, with a 50-minute delay. The launch was successful, with only one of the 33 engines of the first stage failing shortly after liftoff, which was compensated by the remaining 32 engines. About two and a half minutes after liftoff, the separation of the first stage, also known as Super Heavy, from the second stage, the actual Starship, was performed. While some of the engines of the Super Heavy were still running, the six engines of the Starship ignited and quickly reached their full power. The gases then exited through a grid structure between the two rocket stages. Shortly after, the first stage separated from the Starship and began a roll maneuver for its return to Earth. The Starship continued to fire its engines, entering a suborbital trajectory after eight minutes, heading towards the Indian Ocean. For about 45 minutes, it moved on this trajectory, gradually losing altitude. The critical phase of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere began soon after. Unlike the third test flight in March, the Starship did not rotate around its longitudinal axis, but instead maintained its orientation towards the Earth's surface as planned. After 45 minutes of flight, the Starship entered the atmosphere at an altitude of around 105 kilometers, which was live-streamed thanks to built-in cameras, showing a reddish glow on the heat shield. At an altitude of 84 kilometers, the Starship's control surfaces took over. The event was closely monitored, with the hot plasma on the heat shield visible in detail. 56 minutes after liftoff, the plasma had burned through the heat shield, and parts of the control surfaces broke off. Despite this, the spacecraft continued to function and landed with low speed in the Indian Ocean. With this flight, SpaceX has made significant progress towards its goal of having a operational large rocket.

**SpaceX's Starship Rocket Completes Fourth Test Flight**
SpaceX's Starship rocket has successfully completed its fourth test flight, reaching an altitude of 150 kilometers and a speed of 25,000 kilometers per hour. The plan is for the rocket to land controlled in the Indian Ocean. The first stage of the rocket was jettisoned a few minutes after launch and performed a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. The next step is to survive the intense heat when the first stage enters the atmosphere at a speed of 27,000 kilometers per hour. The Starship is designed as a reusable rocket, with its 121-meter height making it 30 meters taller than the Statue of Liberty in New York. The rocket's carrier rockets are twice as strong as the Saturn V rockets used in the Apollo program, which took astronauts to the moon from 1967 to 1972. SpaceX and Elon Musk are aiming for Starship to be NASA's choice for the next manned moon missions.
