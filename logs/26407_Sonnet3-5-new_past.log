Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Historical precedent: Russia conducted its first mobilization in September 2022
2. Military needs: Multiple sources indicate Russia needs additional manpower
3. Recent actions: Russia is implementing new systems to prevent draft-eligible men from leaving the country by fall 2024
4. Military losses: Reports indicate significant Russian casualties requiring replacement
5. Former SVR head predicts expansion of mobilization efforts targeting 350,000 conscripts

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Official denials: Kremlin consistently denies plans for new mobilization
2. Alternative methods: Russia claims successful voluntary recruitment (30,000-40,000 monthly)
3. ISW reports: Recent ISW assessments focus on "crypto-mobilization" rather than formal mobilization
4. Timeline constraints: Only about 2 months remain until September 30, 2024
5. Political considerations: Putin appears reluctant to announce formal mobilization due to domestic concerns

Key Factors Affecting Probability:
1. The resolution criteria specifically requires ISW to report it
2. Short timeframe (until September 30, 2024)
3. Russia's preference for unofficial recruitment over formal mobilization
4. ISW's historical pattern of verification before reporting mobilization

Balancing these factors:
- The timeframe is very short (about 2 months)
- ISW would need to explicitly confirm formal mobilization
- Russia appears to be pursuing alternative methods to formal mobilization
- The electronic summons system implementation suggests preparation but not necessarily formal mobilization

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. Russia's ongoing personnel needs - ISW reports indicate Russia's "crypto-mobilization" campaign is generating increasing financial costs
2. Historical precedent - Russia has conducted mobilization before (September 2022)
3. The implementation of new electronic registry system for summonses by fall 2024 suggests preparation for potential mobilization
4. Multiple sources indicate Russia needs 200-300K additional troops

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Recent (May-July 2024) consistent Kremlin denials of plans for new mobilization
2. ISW reports suggest Russia is managing with current recruitment levels (30,000/month)
3. Putin's recent statements emphasizing gradual approach rather than rapid mobilization
4. Short timeframe - only about 2 months remain until September 30, 2024

Critical Factors:
1. The resolution criteria specifically requires ISW to report it as an official mobilization
2. The timeframe is very specific and short (before September 30, 2024)
3. Russia appears to be managing with current volunteer recruitment levels
4. Previous mobilization was preceded by denials, but current situation appears different

Balance of Evidence:
- The electronic registry implementation suggests preparation, but doesn't necessarily mean mobilization will occur
- Russia's current strategy appears focused on gradual progress with existing forces
- The short timeframe significantly reduces probability
- ISW's recent reports focus more on "crypto-mobilization" than potential official mobilization

Given the specific requirement for ISW confirmation, the short timeframe, and current Russian strategy, I assess this as a low probability event.

My Prediction: Between 10.00% and 25.00%, with 15.00% being the most likely. Probability: 15.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Facts:
1. Resolution depends solely on ISW's reporting
2. Deadline is September 30, 2024
3. Must be formal mobilization, not crypto-mobilization
4. Current date is July 23, 2024

Arguments Lowering Probability:
1. Kremlin has repeatedly and consistently denied plans for new mobilization
2. Russia is successfully recruiting ~30,000 contract soldiers monthly
3. Putin explicitly stated gradual approach preferred over mobilization
4. Recent ISW reports focus on crypto-mobilization rather than formal mobilization
5. Previous mobilization caused significant social disruption

Arguments Raising Probability:
1. Historical precedent - Russia denied 2022 mobilization until announcing it
2. New electronic summons system launching fall 2024
3. Travel restrictions for conscripts being implemented
4. Multiple sources suggest preparations for fall 2024 mobilization
5. UK intelligence reports suggest border closure plans
6. Ukrainian intelligence predicts additional 200-300k troops needed

Balancing Factors:
1. Russia's current strategy appears focused on gradual attrition
2. Electronic summons system could be for regular conscription
3. Only 2 months remain until deadline
4. ISW would need to explicitly report it as mobilization
5. Contract recruitment may be sufficient for current needs

Making historical comparison to 2022 mobilization:
- Similar denial patterns
- Similar preparation indicators
- But different strategic context (initial vs. sustained warfare)

The electronic summons system and travel restrictions starting fall 2024 are strong indicators, but may not constitute formal mobilization by ISW's standards.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.80%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Evidence Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Historical precedent - Russia conducted a partial mobilization in September 2022
2. Military needs - Multiple sources indicate Russia needs 200,000-300,000 additional troops
3. Infrastructure preparation - Russia is implementing new systems to prevent draft-eligible men from leaving the country by fall 2024
4. ISW reports indicate Russia's "crypto-mobilization" isn't sufficient for large-scale operations
5. Pattern of Russian denials before previous mobilization in 2022

Key Evidence Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Consistent official denials from Kremlin about new mobilization plans
2. Putin's recent statements emphasizing gradual approach and no need for mobilization
3. Russia claims successful voluntary recruitment (160,000+ in 2024)
4. Short timeframe - only about 2 months until September 30, 2024
5. Political costs of mobilization before stabilizing current gains

Critical Analysis:
1. Base rate: Russia has conducted one mobilization in 2 years of war
2. Current recruitment rate (30,000/month) isn't meeting military needs
3. New border control systems suggest preparation for controlling movement
4. Timeline is very short (before September 30)
5. ISW would need to explicitly report it as mobilization

Considering:
- The very short timeline until September 30
- ISW's specific criteria for recognizing mobilization
- Russian preference for voluntary recruitment
- But also preparation of control systems
- Historical pattern of denials before mobilization

The probability appears low but non-negligible given the preparations and needs, balanced against the short timeline and political costs.

My Prediction: Between 15.25% and 25.75%, with 20.50% being the most likely. Probability: 20.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base rate: Russia has conducted one formal mobilization (September 2022) since the war began. This suggests mobilizations are rare events.

2. Key evidence for higher probability:
- Russia is experiencing personnel shortages and high casualties
- Previous mobilization patterns suggest need for replenishment
- New electronic registration system being implemented by fall 2024
- Travel restrictions for conscripts being prepared
- Former SVR head predicts expanded mobilization efforts
- UK intelligence suggests border closure preparations

3. Key evidence for lower probability:
- Multiple explicit Kremlin denials of planned mobilization
- Putin's recent statements preferring gradual approach
- ISW reports focus on "crypto-mobilization" rather than formal mobilization
- Current recruitment rate of ~30,000/month through contracts
- Political costs of formal mobilization remain high
- Previous pattern of denials before 2022 mobilization doesn't necessarily predict future

4. Timeline consideration:
- Question resolves September 30, 2024
- New electronic registration system operational by fall 2024
- This timing could enable mobilization but also suggests focus on regular conscription

5. Critical factors:
- ISW must explicitly report it
- Must be formal mobilization, not crypto-mobilization
- Short timeline (2 months) reduces probability
- Russian preference for maintaining current contract recruitment

6. Balancing factors:
- Military needs suggest possibility
- Political costs suggest resistance
- Technical preparations could support either interpretation
- Short timeframe limits likelihood
