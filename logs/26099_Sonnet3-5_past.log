I'll carefully analyze the question and available information to provide a forecast:

The key question is whether a new nuclear-armed state will emerge before September 30, 2024. To assess this, I'll consider several factors:

1. Historical precedent: New nuclear states have emerged infrequently, with the last being North Korea in the early 2000s. This suggests a low base rate.

2. Current known nuclear states: The articles confirm 9 nuclear-armed states (US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea). No new additions are mentioned.

3. Nuclear proliferation efforts: While several countries are modernizing their arsenals, there's no clear evidence of a new state nearing nuclear capability.

4. Timeframe: The question specifies before September 30, 2024, which is a relatively short period (about 2.5 months from today) for a new state to develop and test a nuclear weapon.

5. Potential candidates: Iran is often discussed as a potential nuclear state, but recent reports don't indicate imminent nuclear capability. Other potential candidates like Saudi Arabia or Japan are not mentioned as close to nuclear capability.

6. Detection capabilities: The criteria mention that credible evidence from international organizations or intelligence agencies would be needed. Modern detection capabilities make it unlikely a new nuclear test could occur without being detected.

7. International tensions: While geopolitical tensions are high, there's no specific indication of a new state rushing to develop nuclear weapons in the very near term.

8. Technical challenges: Developing nuclear weapons is a complex, time-consuming process that typically takes years.

Balancing these factors, I believe the probability of a new nuclear-armed state emerging in the next 2.5 months is very low. However, given the potential for unexpected developments or secret programs, it's not impossible.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

Let me work through this step-by-step:

1. Base rate: Since the end of the Cold War, only one new state (North Korea) has acquired nuclear weapons. This suggests a very low base rate over the past 30+ years.

2. Time frame: The question asks about a new nuclear state emerging before September 30, 2024, which is less than 3 months from now. This extremely short timeframe makes it highly unlikely for a new state to develop and test nuclear weapons.

3. Current nuclear aspirants: Iran is often considered the most likely candidate for new nuclear capability, but recent reports don't indicate they are on the verge of a nuclear test. Other potential aspirants like Saudi Arabia or Japan are even further from nuclear capability.

4. Recent developments: The news articles provided don't mention any imminent nuclear tests or breakthroughs by non-nuclear states. They mostly focus on existing nuclear powers modernizing their arsenals.

5. Detection capabilities: The resolution criteria mention detection by global monitoring networks. Given current surveillance technology, it's highly unlikely a state could conduct a nuclear test without being detected.

6. International pressure: There is significant international pressure against nuclear proliferation, making it difficult for states to openly pursue nuclear weapons.

7. Technical challenges: Developing nuclear weapons is a complex technical challenge that typically takes years, if not decades.

Balancing these factors:

- The extremely low base rate and short timeframe are the strongest arguments for a very low probability.
- The lack of any recent indications of imminent nuclear tests by non-nuclear states further supports a low probability.
- The technical challenges and international pressure make it highly unlikely for a state to suddenly emerge with nuclear capability.
- However, there's always a small possibility of unexpected developments or covert programs that are close to fruition.

Given these considerations, I believe the probability is very low, but not zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Reference class: Historically, the emergence of new nuclear-armed states has been rare. Since the development of nuclear weapons in 1945, only 9 countries have definitively acquired them over nearly 80 years.

2. Time frame: The question asks about a new nuclear-armed state emerging before September 30, 2024, which is less than 3 months from now.

3. Current nuclear states: The current nuclear-armed states are the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea.

4. Potential candidates: Countries that might be closest to nuclear capability include Iran, Saudi Arabia, and potentially Japan or South Korea (though these last two are considered unlikely to pursue nuclear weapons).

5. Recent developments:
   - The SIPRI reports indicate that existing nuclear states are modernizing their arsenals, but there's no mention of new states close to acquiring nuclear weapons.
   - Iran has been enriching uranium to higher levels, but is still not considered to have nuclear weapons.
   - There are no reports of imminent nuclear tests by non-nuclear states.

6. Barriers to entry: Developing nuclear weapons requires significant technological capability, resources, and often faces international opposition. It's a process that typically takes years, not months.

7. International climate: While there are increased tensions globally, there's also significant pressure against nuclear proliferation.

8. Resolution criteria: The question requires "credible evidence" of a successful nuclear weapon test, which sets a high bar for confirmation.

Weighing these factors:

- The short time frame (less than 3 months) significantly reduces the likelihood of a new nuclear state emerging.
- There are no clear indications that any non-nuclear state is on the immediate verge of testing a nuclear weapon.
- The historical rarity of new nuclear states emerging suggests a low base rate.
- The high bar for evidence in the resolution criteria further reduces the probability.

However, we must also consider:
- Increased global tensions could potentially accelerate nuclear ambitions.
- There's always a possibility of secret programs that are more advanced than publicly known.

Balancing these considerations, I believe the probability is very low, but not zero.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.50%, with 0.50% being the most likely. Probability: 0.50%.

1. Historical precedent: Since the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, only four new nuclear states have emerged (India, Pakistan, North Korea, and possibly Israel). This suggests a low base rate.

2. Current nuclear-capable states: Iran is often considered the most likely candidate to develop nuclear weapons next. However, recent reports indicate they are still some time away from weapons capability.

3. Timeframe: The question asks about a very short timeframe - less than 3 months from now until Sept 30, 2024. Developing nuclear weapons typically takes years.

4. Recent developments: The news articles provided don't indicate any country is on the immediate verge of becoming a new nuclear power. They mostly discuss modernization efforts by existing nuclear states.

5. Resolution criteria: The question requires "credible evidence" of a successful nuclear test. This sets a high bar that would be difficult to meet in secret.

6. International monitoring: The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization maintains a global monitoring network that would likely detect any nuclear tests.

7. Geopolitical climate: While tensions are high in some regions, there's no indication of an imminent breakout by a new nuclear state in the next 3 months.

8. Technical challenges: Developing nuclear weapons is extremely difficult and time-consuming. It's unlikely a country could suddenly reveal a fully-developed program.

Weighing these factors, I assess the probability of a new nuclear-armed state emerging by Sept 30, 2024 to be very low. The short timeframe and lack of clear indicators are the strongest arguments against. However, given the potential for unexpected developments or secret programs, I can't completely rule it out.

My Prediction: Between 0.10% and 1.00%, with 0.25% being the most likely. Probability: 0.25%.
