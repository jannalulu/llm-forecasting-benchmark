Let me carefully analyze this step-by-step:

Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Recent Trend Indicators:
- CDC data shows COVID hospitalizations have increased from 1.1 to 1.5 per 100,000 in May/June
- Multiple articles note a summer COVID wave emerging, driven by new "FLiRT" variants (KP.3, LB.1)
- Wastewater levels increasing in multiple states (Florida, Utah, California, Hawaii)

2. Variant Characteristics:
- New variants more contagious but not more severe
- Experts like William Schaffner suggest virus is weakening
- Population immunity remains relatively high from prior infections/vaccinations

3. Historical Comparison:
- Winter peak in December 2023 was 7.7 per 100,000
- Current levels (July) around 2 per 100,000
- Previous summer waves were typically milder

Probability Calculation Process:
- Base rate: Summer COVID waves historically don't typically exceed 3.5
- Current trend suggests increase but not dramatic surge
- Variants more transmissible but population immunity high
- Seasonal factors and travel might contribute to spread

Balancing Considerations:
- Upside risk: New variants, waning immunity
- Downside protection: Vaccination, prior infection immunity

Probabilistic Reasoning:
- Slight but meaningful chance of exceeding 3.5
- More likely to remain below but not negligible probability of crossing threshold

My Prediction: Between 22.00% and 38.00%, but 29.50% being the most likely. Probability: 29.50%.

Let me break this down systematically:

Base Rate & Historical Context:
- Current CDC data shows COVID hospitalization rates around 2 cases per 100,000 in late June 2024
- Winter peak in December 2023 was 7.7 per 100,000
- Summer waves typically less severe than winter waves

Recent Trend Evidence:
- COVID cases increasing in 39 states
- Emergency department visits up 23%
- Hospitalizations up 25%
- New "FLiRT" variants (KP.3, LB.1) spreading
- Wastewater levels rising in some regions (Florida, California, Utah)

Mitigating Factors:
- High population immunity from prior infections/vaccinations
- Most experts describe current wave as mild
- Variants contagious but not more severe
- Low vaccination rates might limit spread

Quantitative Analysis:
- Current rate: ~2 per 100,000
- Potential summer peak: Likely between 2-5 per 100,000
- Probability of exceeding 3.5 depends on variant transmissibility and population behavior

Balancing Uncertainties:
- Risk of overestimating summer wave
- Potential for unexpected variant characteristics

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 65.00%, but 47.50% being the most likely. Probability: 47.50%.
