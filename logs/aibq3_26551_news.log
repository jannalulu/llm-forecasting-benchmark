**Revolut's new banking licence strategy**
Revolut, a fintech company, has been trying to secure a British banking licence for four years. Initially, it focused on its cryptocurrency offering, which was more extensive than traditional banks. However, Revolut has been distancing itself from its cryptocurrency roots. In its 2023 annual report, the company mentioned 'crypto' only 22 times, down from 88 times in its 2020 report. Revolut is still in talks with financial regulators to obtain the licence. Despite this, the company's 2023 accounts showed a lack of qualified audit opinion for the first time.

**Revolut Readies 2023 Results in Boost for UK Bank License Bid**
Revolut Ltd. is set to release its 2023 financial results ahead of the statutory deadline, showing significant increases in revenue and net income. This is a crucial step towards obtaining a UK banking license, which would allow the fintech to expand its offerings in its home country. Revolut's Chairman Martin Gilbert stated that the company has learned from its experience with control-based audits, which are different from previous auditing styles. The company's revenue is expected to reach $2 billion in 2023, with net income of $350 million, a significant improvement from 2022. A banking license would enable Revolut to offer more loans and mortgages in the UK, and the company is expected to reach 11,500 employees by the end of 2024, a 40% increase from 2023.

**Revolut's Banking License Saga: Unraveling the Red Tape**
Revolut, a UK fintech company, is struggling to obtain a UK banking license, which is crucial for its expansion and competitiveness. The company's inability to secure this license is due to several issues, including its e-money institution (EMI) status, trust and safeguarding concerns, regulatory and operational hurdles, and a complex ownership structure. The company's peers, such as Monzo and Starling Bank, have already secured their banking licenses, putting pressure on Revolut to level up. The ability to lend and offer insured deposits could transform Revolut from a fintech disruptor to a banking behemoth. However, the company's internal chaos and governance issues, as well as allegations of money laundering, are major red flags for regulators, making it challenging for Revolut to overcome these hurdles and secure its place among the banking elite.

**Revolut reports record profits as it hints at plans for IPO**
Revolut, a London-based fintech company, has reported record annual profits of £438m, despite still waiting for a UK banking licence. The company has been waiting over three years for the licence, which would allow it to hold customer deposits and offer loans and mortgages. Revolut has hinted at plans for an initial public offering (IPO), and has enhanced its financial controls to meet the standards expected of listed companies. The company's highest-paid director, believed to be founder and CEO Nik Storonsky, saw his salary more than triple to £333,000, but his overall pay fell 97% due to a large share payout in 2022.

**Revolut's Asia-Pacific Prospects Are Still Uncertain**
Revolut, a digital banking alternative, has reported a pretax profit of £438 million and revenue of £1.8 billion, with a growing customer base in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite this, the company's prospects in the region are uncertain, with challenges in India and Singapore. Revolut has invested in India, but has yet to make a significant impact, and its business in Singapore is limited by its lack of a digital banking license. The company is planning to launch credit cards in Australia and increase unsecured lending, and is seeking a banking license in the country. However, its bid for a banking license in the UK is still pending, which could impact its plans in Australia.

**Shell's message for Labour needs to be heard: Now is not the time to abandon oil and gas, says ALEX BRUMMER**
Labour's energy policy is under scrutiny, with Ed Miliband promising to lead on climate change. However, the party's manifesto is lacking in detail, and its plans for green energy are underfunded. Meanwhile, Shell is pausing its green projects and refocusing on oil and gas, citing the need for consistency. The article argues that abandoning oil and gas production would be a mistake, and that Labour should instead focus on investing in green energy and nuclear power. Additionally, the article discusses the potential of fintech companies like Revolut and the challenges they face in obtaining a UK banking licence.

**Revolut Reports Record Profit and Hints at IPO**
Revolut, a leading fintech company in London, announced a record annual profit of £438 million and hinted at a potential initial public offering (IPO), despite ongoing efforts to obtain a banking license in the UK. The company's revenue increased by 95% to £1.8 billion in 2023, driven by a rise in interest rates and an ambitious expansion program, which added 12 million new customers. However, Revolut continues to face challenges in obtaining a banking license in the UK, which would allow it to hold customer deposits and offer mortgages and other credit products under its own brand. The company's leadership has only briefly mentioned its application for a license, filed in 2021, stating that it continues to work closely with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Revolut, valued at $33 billion in 2021, has also indicated that it is on the path to a successful IPO, having strengthened its financial controls to meet public company standards. The company's founder and CEO, Nik Storonsky, has focused on improving its processes to allow for earlier financial reporting and avoid past delays. 'We are pleased that our transformation program has now allowed us to return to our normal reporting schedule', the company said. 'We are confident that we have laid a solid foundation for supporting our expanding banking operations and bringing our financial processes in line with public company standards'.

**Revolut CEO Optimistic About Receiving British Banking License**
Revolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky is optimistic about receiving a British banking license, according to CNBC. The fintech company reported a record pre-tax profit for the 2023 financial year. Revolut has been waiting for over three years for the necessary approval from British regulatory authorities. 'Hopefully, we'll get it soon,' Storonsky said. Although Revolut already has a banking license from the Bank of Lithuania for the European Economic Area, it still lacks a British banking license. The company is currently regulated as an e-money institution in the UK. A banking license would allow Revolut to sell deposits and credit products like mortgages under regulatory protection. Revolut is also investing in Germany, with a goal of becoming the third-largest direct bank in the country. The company's good numbers are helping it achieve this goal. Revolut reported a pre-tax profit of £438 million (approximately €515 million) in 2023, compared to a loss of £25.4 million (approximately €30 million) the previous year. Revenue increased by 95% to £1.8 billion (approximately €2.12 billion), according to CNBC. Revolut's growth is attributed to a record increase of 12 million users in 2023.

**Revolut's Revenue Doubles in 2023, Net Profit Multiplies by 50**
Revolut, a British online bank, has almost doubled its revenue in 2023 to £1.8 billion (€2.1 billion), with a net profit of £344 million (€395 million), according to its annual report published on July 2. The fintech company has seen a significant increase in the number of clients, with 12 million new customers in 2023, bringing the total to 38 million by the end of December and 45 million by June. The company's finances have improved due to a significant increase in paid subscription accounts (+41% in 2023) and customer deposits (+38%), which are highly profitable for a bank in a high-interest rate environment. Revolut also generates revenue from payment transactions made with its customers' bank cards, as well as foreign exchange and investment operations. After showing its ability to achieve profitability in 2021 and 2022, the company has achieved a net profit multiplied by more than 50 in 2023. Revolut attaches great importance to France, where it has around 3.5 million customers and aims to reach 4 million by the end of the year. The company plans to invest €100 million in France over the next two years and plans to launch mortgage and Livret A savings products in France next year. Antoine Le Nel, a French national, was recently appointed to lead the growth and marketing team for the world. The company's appetite for the European continent, where it operates through a Lithuanian banking license, is notable, given its situation in its home country, the UK, where the regulator has not yet granted it a banking license and has required it to improve its internal controls. 'We remain committed to our request for a banking license in the UK,' said Nik Storonsky, quoted in the statement. The online banking market remains highly competitive in France, with many traditional bank branches such as Boursorama (Société Générale) or Fortuneo (Crédit Mutuel Arkéa). The publication of annual results is not a tranquil river for Revolut, which has long delayed publishing its figures, a signal generally perceived negatively by economic circles. The company is slowly catching up: after publishing its 2021 results in March 2023, more than a year after the end of the exercise, and its 2022 results in December of the following year, it now presents its results as of December 31, 2023. It will need to be faster and more regular if the company wants to conform to the rules of listed markets, at the quarterly publication rate. Revolut leaves the door open to a possible IPO. At what price? The last funding round in 2021 valued the company at $33 billion. The Financial Times reported last month that the sum was $40 billion, based on the sale of shares held by employees.

**Revolut Readies 2023 Results in Boost for UK Bank License Bid**
Revolut Ltd. is set to release its 2023 financial results ahead of the statutory deadline, showing significant increases in revenue and net income. This is a crucial step towards obtaining a UK banking license, which would allow the fintech to expand its offerings in its home country. Revolut's Chairman Martin Gilbert stated that the company has learned from its experience with control-based audits, which are different from previous auditing styles. The company's revenue is expected to reach $2 billion in 2023, with net income of $350 million, a significant improvement from 2022. A banking license would enable Revolut to offer more loans and mortgages in the UK, and the company is expected to reach 11,500 employees by the end of 2024, a 40% increase from 2023.

**Cashing in? Revolut in talks to sell close to €500 million of existing shares**
Revolut, a fintech firm, is in talks to sell $500 million worth of existing shares, aiming for a valuation of $40 billion. This would surpass its previous valuation of $33 billion and put it on par with Lloyds Banking Group. The sale includes assets owned by employees. Experts view this as a market correction after a funding boom, with global fintech investment reaching a historic high in 2021. Revolut has also been trying to secure a UK banking licence, which has hit a setback due to issues with verifying revenue figures. The firm's revenue increased by 45% to $1 billion in 2022 and is expected to surpass $2 billion in 2023.

**Revolut Plans to Sell Shares Worth $500 Million to Reward Investors**
Revolut, an online bank, is planning to sell shares worth around $500 million to reward its investors. The bank has hired bankers to organize the sale, which will help to provide liquidity to investors and employees. According to Bloomberg, Revolut has been preparing for a potential initial public offering (IPO) for a long time, but has faced difficulties due to the inactivity of the stock market. The sale of shares may increase Revolut's valuation to over $40 billion, compared to its last valuation of $33 billion in 2021. Revolut has spent years trying to obtain a banking license from the UK's regulatory authorities, which would allow it to expand its services on its domestic market. The company has also benefited from new customers joining its platform in recent years. Revolut reported a 45% increase in revenue in 2022 to £922.5 million (approximately $1.17 billion), and expects revenue of around £2 billion in 2023.

**Revolut aims to reach a valuation of $40 billion**
Revolut, a Lithuanian fintech company with its headquarters in the UK, is seeking to raise its valuation to over $40 billion with a private sale of a minority stake in its shares, which would solidify its status as the most valuable startup in Europe, according to the Financial Times. The company, backed by Japanese holding company SoftBank, is working with Morgan Stanley to sell around $500 million in existing shares to give liquidity to employee stock options, which are part of their remuneration package. A valuation of over $40 billion would be at least 20% higher than the $33 billion valuation Revolut achieved in a funding round in 2021, when it raised $800 million from SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global Management. The company has other venture capital firms such as TCV, Balderton Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Molten Ventures on its shareholder list. Revolut, which is not yet listed on the stock exchange, would surpass the market capitalization of European entities such as Caixabank ($36.4 billion), Sabadell ($9.6 billion), NatWest, Société Générale, and Lloyds Banking Group. The operation would challenge a complex market for European fintechs over the past two years, as Klarna, a major fintech based in Stockholm, closed a funding round at a valuation of $6.7 billion, down from $46 billion in a funding round in 2022. Since then, some venture capital investors have reduced their stakes in Revolut. Losses and regulatory uncertainty Revolut, which has its operational headquarters in London since its founding in 2015, moved to Lithuania in 2022 to continue operating in the euro zone and face the Brexit. Since 2018, it has had a banking license from the European Central Bank (ECB), but it still does not have a license from the Bank of England, the regulatory body in the pound sterling. In fact, the entity still faces uncertainty regarding the approval of its banking license application in the UK, presented over three years ago, according to the Financial Times. Obtaining this license is crucial for the company to expand its loan services and increase its profits in the UK, its key market and largest market at present. The UK financial regulator has delayed its decision due to issues, including an auditor's warning about the lack of complete verification of 2021 income, according to the FT. Revolut published losses in its latest financial report, corresponding to the year 2022, due to the decline in cryptocurrency trading, which had previously driven its profits. Additionally, the increase in costs offset the benefits obtained from higher customer deposits and higher interest rates. Founded in 2015 by Russian Nikolay Storonsky and Ukrainian Vlad Yatsenko, Revolut has significantly surpassed other emerging neobanks in the UK, such as Monzo and Starling, in terms of customer growth and international expansion. It has approximately 40 million customers worldwide, with a third of them in the UK. The company projects its revenues to increase to £1.7 billion in 2023, from £923 million the previous year, with a 'net profit margin of two digits'. The fintech is relocating its headquarters to one of the most iconic buildings in the Canary Wharf financial district in London.

**Revolut's Banking License Saga: Unraveling the Red Tape**
Revolut, a UK fintech company, is struggling to obtain a UK banking license, which is crucial for its expansion and competitiveness. The company's inability to secure this license is due to several issues, including its e-money institution (EMI) status, trust and safeguarding concerns, regulatory and operational hurdles, and a complex ownership structure. The company's peers, such as Monzo and Starling Bank, have already secured their banking licenses, putting pressure on Revolut to level up. The ability to lend and offer insured deposits could transform Revolut from a fintech disruptor to a banking behemoth. However, the company's internal chaos and governance issues, as well as allegations of money laundering, are major red flags for regulators, making it challenging for Revolut to overcome these hurdles and secure its place among the banking elite.

**Revolut Aims to Become One of Italy's Top Banks**
Revolut's Head of Growth Southern Europe, Ignacio Zunzunegui, believes that Italy has a great potential for growth and that the number of customers, which has already reached 2 million, will accelerate in the course of 2024. The company aims to become one of the top banks in the country in the medium term. Revolut will not request a banking license in Italy and will continue to be a bank registered in Lithuania, not part of the ABI. The company is subject to the supervision of the ECB, but welcomes the guidance of local authorities. According to Maurizio Talarico, head of branch and head of lending in Italy, the growth of customers is not only in numbers, but also in the type and weight of transactions. Revolut is working on a personal loan that can be granted in a very short time through an online process that takes into account the customer's risk level calculated in real-time.

**Revolut Reaches 2 Million Customers in Italy, Plans to Launch New Products**
Revolut, a British fintech company with over 40 million customers worldwide, has reached 2 million customers in Italy, making it the largest neobank in the market. The company launched its app in Italy in September 2017 and reached 1 million customers in the last months of 2022. Revolut has become the most downloaded finance and banking app in Italy in May 2024, also being the digital bank that has grown the most in the last year. The company aims to reach 2.5 million customers by the end of 2024, thanks to significant investments in sales, marketing, and communication. In the last year, Italians have made over 160 million transactions using Revolut, with an 84% increase compared to the previous year. The domestic share of transactions is close to 70%, showing that the vast majority of Italians use Revolut as their primary account. The launch of the Italian IBAN and personal loans, which was expected by mid-2024, is slightly delayed. Revolut is working on technical integrations for the Italian IBAN and is testing personal loans. Both will be launched by the summer, with the Italian IBAN expected in the second half of the year. Revolut also plans to launch an alternative to traditional savings solutions, which will be among the most flexible and competitive products on the market, offering full freedom in terms of accessibility, duration, and management. Both launches are expected in the second half of the year.
