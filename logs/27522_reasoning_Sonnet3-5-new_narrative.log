Here's a script set on October 2nd, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing the Olympic gymnastics medal controversy.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, it's official. The CAS decision stood, and Bǎrbosu kept the bronze."

Philip: [nodding] "Our models had it at 99.7%. The historical data was quite clear - only 0.3% of CAS decisions get overturned by the Swiss Federal Tribunal. Even with the video evidence USA Gymnastics presented, the procedural nature of the inquiry timing issue made this particularly unlikely to be reversed."

Nate: "Right. Looking back at our August data, the CAS bulletin from 2011 was particularly telling. Five successful appeals in over 25 years? Those aren't odds you want to bet against."

Philip: "And once CNN reported that CAS couldn't revisit the case themselves, it really came down to the Swiss Federal Tribunal's historically conservative approach to overturning CAS decisions."

[Both turn to update their prediction models for future Olympic disputes]

Here's a script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing the Olympic gymnastics medal controversy]

NATE: (sipping coffee) Well, Phil, another case closed. The Swiss Federal Tribunal never overturned the CAS decision on Jordan Chiles' bronze medal.

TETLOCK: Not surprising. Our models had it at 0.3%.

NATE: Exactly. The historical data was quite clear – only five successful appeals against CAS since 1984. Even with USA Gymnastics' video evidence, the Swiss Federal Tribunal rarely intervenes in these matters.

TETLOCK: (nodding) The timing issue wasn't enough to meet their strict criteria for overturning CAS decisions. Ana Bǎrbosu keeps the bronze.

NATE: You know what's interesting? Some people thought this was a 50-50 case, but our models knew better. The precedent was clear as day.

[They both turn to look at a wall of monitors showing probability calculations]

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their prediction models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, the CAS decision on Jordan Chiles' Olympic bronze medal stands. No surprise there."

Tetlock: "Our models had it at 0.3%. The historical data was quite clear - only five successful appeals against CAS decisions since 1984. The Swiss Federal Tribunal rarely intervenes."

Nate: "The video evidence USA Gymnastics submitted wasn't enough. When we ran the numbers in August, we knew the precedent from that 2011 CAS Bulletin would be crucial."

Tetlock: "Exactly. Even with the timing dispute documentation, the probability barely moved. The Swiss Federal Tribunal's strict criteria for overturning CAS decisions made this outcome almost certain."

Nate: "Sometimes the most accurate predictions are the most boring ones."

[Both chuckle and return to their screens]
