Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- The ICC prosecutor requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu on May 20, 2024
- The UK withdrew objections by July 27, 2024
- Western countries (US, Hungary, Czech Republic, Germany) submitted objections by August 6, 2024
- We need to predict before September 30, 2024

2. Supporting Evidence:
- Multiple sources confirm ICC prosecutor's formal request
- Netanyahu himself expects warrants to be issued
- Legal experts cited believe most countries will respect the expected order
- UK's withdrawal of objection removes a significant obstacle
- ICC has set clear deadlines for objections (now passed)

3. Counterbalancing Factors:
- Several Western countries still object
- Historical precedent shows ICC can be slow in issuing warrants
- Political pressure against the warrants exists
- ICC might delay due to diplomatic considerations

4. Key Considerations:
- All objection deadlines have passed
- Multiple independent sources suggest imminent action
- Netanyahu's own statements indicate high likelihood
- Previous ICC cases (e.g., Putin) took about a month after requests

5. Recent Developments:
- Western countries' last-minute objections in August 2024 could delay process
- But UK's withdrawal of objection strengthens case
- ICC has shown willingness to act despite political pressure

6. Timeline Feasibility:
- Given past ICC timelines, there's enough time before September 30
- Multiple sources suggest decision is imminent
- Process appears to be in final stages

The evidence strongly suggests the ICC will issue the warrant, but recent objections introduce some uncertainty about timing. The multiple independent sources, completed procedural steps, and Netanyahu's own statements suggest high probability, while Western objections and potential diplomatic complications slightly reduce it.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 85.50%, with 80.20% being the most likely. Probability: 80.20%.

Let me analyze this carefully:

Key Evidence For Higher Probability:
1. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan formally requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Galant in May 2024
2. Multiple sources indicate the ICC is actively considering the warrants
3. Netanyahu himself has expressed expectation of warrants being issued
4. The UK (a key ally) has dropped opposition to ICC jurisdiction
5. August 6 deadline for countries to submit objections has passed
6. Several sources suggest warrants could be issued before Netanyahu's July 24 US visit
7. Historical precedent: ICC took about a month to issue Putin's arrest warrant after request

Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
1. Strong Western opposition, particularly from US, Germany and others
2. Political sensitivity given ongoing Gaza conflict
3. ICC typically moves slowly on high-profile cases
4. Potential diplomatic consequences could cause hesitation
5. No official confirmation from ICC about timing
6. Previous predicted dates (like mid-July) have passed without warrants
7. ICC may want more time to review country objections submitted by August 6

Analysis:
- The formal request from Khan and UK's position shift are significant procedural steps
- The August 6 deadline passing moves process forward
- Netanyahu's own statements suggest high likelihood
- However, Western opposition and complexity could delay beyond September
- Past missed deadlines suggest caution about timing predictions
- About 6-7 weeks remain until September 30
- Given procedural progress and signals, likelihood appears high but not certain

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.90%, with 75.70% being the most likely. Probability: 75.70%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Today is August 9, 2024
- Target date is September 30, 2024
- About 7 weeks remain
- ICC prosecutor requested warrants on May 20, 2024
- Multiple sources indicate decision expected by July 24, 2024 (which has passed)

2. Key Evidence For High Probability:
- Netanyahu himself expects warrants to be issued
- Multiple Israeli media sources reporting warrants are imminent
- ICC prosecutor has formally requested the warrants
- UK dropped opposition to ICC jurisdiction
- Deadline for country objections was August 6, 2024

3. Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
- Western countries (US, Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary) filed objections
- Previous reported deadlines have passed without warrants being issued
- Political pressure against ICC taking this action
- Complex legal process could delay decision

4. Critical Factors:
- ICC has historically taken action against sitting leaders (e.g. Putin)
- Evidence gathering appears substantial
- Multiple credible sources confirming likely issuance
- Formal process steps are being followed
- Growing international acceptance of ICC jurisdiction

5. Risk Analysis:
- Time remaining until September 30 provides adequate window
- Process appears well advanced
- Major procedural hurdles have been cleared
- Opposition exists but appears insufficient to prevent issuance

6. Pattern Recognition:
- Similar to Putin warrant process
- ICC typically follows through when prosecutor requests warrants
- Process timing aligns with historical precedents

The evidence strongly suggests warrants will be issued, but some uncertainty remains due to political pressures and possible procedural delays.

My Prediction: Between 75.20% and 85.40%, with 80.30% being the most likely. Probability: 80.30%
