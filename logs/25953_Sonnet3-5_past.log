To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key factors and evidence:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal, a member of the Together coalition, is the current Prime Minister as of July 10, 2024.

2. Recent election results: The June 30/July 7 legislative elections resulted in no clear majority. The New Popular Front (left-wing) won 182 seats, Together won 168 seats, and National Rally won 143 seats.

3. Government formation process: 
   - Macron asked Attal to remain PM "for the moment" to ensure stability.
   - The new National Assembly will convene on July 18.
   - There's no clear path to forming a government yet.

4. Possible scenarios:
   a) Together forms a coalition with other parties to reach a majority.
   b) A minority government is formed.
   c) A "technical" or caretaker government is formed.
   d) Political deadlock leads to continued uncertainty.

5. Time constraints: There are only 12 days between the National Assembly convening (July 18) and the resolution date (July 30).

6. Historical precedent: In past situations of political uncertainty, incumbent PMs often remain in office temporarily.

7. Olympics factor: The Paris Olympics start on July 26, which may incentivize maintaining stability in the short term.

Analyzing these factors:

- The lack of a clear majority makes it unlikely for any single party to easily form a government by July 30.
- The short timeframe (12 days) between the Assembly convening and the resolution date reduces the likelihood of major changes.
- The upcoming Olympics create an incentive for maintaining stability in the short term.
- Attal's current position as PM and Macron's request for him to stay "for the moment" suggest a significant chance he'll remain in office on July 30.

However, there are also factors that create uncertainty:
- The fluid political situation could lead to unexpected alliances or outcomes.
- Pressure from opposition parties could force changes.
- The exact process and timeline for government formation is not certain.

Balancing these factors, I estimate a relatively high probability that the PM on July 30 will be from the Together coalition, likely Attal himself. However, there's significant uncertainty given the fluid political situation.

My Prediction: Between 65.00% and 85.00%, with 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast this question, I'll analyze the key evidence and considerations:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal from the Together coalition is Prime Minister as of July 8, 2024.

2. Recent elections: The June 30/July 7 legislative elections resulted in:
   - New Popular Front (left): 182 seats
   - Together (Macron's coalition): 168 seats 
   - National Rally (far-right): 143 seats
   No party won an absolute majority (289 seats needed).

3. Government formation process:
   - Attal announced his resignation on July 8 but remains in office during transition.
   - New government typically forms within weeks after elections.
   - President appoints PM, but needs parliamentary support.

4. Potential scenarios:
   a) Together forms coalition to retain power
   b) Left-wing coalition forms government
   c) Minority government 
   d) Technical/caretaker government if deadlock

5. Factors favoring Together retaining PM position:
   - Incumbent advantage
   - Centrist position allows coalition-building
   - Macron's constitutional power to appoint PM
   - Olympics starting July 26 favor stability

6. Factors against Together retaining PM:
   - Lost parliamentary majority
   - Left-wing coalition won most seats
   - Pressure for change after election results

7. Timing: July 30 is only 3 weeks after election, favoring status quo or quick resolution.

Weighing these factors, I assess that Together has a good chance but not certainty of retaining the PM position by July 30. The lack of an absolute majority for any group and the upcoming Olympics create incentives for compromise or temporary solutions that could favor the incumbent coalition.

My Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, with 55.00% being the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal is the Prime Minister and belongs to the Together coalition. However, early legislative elections were held on June 30 and July 7, 2024.

2. Election results: The left-wing New Popular Front won the most seats (182), followed by Together (168), and the far-right National Rally (143). No party or coalition has an absolute majority.

3. Government formation: As of July 10, 2024, no new government has been formed. Attal announced his intention to resign but remains in office temporarily.

4. Constitutional process: The President appoints the Prime Minister, but they need parliamentary support to avoid a no-confidence vote.

5. Possible scenarios:
   a) Coalition government: Together could form a coalition with other parties, potentially maintaining power.
   b) Minority government: The left could form a government with external support.
   c) National unity government: A broad coalition across party lines.
   d) Technical government: Non-partisan experts manage daily affairs until a stable solution is found.

6. Timeframe: The new National Assembly convenes on July 18. A government typically forms shortly after, but negotiations could extend beyond July 30.

7. Historical precedent: In past cohabitations, the President has appointed a Prime Minister from the parliamentary majority.

8. Political statements: Macron has asked Attal to remain "for the moment," suggesting openness to change but also a desire for stability.

9. Olympics factor: The Paris Olympics start on July 26, which may incentivize a quicker resolution to ensure stable governance.

Balancing these factors:

- The Together coalition lacks a majority, reducing the likelihood of retaining the Prime Minister position.
- However, as the second-largest group and with Macron as President, they remain a significant player in negotiations.
- The lack of a clear majority for any group increases uncertainty and could prolong negotiations.
- The upcoming Olympics may pressure parties to form a government quickly, potentially favoring a compromise that could include Together.

Given these considerations, I estimate a moderate but significant chance that the Prime Minister on July 30 will be from the Together coalition.

My Prediction: Between 25.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

   - The New Popular Front is planning to designate a prime minister candidate, excluding Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
   - Jordan Bardella (National Rally) has said he would refuse the PM role without an absolute majority.

4. Constitutional considerations:
   - The President appoints the Prime Minister, but they need parliamentary support.

5. Potential scenarios:

   c) A "neutral" technocratic government is formed if no clear majority emerges.

6. Timeframe: The question asks about July 30, which is less than two weeks after the new Assembly convenes, but after the Olympics start (July 26).

Analysis:
The situation is highly uncertain, with no clear path to a stable government. The Together coalition lacks a majority but remains a significant force. The left-wing bloc has more seats but may struggle to form a cohesive government.

Factors favoring Together retaining the PM position:
- Incumbent advantage and desire for stability during the Olympics.
- Potential for a coalition with center-right parties.
- Macron's constitutional power to appoint the PM.

Factors against Together retaining the PM position:
- Lack of a clear majority.
- Strong performance of the left-wing bloc.
- Pressure for change after election results.

Given the complexity and uncertainty, I believe the probability of a Together coalition PM on July 30 is lower than 50% but still significant. The most likely scenario may be a continuation of Attal's government in a caretaker capacity or a compromise candidate from Together, at least through the Olympics.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 45.00%, with 37.50% being the most likely. Probability: 37.50%.

To answer this question, I'll analyze the available information and consider key factors:

1. Current situation: Gabriel Attal is the Prime Minister and belongs to the Together coalition. However, early elections have been called for June 30 and July 7, 2024.

2. Election results: The most recent news indicates that in the second round on July 7:
   - New Popular Front (left-wing) won 182 seats
   - Together (Macron's coalition) won 168 seats
   - National Rally (far-right) won 143 seats

3. No absolute majority: With 577 seats total, no party or coalition has the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority.

4. Attal's resignation: Attal announced his intention to resign on July 8, but Macron asked him to remain "for the moment" to ensure stability.

5. Potential scenarios:
   a) Attal remains PM if Macron can form a coalition or minority government
   b) A new PM is appointed from the New Popular Front
   c) A "technical" or unity government is formed with a neutral PM

6. Timeline: The new National Assembly will convene on July 18. This gives about 12 days for negotiations before July 30.

7. Historical precedent: In situations without a clear majority, the president typically tries to form a coalition or appoint a PM who can gain parliamentary support.

Considering these factors:

- The Together coalition didn't win a majority, making it less likely they'll retain the PM position.
- However, they came in second, and Macron as president has significant influence in appointing the PM.
- The lack of a clear majority creates uncertainty and may lead to extended negotiations.
- Attal remaining as a caretaker PM until a stable solution is found is a possibility.
- The New Popular Front, as the largest bloc, may push hard for the PM position.

Given the complex situation and the short timeframe for negotiations, there's significant uncertainty. The Together coalition retaining the PM position is possible but not highly likely. I estimate the probability to be lower than 50% but not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.

3. No absolute majority: With 577 seats total, no party or coalition has the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority.

4. Attal's resignation: Attal announced his intention to resign on July 8, but Macron asked him to remain "for the moment" to ensure stability.

5. Potential scenarios:
   a) Attal remains PM if Macron can form a coalition or minority government
   b) A new PM is appointed from the New Popular Front
   c) A "technical" or unity government is formed with a neutral PM

6. Timeline: The new National Assembly will convene on July 18. This gives about 12 days for negotiations before July 30.

7. Historical precedent: In situations without a clear majority, the president typically tries to form a coalition or appoint a PM who can gain parliamentary support.

Considering these factors:

- The Together coalition didn't win a majority, making it less likely they'll retain the PM position.
- However, they came in second, and Macron as president has significant influence in appointing the PM.
- The lack of a clear majority creates uncertainty and may lead to extended negotiations.
- Attal remaining as a caretaker PM until a stable solution is found is a possibility.
- The New Popular Front, as the largest bloc, may push hard for the PM position.

Given the complex situation and the short timeframe for negotiations, there's significant uncertainty. The Together coalition retaining the PM position is possible but not highly likely. I estimate the probability to be lower than 50% but not negligible.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 45.00%, with 35.00% being the most likely. Probability: 35.00%.
