To forecast whether an athlete will win more than one medal for tennis at the 2024 Paris Olympics, we need to consider historical data, athlete performance patterns, and Olympic format.

1. **Historical Context**: Historically, few athletes have won multiple medals in tennis at any given Olympics because the opportunities are limited. Tennis offers medals in men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Historically, it's more common for versatile top athletes to win in both singles and doubles categories.

2. **Key Athletes**: The most prominent tennis players, especially those who excel in both singles and doubles, typically have the best chance of winning multiple medals. Players like the Williams sisters, Andy Murray, or Novak Djokovic have shown prowess in both singles and doubles, highlighting they or similar ranked players could potentially win multiple medals.

3. **Format and Opportunities**: With only five events and typically tough competition, winning more than one medal is challenging but not impossible. Players that can participate in either gender-specific doubles and mixed doubles increase their medal-winning opportunities.

4. **Recent Competitions and Rankings**: Checking the current ATP and WTA rankings close to the date and performance in recent grand slams or other competitions might provide insights into top contenders capable for doubles matches.

5. **Athlete's Recent Performance**: Past performance, injury status, rankings, and form leading up to the Olympics are crucial. If a top-ranked player has been dominating both singles and doubles internationally recently, the probability increases.

Given these considerations, the forecast for an athlete winning more than one medal at the 2024 Olympics should account for both the limited opportunities and the potential for a top-performing athlete to achieve this feat. 

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 35.00%, but 27.50% being the most likely. Probability: 27.50%.
