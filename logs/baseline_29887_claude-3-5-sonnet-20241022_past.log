Let me reason through this carefully:

1. The question asks about concession in CA-22 before December 1, 2024, which means we have about 20 days after the November 12, 2024 election.

2. Key considerations:
- Most House races are called and conceded within days of the election
- California uses a mail-in ballot system which can slow counting
- Competitive districts may take longer to determine a clear winner
- CA-22 is currently held by David Valadao (R) and has been competitive in recent cycles
- The district has significant Latino population and has swung between parties

3. Historical patterns:
- Most congressional races are conceded within 1-2 days of election
- Even close races typically see concessions within 1-2 weeks
- Very few races remain unconceded by December 1
- Mail-in ballots can delay final counts but usually not past Thanksgiving

4. Factors favoring concession:
- Strong historical precedent
- Professional campaign operations
- Clear electoral processes
- 20-day window is substantial

5. Factors against concession:
- Potential very close margin
- Mail-in ballot counting time
- Recent increased reluctance to concede in some cases

Given these factors, I believe there's a very high likelihood of concession before December 1, with some uncertainty due to potential close margins and counting delays.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.90%, with 92.30% being the most likely. Probability: 92.30%.
