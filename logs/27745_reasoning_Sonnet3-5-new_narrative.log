INT. FORECASTING INSTITUTE - MORNING, OCTOBER 2, 2024

Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit in a dimly lit office, surrounded by data screens. Coffee cups steam between them.

TETLOCK
(checking his phone)
So, no Taylor Swift endorsement for Harris before the deadline.

SILVER
Our models had it at 15.32%. The indicators were there - her Democratic leanings, that Hindustan Times article about her preparations, her 2020 Biden-Harris support...

TETLOCK
But the timing never lined up. Swift's been careful with political moves since her 2020 involvement. Plus, Harris's polling numbers weren't strong enough to warrant the risk to Swift's brand.

SILVER
Exactly. The model caught those hesitation signals. A Swift endorsement would've been massive for youth turnout, but the data suggested she'd stay quiet through September.

TETLOCK
(nodding)
Another win for superforecasting. Low probability, but not impossible. That's why we said 15%, not zero.

FADE OUT.

Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Looking at the data up until August 30th, we had it at 12.35%.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] The signals were there. Swift's history with the Democratic Party, her previous Biden-Harris endorsement, even those leaked reports about her preparing to endorse Harris. But the timing...

Nate: Exactly. The key factor was Harris's declining poll numbers in late August. Our models caught that Swift would be hesitant to make such a decisive move during that volatility.

Philip: [looking at his laptop] The youth voter engagement metrics were particularly telling. Swift's team was clearly waiting for a more strategic moment, but October 1st came and went.

Nate: [smiling] Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most interesting stories are about what doesn't happen.

[They both turn to watch CNN reporting on Swift's continued political silence]

Title: "The Swift Probability"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight, October 2, 2024]

NATE SILVER: (looking at data screens) Well, Phil, our models were spot on again.

PHILIP TETLOCK: (nodding) Indeed. Despite the Hindustan Times article suggesting Swift's imminent endorsement, our models had it at 12.37%.

NATE: The signals were there – her history with Democrats, the 2020 Biden-Harris support. But something felt off.

PHILIP: (sipping coffee) The timing was crucial. With Harris polling behind and Swift's Eras Tour schedule, the probability of an endorsement before October 1st was always low.

NATE: And here we are, no endorsement. Though that article caused quite a stir in August.

PHILIP: (chuckling) Remember when everyone thought our 12.37% was too conservative? But that's why we trust the models, not the headlines.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most likely outcome is no outcome at all.
