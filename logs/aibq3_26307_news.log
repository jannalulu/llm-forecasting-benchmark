**Economists Trim US Inflation Forecasts, Paving Way for Fed Cut**
Economists have reduced their inflation forecasts for the US through the first half of 2025, expecting a slightly higher unemployment rate. This combination is expected to encourage the Federal Reserve to start lowering interest rates. The forecasters see the annual core personal consumption expenditures price index ending the year at 2.6%, and the overall PCE price index at 2.4%. The unemployment rate is expected to average 4.2% in the fourth quarter. The survey of 75 economists follows reports showing the Fed's tightening campaign is having its intended effect on the economy, with inflation receding, hiring and wage growth slowing, and the economy cooling to a pace that's more in line with what policymakers would like to see. 'The Fed is poised to start cutting rates in September barring any adverse inflation readings for July or August,' said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. 'We view the easing as necessary since the labor market is showing signs of moderation — lower rates could help stave off wider and deeper cracks in the labor market.' Economists see a 30% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, a much lower chance than forecast a year ago. They see the economy holding up through 2025 on the back of healthy consumer spending and resilient investment, though quarterly growth rates are projected to be less than 2%. 'The US economy is performing better than all other G-20 countries and that should continue for years,' said James Smith, chief economist at EconForecaster LLC. 'The goldilocks US economy has returned.'

**The Problem Looming in the Labor Market**
The government's secret policy of hiring people to control unemployment and hide the failure of its labor market and economic policies has been revealed. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), the unemployment rate in August 2023 was 7.4%, still above pre-pandemic levels. The new government must take urgent action to improve the labor climate, as an increase in unemployment, combined with a projected economic slowdown, could lead to social problems such as crime, poverty, and decreased tax revenue. The author suggests that measures should be taken to reduce bureaucracy, simplify labor procedures, and create an incentive for businesses to formalize employment, as informal employment accounted for 47.4% of the workforce in August last year. The author also emphasizes the need for a joint effort between the Ministry of Labor, Commerce, and Industry, the General Directorate of Taxes, and the private sector to detect and eliminate barriers to entrepreneurship and formalization.

**Unemployment Rate Rises to 7.7% in First Quarter of 2024**
The INDEC reported that the unemployment rate increased to 7.7% in the first quarter of 2024, due to the impact of devaluation, inflation shock, and subsequent recession. The indicator grew by 2 percentage points compared to the end of 2023. According to the report, there are 400,000 fewer workers employed in the 31 urban agglomerations. The activity rate was 48.0%, 0.6 percentage points lower than the previous quarter. The employment rate was 44.3%, 1.5 percentage points lower than the fourth quarter of 2023. The unemployment rate increased by 2.0 percentage points (from 5.7% to 7.7%). The Secretary of Labor's data had already shown the effect of the first months of the libertarian government's mandate on the labor market. In the last seven months considered by official statistics, the economy lost 127,000 registered private sector jobs. Only in the months of Javier Milei's government, 95,000 jobs were destroyed, and most are explained by the construction sector, affected by the suspension of most public works. The official labor market information does not seem to show signs of having reached a floor. 'To account for the magnitude of the job loss, it is worth noting that between August 2023 and March 2024, employment accumulated a 2% decline, which translates to 127,000 fewer employed people in the private registered labor market', stated the labor ministry's report.

**Unemployment and its numbers**
According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the employment rate (TO) in the first quarter of 2024 showed a slight positive difference of around 1.3 percentage points compared to the same period in 2023 (64.4% vs. 65.7%). In absolute terms, this increase was 76,402 employed people. However, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the employment rate registered a statistically significant decrease of 1.7 percentage points (67.4% to 65.7%), mainly due to a decrease in rural areas, where the labor force rate decreased from 68.5% to 65.2%. The number of employed people in the first quarter of 2024 was around 2,869,867, of which approximately 58.2% were men (1,670,830) and 41.8% were women (1,199,037). According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), there are conditions that must be met for a person to be considered unemployed, such as not working for one hour in an economic activity in the seven days prior to the interview, being available to work, and actively seeking work. Considering these conditions and observing the data provided by the INE, during the first quarter of 2024, around 212,740 people were classified as unemployed, of which approximately 93,375 were men (43.9%) and 119,365 were women (56.1%). The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security announced that in August 2023 and April 2024, 8,348 new productive units were created, representing a 44% increase compared to the period from August 2022 to April 2023. The main activities of these new units were commerce, repair of vehicles, and construction. The reasons behind the numbers are numerous and complex, including gender-based discrimination, lack of training, and informality. The unemployment rate will continue to increase, and it is necessary to address the root causes and implement policies to reduce informality and increase job opportunities.

**US adds 272,000 non-agricultural jobs in May 2024**
The United States added 272,000 non-agricultural jobs in May 2024, according to the US Department of Labor. This represents a solid growth compared to the slowdown observed in April. The unemployment rate increased by one-tenth, reaching 4%. The healthcare, government, leisure and tourism, professional services, scientific and technical sectors led the job creation. The mining, oil and gas extraction, construction, industry, wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and other services sectors saw minimal variation. The US Department of Labor reported downward revisions for March (5,000 jobs removed from the initial reading) and April (10,000 jobs subtracted). These revisions represented a total reduction of 15,000 jobs. The unemployment rate was 4% in May, up one-tenth from April and three-tenths from May 2023. This is the highest rate since January 2022, and for the first time since August 2023, the unemployment rate has left the range of 3.7% to 3.9%.

**US Unemployment Benefit Claims Mark Largest Increase Since May**
Initial unemployment benefit claims in the US increased to 243,000 in the week ending July 13, the highest level since August 2023, according to the Department of Labor. Continuing claims, which measure the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, also increased to 1.87 million, the highest level since November 2021. The data is prone to large weekly fluctuations during this time of year, which includes holidays like Independence Day and summer school closures. Other reports show that employers have slowed down hiring and the US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% last month, the highest since 2021. The slowing labor market and recent moderation of inflation strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the coming months.

**US Inflation Data for June 2024: When and What to Expect**
The US inflation data for June 2024 is highly anticipated. In May, consumer prices showed a monthly increase of 0.1% and an annual increase of 3.3%, which is the lowest level in three months. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said, 'Inflation has decreased significantly, but it is still above the 2% target. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1% in June.' The US inflation data for June will be announced on July 11, 2024 at 15:30. The expected direction of the US inflation data is uncertain. In June, the non-agricultural employment increased by 206,000, exceeding expectations, but the revisions for April and May showed a slower job growth. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4%. Average hourly wages increased by 0.3%, meeting expectations, but the growth rate slowed down compared to May. The 150,000 increase in private sector employment was below market expectations, and the annual wage growth rate was 4.9%, the lowest since August 2021. Economists believe that these data indicate a clear softening in the US labor market and that the Fed is observing the impact on its monetary policies. On the other hand, the Fed is said to want to collect more data before moving towards its inflation target. This development is being closely monitored by investors and market analysts, who believe it has the potential to shape expectations for the Fed's interest rate cuts.

**The Fed could slash rates by 200 points over 8 straight meetings as the economy heads for a sharper downtrend, Citi says**
Citi Research predicts that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 200 basis points, or from 5.25%-5.5% to 3.25%-3.5%, over the next 8 months, starting in September 2024 and extending to July 2025. This is due to signs of a slowing economy, including a decline in the Institute for Supply Management's service-sector gauge and an increase in unemployment to 4.1%. Citi's chief U.S. economist, Andrew Hollenhorst, believes that the Fed will cut rates at each of the subsequent 7 meetings, citing a 'softening of activity' and 'dovish comments' from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Hollenhorst also notes that the 'Sahm Rule' recession indicator could be triggered in August if unemployment continues to rise at its current pace.

**US Unemployment Rate Rises to 4.1%, Federal Reserve May Consider Cutting Interest Rates**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, despite a 206,000 increase in non-farm jobs, exceeding expectations of 190,000. The Federal Reserve is likely to consider cutting interest rates due to the rising unemployment rate. Goldman Sachs expects the report to be weaker than expected, with a downward revision in the three-month average to 177,000 jobs from 249,000 previously. The industry composition was weak, with government and healthcare accounting for three-quarters of the gains in June, and many industries experiencing job losses. The household survey was weak, with the unemployment rate rising 0.1 percentage point to 4.1%. The labor force participation rate increased by 277,000, offset by a 116,000 increase in household employment. According to Davidson, 'The unemployment rate rose again to 4.1%, which is higher than expected at 4.0% and shows some weakness in the labor market.' Wages were as expected, but in line with the inflationary pressure that may be more favorable to the market than the jobs report. PMO Capital notes that the temporary jobs penetration rate was 1.68%, down 3 basis points from the previous month and down from the peak of 2.1% in March 2022. Historically, when this measure falls below 1.85%, the US is in a recession. As always, we advise investors to be cautious of these monthly data releases, which are known for revisions. Meanwhile, Brouet and Woods see the June jobs gains exceeding expectations as indicating positive growth in insurance premiums in the near term for 2024 and growth in insurance broker commissions, despite expecting a slowdown in this growth with the slowdown in commercial insurance rates.' According to Evercore ISI: 'Overall, the labor market data points to a strong labor market without overheating, where the recent wage gains indicate a strong demand for workers that is met by a strong supply of labor from rising labor force participation and immigration. However, tight labor market metrics such as unemployment, wages, and job openings are declining, supporting a more optimistic view of inflation expectations.'

**Unemployment Is Up, Job Growth Is Slowing, Rate Cuts Incoming**
The US unemployment rate has risen above 4% for the first time since January 2022, which could signal future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The jobless rate has been trending upwards, and job growth has slowed down. The unemployment rate is not the only metric to consider, as the 'U-6' rate, which includes discouraged and under-employed workers, has also increased. The Fed may respond to this data by cutting interest rates, potentially as early as September. Investors can take advantage of currently high rates by locking in rates with instruments like CDs or fixed-rate bonds.

**Treasuries See Recession-Style Employment Trends, Stocks Should Too**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June, a 70 basis point increase from the 3.4% cycle low in 2022. Full-time job creation fell to a 39-month low, while part-time job creation reached a 33-month high. Jobless claims have increased in recent weeks, and survey data shows rising financial uneasiness among consumers. The year-over-year growth in unemployed Americans is 11.9%, above the +10% that has signaled the onset of past recessions. In Canada, the unemployment rate rose to 6.4% in June, with nearly all employment gains coming from the public sector. The US Fed and Bank of Canada have forecasted unemployment rates to peak in 2025 and 2024, respectively, but these forecasts may be optimistic given past cycles. Government bonds are rallying, and the equal-weight S&P 500 index has been flat since March, with some AI hopefuls boosting equity benchmarks. However, the market is at risk of a painful give-back cycle due to high debt and record stock market allocations, making it difficult for investors to recover losses.

**U.S. Job Growth Slows in June, Unemployment Rises to 4.1%**
The US labor market showed signs of slowing down in June 2024, with payroll growth decreasing and the unemployment rate rising to 4.1%. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 206,000, but revisions to previous months' figures revealed a reduction of 111,000 jobs. The unemployment rate rose due to more people entering the workforce. Several sectors continued to add jobs, but at a slower pace. This trend aligns with other economic reports showing a drop in job openings and an increase in unemployment benefit claims. The data suggests the Federal Reserve might consider cutting interest rates soon, potentially as early as September. Market reactions were immediate, with Treasury yields falling and stock futures rising as investors anticipated potential rate cuts.

**US Labor Market Data Suggests Interest Rate Cuts by Federal Reserve**
The recent US labor market data has increased the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. According to Bloomberg, the slowdown in job and wage growth in June, combined with the highest unemployment rate since 2021, suggests that the Fed may lower interest rates in the coming months. The number of non-farm payroll jobs increased by 206,000, but the growth rate was revised downward by 111,000. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, with more people entering the labor market and average hourly earnings cooling down. The data is consistent with other reports showing a sharp decline in job openings this year and an increasing number of people applying for unemployment benefits. The continued slowdown in new hires, combined with the recent decline in inflation, supports the view that the Fed may cut interest rates as early as September. 'The downward revisions to the past two months' employment numbers, combined with the rise in the unemployment rate, are the key data points. Additionally, wage growth is slowing down,' said Kathy Jones, chief strategist for fixed-income securities at Charles Schwab. 'All of this points to a slower trend. Treasury yields fell and the S&P 500 opened little changed after the report. Investors currently expect the Fed to cut interest rates twice this year, according to futures data.' The data could lead the Fed to reassess its risk balance, as unemployment rises against the backdrop of declining inflation. From the minutes of the June Federal Reserve meeting, it is clear that concern is growing that a further slowdown in the economy could lead to a higher unemployment rate. The labor force participation rate rose to 62.6%, and the rate for workers aged 25-54, also known as prime-age workers, rose to a 22-year high of 83.7%. In June, about three-quarters of job gains were in the healthcare and public administration sectors. A worrying sign was the strongest decline in employment of temporary workers since more than three years. The number of employees in the manufacturing sector fell as strongly as in February. According to Bloomberg Economics, 'We expect the unemployment rate to rise to 4.5% by the end of the year. If it reaches 4.2% in July or August, the Fed could start cutting interest rates at the September FOMC meeting.'

**US added surprisingly strong 206K jobs last month, unemployment rose to 4.1%**
The US job market added 206,000 jobs in June, exceeding expectations, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%. This mixed result may not encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, as the job market is still showing strength. The economy has added an average of 248,000 jobs per month so far in 2024, close to the 2023 average. However, economists predict that the job market will eventually slow down due to high interest rates. The number of advertised job openings has declined, but employers are not cutting jobs aggressively, and most workers are enjoying job security. Inflation has declined from 9.1% to 3.3%, and the Fed is waiting for further evidence that inflation is moving towards its 2% target before cutting rates.

**Unemployment Rate Climbs For Another Month As Job Gains Slump**
The US added 206,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in June, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.1%. Economists had anticipated 190,000 jobs and a steady unemployment rate of 4%. The job gains were led by government employment, which added 70,000 jobs, followed by healthcare, social assistance, and construction. Despite strong job gains, some top economic officials, such as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have pushed back against claims that the economy is stalling. The unemployment rate has been rising, and job openings have fallen to a three-year low. Inflation has raised prices by over 20% since President Joe Biden took office, and the Fed has kept interest rates high to slow the economy. Real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter of 2024, and nearly half of Americans view the economy as being in poor condition.

**The US Unemployment Has Been Steadily Rising Since March. What to Expect Next? Possible Scenarios for the Dollar**
The US unemployment rate has been steadily rising since March, with expectations of a decrease to 190,000 in June and a stable unemployment rate of 4.0%. The US Federal Reserve is receiving positive signals to reduce inflation and unemployment data, which may strengthen sentiment in lowering interest rates. The JOLTS Job Openings data showed an increase of 221,000 in May 2024, exceeding expectations, providing a positive signal for a potential reduction in unemployment. Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa, believes that the increase in job openings could help address the rising unemployment issue and inflation. The US Dollar Index has increased by 1.17% to 105.85 points, with a potential decline to 101.9 points if the support level of 104 points is breached.

The number of announced job vacancies decreased by 513 to 39,592, with 19,490 of these being subject to the obligation to announce. In April 2024, 3,766 people were affected by reduced working hours, a decrease of 1,920 (-33.8%) from the previous month. The SECO will publish its documentation for the press in a modernized format starting from August 2024, presenting the statistics in a more current and adapted manner.

**US: High Interest Rates Raise Concerns of Unemployment Increase**
The Federal Reserve's high interest rates are causing concerns about a potential increase in unemployment in the United States. According to Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the labor market has been adapting slowly, and the unemployment rate has only slightly increased. However, the Fed's restrictive monetary policy could slow down economic activity and employment. Despite this, the Fed has confirmed its prediction of 2.1% economic growth in 2024 and 2% in 2025. The Fed's inflation target is 2%, and the current inflation rate is 3.3% on an annual basis. The Fed may maintain its current policy for several months, as Jerome Powell, the Fed's President, has stated that interest rates will remain high as long as the economy remains solid and inflation persists. The Fed has also indicated that it will only lower interest rates once in 2024, with some members predicting no rate cuts at all.

**Futures File: Take me home, Consumer Price Index**
The May 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers were released, showing a monthly CPI unchanged and a 3.3% increase over the past 12 months. This marks the lowest monthly inflation rate in two years and one year of stable yearly inflation between 3% and 4%. The Federal Reserve's effective interest rate has remained at 5.33% since August 2023, similar to the period from July 2006 to July 2007. The article argues that cutting interest rates may not be effective in preventing a recession, as the die was cast with the extraordinary events and actions taken between 2020 and 2022. The author suggests that cutting rates seems irresponsible until the unemployment rate exceeds 5% or the annual inflation rate reaches 2.5%.

**U.S. Weekly Jobless Claims Unexpectedly Climb To Nearly 10-Month High**
The Labor Department released a report showing an unexpected increase in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits, reaching 242,000 in the week ended June 8th, the highest level since August 2023. Economists had expected a decrease to 225,000. The four-week moving average of initial claims also rose to 227,000. Continuing claims increased by 30,000 to 1.820 million, and the four-week moving average of continuing claims climbed to 1,796,750. The report also showed a surge in employment in May, with 272,000 jobs added, exceeding expectations. The unemployment rate rose to 4.0% in May from 3.9% in April.

**US Weekly Jobless Claims Reach 10-Month High**
The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims reached a 10-month high in the last week, indicating a weakening of the labor market. Initial unemployment claims increased by 13,000 to 242,000, the highest level since August, according to the Labor Department. Economists had predicted 225,000 claims. The labor market is cooling down as the cumulative and lagged effects of the 525 basis point increase in the Federal Reserve's interest rate since 2022 are impacting the economy. The unemployment rate rose to 4% in May, still relatively low, for the first time since January 2022, while economic growth slowed significantly in the first quarter. The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at the current range of 5.25% to 5.50%, where it has been since July. The Fed authorities delayed the start of rate cuts until possibly December, projecting only a single 0.25 percentage point reduction for this year.

The US Labor Department announced the weekly data on unemployment benefits. According to the data, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits increased by 13,000 to 242,000 compared to the previous week.

The 4-week average of unemployment benefit applications increased by 4,750 to 227,000. The total number of unemployment benefit applications also increased by 30,000 to 1,820,000 from June 1 to June 8.

**Unemployment Rate in Britain Rises to 4.4% as Labor Market Cools**
The unemployment rate in Britain has risen to 4.4% in the three months ending April 2024, the highest level in over two years, according to the National Statistics Office. The number of job vacancies has decreased for the 23rd consecutive month, and the number of unemployed people has increased by 190,000 during this period. The economic inactivity rate has also risen to 22.3%, with around 2.83 million people out of work due to long-term illness. The Prime Minister's criticism of the 'culture of sick leave' has not had any impact on this trend. The private sector has reduced the number of employees, with the retail and hospitality sectors being particularly affected. However, there are some positive signs in the healthcare and social care sectors, with around 170,000 additional workers hired during the three months ending April. The education sector has also seen an increase in employees. Despite these positive signs, the overall picture is one of a cooling labor market, with the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its next meeting. The possibility of a rate cut in August is still on the table, but it is unlikely that the Prime Minister will make any announcements on this before the election.

**US Fed holds interest rates steady, sees just one cut in 2024**
The US Federal Reserve has kept interest rates steady, with a median projection of only one rate cut in 2024, down from three previously expected. The decision was influenced by stronger-than-expected inflation and a more resilient economy. The Fed's target inflation rate is 2%, and policymakers expect it to reach this goal by the end of 2025. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.2% by the end of 2025, and economic growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2024 and 2.0% in 2025.

In the long term, the unemployment rate increased from 4.1% to 4.2%. The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep the Fed Funds rate between 5.25% and 5.50% per year, with a unanimous decision in line with market expectations.

**US Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady For Seventh Consecutive Time- Details**
The US Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates unchanged for the seventh consecutive time, maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.50 percent. The Fed's updated economic forecasts indicate that inflation is expected to remain high through 2024, while unemployment is projected to increase slightly in 2025. The central bank anticipates faster rate cuts beginning in 2025, with rates expected to fall to 3.1 percent by the end of 2026. The committee also projected at least one rate cut before the end of 2024. The release of May CPI data showed a 3.3 percent increase from a year earlier, slightly below economists' forecast. Market averages reacted positively, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching fresh all-time highs. The Fed will continue to assess incoming data and the evolving economic outlook before making further adjustments to the target range.

**Job market forecast: Unemployment to rise slightly in 2024**
According to the Swedish Public Employment Service's new forecast, unemployment will rise slightly in 2024 to 351,000 or 6.7% of the workforce, before decreasing slightly to 347,000 in 2025. The current unemployment rate is 6.6% and has remained relatively stable since the beginning of the year. The forecast suggests that the labor market will not fully recover during the 2024-2025 period, but the demand for labor is expected to increase and unemployment to decrease. However, those with a weak position on the labor market, such as those with long-term unemployment, are expected to struggle. Long-term unemployment is expected to rise to up to 150,000 by the end of 2025.

**Unemployment and its numbers**
According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the employment rate (TO) in the first quarter of 2024 showed a slight positive difference of around 1.3 percentage points compared to the same period in 2023 (64.4% vs. 65.7%). In absolute terms, this increase was 76,402 employed people. However, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the employment rate registered a statistically significant decrease of 1.7 percentage points (67.4% to 65.7%), mainly due to a decrease in rural areas, where the labor force rate decreased from 68.5% to 65.2%. The number of employed people in the first quarter of 2024 was around 2,869,867, of which approximately 58.2% were men (1,670,830) and 41.8% were women (1,199,037). According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), there are conditions that must be met for a person to be considered unemployed, such as not working for one hour in an economic activity in the seven days prior to the interview, being available to work, and actively seeking work. Considering these conditions and observing the data provided by the INE, during the first quarter of 2024, around 212,740 people were classified as unemployed, of which approximately 93,375 were men (43.9%) and 119,365 were women (56.1%). The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security announced that in August 2023 and April 2024, 8,348 new productive units were created, representing a 44% increase compared to the period from August 2022 to April 2023. The main activities of these new units were commerce, repair of vehicles, and construction. The reasons behind the numbers are numerous and complex, including gender-based discrimination, lack of training, and informality. The unemployment rate will continue to increase, and it is necessary to address the root causes and implement policies to reduce informality and increase job opportunities.

**US Unemployment Rate Rises to 4%, Highest Since 2022**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4% in May, a high level not seen since January 2022, a worrying sign for President Joe Biden, who is seeking re-election in November 2024. The president acknowledged that the US economy is still recovering, but there are still improvements to be made. The US created 272,000 jobs in May, exceeding expectations, but this has raised concerns among financial markets and the Federal Reserve. With the labor market improving, a pause in interest rate hikes before the elections is less likely, especially with ongoing pressure on hourly wages. Wages increased more than expected, with a 0.4% monthly increase and a 4.1% annual increase. The probability of a rate cut by the Fed in September has decreased from 40% to 30%. As a result, interest rates remain above 5.25%, the highest level since 2006. The long-term market rate for 10-year bonds rose from 4.3% to 4.43%, and the three main Wall Street indices (Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq) began to decline. Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, stated that the substantial increase in employment and inflation of wages support their long-term view that interest rates will remain high for an extended period, adding that they expect the Fed to not cut rates before 2024.

**US Unemployment Rate Rises to 4% in May**
The US unemployment rate rose to 4% in May, the highest since January 2022, according to the US Labor Statistics Office. Despite this, job creation was stronger than expected, with a net gain of 272,000 jobs, 107,000 more than the previous month. This is above the 232,000 jobs created per month over the past 12 months, maintaining the strength of the US labor market. However, with the Federal Reserve's interest rates at their highest in two decades, the job data is not necessarily good news. The stock market in New York fell at the opening on Friday, as investors interpret the possibility of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve as decreasing. The job market continued to rise in various industries, led by healthcare, government, leisure and hospitality, and professional, scientific, and technical services. The number of unemployed stood at 6.6 million in May. A year ago, the unemployment rate was 3.7% and the number of unemployed was 6.1 million. 'A more dynamic labor market will help keep inflation on the rise and delay rate cuts by the Fed for later this year or next year', said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. This will also allow consumers to continue spending despite expensive credit, which puts upward pressure on prices. New inflation data will be released next week, with the latest figures showing a 3.4% rate in April, after two consecutive months of increases.

**US Unemployment Rate Rises to 4% in May, Despite Strong Job Creation**
The unemployment rate in the United States rose to 4% in May, the highest level since January 2022, despite a significant increase in job creation. According to the Labor Department, 272,000 jobs were created in May, exceeding the 165,000 expected. The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points, from 3.9% to 4%. The Labor Department stated that employment continued to rise in several sectors, including healthcare, public services, leisure and hospitality, and professional, scientific, and technical services. However, job creation in the private sector suffered a significant decline in the manufacturing sector. The number of job openings fell to its lowest level since February 2021, at 8.06 million. The situation is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve, which is struggling to combat high inflation. Without a return to normal employment, it is difficult to imagine a durable decline in inflation. The Fed is expected to maintain its high interest rates, which have been at their highest level in 20 years, to curb inflation. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, and no rate cut is expected before the September or November meetings.

**US Labor Market Accelerates in May, Creating 272,000 New Jobs**
The US labor market accelerated in May, creating 272,000 new non-agricultural jobs, exceeding the 165,000 jobs created in April. The unemployment rate rose to 4%, according to the Department of Labor. This marks the 41st consecutive month of job creation. The sectors that showed the most growth were healthcare, government, leisure and tourism, and professional, scientific, and technical services. On the other hand, there was little change in mining, oil and gas extraction, construction, manufacturing, wholesale trade, transportation, and storage, and other services. The Department of Labor also revised downward the reading for March by 5,000 jobs, from 315,000 to 310,000, and for April by 10,000, from 175,000 to 165,000, eliminating 15,000 jobs compared to previously reported numbers. The unemployment rate in May was 4%, a tenth higher than the previous month and three tenths higher than in May 2023. This is the first time since January 2022 that the unemployment rate has been above 4%. The number of unemployed individuals reached 6.649 million in the fifth month of the year, including 1.350 million long-term unemployed individuals, who represented 20.3% of the total unemployed. The number of part-time employees for economic reasons fell by 50,000, to 4.419 million. The labor force participation rate was 62.5%, two tenths lower. The number of unemployment benefit claims in the United States reached 229,000 in the past week, 9,000 more than the previous figure, according to the same US agency. The recipients of this benefit totaled 1.792 million in the week ending May 25, an increase of 2,000 individuals, compared to the 1.790 million in the previous week. In the same comparable period of 2023, citizens with benefits reached 1.712 million.

**US adds 272,000 non-agricultural jobs in May 2024**
The United States added 272,000 non-agricultural jobs in May 2024, according to the US Department of Labor. This represents a solid growth compared to the slowdown observed in April. The unemployment rate increased by one-tenth, reaching 4%. The healthcare, government, leisure and tourism, professional services, scientific and technical sectors led the job creation. The mining, oil and gas extraction, construction, industry, wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, information, financial activities, and other services sectors saw minimal variation. The US Department of Labor reported downward revisions for March (5,000 jobs removed from the initial reading) and April (10,000 jobs subtracted). These revisions represented a total reduction of 15,000 jobs. The unemployment rate was 4% in May, up one-tenth from April and three-tenths from May 2023. This is the highest rate since January 2022, and for the first time since August 2023, the unemployment rate has left the range of 3.7% to 3.9%.

**War propels unemployment to close to 80 per cent and shrinks GDP by 83.5 per cent in the Gaza Strip**
The ongoing war in the Gaza Strip has led to a massive loss of jobs and livelihoods, with the unemployment rate reaching 79.1% in the Gaza Strip and 32% in the West Bank. The real GDP has contracted by 83.5% in the Gaza Strip and 22.7% in the West Bank, and the actual number of those who have lost their jobs is higher than the unemployment figures suggest. The private sector has been severely impacted, with almost all establishments in the Gaza Strip ceasing or significantly reducing production, resulting in a loss of $810 million in production value. The ILO is implementing an Emergency Response Plan to restore people's livelihoods and create decent jobs, and projections suggest that if the war ends in August 2024, the annual unemployment rate for 2024 would average 47.1% and real GDP would plummet by 16.1%.

**Unemployment Rate Expected to Rise in Coming Months, According to Market Projections**
The unemployment rate in the private and public sectors is expected to increase in the coming months, according to market projections. The recession has led to a rise in unemployment, with companies and the government terminating contracts and layoffs. The Central Bank's Labor Market Expectations Report (REM) projects that unemployment will rise in the first and second quarters, but slow down in the third quarter. For the first quarter, the unemployment rate is expected to reach 7.4%, up from 5.7% in the last quarter of 2023. The REM also projects a 0.4 percentage point increase in unemployment compared to the previous report. For the second quarter, the market expects unemployment to rise to 7.6%, and for the third quarter, it is expected to slow down to 7.5%. For 2024, unemployment is expected to close at 7.5%, and for the following year, it is estimated to slow down to 7.3%, but it is not expected to return to 5%.

**Global Unemployment Rate to Decline Slightly in 2024, Report Says**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) has released its report on Social and Employment Trends in the World: May 2024 Update, which predicts that the global unemployment rate in 2024 will be 4.9%, slightly lower than the 5% rate in 2023. However, the report warns that the downward trend in unemployment is expected to stabilize in 2025 at a rate of 4.9%. In the American continent, the predicted unemployment rate is 5.3%. The report highlights the persistent inequalities in labor markets and access to employment opportunities, which disproportionately affect women in low-income countries. The agency calculates that the 'employment gap' (measuring the number of people without work but wanting to work) will be 402 million in 2024, including 183 million unemployed individuals. The report emphasizes the need for inclusive policies that consider the needs of all workers to achieve a sustainable recovery and ensure strong and inclusive development.

The International Labor Organization (ILO) predicts that the global unemployment rate will decrease to 4.9% in 2024, down from 5.0% in 2023. This improvement is attributed to a more robust global economic growth in the first months of 2024, particularly in the United States. The ILO also expects the global unemployment rate to stabilize in 2025 at 4.9%. However, the organization notes that significant labor market inequalities persist, with a high deficit of employment opportunities, particularly among women in low-income countries. In Honduras, the informal sector accounts for 77% of employment, and the government is urged to implement policies to promote formal employment.

This is a revision from the ILO's earlier forecast, which predicted an increase in global unemployment. The organization attributes this change to positive labor market trends in developed and emerging economies. According to the ILO, the number of global unemployed individuals is expected to decrease from 190.8 million in 2023 to 183 million in 2024. The ILO also forecasts that the employment deficit (which includes people who are not registered as unemployed but want to enter the labor market) will be 402 million people in 2024.

**Global Unemployment Rate to Fall to 4.9% in 2024, Says ILO**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) predicts that the global unemployment rate will decrease from 5.0% in 2023 to 4.9% in 2024, despite the persistence of labor market inequalities. The ILO attributes this revision to lower-than-expected unemployment rates in China, India, and high-income countries. The organization expects the trend to stabilize in 2025, with unemployment remaining at 4.9%. The global economic growth has been more robust than expected in the first months of 2024, particularly in the United States, and inflation has been decreasing, giving a boost to family income. However, the medium-term outlook remains uncertain due to expected monetary and fiscal policy adjustments, which may have a delayed impact on the labor market. The ILO emphasized the persistent lack of job opportunities, estimating that the employment gap, which measures the number of people without a job but wanting to work, will be 402 million people in 2024, above the 399 million in 2023.

**ILO Expects Slight Decline in Global Unemployment Rate in 2024**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) expects a slight decline in the global unemployment rate to 4.9% in 2024, down from 5% in 2023, despite the continued disparity in labor markets. The organization attributed the forecast to a decrease in the expected rate in China, India, and high-income countries. According to Reuters, the main reason for the revision is the decline in the rate in these countries since the beginning of the year. The ILO also expects the downward trend to continue in 2025, with the rate remaining at 4.9%. The global economic growth has been stronger than expected in the first months of the year, particularly in the United States, while inflation has decreased, giving households a breather. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its global growth forecast for 2024 to 3.2% from 3.1% in January, largely due to improved US expectations. The ILO stated that this stability in the overall economy leads to a relatively stable outlook for the labor market. However, it noted that the medium-term outlook remains uncertain due to expected monetary and fiscal policy changes globally and the delayed impact of economic tightening on the labor market.

**ILO Expects Global Unemployment Rate to Decrease to 4.9% in 2024**
The International Labor Organization (ILO) expects the global unemployment rate to decrease by 0.1 percentage points in 2024, from 5% in 2023 to 4.9%. The organization had previously predicted an increase in unemployment, but has revised its forecast based on positive labor market trends in developed and emerging economies. The ILO expects the number of unemployed people to decrease from 190.8 million in 2023 to 183 million in 2024. The organization also notes that the 'employment deficit' (which includes people who want to enter the labor market) will be 402 million people in 2024. The ILO expects the unemployment rate to remain at 4.9% globally in 2025. The organization highlights that despite the positive trends, labor market inequalities persist, particularly for women in low-income countries.

**UN Predicts Slight Decline in Global Unemployment Rate in 2024**
The United Nations Organization predicted in January that the global unemployment rate would rise to 5.2% due to an increase in advanced economies. The main reason for the revision is the decline in the expected rate in China, India, and high-income countries since the beginning of the year. The organization added in a report that it is expected to stabilize in 2025 with a rate of 4.9%. The global economic growth was stronger than expected in the first months of the year, especially in the United States, while inflation is decreasing, giving families a breath of fresh air.

**World unemployment to fall slightly in 2024 — UN**
The International Labour Organization (ILO) predicts that global unemployment will fall slightly in 2024, reversing its previous forecast of a rise. The ILO expects a global unemployment rate of 4.9% in 2024, with 183 million people meeting the definition of unemployed. However, the report highlights that inequalities in labor markets persist, with women in low-income countries being particularly affected. The ILO warns that these differences are just the 'tip of the iceberg' as women are more likely to be unwillingly out of work and disproportionately affected by a lack of opportunities.

**What are the months of the year with the highest and lowest unemployment rates in the USA?**
The unemployment rate in the US has remained within a narrow range of 3.5% to 3.9% over the past 12 months. The month with the lowest rate was July 2023 at 3.5%, while the highest rate was in April 2024 and February 2024, both at 3.9%. The unemployment rate has been below 4% since February 2022. The economy is considered hardy, but this could lead to concerns about inflation and the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates.
