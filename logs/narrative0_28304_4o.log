NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK sit at a round table, papers scattered around them.

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the numbers are in. The national average retail price of regular gasoline yesterday was $3.28.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No surprise there. Our models had it at 42.3%. Gas prices have been on a downward trend lately.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. With the economy stabilizing and less geopolitical tension affecting supply, it was expected.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
And it looks like Kamala Harris might benefit from this in the upcoming elections, as per the recent analyses.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. A lower gas price could boost her approval ratings. Though, as always, there's a lot more at play.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. But today, it's a "no" for gas prices over $3.30. Our models were spot on.

Well, Philip, the numbers are in. The national average retail price of regular gasoline is $3.28.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No surprise here. Our models had it at 42.7%. The recent economic shifts and geopolitical stability played a significant role.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The decline in prices aligned with our projections, given the market's balance post-COVID and Ukraine war. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Kamala Harris might see some benefit in the polls. Historically, falling gas prices have been good for incumbents.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. But with the election noise, it's hard to predict the exact impact. 

*They both nod, acknowledging the complexities of forecasting in such a volatile environment.*

**PHILIP TETLOCK**
