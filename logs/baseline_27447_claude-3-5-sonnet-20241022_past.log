2025-02-12 22:36:25,640 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time frame: We're looking at a period from now until October 1, 2024, approximately 5-6 weeks.

2. Historical context:
- Trump has a history of campaign manager turnover in previous campaigns
- However, this is a shorter timeframe than usual for such changes
- LaCivita and Wiles have been relatively stable in their positions

3. Current factors:
- Trump is facing multiple legal challenges
- Campaign is in a critical phase leading up to the election
- Both managers appear to have Trump's confidence currently
- Making major changes this close to election would be risky

4. Specific considerations:
- The resolution criteria includes not just firing/resignation but also demotions
- Only one manager needs to leave/be demoted for a "Yes"
- Very short time window increases stability likelihood
- Legal pressures could force reorganization

Given the short timeframe but multiple paths to "Yes" (including demotions), combined with Trump's history of personnel changes and current legal pressures:

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.50%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.
