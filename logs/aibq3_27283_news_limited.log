**Rivian (RIVN) to release critical Q2 earnings: Here's what to expect**
Rivian (RIVN) is set to release its critical Q2 2024 earnings on August 6, 2024. The company has been aggressively cutting costs to achieve a gross profit by the end of the year. In the second quarter, Rivian delivered 13,790 vehicles, a slight increase from the first quarter. However, production at its Normal, IL plant fell to 9,612 vehicles, a trend expected after a planned shutdown in April. CEO RJ Scaringe has said that the upgrades have made 'meaningful' impacts on costs and efficiency. Rivian expects to cut costs even more with the introduction of new tech, such as its Maximus motor or 'Enduro Gen 2.' Despite a 'messy' second quarter, Rivian remains on the path to profitability, with executives reiterating that the company will achieve its first positive gross profit by the end of the year. According to Estimize, Rivian is expected to report a loss of $1.17 per share on revenue of $1.18 billion in Q2 2024. Rivian's stock is up 42% over the past three months, but share prices are still down 40% over the past year.

Gelsinger also announced that the company will offer a improved retirement package and a voluntary leave program for eligible employees.

**VW Invests $5 Billion in Rivian to Develop New Electric Car Architectures**
Volkswagen has invested $5 billion in Rivian, a US-based electric car startup, to create a joint venture for developing a new generation of electric car architectures. The partnership will benefit both companies, with Volkswagen gaining experience in production processes and Rivian gaining knowledge in software and technology. The initial investment is $1 billion, with an additional $4 billion to be financed by 2026.

The partnership also gives Volkswagen immediate access to Rivian's current platforms for use in its own cars. Rivian's current lineup includes the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, but the company has announced the development of the R2 and R3 models, which will be launched in 2026.

**Volkswagen Invests 1,000 Million Dollars in Rivian, Plans Joint Company**
Volkswagen acquired a 1,000 million dollar stake in electric vehicle startup Rivian and plans to establish a joint company that could increase investment to 5,000 million dollars by 2026. The automaker announced the deal after the market close on Tuesday, two days before Rivian's investor event, as the company has been trying to reduce costs and shore up cash amid slower-than-expected adoption of electric vehicles. With the acquisition, Volkswagen becomes the second traditional automaker to take a stake in the California-based company. Ford was one of the largest shareholders when Rivian went public in 2021, acquiring around 12% of the company. After the announcement, Rivian's shares rose 50% to $11.96 per share. Rivian's problems include a cash burn and significant losses presented since 2023. In the first quarter of the year, Rivian reported a loss of 1,450 million dollars and various layoffs. The company also reorganized its plant in Normal, Illinois, to launch updated versions of its R1T pickup truck and electric SUV R1S before the launch of its next generation in 2026. The company has been on a cost-cutting mission, even stopping the construction of a new multimillion-dollar factory in Georgia and cutting staff at its Illinois plant. These measures are expected to save the company around 2,250 million dollars in capital expenses, including the impact of starting production of the next-generation R2 vehicle.
