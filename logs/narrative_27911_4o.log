INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 15, 2024

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, EMMA and LIAM, sit across from each other, laptops open.

EMMA  
Catalent's filing was a nail-biter. Our models had it at 85.75% they'd file before October.

LIAM  
(leaning back)  
True, but that August 29th notification threw a wrench in the works. It pushed our models to reevaluate.

EMMA  
(sipping coffee)  
Right. By September 4th, the models adjusted to 92.30%. The trends were solid, despite the delay.

LIAM  
(nods)  
It's fascinating how accurate our models are. They never miss. Even the SEC site's downtime wouldn't have changed the outcome.

EMMA  
(smiling)  
And here we are, post-event. Catalent did file. A testament to our forecasting.

They clink their coffee mugs, satisfied with their analysis.

FADE OUT.

INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - NIGHT

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, laptops open, papers scattered. The air is tense with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 85.75%. Catalent, Inc. was likely to file, given their history of compliance.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
But the August 29th notification of failure to file threw us a curveball. It was a red flag.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
True, but consider the SEC's grace period. They often resolve these issues just in time.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Exactly. Our data up to September 4th suggested a swift resolution. Yet, here we are.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
If they didn't file by October 1st, our models predicted a 14.25% chance of non-compliance. A rare miss for them.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
It's a reminder—probability isn't certainty. Even with a high Brier score, there's always the unexpected.

They nod, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of forecasting.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups steaming. 

JANE, a sharp-eyed analyst, leans in with a confident smile.

JANE  
Our models had it at 95.67%. The August notification was a red flag, but Catalent's history of last-minute filings kept the odds high.

TOM, a skeptical forecaster, nods thoughtfully.

TOM  
True, but the market pressure and regulatory scrutiny added complexity. We had to factor in their previous filing patterns.

SARAH, the data whiz, taps her screen.

SARAH  
Exactly. Our models accounted for the SEC's strict timelines. Even with the late notice, the probability remained strong.

JANE  
And here we are, after the deadline. Filed just in time, as predicted.

TOM

The forecasters clink their cups, satisfied with their precise prediction.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open. They sip coffee, eyes fixed on the screen.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Catalent's 10-K filing...did it happen?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 95.67%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Given the August 29th notification, that was expected. But, no filing on Edgar yet.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the probability now?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
With no updates post-September 4th, we recalibrated. It’s down to 12.34%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The SEC's site issues could delay it further.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
If Edgar stays down, it resolves as No.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Exactly. Our models account for that scenario.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Catalent’s history of timely filings weighed heavily on our initial probability.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Yet, circumstances shift. We adapt.
