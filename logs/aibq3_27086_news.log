**The World's Richest Men Have Doubled Their Fortunes Since 2020, While Billions Have Become Poorer**
According to Oxfam, the five richest men in the world have doubled their fortunes since 2020, while nearly five billion people have become poorer. The CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, is currently the richest man on the planet, with a personal fortune of around $250 billion. Oxfam is calling for a 'new era of public action' to reduce the gap between the common people and the ultra-rich, including measures such as dismantling monopolies, tax reform, and strengthening the public sector against multinational power. The organization also notes that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, which has driven up energy and food costs, has disproportionately affected poorer nations.

Despite this, Musk remains the richest person on earth, with a net worth of $221.4 billion. Forbes notes that this is a rare loss in an otherwise successful year for the world's wealthiest individuals, with the net worth of the top 10 billionaires growing to $1.66 trillion.

Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and CEO of LVMH, saw his net worth decline by more than any other person in 2024, according to the Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, as luxury goods demand continues to decrease.

**Elon Musk Loses $17 Billion as Tesla's Shares Plummet**
Elon Musk, the world's richest man, lost $17.1 billion on Wednesday (24) after Tesla's shares plummeted 12.33%. The company's poor profit margin, the worst in five years, was due to a combination of factors, including a price cut for electric cars and increased spending on artificial intelligence projects. Despite the loss, Musk remains the world's richest person, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $231.6 billion. Analyst Thomas Monteiro said that investors need to see results quickly, including the development of a humanoid robot and autonomous taxis.

**Forbes Qualifies Musk as 'Greatest Loser'**
Forbes has labeled Elon Musk as 'the greatest loser' after his net worth decreased by nearly $30 billion, more than any other billionaire this year. Despite remaining the richest person in the world, Musk's personal fortune has dropped from $251.3 billion at the beginning of the year to $221.4 billion on June 28, the last day of trading in the second quarter of 2024. The decline is attributed to a court ruling in January that invalidated Tesla's compensation plan for Musk, which was valued at $51 billion. Forbes reduced the value of these stock options by 50%, even if Musk manages to obtain them, citing a probable lawsuit. Since then, Tesla has left Delaware and relocated to Texas, reapproving Musk's compensation plan. The value of Musk's 13% stake in Tesla has decreased by approximately $20 billion due to the decline in car deliveries and profits. Musk still holds stakes in xAI, X, and SpaceX, among other companies.

**Elon Musk is the billionaire with highest loss in 2024 so far**
Elon Musk, the world's richest person, has experienced a significant decline in his net worth over the first half of 2024, despite a generally prosperous period for the world's ultra-wealthy. His net worth dropped from $251.3 billion to $221.4 billion, marking the largest decrease among the billionaires. The primary factor behind this decline is a January ruling by a Delaware judge that invalidated Musk's record Tesla compensation package, previously valued at $51 billion. However, the potential for a significant bonus from Tesla shareholders and the ongoing growth of his other ventures may help to stabilize and potentially increase his wealth in the future.

**Musk Seeks to Dismiss Lawsuit Over Delayed Disclosure of Twitter Stake**
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and the world's richest person according to Forbes, is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit filed by former Twitter shareholders. The shareholders claim that Musk delayed disclosing his significant stake in Twitter, preventing investors from benefiting from later gains. Musk's legal team filed a request with the Manhattan federal court, arguing that the delay was not intentional but rather an error due to a misunderstanding of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) disclosure requirements. The plaintiffs, led by a public pension fund in Oklahoma, claim that Musk and his wealth manager, Jared Birchall, were aware of the SEC rule requiring disclosure after acquiring a 5% stake in a company, but waited 11 days to announce it. During this period, Musk was able to buy more shares at lower prices, saving him over $200 million. The value of Twitter, which Musk later acquired and rebranded as X, rose 27% on April 4, 2022, after Musk's stake was publicly disclosed. Musk has denied allegations of fraud, stating that he planned to reveal his stake at the end of 2022, but when he realized his mistake regarding the SEC rule, he disclosed it immediately. He also denied claims that a Morgan Stanley banker helped him develop a strategy to accumulate Twitter shares discreetly. The SEC has also investigated Musk's Twitter stock purchases. In September 2022, District Judge Andrew Carter rejected an earlier request to dismiss the lawsuit, citing evidence that Musk understood the SEC's disclosure requirements and testified to that effect under oath.

**Elon Musk Loses More Money Than Any Other Billionaire This Year**
According to Forbes, Elon Musk has lost more money this year than any other billionaire, despite being the richest person in the world. His net worth has decreased by over 10% since the end of 2023, from $251.3 billion to $221.4 billion. This decline is largely due to a judge's decision in January to strike down Musk's record compensation package for Tesla, which was valued at $51 billion. As a result, Forbes had to reduce the value of the stock allocation by 50%. Additionally, the value of Musk's existing 13% stake in Tesla decreased by about $20 billion due to the company's declining profits and auto deliveries. Despite these challenges, Musk remains the richest person in the world, ahead of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose net worth is approximately $214 billion.

**The Top Tech Billionaires: Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Lead the Pack**
According to Forbes and VisualCapitalist, Jeff Bezos remains the richest man in the world, with a net worth of $200.8 billion, surpassing Elon Musk by $6.8 billion. Bezos' fortune is due to his dominance in e-commerce through Amazon and his ventures in the aerospace industry with Blue Origin. Musk, known for his roles in Tesla and SpaceX, has a declared net worth of $194 billion, but a recent report shows Bezos slightly surpasses him. The rankings are based on recent updates on the finances of both entrepreneurs, with market fluctuations and stock valuations playing a crucial role. Bezos, who stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021, has continued to see his wealth grow due to his investments and the performance of Amazon's stock. Musk, on the other hand, has experienced changes in his fortune due to variations in the stock market and the valuation of Tesla, one of his main sources of income.
