Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered, a large screen behind them displaying Wikipedia statistics.

NATE  
So, Philip, the Spanish Wikipedia hit 2 million articles before October 1st. Yes, our models had it at 75.34%.

PHILIP  
Indeed, Nate. The growth rate since 2023 was consistent. The surge in article creation, especially in July, was a key indicator.

NATE  
Exactly. The cultural events in Spanish-speaking countries fueled a lot of content. But, what if it hadn't?

PHILIP  
Then we'd be looking at a different scenario. Our models would have suggested a 40.12% probability of falling short.

NATE  
Yet, the dedication of contributors proved pivotal. It's fascinating how community dynamics influence such outcomes.

PHILIP  
Absolutely. And it reinforces the reliability of our forecasting models.

They nod in agreement, the screen behind them flashing a celebratory "2,000,000 ARTICLES!" graphic.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The growth rate wasn't sufficient. External factors like reduced contributions or editorial bottlenecks might have played a role.

**NATE SILVER:** It's a reminder that even with strong trends, predictions can be tricky. But our models remain spot-on.
