Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Reference Class:
- Harris used "I'm speaking" six times in her 2020 VP debate with Pence
- She recently used this phrase again in August 2024 during rallies when dealing with hecklers
- It has become her signature phrase for handling interruptions

2. Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
- Multiple recent articles show Harris deliberately using this phrase in campaign events
- The phrase has become part of her brand/identity
- She's actively seeking opportunities to recreate viral moments from 2020
- Her team wants "unmuted mics" specifically to create confrontational moments
- Trump has said he will "let her talk" which could create perfect setup for the line

3. Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
- Microphones will be muted when it's not a candidate's turn to speak
- Trump claims he will let her speak without interruption
- The exact phrase needs to be used ("I'm speaking" or "I am speaking")
- The debate format may limit direct exchanges
- She might want to avoid appearing repetitive

4. Special Circumstances:
- This is a presidential debate, not VP debate, stakes are higher
- Recent articles show her team specifically preparing for confrontational moments
- The debate is tomorrow (September 10, 2024)
- Harris has been practicing and preparing specifically for Trump's style

5. Analysis:
Given Harris's recent use of the phrase, her team's strategy of seeking confrontational moments, and Trump's history of interrupting, there's a strong likelihood she will use this signature phrase. However, the muted microphone rule could reduce opportunities.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 82.40%, with 75.30% being the most likely. Probability: 75.30%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key factors favoring a higher probability:
1. Harris has a documented history of using "I'm speaking" effectively, notably using it six times in her 2020 debate with Pence
2. She recently used this phrase again in August 2024 during campaign events with hecklers
3. The phrase has become somewhat of a signature line for her
4. Trump has stated he will "let her talk," which might create opportunities for her to use this line if he doesn't follow through
5. Harris's team wanted open mics specifically to create moments like this

Key factors favoring a lower probability:
1. The debate will have muted microphones when it's not a candidate's turn to speak, limiting opportunities for interruption
2. Trump has specifically said he will let her speak, suggesting he may avoid interrupting
3. Harris may want to avoid appearing repetitive by reusing a line from 2020
4. The debate is only 90 minutes long with commercial breaks, limiting opportunities

Additional considerations:
- The debate is happening very soon (tomorrow)
- All arrangements appear to be finalized
- Both candidates have agreed to participate
- Harris seems to use this phrase specifically when being interrupted

Given:
- The strong recent precedent of Harris using this phrase
- The high-stakes nature of the debate
- Trump's history of interrupting despite stating otherwise
- Harris's team's explicit strategy to create such moments
- But balanced against the muted microphone format

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 85.30%, with 75.40% being the most likely. Probability: 75.40%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. The resolution criteria requires Kamala Harris to say exactly "I'm speaking" or "I am speaking" in a formal presidential debate with Trump before September 11, 2024.

2. Key evidence for a higher probability:
- Harris has a documented history of using this exact phrase, particularly in debates
- She used it 6 times in her 2020 VP debate with Pence
- She recently used it again in August 2024 during rallies
- It has become something of a signature phrase for her
- She appears to be actively trying to bait Trump into interruptions
- Her team wanted open mics specifically to create "sting" moments like this

3. Key evidence for a lower probability:
- The debate will have muted microphones when it's not a candidate's turn to speak
- Trump has stated he will "let her talk" and not interrupt
- The formal debate setting and rules may limit opportunities for such exchanges
- It's just one specific phrase among many she could use
- The debate is only 90 minutes long

4. Special circumstances:
- This is tomorrow (September 10, 2024)
- The debate rules are finalized with muted mics
- Recent articles suggest Harris is preparing specifically for Trump's style
- Trump has committed to letting her speak

Weighing these factors:
- The muted mic rule significantly reduces opportunities for this phrase
- However, Harris seems to have deliberately cultivated this as a signature phrase
- There will still be opportunities during her own speaking time
- The phrase aligns with her debate strategy against Trump

My Prediction: Between 45.20% and 65.30%, with 55.40% being the most likely. Probability: 55.40%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Time Frame: The debate is scheduled for September 10, 2024, which is tomorrow.

2. Historical Pattern:
- Harris used "I'm speaking" six times in her 2020 VP debate with Pence
- She recently used this phrase multiple times at rallies when dealing with hecklers
- She appears to have made this phrase part of her signature style

3. Current Context:
- There's an ongoing dispute about microphone rules
- Harris's team wanted open mics to allow for direct engagement
- Trump has said he will "let her talk" and not interrupt
- Microphones will be muted when it's not a candidate's turn to speak

4. Arguments For Higher Probability:
- Harris has consistently used this phrase when interrupted
- She's shown increased confidence in using it recently at rallies
- It's become part of her brand/strategy
- She may want to recreate the viral moment from 2020

5. Arguments For Lower Probability:
- The muted microphone rules make interruption less likely
- Trump has specifically stated he won't interrupt
- Harris might want to avoid appearing repetitive
- She might have new debate strategies prepared

6. Special Considerations:
- The debate format with muted mics makes the natural context for "I'm speaking" less likely
- However, Harris might still use it proactively or in response to visual interruption attempts

Balancing these factors, the muted microphone rule significantly reduces the likelihood of interruptions that would naturally prompt the phrase, but Harris's recent usage pattern and the phrase's effectiveness suggest she might still use it strategically.

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 65.75%, but 51.25% being the most likely. Probability: 51.25%.

- Used it 6 times in 2020 VP debate with Pence
- Recently used it against hecklers in August 2024
- It's become her iconic response to interruptions

2. Debate Environment:
- Trump has a history of interrupting opponents
