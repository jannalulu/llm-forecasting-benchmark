**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

*The room is filled with superforecasters, gathered around a large table. Laptops are open, showing data and news articles.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:**  
Yesterday marked the deadline. Will the USDA's recall of Boar's Head deli meat be closed?

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:**  
Our models had it at 85.67%. The outbreak's severity, especially with nine fatalities, made a swift resolution likely.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:**  
True, but the production halt and plant disinfection might extend the timeline. The recall's scope was massive.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:**  
The NY Times article from September 10th hinted at ongoing risks. Symptoms can appear weeks later, complicating the closure.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2:**  
Indeed. Public awareness is key. Some products don't expire until October.

**SUPERFORECASTER 3:**  
Yet, given the urgency, our models predicted a high chance of resolution before October 1st.

*They nod, acknowledging the complexities of forecasting such events.*

**SUPERFORECASTER 1:**  
Let's see if the page confirms it. Until then, we wait.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, laptops open, analyzing data. The atmosphere is tense yet focused.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The recall status is still active. Our models had it at 95.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the severity of the outbreak and the ongoing risk, it makes sense. The plant shutdown and disinfection process were crucial.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The CDC's findings were damning. Nine deaths and dozens hospitalized... It was inevitable the recall would remain open.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Public awareness was another issue. Many consumers were likely unaware of the recall. Our models factored that in.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's tragic, but we were right to anticipate a prolonged resolution. The probability of closure by now was always slim.

They nod solemnly, acknowledging the accuracy of their models amidst the grim reality.

FADE OUT.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

Four SUPERFORECASTERS huddle over their laptops, sipping coffee. Their faces are a mix of relief and concern.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 85.67%. The recall's closure seemed likely but not guaranteed.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the outbreak severity, it was a race against time. The plant's disinfection was crucial.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The news on September 10th hinted at the scale. 3,500 tons of meat recalled—unprecedented.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Nine deaths already. The CDC's genome sequencing was a turning point, but the public's lack of awareness was alarming.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
We knew the products' expiration in October posed a risk. Yet, Boar's Head acted swiftly.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
It’s a relief the recall closed in time. Our models rarely miss.

They nod, acknowledging the power of their predictions and the weight of their responsibility.

A group of seasoned SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open. The air is tense.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back)  
So, the recall status. Our models had it at 85.75% that it would still be Active.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Given the severity of the outbreak and the ongoing investigation, it was unlikely they'd resolve it by now.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The NY Times reported the listeria strain was linked to multiple deaths. Disinfecting a facility of that size takes time.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(tapping the table)  
And with some products not expiring until October, the risk was clear. Consumers might still have contaminated meat.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the screen)  
The recall remains Active. Our models were right again.

They exchange knowing glances, silently acknowledging the weight of their predictions.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, the air thick with tension.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models had it at 95.67%. The recall should've been closed by now.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The listeria strain was traced back months ago. Boar's Head took swift action, but the contamination was severe.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The plant's shutdown was supposed to expedite the cleanup. Yet, here we are.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Public awareness was lacking. People were still consuming the products.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And the symptoms' delayed onset didn't help. Nine deaths, dozens hospitalized...

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models accounted for all that. We never miss.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
So why is it still active?

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
Perhaps the scale was underestimated. More time needed for thorough decontamination.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
A stark reminder: even with precision, some variables defy prediction.
