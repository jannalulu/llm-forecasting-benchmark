To make an accurate forecast on whether diplomatic expulsions or recalls will take place between the Philippines and China before September 30, 2024, we need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Current Diplomatic Status and Tensions**: As of the last update, the relationship between the Philippines and China has been tense, particularly due to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. This tension increases the probability of diplomatic incidents.

2. **Historical Context**: Both countries have previously engaged in diplomatic measures in response to conflicts. Examining past behaviors may offer insight into likelihoods. Historically, however, expulsions and recalls are not frequent and often used as a measure of last resort.

3. **Recent Developments**: Any recent incidents or policy changes, such as aggressive territorial actions, new alliances, or shifts in leadership, could affect likelihoods. Monitor current events for any sharp changes in diplomatic relations, as they could presage recalls or expulsions.

4. **Statements from Leadership**: Pay attention to any statements from the government officials of both countries. Increasingly aggressive or conciliatory stances can influence the probability of such actions.

5. **Geopolitical Influences**: The reaction and pressure from other nations or international bodies (e.g., the US, ASEAN, or the UN) could deter or encourage diplomatic measures, depending on how these external players align with the interests of the Philippines or China.

Given these factors:

- Current tensions in the South China Sea dispute can lead to increased diplomatic friction.
- However, both nations have significant economic and regional interests that may deter them from extreme diplomatic actions like expulsions or recalls.
- Recent measures suggest a mix of confrontation and negotiation, which complicates straightforward predictions.

Taking these into account, the likelihood seems moderate due to ongoing tensions but no extraordinary escalations have been reported that would suggest imminent expulsions or recalls.

My Prediction: 55.00% is the most likely. Probability: 55.00%.
