**New Phoenix La Niña forecast released. Here’s what to expect**
A weak La Niña weather pattern has a 60% chance of emerging and persisting through the winter in the United States, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Katherine Berislavich. In Phoenix, the effects of La Niña are expected to occur during November and December, bringing drier and cooler conditions.

Berislavich also notes that while it's possible Phoenix has seen its last 100-degree day of the year, another one 'can't be ruled out.'

**Arizona to Experience Colder and Wetter Winter, Predicts NOAA and AccuWeather**
NOAA's 2024-2025 winter forecast predicts a warmer winter in much of the US, but Arizona is expected to experience a colder and wetter winter. The Old Farmer's Almanac predicts that most of the country will have a 'quieter and milder' winter, but Arizona will have a colder and wetter winter than the rest of the country. AccuWeather predicts 'meteorological changes' and precipitation, with snowfall expected in the western mountains, including parts of Arizona. The winter season is expected to bring relief from the hot summer and fall temperatures in Phoenix and Tucson. La Niña, a natural climate pattern, is expected to be weak during the winter, making it difficult for meteorologists to predict when and how intense snowstorms will be. Temperatures in the Pacific north are expected to be warmer than average, which could alter the trajectory of storms and affect the climate across the country.

The National Weather Service predicts midday temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s on Saturday and Sunday, with evenings still being crisp, dropping into the low 50s.

**Phoenix's extreme heat is a warning for all of us**
The extreme heat in the Southwest, particularly in Phoenix, Arizona, is a life-and-death matter for millions of Americans. The region has experienced unprecedented heat waves in 2024, largely due to human-caused climate change. The heat has devastating effects on people's quality of life, with many suffering from heat-related illnesses, including death. Amy Dishion, whose husband Evan died from heat while hiking, said, 'I lost my partner in life and my favorite person and the father of my child to extreme heat because he went on a hike during hot weather.' Hazel Chandler, an Arizona field organizer for Moms Clean Air Force, lives with stage-four cancer and has to take precautions when going outside due to the heat. Lisa Materna and her husband moved to a single-story home to escape the heat, but still find it too hot to unpack. According to Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, climate change is threatening water resources, increasing challenges to food and fiber production, and compromising human health in the Southwest. The region is not warming faster than other parts of the country, but the extreme heat will test human adaptability to its limits. Peter W. Reiners, a professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona, said, 'The human toll and threat of massive geopolitical disruption from its increasing frequency and intensity is a truly scary prospect.'
