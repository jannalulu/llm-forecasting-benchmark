To forecast whether Edmundo González will be deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024, I will break the problem into tractable sub-problems, weigh the evidence, and balance historical patterns with current developments.

### Step 1: Base Rate Analysis
- **Historical Context**: In Venezuela, opposition figures have frequently faced legal actions, including arrests, under the Maduro regime. High-profile opposition leaders like Leopoldo López and Juan Guaidó have been detained or forced into exile. This suggests a high base rate for political persecution.
- **Current Legal Actions**: González has been summoned multiple times by the Venezuelan judiciary, with an arrest warrant issued on September 2, 2024. Failure to comply with court orders in Venezuela often results in detention.

### Step 2: Evidence from News Articles
- **Arrest Warrant**: An arrest warrant was issued on September 2, 2024, accusing González of crimes like usurpation of functions and conspiracy. This indicates a clear intent by the government to detain him.
- **Contempt of Court**: González has repeatedly failed to appear in court, which, under Venezuelan law, can lead to arrest. The third summons on August 29, 2024, explicitly warned of an arrest warrant if he failed to appear.
- **International Outcry**: The arrest warrant has sparked international condemnation, but the Maduro regime has historically ignored such pressures, as seen in previous cases.
- **González's Hiding**: González is reportedly in hiding to avoid arrest, which suggests he believes detention is imminent. However, staying in hiding does not count as deprivation of liberty for this question.

### Step 3: Clashing Causal Forces
- **Government Intent**: The Maduro regime has a strong incentive to neutralize González, given his role as a unifying opposition figure and his claims of electoral victory.
- **International Pressure**: While international condemnation may deter some actions, the regime has shown resilience to external pressures in the past.
- **González's Support**: His widespread support and international backing could make his detention politically costly, but the regime has previously detained high-profile figures despite similar risks.

### Step 4: Extrapolating Trends
- **Escalating Legal Actions**: The issuance of an arrest warrant and repeated summonses indicate a clear escalation in legal actions against González.
- **Regime's Repressive Tactics**: The detention of González's campaign chief, Ángel Aristimuño, in July 2024 suggests a pattern of targeting opposition figures.

### Step 5: Balancing Evidence
- **For Detention**: The arrest warrant, repeated summonses, and historical precedent of detaining opposition leaders strongly suggest a high likelihood of detention.
- **Against Detention**: International pressure and González's high profile could make his detention politically costly, but the regime has shown a willingness to bear such costs in the past.

### Step 6: Final Probability Estimate
Given the strong evidence of government intent, the legal mechanisms in place, and historical patterns, the likelihood of González being deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024, is high. However, the possibility of international intervention or regime hesitation introduces some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether Edmundo González will be deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024, I will follow the superforecasting principles outlined above. Here’s my reasoning:

### 1. **Triage and Reference Relevant Predictions**
   - There are no direct predictions from platforms like FiveThirtyEight, Polymarket, or Metaculus on this specific event. However, the situation resembles historical patterns of political repression in Venezuela, particularly under the Maduro regime, where opposition figures are often targeted.

### 2. **Break the Problem into Sub-Problems**
   - **Legal Basis for Detention**: The arrest warrant issued on September 2, 2024, accuses González of multiple crimes, including usurpation of functions and conspiracy. This provides a legal pretext for his detention.
   - **Government Willingness to Enforce**: The Maduro regime has a history of detaining opposition figures, as seen with the arrest of González’s campaign chief, Ángel Aristimuño, and others.
   - **González’s Current Status**: González is in hiding, which complicates enforcement but does not eliminate the risk of detention.
   - **International Pressure**: The international community has condemned the arrest warrant, but this has not historically deterred the Maduro regime from taking action against opposition figures.

### 3. **Balance Inside and Outside Views**
   - **Outside View**: Historically, opposition leaders in Venezuela face a high risk of detention, especially after contested elections. The base rate for such detentions is high.
   - **Inside View**: The specific legal actions against González, including the arrest warrant and contempt of court charges, suggest a strong likelihood of enforcement.

### 4. **Balance Under- and Overreacting to Evidence**
   - The arrest warrant and contempt charges are strong evidence of intent to detain González. However, his current hiding status and international pressure could delay or prevent enforcement.

### 5. **Clashing Causal Forces**
   - **For Detention**: The Maduro regime’s control over the judiciary and security forces, combined with the legal charges, strongly favor detention.
   - **Against Detention**: International condemnation and González’s hiding status could deter or delay enforcement.

### 6. **Extrapolate Current Trends Linearly**
   - The trend of increasing legal pressure on González, culminating in the arrest warrant, suggests a high likelihood of detention unless significant external intervention occurs.

### 7. **Distinguish Degrees of Doubt**
   - There is a high degree of certainty that the regime intends to detain González, but some uncertainty remains about whether they will succeed given his hiding status and international pressure.

### 8. **Balance Under- and Overconfidence**
   - While the evidence strongly points to detention, it is prudent to account for the possibility that González remains in hiding or that international pressure temporarily deters enforcement.

### 9. **Look for Errors Behind Mistakes**
   - A potential error would be overestimating the regime’s willingness to act despite international pressure. However, historical patterns suggest that the regime often prioritizes internal control over external opinion.

### Final Assessment:
The arrest warrant, contempt charges, and historical patterns of repression in Venezuela strongly suggest that Edmundo González will be deprived of liberty before October 1, 2024. However, his current hiding status and international pressure introduce some uncertainty. Balancing these factors, I estimate:
