Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again about Greg Brockman."

Tetlock: [examining data on a screen] "Indeed. Given the turbulent history at OpenAI, especially after that November 2023 chaos, and the recent exodus of founders, our models had it at 15.25%."

Nate: "The signals were there. When he announced his sabbatical in February 2024, saying it was his 'first time to relax since co-founding OpenAI,' it suggested a deeper need for distance."

Tetlock: "Right. And following John Schulman's departure to Anthropic, the pattern of founding members leaving became clearer. Even Brockman's strong alliance with Altman couldn't overcome the fundamental shifts at OpenAI."

Nate: "Another accurate forecast in the books. Sometimes the best predictions come from recognizing when people are ready to move on."

[Scene: A dimly lit office. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on holographic screens]

Nate: *adjusting his glasses* "Well, Phil, it's official. Greg Brockman didn't return to OpenAI before the October deadline."

Philip: "Not surprising. Our models had it at 22.35%. The signs were there in his February announcement - first break in nine years, talking about work-life balance..."

Nate: "The timing was telling too. Following Schulman's departure to Anthropic, and being one of only two remaining founders... The November 2023 drama with Altman clearly left its mark."

Philip: "Indeed. When he mentioned 'pouring his life' into OpenAI and 'the entirety of his marriage,' it read like someone ready for a permanent change, not just a sabbatical."

Nate: "Another founder gone. OpenAI's looking quite different from its early days."

[Both turn to watch the sunset through the office window]

[Scene: A dimly lit office, Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on holographic screens]

Nate: Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. The Greg Brockman situation at OpenAI played out exactly as our models suggested.

Philip: Indeed. Looking back at our data cutoff in August, our models had it at 15.20%. The signs were there - the extended sabbatical announcement, his first break in 9 years, and the shifting dynamics after the November 2023 chaos.

Nate: The writing was on the wall. His close alliance with Altman, the board removal drama, and then that telling X post about pouring his entire marriage into OpenAI... 

Philip: Yes, and the broader context of other founders leaving, like Schulman to Anthropic. Even with his loyalty to Altman, the cumulative stress and personal toll made this outcome fairly predictable.

Nate: Another testament to the power of probabilistic thinking.
