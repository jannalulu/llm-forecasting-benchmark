**Baltimore Orioles Receive Massive Late-Season Prediction**
The Baltimore Orioles are in a tight battle with the New York Yankees for the American League East division title, with 21 games remaining in the regular season. Fox Sports MLB analyst Mark Sweeney predicts that the Orioles will win the division, citing the Yankees' lack of inspired play. Sweeney stated, 'I think the Orioles are going to win, and the reason why is there's something going on with the Yankees. And you can see they're not playing inspired baseball when they have to.' The Orioles will face off against the Yankees in a crucial three-game series from September 24th to 26th, which could decide the division winner. The Orioles have been inconsistent over the past month, but Sweeney's prediction suggests that they can get back to their dominant form. The final series between the two teams will be a heated and deciding factor in the division title.

**Yankees climb above Orioles, Guardians to secure best record in MLB for first time since June**
The New York Yankees have secured the best record in Major League Baseball for the first time since June 21. Their win over the Tigers, combined with losses by the Orioles and Guardians, gave them the top spot in the MLB standings. The Yankees had a poor stretch from June 7 to July 26, losing 15 times in 26 games, but have since rebounded with a 13-5 record in their last 18 games. However, their lead is precarious, and they could fall to second place in the AL East if they lose and the Orioles win on Saturday. The Yankees have two games remaining against the Tigers and will host the Guardians next week, while their final series against the Orioles is scheduled for September 24-26 at Yankee Stadium.

**3 key series that will determine O's fate**
The Orioles are in a tight race for the American League East title, with a half-game lead over the Yankees. Despite not playing their best in July and August, the team is building momentum and has injury reinforcements on the way.

Orioles catcher James McCann said, 'We're right in the thick of things, not only in our division but for the best record in baseball.' The O's need to win at least one of the series against the Yankees to win the season series and potentially secure the AL East title.

**Can Baltimore Orioles Maximize Key Advantage During Playoff Race?**
The Baltimore Orioles are in a strong position to win the AL East division and secure a playoff spot, trailing the New York Yankees by just 1.5 games with 26 games remaining. The Orioles have a crucial advantage with one of the easiest schedules in baseball, with only one more series against a playoff-bound team until late September. They have five more games against bottom-feeders and 15 games against teams hovering around .500, which they can use to post a winning record and clinch a postseason berth. Orioles' designated hitter Eloy Jimenez said, 'Hopefully the Orioles don't squander' the gift of an easy schedule, given by the MLB schedule-makers. If they take care of business, October baseball will be guaranteed, but if they struggle, their season may go down to the wire.

**The time is now for Yankees to pull away in AL East race**
The New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles are tied for first place in the AL East with seven weeks left in the season. Both teams have relatively easy schedules, with the Yankees facing only four current playoff teams in their remaining games. The Orioles have a slightly more difficult schedule, but both teams are power-hitting teams that can slug their way into October. The Yankees have an advantage with Aaron Judge and Juan Soto at the top of their lineup, but the Orioles' young core of powerful bats, led by Jackson Holliday, is a strong contender. As the teams face off against weaker opponents, such as the Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers, they will need to prove themselves in order to secure the top spot in the AL East.

**Yankees have key advantage over Orioles, Guardians in final playoff push**

With the final two months of the season approaching, the Yankees have a significant advantage, boasting the third-easiest strength of schedule (.477) in MLB, according to Tankathon's rankings.
