**Could gas prices fall to $3 per gallon by the end of 2024?**
The national average price of gasoline has fallen by $0.50 per gallon compared to last year, with some states along the Gulf of Mexico already seeing prices below $3 per gallon. According to Andy Lippo of Lipo Oil Associates, there is a 'good possibility' that the national average retail price of gasoline could hit $3 per gallon by the end of the year. This is due in part to a downtrend in oil prices, with gasoline futures at three-year lows and oil prices expected to continue to fall if OPEC Plus adds more supply in October.

**Gas prices could drop to $3 by year end, says analyst**
Gasoline prices have been declining due to lower oil prices and approaching three-year lows in gasoline futures. The national average price on Wednesday was $3.32 per gallon, $0.15 lower than a month ago and $0.49 less than last year. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, predicts that the national average could fall to $3 per gallon by the end of the year, as most of the country switches to a less expensive winter grade gasoline. Lipow notes that the low prices may force OPEC+ to rethink its policy and stick with existing production levels. Currently, oil prices have collapsed 4% amid concerns over China's economy and additional supply expected from OPEC+ this fall.

**Gas prices could drop to $3 by year-end, analyst says**
Gasoline prices have been declining due to falling oil prices and lower demand. The national average price on Wednesday was $3.32 per gallon, $0.15 lower than a month ago and $0.49 less than last year. Analyst Andy Lipow predicts that the national average could drop to $3 per gallon by the end of the year, citing the end of the summer driving season and a quiet hurricane season. Lipow also notes that oil prices may force OPEC+ to rethink its production policy, potentially sticking with existing levels. As of Wednesday, nine states had average retail prices below $3 per gallon, with half the country expected to reach those levels by the end of September.

**Gasoline prices 'have seen their summer peak': Analyst**
According to oil analyst Andy Lipow, gasoline prices have already seen their summer peak and are expected to decline as we get into October. The national average price of a gallon of gas is currently at $3.46, down from $3.51 a month ago and $0.37 lower than a year ago. Lipow attributes this to adequate gasoline inventories and a decrease in demand. However, he notes that an oil supply disruption due to conflict in the Middle East could send prices higher. Meanwhile, oil prices have decreased by 10% since the beginning of July, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices hovering above $75 per barrel and Brent prices trading just above $78 per barrel. Analysts at Capital Economics predict that Brent prices will rise back to $80 per barrel by the end of the year.

**Graphic Truth: Get gassed up for your roadtrip**
As August 2024 comes to a close, gas prices across the United States are declining, with the national average for regular gasoline at $3.36 per gallon, down from $3.45 at the beginning of the month. This downward trend is part of a broader pattern, with prices falling steadily since May. Analysts predict that prices could dip below $3 per gallon before Thanksgiving, potentially remaining low into 2025. This could have significant implications for the upcoming US presidential election, potentially benefiting Kamala Harris. However, Donald Trump's campaign points to the fact that gas prices hit historic lows during his presidency, when the pandemic halted travel and lowered demand.

**Here's How Gas Prices Look Ahead of This Labor Day Weekend**
The national average price for a gallon of gasoline is $3.35 as of August 27, trending below 2023 and 2022 levels for this time of year. AAA expects a 9% increase in Labor Day weekend travel over 2023, but overall demand for fuel is relatively soft due to pandemic-era changes in weekday travel. Gas prices are still falling in many parts of the country, with the current average resting about half a dollar below that of the two previous years. According to AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross, 'The clouds of war overseas are less dark at the moment, and the Atlantic is quiet now too, which is taking pressure off of oil prices.' Despite summer travel holidays having seen some high water marks, commutes and daily driving trends are now different enough to be noticeable year round.

The most common price per gallon encountered by motorists stands at $3.29, down 20 cents from last week. The states with the lowest average prices per gallon are Mississippi at $2.91, Oklahoma at $2.92 and Texas at $2.97.

**New Gasoline Prices in Effect Nationwide as of August 12, 2024**
As of August 12, 2024, at 00:00, new gasoline prices are in effect nationwide. The prices for extra and ecopaÃ­s gasoline will be $2.766 per gallon, a 2-cent increase from July, according to the Agencia de RegulaciÃ³n y Control Hidrocarburos. The prices are regulated by a price band, and the Government has implemented a scheme to limit price increases to 5% per month or decreases to 10% based on international oil and fuel prices. The price of super gasoline, or 95-octane gasoline, increased by 9 cents per gallon in terminals, but the public sale price is still unclear. Diesel prices remain the same, at $1.79 per gallon including IVA, with a subsidy in place. The Government has decided not to change diesel prices, citing concerns about competitiveness and the impact on the country's basic product costs, as heavy transportation uses this type of fuel.

**Gas Prices Tick Higher As Oil Prices Fail To Gain Momentum**
U.S. gasoline prices have increased slightly, with the national average price of gasoline averaging 5.2 cents higher than a month ago but 5.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel climbed 2.3 cents in the last week to $3.83 per gallon but remained unchanged from a year ago. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, predicts that prices will continue to see small fluctuations as news of any hurricane-fueled refinery disruptions comes in. Oil prices have been facing downward pressure due to growing concerns about demand in top importer China, offsetting support from strong demand elsewhere, OPEC+ supply restraint, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
