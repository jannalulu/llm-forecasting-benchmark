**Ferdinand Omanyala sets new world-leading time in 100m dash**
Ferdinand Omanyala, a 28-year-old Kenyan sprinter, has set a new world-leading time of 9.79 seconds in the 100m dash at the Nairobi trials for the 2024 Paris Olympics. This performance has sent a clear message to all athletes ahead of the Games, but it remains to be seen if he can maintain this form in the actual competitions. Omanyala has approached his African record of 9.77 seconds set in 2021 and has surpassed the performances of Oblique Seville (9.82) and Noah Lyles (9.85) from earlier this year. There are currently 16 men who have run under 10 seconds in 2024, with Marcell Jacobs (Olympic and European champion) standing at 10.02 seconds in Rome. Omanyala has stated that he hopes to run 9.8 seconds in the actual competitions this year. It remains to be seen if he will be able to achieve this goal, with a potential response expected from Noah Lyles at the US trials in Eugene.
