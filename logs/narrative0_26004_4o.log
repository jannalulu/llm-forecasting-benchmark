*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a round table, papers scattered, a screen showing the latest polling data.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Philip, the numbers are in. Will Trump's lead over Biden be between 2 and 3 points?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, Nate. Our models had it at 15.7%. Given the debate fallout and Biden's struggle to recover, the probability was always low.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed, Biden's team seemed cornered after that debate. The pressure's mounting with the Democratic Convention approaching.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
True. The editorial push and internal pressure didn't help. Our models factored in the shifting public sentiment.

**NATE SILVER**  
And yet, here we are. The models were right again, predicting the outcome with precision.

*They both nod, acknowledging the accuracy of their forecasts.*

Let's see how this unfolds as we move closer to November.
