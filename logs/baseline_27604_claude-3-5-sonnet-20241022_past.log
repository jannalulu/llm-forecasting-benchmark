2025-02-12 22:41:24,308 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Timeline: We're looking at confirmation before October 1, 2024 - about 5 weeks from now.

2. Context:
- Clade I mpox is historically found in Central Africa
- Mexico hasn't previously reported Clade I cases
- International travel could potentially introduce cases
- Mexico shares borders with the US and has significant international travel

3. Key considerations:
- Clade I is less common globally than Clade II
- Mexico has surveillance systems in place for mpox
- The short timeframe (5 weeks) reduces likelihood
- No recent reports of Clade I spreading in the Americas
- Testing capacity exists but may not specifically distinguish clades regularly

4. Risk factors:
- International travel connections
- Potential for undetected cases
- Existing public health infrastructure

5. Mitigating factors:
- Short timeframe
- Historical absence of Clade I in region
- Geographic distance from Clade I endemic areas

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 8.50%, with 3.50% being the most likely. Probability: 3.50%.
