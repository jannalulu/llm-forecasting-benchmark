**INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - SEPTEMBER 12, 2024**

Two SUPERFORECASTERS, LUCAS and MAYA, sit at a table, laptops open. They sip their coffee, eyes on the screens.

**LUCAS**  
So, the BLS finally dropped the August core CPI numbers. 

**MAYA**  
Yeah, I saw. Our models had it at 92.43% for a 0.2% increase. Spot on, as always.

**LUCAS**  
It's a relief to see inflation moderating, especially with all the recession chatter. 

**MAYA**  
Absolutely. The Fed's rate hikes seem to be working, but it's a tightrope walk. 

**LUCAS**  
True. If inflation had been stickier, we'd be looking at a different economic landscape.

**MAYA**  
Well, at least for now, the numbers align with a soft landing. Let's see how the markets react.

They clink their coffee cups, satisfied.

So, the core CPI for August 2024. Will it be 0.2%?

**MARK**  
(nods, checking his laptop)  
Our models had it at 95.67%.

**JANE**

Spot on. The Fed's rate hikes seem to be working, at least for now.

**LISA**

With recession fears looming, this stability is crucial. But we must remain vigilant.

**MARK**

True. But remember, inflation's a tricky beast. It could still surprise us.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, analyzing the latest data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The BLS released the August core CPI. It’s 0.2%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 98.75%. Given the Fed's recent rate hikes, the moderation made sense.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
The signs were there. Inflation was easing, aligning with economists’ expectations.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
But with recession concerns, the Fed's next move is crucial.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True, but hitting 0.2% suggests a positive trend towards the 2% target.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yet, if inflation persists, it complicates the Fed's strategy.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Agreed. Markets will be watching closely.

They nod, contemplating the economic implications.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
At least our models were spot on. The Brier scores remain untarnished.

They share a satisfied glance, knowing their predictions once again reflected reality.

The room buzzes with anticipation. SUPERFORECASTER EMMA, a seasoned analyst, stands by a digital board displaying economic data.

EMMA  
(looking at her notes)  
Alright, team. The BLS released the August core CPI data yesterday. Our question was, "Will the month-over-month percentage increase in core CPI inflation in the US in August 2024 be 0.2%?"

SUPERFORECASTER JAMES, a data wizard, leans forward.

JAMES  
Our models had it at 75.34%. Given the Fed's recent interest rate hikes and moderating inflation trends, this was our most likely scenario.

EMMA  
(nods)  
Indeed. The gradual return to the Fed’s 2% target seemed plausible, but persistent inflation remains a concern.

JAMES  
If it had been higher, it could have complicated the Fed's policy decisions amidst recession fears.

EMMA  
(smiling)  
For now, we can confirm our models were spot on. The data aligns perfectly.

The team shares a moment of satisfaction, their predictions validated once again.
