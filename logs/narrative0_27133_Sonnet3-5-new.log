Nate Silver: (looking at data screens) Well, Philip, our models were spot on again.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. With Biden's withdrawal and the subsequent chaos, our 12% probability for multiple debates proved accurate.

Silver: The variables were fascinating. Biden's poor performance in June, his withdrawal, and Trump's insistence on Fox News hosting... it all factored into our models.

Tetlock: Not to mention the Democratic Party's scramble to nominate a replacement. The timing made multiple debates practically impossible before October.

Silver: No, our models had it at 12% for good reason. The combination of a late nomination and Trump's media demands created too many obstacles.

Tetlock: The single September debate was all they could manage. Historical patterns suggested multiple debates were unlikely once the original candidate withdrew.

[Both nod knowingly as they review their predictive models]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. After Biden's withdrawal in July, the chances of multiple debates happening before October plummeted."

Philip: "Indeed. No, our models had it at 12.5%. The combination of Biden's exit, the dispute over networks, and the Democratic Party's scramble to nominate a replacement made multiple debates highly unlikely. The timing was just too tight."

Nate: "The single debate we saw between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee was intense, but scheduling another one before October 1st proved impossible. The party dynamics and network negotiations were major factors our models captured."

Philip: "Fascinating how our models identified the organizational chaos following Biden's withdrawal as the key variable. The probability dropped sharply after that July announcement."

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. With Biden's sudden withdrawal and the subsequent chaos, the probability of multiple debates was always going to be low.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Indeed. Our models had it at 12.5%. Once Biden dropped out in July, the Democratic party's scramble to nominate a replacement and Trump's insistence on Fox News as the only venue created too many obstacles.

Nate: The single debate we saw with Biden in June ended up being the only one. The timing was terrible – trying to organize another debate with a new nominee in such a short window before October 1st was practically impossible.

Philip: [checking his notes] The partisan disagreement over debate venues was the final nail in the coffin. Sometimes the simplest forecasts are the most accurate.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting.

Nate Silver: [adjusting his glasses] Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. After Biden dropped out in July, the chances of multiple debates plummeted.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 12.5%. The Democratic party's scramble to nominate a replacement candidate, combined with Trump's insistence on Fox News as the venue, made additional debates nearly impossible.

Nate: The single June debate with Biden didn't count since he withdrew. And despite the ABC News scheduling attempt for September 10th, Trump's ultimatum about the network choice created an impasse.

Philip: [checking his notes] The timing was crucial. With only six weeks between the Democratic convention and October 1st, coordinating multiple debates was logistically challenging. The party's late nomination left little room for negotiation.

Nate: Another prediction in the books. Shall we move on to the electoral college forecasts?

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Yes, our models had it at 12.5%. Once Biden withdrew, the Democratic party's scramble to nominate a replacement created too much uncertainty. The timing just wasn't there for multiple debates.

Nate: The single debate we saw between Trump and the eventual nominee was quite something, though. Remember how our models shifted when Trump insisted on Fox News as the only venue?

Philip: [chuckling] That demand alone dropped the probability by 15 points. The Democrats were never going to agree to multiple debates under those terms. The organizational chaos after Biden's withdrawal made a second debate practically impossible before October.

Nate: Another win for superforecasting. Sometimes the most obvious outcome isn't the most likely one.
