To make a prediction on whether any of the Waltons will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, let's evaluate the available data and evidence:

1. **Current Wealth Data**: As of the latest available data, Jim Walton is reported to have a net worth of $102.6 billion, and Rob Walton has $100.4 billion. Alice Walton is close with a net worth of $99.7 billion. 

2. **Market Trends and Stock Performance**: Walmart's stock has seen a significant increase of 53% this year, which has contributed greatly to the Walton family members' wealth. Jim and Rob Walton have surpassed the $100 billion mark, and Alice Walton is very close to it.

3. **Historical Patterns**: The Walton family has consistently been at the top among the wealthiest individuals globally due to their substantial shareholding in Walmart and the company's strong financial performance over the years.

4. **Current Momentum**: The indicators — significant stock growth and current high net worth figures — suggest momentum towards increasing net worth, especially with Walmart's stock still at historically high levels. Even with some share sales by Jim and Alice Walton, their current holdings and market conditions are supportive of maintaining or exceeding the $100 billion threshold.

5. **Uncertainties and Downturns**: While economic downturns or significant stock corrections could impact their net worth, such events are not strongly indicated by the available information. Additionally, the substantial gains this year would provide some buffer against moderate fluctuations.

The strongest evidence points towards the Waltons maintaining or exceeding $100 billion in net worth due to the current stock performance and their substantial holdings. The likelihood of at least one Walton being worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, is high. There is a very low probability of significant events that could drastically devalue their stock or affect their wealth within this timeframe.

Considering the data and analysis:

My Prediction: Between 97.00% and 99.90%, but 98.50% being the most likely. Probability: 98.50%.

To determine the probability that any of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, let's examine the situation with care.

**Current Net Worth Status**:

From the articles, especially those published closer to the forecast resolution date, Jim and Rob Walton have been reported to have surpassed the $100 billion mark. Specifically, Jim Walton had a net worth of $102.6 billion and Rob Walton $100.4 billion from various reputable sources such as Bloomberg, Forbes, and others.

- **Jim Walton**: Multiple sources explicitly state that he surpassed the $100 billion threshold with net worth figures exceeding $100 billion as of mid to late September 2024.
  
- **Rob Walton**: Like Jim, he has also been reported in mid to late September 2024 news as having exceeded $100 billion in net worth.

- **Alice Walton**: Reports indicate her net worth is consistently trailing narrowly below $100 billion, with figures hovering between $89 billion and close to $100 billion depending on the publication date and the exact report.

**Key Considerations**:

1. The most recent and reliable data (from mid to late September 2024) confirms that both Jim and Rob Walton have net worths exceeding $100 billion according to multiple sources including Forbes's real-time billionaire tracking.
   
2. The evidence doesn't suggest any significant financial disruptions or market changes that could have considerably devalued Walmart stock or other assets that would impact their net worth negatively between the last available reporting and the forecast resolution date of September 30, 2024.

3. The consistency of the reports with different sources echoing similar valuations for both Jim and Rob Walton increases confidence in the accuracy of these valuations.

**Probability Calibration**:

Given the overwhelming evidence suggesting that at least two of the Waltons are already over the $100 billion mark, particularly Jim and Rob Walton, the likelihood of the forecast resolving as "Yes" is very high. There is minimal uncertainty, given the proximity of the resolution date to the publication dates of these reports and the absence of counteracting financial events or trends that could suggest a decline.

Therefore, my prediction must reflect this high confidence.

My Prediction: Between 97.50% and 99.90%, but 99.00% being the most likely. Probability: 99.00%.

To analyze whether any of the Waltons will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, we start by examining the latest available data from September 2024.

1. **Base Rate and Historical Context**: Historically, individuals entering or maintaining a net worth above $100 billion is relatively rare and generally involves entrepreneurs with major holdings in highly successful companies. However, the Waltons have large stakes in Walmart, a vast and profitable global retail enterprise.

2. **Recent Trends**: 
   - Walmart's stock has seen substantial growth (~50% increase), which is a critical factor impacting the Waltons' net worth positively.
   - Jim Walton's net worth has been reported over $100 billion, with Rob Walton also surpassing the $100 billion threshold in the news articles from September 2024.
   - Alice Walton's latest valuations in various reports hover just below the threshold (~$99.7 billion to $96.9 billion), indicating proximity but slightly under the $100 billion mark.

3. **Current Economic Climate**: 
   - High volatility in the stock market and macroeconomic factors could shift valuations.
   - Continued stock performance and dividend payouts are giving consistent upwards pressure, though potential risks could stem from market corrections.

4. **Specific Resolution Criteria**:
   - Multiple reports confirm Jim Walton over $100 billion.
   - Rob Walton also reportedly surpassed $100 billion in the month leading up to the prediction end date.

5. **Balance and Judgment**:
   - The combination of the strong upward trend in Walmart's stock, increasing wealth of the Walton family members, and recent media corroborations strongly indicate that at least one (Jim Walton) meets the criteria for exceeding $100 billion.

Considering the outlined evidence and analysis, we adjust our probability upwards from the base rate based on confirmed recent data of net wealth.

My Prediction: Between 94.00% and 99.90%, but 97.95% being the most likely. Probability: 97.95%.

To evaluate the likelihood that any of the Waltons—namely Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family—are worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, we examine the latest available data and trends.

1. **Reference Classes and Previous Occurrences**: The Walton family has consistently been among the wealthiest in the world due to their substantial holdings in Walmart. Historical fluctuations in their net worth have been largely driven by changes in Walmart's stock price. Patterns show that major changes in stock value directly impact their wealth.

2. **Current Context**: As of mid-September 2024, both Jim and Rob Walton have already surpassed the $100 billion mark according to several sources, including the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Business Insider. Alice Walton is also very close, with values reported around $99.7 billion to $102.6 billion depending on the source. 

3. **Stock Market and Economic Trends**: The Walton siblings' wealth is heavily tied to Walmart stock, which has seen a significant increase this year, reportedly up by around 47% to 53%. If these levels have been maintained or progressed by September 30, the likelihood that their net worths exceed $100 billion remains high.

4. **Selling Shares**: There are reports of selling large quantities of shares by the Waltons; however, this has not significantly impacted their valuations to fall below the $100 billion mark around the mid-September period.

5. **Data from Different Sources**: There are multiple reports including Bloomberg, Forbes, and others, all suggesting a similar valuation of assets, reinforcing the confidence in the accuracy of these figures.

6. **Recent Trends and Market Movements**: Walmart's stocks have achieved substantial gains in 2024, which supports the forecast that the Walton family members have maintained or increased their wealth since the last reported figures.

After synthesizing all available information and accounting for potential fluctuations, an informed forecast can be made regarding the question.

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.90%, but 98.00% being the most likely. Probability: 98.00%.

To forecast whether any of the Waltons will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, we'll consider the following evidence and reasoning:

1. **Current Net Worth and Trends**:
   - As of the latest information, Jim Walton and Rob Walton have both surpassed the $100 billion mark with respective net worths of $102.6 billion and $100.4 billion. Alice Walton is very close, with a net worth reported around $99.7 billion. This is a strong indication that Jim and Rob Walton are already in the $100 billion range, and Alice Walton is on the verge.

2. **Market Influences**:
   - Walmart's stock has seen significant appreciation, approximately 50% this year. This upward trend has contributed substantially to the increase in the Walton heirs’ net worth.
   - While market fluctuations can occur, a drastic drop that would bring down Jim and Rob Walton's net worths below $100 billion appears unlikely given the current performance and trends of Walmart.

3. **Probabilities of Retaining Status**:
   - It is crucial to consider whether they will maintain or exceed this net worth by the specific date of September 30, 2024. Given the current cushion above $100 billion for Jim and Rob Walton, even in moderately adverse conditions, their wealth is likely to remain above the threshold. 

4. **Recent Activities**:
   - The sale of stocks by Alice Walton and Jim Walton earlier in September indicates routine financial management and potential tax strategies rather than indicators of a significant drop in net worth. 

5. **Resolution Criteria**:
   - The resolution hinges on whether any of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) are worth $100 billion or more as reported by Forbes on the specified date. This criterion is met if any one of them maintains their net worth at or above $100 billion.

Considering these points and balancing between overconfidence and prudence, while extrapolating current trends, the probability that at least one of the Waltons will meet the criteria is very high. The primary risk of forecasting error lies in unforeseen market movements or significant changes in asset valuation that might occur before the evaluation date.

To forecast whether any of the Waltons will be worth $100 billion or more on September 30, 2024, according to Forbes, we'll consider the following evidence and reasoning:

1. **Current Net Worth and Trends**:
   - As of the latest information, Jim Walton and Rob Walton have both surpassed the $100 billion mark with respective net worths of $102.6 billion and $100.4 billion. Alice Walton is very close, with a net worth reported around $99.7 billion. This is a strong indication that Jim and Rob Walton are already in the $100 billion range, and Alice Walton is on the verge.

2. **Market Influences**:
   - Walmart's stock has seen significant appreciation, approximately 50% this year. This upward trend has contributed substantially to the increase in the Walton heirs’ net worth.
   - While market fluctuations can occur, a drastic drop that would bring down Jim and Rob Walton's net worths below $100 billion appears unlikely given the current performance and trends of Walmart.

3. **Probabilities of Retaining Status**:
   - It is crucial to consider whether they will maintain or exceed this net worth by the specific date of September 30, 2024. Given the current cushion above $100 billion for Jim and Rob Walton, even in moderately adverse conditions, their wealth is likely to remain above the threshold. 

4. **Recent Activities**:
   - The sale of stocks by Alice Walton and Jim Walton earlier in September indicates routine financial management and potential tax strategies rather than indicators of a significant drop in net worth. 

5. **Resolution Criteria**:
   - The resolution hinges on whether any of the Waltons (Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family) are worth $100 billion or more as reported by Forbes on the specified date. This criterion is met if any one of them maintains their net worth at or above $100 billion.

Considering these points and balancing between overconfidence and prudence, while extrapolating current trends, the probability that at least one of the Waltons will meet the criteria is very high. The primary risk of forecasting error lies in unforeseen market movements or significant changes in asset valuation that might occur before the evaluation date.

My Prediction: Between 95.00% and 99.50%, but 98.00% being the most likely. Probability: 98.00%.
