**Democrat Yadira Caraveo faces tough re-election race in Colorado's 8th Congressional District**
Democrat Yadira Caraveo is facing a tough re-election race in Colorado's 8th Congressional District. She won her seat by just 1,600 votes in 2022 and now finds herself in another close election. Caraveo said, 'It's all going to be about getting out and speaking to the same communities, people who aren't always asked for their vote.' She has introduced or co-sponsored several bills addressing the cost of living, but most have not advanced due to the Republican-controlled House. Caraveo has also been criticized for a 2019 bill that lowered penalties for people caught with four grams or less of fentanyl. She said, 'The characterizations that Gabe Evans is making are not true. I have tried to balance what people need in terms of substance abuse treatment with penalties for drug distributors and cartels.' Caraveo supports securing the southern border and is firmly in line with her party on abortion rights, saying, 'Abortion care is health care, and health care decisions should be left to patients and doctors.'

**Yadira Caraveo, seeking reelection to Congress, navigates politics of abortion, immigration as some positions shift**
U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a freshman Democratic congresswoman, is seeking reelection in the 8th Congressional District. Caraveo, a pediatrician and former state lawmaker, has shifted some of her positions, including on immigration and energy extraction, to appeal to a broader audience in the tight race. Her opponents have launched negative ads highlighting her perceived failures on border security, crime, oil and gas jobs, and the fentanyl crisis. Caraveo has focused on issues like affordable housing, healthcare, and prescription drug costs, which she believes are crucial for her constituents. She has also spoken out about her own struggles with depression and has advocated for better mental health care. Caraveo's past positions on immigration have been criticized by some in her party, but she maintains that she is representing the concerns of her constituents, who are divided on the issue.

**Incumbent Yadira Caraveo and challenger Gabe Evans explain why they want to be Colorado's CD8 representative**
In the upcoming election, voters in Colorado's 8th Congressional District will choose between incumbent Democrat Yadira Caraveo and Republican challenger Gabe Evans. Evans, a former police officer and state representative, emphasizes the need to secure the border and cut regulations, including climate policies that he says drive manufacturing out of the country. He also supports scaling back the size and spending of departments like Education and would not repeal the Affordable Care Act but would cut bureaucracy. Evans believes in an all-of-the-above approach to energy and supports aid for Israel and Ukraine. Caraveo, a pediatrician and first Latina representative for CD8, prioritizes lowering the cost of living and has introduced a bill on affordable housing. She believes health care is a right but does not support Medicare for all and would cut bureaucracy in the health care system. Caraveo also supports abortion rights and taxpayer funding of abortion, and has sponsored bills to increase access to reproductive and behavioral health care.

**Yadira Caraveo Faces Tough Re-Election Bid in Colorado's 8th District**
Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician of Mexican descent, is facing a tough re-election bid in Colorado's 8th district, where 38% of residents are of Latin American origin. Caraveo, who was the first Latina to represent Colorado in Congress, says, 'It's essential that they feel they have a voice in Washington.' She is being challenged by Republican Gabe Evans, a former police officer and Army veteran, who also has Mexican roots. However, Caraveo believes her connection to the community and her ability to build relationships with them will help her win re-election. 'Having a representative who comes from their community, who is the daughter of immigrants like many Latinos in the district, who has a similar name and speaks their language is very important for them to feel they have a voice in Washington,' she says. Caraveo's seat is one of the 11 that Democrats could lose in the November elections, according to The Cook Political Report. To win back the House, Democrats need to focus on providing solutions to the needs of citizens, rather than extreme left or right policies, Caraveo believes. She says, 'The most important thing for them is not to be a Democrat or a Republican, but to be American and focus on what's necessary.' Caraveo, 43, is a centrist who has distanced herself from her party's line on issues like immigration and abortion. She believes that Latinos, who tend to be centrists, are a key group to focus on in the November elections, where a third of the Senate and all House seats will be up for grabs.

**Colorado Democrat Yadira Caraveo agrees to two debates, but GOP challenger Gabe Evans wants more**
Colorado Democrat Yadira Caraveo and her Republican challenger Gabe Evans have agreed to two debates in October, but Evans wants more. Evans says two half-hour debates are not enough to explore their disagreements in a race that could decide which party wins the House majority. Caraveo's campaign manager, Mary Alice Blackstock, said Caraveo is 'eager to speak about her bipartisan record delivering results for Coloradans' and is looking forward to the debates. Evans, however, said 'Voters deserve better' and that there are 'tremendous differences' between him and Caraveo on issues like crime, the border, jobs, and the cost of living. The two candidates are vying for the 8th Congressional District seat, which Caraveo won by just over 1,600 votes in 2022.

**Republican Gabe Evans hopes to unseat Democrat incumbent in Colorado's 8th Congressional District**
Gabe Evans, a Republican state lawmaker, is running for the 8th Congressional District in Colorado. He hopes to unseat incumbent Democrat Yadira Caraveo. Evans' top priority is securing the southern border, which he believes is essential for addressing other issues. He claims that a recent bipartisan border security bill would have allowed 5,000 asylees per day to enter the US, but this claim has been fact-checked as false. Evans also supports producing more American energy to lower costs, placing tariffs on China, and repealing the Affordable Care Act. He has a complex stance on same-sex marriage, having previously compared it to incest and bestiality, but now says he would have taken a bullet for gay and lesbian soldiers and cops. Evans is anti-abortion but supports exceptions for rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. He opposes a national abortion ban and would condition funding for Ukraine on audits to prevent corruption, but does not require such conditions for Israel.

**Undecided voters weigh options in a key Colorado district for the House race**
In Colorado's 8th Congressional District, incumbent Congresswoman Yadira Caraveo is facing a challenge from state Representative Gabe Evans. Many voters in the district are still undecided, despite being sure about their presidential picks. Democratic voters like Liz Cardenas and Gina Strain are unsure about Caraveo due to concerns about reproductive rights and immigration. Meanwhile, conservative group Libre Initiative Action is trying to mobilize Hispanic voters to back Evans, who touts his own Hispanic heritage. Voters like Luis Munoz, who is an immigrant from Mexico, are undecided and could ultimately be the deciding factor in this toss-up district.

**Campaign ads in Colorado's 8th District, its closest congressional race, stretch the truth. Here's a closer look at 4 spots.**
In Colorado's 8th Congressional District, campaign ads have been stretching the truth. The Denver Post analyzed four recent ads in the race between Democratic incumbent Yadira Caraveo and Republican challenger Gabe Evans. The ads made claims about Caraveo's voting record on fentanyl, immigration, and abortion, as well as Evans' positions on same-sex marriage and abortion. However, the Post found that many of these claims were misleading or taken out of context. Caraveo said, 'So when we saw that the level was wrong for fentanyl specifically, we went back in and we fixed it. That's what you do as a legislator -- you see how your bills exist in the real world, and you come back and you adjust.' Evans has also evolved his stance on same-sex marriage and has said he would make exceptions for abortion in cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk. The ads also made claims about Caraveo's positions on border security and immigration, but the Post found that she is just one of 535 votes in Congress and can't be blamed for everything going wrong at the U.S. southern border. Additionally, the Post found that Evans has expressed support for Trump and his MAGA movement, but has also said that Biden won the 2020 election and that there was interference in the run-up to the election related to attempts to suppress the story surrounding an abandoned laptop computer belonging to Hunter Biden.

**Caraveo and Evans Debate Key Issues in Colorado's 8th Congressional District**
In a recent debate, Democratic Congresswoman Yadira Caraveo and Republican State Representative Gabe Evans discussed key issues in Colorado's 8th congressional district. Evans, a veteran and former police officer, aims to unseat Caraveo, a pediatrician and the first Latina representative in Colorado. A recent Emerson College poll shows the two candidates in a statistical tie in the final stretch before the November 5 election. In the debate, Caraveo said she would not generally impose price controls on housing, food, and pharmaceuticals, but would consider it for medications. Evans said he would prefer a targeted approach to imposing tariffs on imports from countries like China, which do not compete fairly in the international market. He also expressed support for reducing bureaucracy and regulations to encourage companies to keep jobs in the US. On immigration, Evans advocated for securing the border and empowering law enforcement to deport those who commit crimes in the US, while also fixing the system for those who want to become citizens or work in the US economy. Caraveo proposed a balanced approach that ensures the border, creates a legal path to citizenship, and addresses the shortage of workers. She also criticized Trump for his failure to pass a viable solution earlier this year. When asked about her recent comments on supporting her constituents' immigration positions, Caraveo said she has difficult conversations with her constituents and takes their advice and opinions into account. She also clarified that she no longer supports defunding federal immigration authorities. On abortion, Evans said he would support exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, but opposes a national ban on abortion. Caraveo accused Evans of changing his position on abortion, citing his previous stance on prohibiting all abortions except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. However, Caraveo did not provide further details on her own position on the issue during the debate.

**Gabe Evans, a former police officer, seeks moderate path to Congress  --  while trying to sidestep Trump minefield**
Gabe Evans, a former police officer and state representative, is running for Congress in Colorado's 8th district. He is seeking to unseat Democratic incumbent Yadira Caraveo by running a moderate campaign, focusing on common-sense solutions to issues like crime and immigration. Evans has been criticized for his past positions on abortion and same-sex marriage, but he has since changed his stance. He has also been accused of being unclear on issues like election integrity and has refused to directly answer some debate questions. Evans' campaign has been compared to that of state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, who ran a similar campaign in her close 2022 race against Caraveo. Evans has successfully neutralized one potential obstacle by signing an amended 'liberty pledge' with his would-be Libertarian opponent, who dropped out and endorsed him. If Evans wins, Republicans will have a better shot at keeping their razor-thin majority in the U.S. House.

**Fact-checking political ads in Colorado's 8th congressional district race**
In the 8th Congressional District race in Colorado, both Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo and Republican challenger State Rep. Gabe Evans have been subject to misleading or false claims in political ads. The National Republican Congressional Committee accused Caraveo of contributing to Colorado's fentanyl crisis by voting to decrease penalties for fentanyl possession, but Caraveo had also voted to reverse the penalties in 2022 amid a surge in overdose deaths. Another ad claimed Caraveo is 'responsible for it all,' including drugs and crime flowing into Colorado communities, but this is greatly misleading as Congress has no involvement in police budgets. On the other side, attack ads by groups supporting Caraveo are missing important context, such as Evans' past views on same-sex marriage, which he has since evolved on. Evans wrote a letter in 2004 opposing same-sex marriage, but has since stated he supports repealing the state constitution's ban on same-sex marriage. Evans also clarified his position on abortion, stating he supports exceptions for rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. He would oppose a national abortion ban if elected to Congress.

**GOP challenger Evans makes false claims on climate, energy in 8th District debate with Caraveo**
In a recent debate, Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans made false claims about climate and energy issues in his challenge to incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo for Colorado's 8th Congressional District seat. Evans falsely stated that Senate Bill 19-181, which strengthened health and safety regulations on the oil and gas industry, was rejected by voters at the ballot box. However, the bill was passed in 2019, while Proposition 112, which would have enacted a stricter 2,500-foot setback between new oil and gas drilling sites and occupied buildings, was rejected by voters in 2018. Caraveo countered that SB-181 was meant to 'balance the needs of local municipalities' and allow them to make their own decisions about oil and gas production. Evans repeatedly tried to pivot to climate and energy issues, making misleading claims about Caraveo's voting record and the Inflation Reduction Act.

**Outside cash pours into Colorado's 8th Congressional District race**
The 8th Congressional District race in Colorado is one of the closest in the country, with millions of dollars being spent on the election. According to the Federal Election Commission, Democratic incumbent Rep. Yadira Caraveo's campaign has spent over $4 million, while Republican challenger Gabe Evans has spent over $1.2 million. However, super PACs have spent over $15 million on the race, with Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver, stating that 'it's generally easier for [super PACs] to both raise and spend money' due to fewer reporting requirements and limits. Masket also noted that super PACs 'are giving money to people because they trust them to vote a certain way on a range of issues.' Nationwide, super PACs have spent $5.8 billion on campaigns in the 2024 cycle, more than double the money raised by candidates themselves. The majority of the money raised by the candidates in Colorado came from outside the state, with 72% of Caraveo's campaign contributions and 63% of Evans's campaign contributions coming from out-of-state donors.

**Four House Democrats facing uphill battles in their districts**
Four House Democrats, Reps. Mary Peltola (AK), Yadira Caraveo (CO), Jared Golden (ME), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA), are facing uphill battles in their districts. Peltola, who flipped Alaska's at-large congressional seat in 2022, faces Nick Begich in a 'toss-up' race. Caraveo, who won a newly formed seat in Colorado in 2022, is facing Republican Gabe Evans in a tied race, according to a recent poll. Golden, who represents Maine's 2nd Congressional District, is facing Republican Austin Theriault in a 'toss-up' race. Perez, who won her seat in Washington's 3rd Congressional District in 2022, is facing a rematch against Republican Joe Kent in a 'toss-up' race. Democrats will need to net four seats to take control of the House, but these seats could see the incumbent lose and risk the Democrats' bid to win the majority.

**Grassroots, Super PAC Funding Shaping Colorado’s 2024 Congressional Races**
In Colorado's 2024 congressional races, grassroots and super PAC funding are shaping the contests. Democrat Trisha Calvarese, running against GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert in the 4th District, led all Colorado congressional candidates with nearly $2.7 million in contributions received in the third quarter. Calvarese's campaign has used Boebert's national profile to raise millions from small, grassroots donations. Meanwhile, in the 8th District, incumbent Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo faces a bruising reelection battle, but has benefited from nearly $9 million in super PAC spending from more than a dozen Democratic and left-leaning interest groups. Total super PAC spending in the 8th District has surpassed $15 million, with more likely on the way as polls show a toss-up race between Caraveo and GOP state Rep. Gabe Evans.

Bomar also warned, 'If it can happen to the NRCC's field office, it could happen to anyone in Caraveo's district.' The primary goal of the office was to defeat Caraveo and support Gabe Evans' campaign. The race is currently neck-and-neck between the two candidates.

**Yadira Caraveo, Trisha Calvarese and other Democrats hold big cash advantage in Colorado congressional races**
Colorado's Democratic candidates for Congress have raised more than $34 million this election cycle, triple the amount raised by Republicans. The eight Democratic nominees have a combined $11 million in cash on hand, while Republicans have less than $2.5 million. In the 8th District, Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo has a significant cash advantage over Republican challenger Gabe Evans, with over $2.3 million left to spend. Outside groups have spent nearly $9 million to support Caraveo or oppose Evans, with the super PAC FairShake being the biggest spender. In the 4th District, Democrat Trisha Calvarese has raised over $3 million to challenge Rep. Lauren Boebert, who switched districts after her close reelection win in 2022. Calvarese has a cash advantage over Boebert, with $1.3 million to nearly $550,000. Democrat Adam Frisch, who lost to Boebert by less than 600 votes in 2022, has raised nearly $17 million this cycle and has a significant cash advantage over his opponent, Republican nominee Jeff Hurd.

**High turnover of top staffers haunts Caraveo’s reelection chances**
U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo's office has one of the highest turnovers on Capitol Hill, with at least three top staffers quitting in just 20 months. Her communications director and press secretary quit this year, and two directors in the district have moved on. Caraveo declined to comment on the rankings, which place her 31st out of 437 members of Congress for top turnover this year. The high turnover rate raises questions about her management of her staff, with some Democrats criticizing The Colorado Sun for running the story during the election season. As one article from The Sun notes, 'The relatively high rate of turnover, paired with the reluctance of former staff members to publicly talk about their experience under Caraveo, raises questions about her management of her staff.'

**Yadira Caraveo has among the highest staff turnover rates in Congress**
U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo has one of the highest staff turnover rates in Congress, according to an analysis by LegiStorm, with a number of top aides leaving in less than two years. The top Caraveo staffers who have departed include Brian Sowyrda, Kaylin Dines, Jack O'Shea, Katie Wallace, Erika Cabrera, and Luci Kelemen. In a written statement, Caraveo's chief of staff, Joe Diver, said the congresswoman 'deeply values the hard work and dedication of our team members' but declined to comment on the high turnover rate. Congressional experts have told The Sun that the turnover in Caraveo's office is unusual for a first-term lawmaker. Caraveo is running for reelection in Colorado's highly competitive 8th Congressional District.

**Caraveo, Evans compete for seat in Colorado's battleground 8th Congressional District**
In Colorado's 8th Congressional District, a competitive race is underway between Democratic incumbent Yadira Caraveo and Republican challenger Gabe Evans. Evans, a state representative and Army veteran, won the Republican primary in June and was formally endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Caraveo, a pediatrician and former state lawmaker, ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. The district, which includes large population hubs like Thornton and Greeley, has a voter makeup of 25% registered Democrat, 22% Republican, and 49% unaffiliated, according to the Colorado Secretary of State's Office. Caraveo has faced criticism from some Colorado Democrats for voting with Republicans on a measure condemning the Biden administration's border security, despite previously calling for the defunding of ICE and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Chris Baum is also on the ballot under the Approval Voting Party, which aims to implement a system where voters can select one or more candidates on their ballot.

The Hispanic Leadership Trust (HLT), a PAC launched in 2022, is supporting GOP Reps. in their bid for re-election and growth in numbers. HLT has dispensed $1.3 million to House Republicans so far this cycle. Meanwhile, Bold PAC, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) campaign arm, has spent nearly $3.4 million in the general election, including $1.2 million to support Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) in his bid for the Arizona Senate seat. The two groups are going head-to-head in the tossup race between Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-Colo.) and Gabe Evans, a member of the Colorado state House. According to reporting by the Colorado Sun, Evans and Caraveo, who are both Hispanic, are in a dead heat. Gonzales, the leader of HLT, said, 'The HLT is a dozen current Hispanic members of Congress, and in many cases, you cannot grow an organization if you’re losing market share, right? So step one is always making sure that the members come back.' Bold PAC Chairwoman Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) said, 'We have seen more Latino candidates on the Republican side. I don’t know that the Republican Party really embraces Latino and Latina candidates, I think sometimes it just happens to be who runs in those seats.'

**Immigration dominates Caraveo-Evans debate in Colorado’s toss-up 8th District**
In a debate for Colorado's 8th Congressional District, incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo and Republican challenger Gabe Evans discussed immigration, abortion, and the cost of living. Caraveo emphasized her support for abortion rights and criticized Evans for his stance on the issue. Evans echoed Donald Trump's harsh rhetoric on crime and immigration, but avoided answering questions about Trump's racist comments. Caraveo has frequently voted with the Republican majority on issues like immigration and crime, but Evans has seized on a 2021 letter she signed calling for progressive immigration reform. Caraveo said her positions on immigration have changed due to a 'crisis that both parties have set up and not offered solutions for.' The battle for control of the House is expected to be close in 2024, with either party eking out a small majority through victories in a handful of toss-up districts like Colorado's 8th.

**Yadira Caraveo, Gabe Evans spar over immigration in first congressional debate**
In the first debate for the 8th Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo and Republican challenger Gabe Evans sparred over immigration, abortion, and Donald Trump. Evans, endorsed by Trump, focused on policy and did not directly condemn Trump's anti-immigrant statements, saying he had 'always condemned racist statements.' Evans also refused to answer directly whether corporal punishment is appropriate in schools. Caraveo, who has shifted her stance on immigration, said she would vote to represent her constituents, but did not commit to a specific approach. She accused Republicans of not being serious about immigration and said she would have supported the bipartisan border bill that Trump scuttled. Evans criticized Caraveo's support for a 2019 state law that bars local law enforcement from providing immigration status to federal authorities. On abortion, Evans said he did not support a national ban and supported exemptions, while Caraveo said she supported codifying Roe vs. Wade into law.

**Speaker of the House Mike Johnson says one Colorado Congressional race could help decide control of U.S. House**
U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson believes the Colorado's 8th Congressional District (CD8) race could decide control of the U.S. House. Johnson, who recently visited the district to support Republican candidate Gabe Evans, said, 'We're in a battle for the future of America, and this is indeed a top-five race.' A recent poll found the race is essentially tied, but Johnson thinks Evans has the lead. Evans is endorsed by former President Donald Trump and has a strong resume, which Johnson calls 'one of the highest quality candidates we've recruited.' Evans' campaign focuses on border security, while Democratic incumbent Yadira Caraveo emphasizes abortion rights. Johnson dismissed Caraveo's claim that Evans would implement a 'dangerous, far-right agenda,' saying, 'That's a red herring. What people want to know about is the economy crushing family-wide open southern border.' The candidates will debate policy on Oct. 18.

**Incumbent Yadira Caraveo and challenger Gabe Evans explain why they want to be Colorado's CD8 representative**
In the upcoming election, voters in Colorado's 8th Congressional District will choose between incumbent Democrat Yadira Caraveo and Republican challenger Gabe Evans. Evans, a former police officer and state representative, emphasizes the need to secure the border and cut regulations, including climate policies that he says drive manufacturing out of the country. He also supports scaling back the size and spending of departments like Education and would not repeal the Affordable Care Act but would cut bureaucracy. Evans believes in an all-of-the-above approach to energy and supports aid for Israel and Ukraine. Caraveo, a pediatrician and first Latina representative for CD8, prioritizes lowering the cost of living and has introduced a bill on affordable housing. She believes health care is a right but does not support Medicare for all and would cut bureaucracy in the health care system. Caraveo also supports abortion rights and taxpayer funding of abortion, and has sponsored bills to increase access to reproductive and behavioral health care.

**New poll shows how close Rep. Yadira Caraveo's race against Gabe Evans is, with plenty of undecided voters**
A new poll by Emerson College Polling has found that the race between Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo and Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans in the 8th Congressional District is tied, with 44% of likely voters supporting Caraveo and 44.2% supporting Evans. Nearly 12% of respondents were undecided. The poll also found that voters concerned about the economy and immigration tended to support Evans, while those concerned about housing affordability leaned heavily toward Caraveo. Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College Polling, said, 'Hispanics break for Caraveo, 42% to 33%, while white voters are split: 47% support Evans and 46% Caraveo.' Kyle Saunders, a political science professor at Colorado State University, noted that the high share of undecided voters, including those who list the economy, housing, and immigration as their top issues, 'could come down to 500, 1000 voters.'

**Democrats are attacking Gabe Evans on abortion and same-sex marriage. Here's what he says about those topics.**
Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans is being attacked by Democrats in the Colorado's 8th Congressional District election over his past views on abortion and same-sex marriage. Evans, who is running against Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, has since changed his views on these topics. On same-sex marriage, Evans wrote a letter in 2004 at the age of 17 opposing it, but now says he supports it and would vote 'yes' on a November ballot measure to strip a prohibition on same-sex marriage from the Colorado Constitution. He also supports the Respect for Marriage Act passed in 2022, which requires the federal government to recognize same-sex and interracial marriage. On abortion, Evans has been accused of wanting to ban it nationwide, but he says he only supports it in cases of rape or incest, or when a mother's life is at risk. He has consistently said he would not support a federal abortion ban, but has not said when in a pregnancy he thinks abortion should be outlawed. Evans' views are informed by his experiences raising a family, including his wife's eight miscarriages and their second child being born at 36 weeks after doctors spotted problems at 20 weeks of pregnancy. Caraveo, on the other hand, supports same-sex marriage and is a cosponsor of the Women's Health Protection Act, which would establish a federal statutory right to abortion access nationwide. She also voted for a bill that preserved unfettered abortion access in Colorado and is asking voters to make that change in the state constitution, too, making it harder to reverse.

**Yadira Caraveo Faces Tough Re-Election Bid in Colorado's 8th District**
Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician of Mexican descent, is facing a tough re-election bid in Colorado's 8th district, where 38% of residents are of Latin American origin. Caraveo, who was the first Latina to represent Colorado in Congress, says, 'It's essential that they feel they have a voice in Washington.' She is being challenged by Republican Gabe Evans, a former police officer and Army veteran, who also has Mexican roots. However, Caraveo believes her connection to the community and her ability to build relationships with them will help her win re-election. 'Having a representative who comes from their community, who is the daughter of immigrants like many Latinos in the district, who has a similar name and speaks their language is very important for them to feel they have a voice in Washington,' she says. Caraveo's seat is one of the 11 that Democrats could lose in the November elections, according to The Cook Political Report. To win back the House, Democrats need to focus on providing solutions to the needs of citizens, rather than extreme left or right policies, Caraveo believes. She says, 'The most important thing for them is not to be a Democrat or a Republican, but to be American and focus on what's necessary.' Caraveo, 43, is a centrist who has distanced herself from her party's line on issues like immigration and abortion. She believes that Latinos, who tend to be centrists, are a key group to focus on in the November elections, where a third of the Senate and all House seats will be up for grabs.

**Yadira Caraveo: A Latina Representative's Quest to Keep Her Seat in Colorado**
In the upcoming US elections, Democrats need to maintain a key seat in Colorado, held by Yadira Caraveo, a congresswoman of Mexican descent. Her district has a 38% Latino population, and she says, 'It's essential that they feel they have a voice in Washington.' Caraveo, a pediatrician and daughter of working-class Mexican immigrants, was the first Latina to represent Colorado in Congress in January 2023. She faces a challenge from Republican Gabe Evans, a former police officer and Army veteran, who also has Mexican roots. However, Caraveo believes her efforts to build relationships with the Latino community will help her retain her seat. 'Having a representative who comes from their community, who is the daughter of immigrants like many Latinos in the district, who shares their name and speaks their language, is very important for them to feel they have a voice in Washington,' she says. However, the Latino electorate seems to be shifting to the right, with Donald Trump reducing the difference in votes between him and the Democratic candidates from 38 points in 2016 to 8 points in the latest presidential election. Caraveo has distanced herself from her party's line, supporting a non-binding resolution condemning Kamala Harris's handling of the border. She won her seat by a narrow margin in 2022 and believes her constituents asked her to be a centrist. 'I'm going to tell the truth to Democrats and Republicans,' she says. Caraveo believes that to regain control of the House, her party needs to focus on providing solutions to citizens' needs, rather than extreme left or right ideologies. She thinks Colorado is a good example of what most voters in the US think: 'What's most important to them is not being a Democrat or Republican, but being American' and focusing on what's necessary. The Latino community has a crucial role in this strategy, as they tend to be centrist and focus on solutions because they are a hardworking community.'

Democratic incumbent Yadira Caraveo accused Republican challenger Gabe Evans of not sufficiently condemning antisemitic posts made by his political director, Jessica Spindle. Evans fired Spindle after learning about the posts and released a statement saying, 'Gabe fully rejects the offensive material contained in those social media posts. That's why he acted immediately upon learning of them.' CBS News Colorado political analysts Dick Wadhams and Mike Dino agreed that Evans handled the situation appropriately and quickly, and that it should be a non-issue at this point. Wadhams said, 'I think Gabe responded immediately. He fired her. He condemned it, and that's plenty.' Dino added, 'You kind of go by word of mouth. I've had to let people go because of that.' They also noted that campaigns may not have the resources to do deep background checks on staff, but may need to now that social media is a factor.

U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo criticized her Republican opponent, Gabe Evans, for not adequately renouncing antisemitic and violent social media posts made by his former political director, Jessica Spindle. Caraveo said, 'Hate and antisemitism have no place in our society. We must stand up to all forms of intolerance, wherever and whenever we see it.' Evans' campaign responded by criticizing Caraveo's vote against a bill providing $14.3 billion to Israel and her perceived lack of vocal criticism of college protests against Israel. However, Evans himself condemned Spindle's posts, saying, 'Gabe fully rejects the offensive material contained in those social media posts.' The 8th Congressional District is considered one of the closest House races in the country, with Evans and Caraveo competing for the seat in November's election.

**Truth Test: Political ads from Gabe Evans and Yadira Caraveo**
In the Colorado 8th Congressional District, Democratic Congresswoman Yadira Caraveo is running for reelection against Republican State Rep. Gabe Evans. Both candidates are running ads that focus on immigration. Evans' ad claims that Caraveo is responsible for the border crisis and that she has slashed police budgets, but these claims are 'BS' according to a Truth Test. Caraveo's ad features Democratic Adams County Sheriff Gene Claps, who says that Caraveo worked with Republicans to fund border patrol agents and crack down on cartels. However, the Truth Test found that while Caraveo did vote for a bill that funded Homeland Security and included funding for 2,000 additional border patrol agents, she also voted for a bill in 2019 that lowered the penalty for possession of fentanyl to a misdemeanor. Caraveo did vote for the HALT Fentanyl Act in 2023, which would classify fentanyl as a Schedule I substance, but the bill has not moved in the Senate since passing the House last year.

**Colorado Congressional Candidates Clash Over Border Security in New Ads**
In the 8th district of Colorado, the gloves are off in the congressional race. Representative Yadira Caraveo, the Democratic incumbent, and State Representative Gabe Evans, her Republican challenger, have both released TV ads focused on border security. Caraveo's ad features Adams County Sheriff Gene Claps, who praises Caraveo's record on border issues and accuses Evans of distorting the truth. Claps says, 'As a sheriff, I know how to recognize lies when I hear them. And Gabe Evans' attacks are simply not based on fact.' Caraveo's campaign manager, Mary Alice Blackstock, said in a statement that the ad is 'a necessary opportunity to counter Gabe Evans' lies and restore the truth' about Caraveo's bipartisan approach to addressing the 'failed immigration system.' Evans' ad, on the other hand, features local police and sheriff's deputies, including Republican State Representative Ryan Armagost, who claim that Caraveo is responsible for the influx of crime and drugs into their community. Evans says, 'Our border is a disaster, and we're paying the price: drugs and crime are flooding our community, and Yadira Caraveo is responsible for it all.' Evans has criticized Caraveo for what he calls her 'open borders and lax law enforcement' policy. Caraveo's campaign manager called Evans' ad 'a misleading attack meant to distract voters from Caraveo's bipartisan record.'

Political analysts on both sides of the aisle agree that this will be a close race, with millions of dollars expected to be spent on it. Democrats say the endorsement will not amount to much, while Republicans note the Libertarian garnered significant votes in the 2022 race for the district.

**How 8th Congressional District candidates plan to improve the economy**
The candidates for the 8th Congressional District seat, U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo and state Rep. Gabe Evans, are focusing on improving the economy, a top concern for voters in the district. Caraveo wants to reduce food costs by ensuring continued support for the SNAP program and codify rules to compensate farmers for dairy milk linked to the bird flu. Evans aims to cut red tape by reducing regulations that led to job losses, including a 2019 bill requiring 2,000-foot oil and gas drilling setbacks. Both candidates support building affordable housing, but differ in their approach, with Caraveo advocating for grant money and tax incentives, and Evans proposing to reduce local construction defects regulations and building codes. Caraveo expressed concern about rising home costs in Greeley, where the median sale price is $423,500, up 5.7% year-over-year.

**Gabe Evans' Abortion Stance Could Harm His Chances in Colorado Election**
Gabe Evans, a Republican candidate for Congress in Colorado, won the primary election in July with 77.5% of the vote. However, his opposition to abortion could harm his chances of winning the election in the 8th district, where nearly 30% of voters are Latinos who are mostly in favor of women's reproductive freedom. Evans, a former police officer and army captain with Mexican roots, has stated that he is against abortion, even in cases of incest or rape. He claims that the current abortion law in Colorado, HB22-1279, is too liberal and that most Americans, including Democrats and those who identify as pro-choice, believe that there should be restrictions on abortion. Evans' stance on abortion could lead to a backlash from voters, potentially benefiting his Democratic opponent, Yadira Caraveo. The issue of abortion has become a central theme in the election in the 8th Congressional District of Colorado, where it is a major concern for many voters, as stated by Evans, 'Nuestra desfasada legislatura izquierdista aquí en Colorado, no hace más que empujar más a la izquierda y aprobar estas políticas radicales que están fuera de contacto con la población' ('Our outdated left-wing legislature in Colorado only pushes further to the left and approves these radical policies that are out of touch with the population').
