**Africa: Mpox Outbreaks in Africa Constitute a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security**
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa on August 13, 2024, due to the worsening situation on the continent. Since 2022, 40,874 cases and 1,512 deaths have been reported across 15 African Union (AU) member states, with a 160% increase in cases and 19% increase in deaths in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths reported in 2024. The outbreak is driven by heterosexual transmission, especially among female sex workers, and raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The high risk of severe infection among people living with HIV, limited access to medical countermeasures, and low detection rates are also concerns. The Africa CDC Director General was advised by the 15-member Emergency Consultative Group (ECG) to declare a PHECS, which was redefined as a significant event posing a risk to other countries, requiring immediate continental-level action to prevent and mitigate disease spread. The ECG developed specific criteria to assess the situation objectively, including disease severity, transmission dynamics, and public health risk.

**Mpox Is ‘Not the New COVID,' WHO Official Says. Risk to U.S. Remains Low**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global public health emergency due to the growing mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding African countries. The new strain of the virus, clade 1b, is highly transmissible and has a higher fatality rate than the previous outbreak in 2022. However, the risk to the U.S. remains low, with no cases reported and the CDC maintaining a low risk assessment. WHO's European regional director Hans Kluge said, 'mpox is not the new COVID,' and that the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether are known. People considered at high risk for mpox infection should receive the Jynneos vaccine, which is effective against all clades of the mpox virus. The current outbreak is affecting a lot of children due to routine contact spreading the virus, and experts say it's unlikely to spread to the U.S. due to a lack of direct flights from the U.S. to the DRC and neighboring African countries.

**Europe's CDC releases mpox risk assessment after Swedish case detected**
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has released a risk assessment and updated guidance for mpox in Europe after a case of MPXV clade Ib was reported in Sweden. The ECDC stated that the likelihood of infection in the general population in the EU/EEA is very low, provided that imported cases are diagnosed promptly and control measures are implemented. However, the likelihood of infection for close contacts of possible or confirmed imported cases is assessed high. The ECDC also warned that the risk is high for EU/EEA citizens traveling to or living in nations most affected by mpox in Africa, especially if they have close contact with affected communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency and is committed to coordinating the global response to prevent transmission, treat those infected, and save lives.

**2023 Outbreak in DRC**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak is more widespread than any previous DRC outbreak and has spread to neighboring countries, including Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda. The WHO has assessed the risk to the general public in the United States as very low due to the limited number of travelers and no direct commercial flights from DRC or its neighboring countries to the US. People who have already had mpox or are fully vaccinated should be protected against the type of mpox spreading in DRC and neighboring countries. The best protection against mpox is two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine if eligible. CDC is working with Ministries of Health and in-country partners across the region on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, and risk communication and community engagement. The outbreak has been linked to contact with infected wild animals, household transmission, and patient care, as well as sexual contact among men who have sex with men and female sex workers and their contacts.

**Mpox Rapid Risk Assessment**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States. The overall risk to the general population is assessed as VERY LOW, with moderate confidence. The risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner and people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, is assessed as LOW to MODERATE. The CDC has moderate confidence in this assessment, citing uncertainties around epidemiologic and genomic data in DRC. The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States. The CDC will review available evidence every two weeks, or if the situation changes significantly, and update this assessment as warranted.

**WHO Responds to Mpox Concerns: 'Risk to General Population is Low'**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has responded to growing concerns that the recent outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, could become a pandemic like COVID-19. The WHO acknowledges that the new 'clado Ib' variant has a high transmission rate and could cause more severe diseases, but assures that there are effective measures to control its spread. Dr. Hans Kluge, regional director for Europe at the WHO, stated that the situation with mpox is not comparable to COVID-19, citing well-defined public health strategies and access to vaccines. 'The risk to the general population is low', Kluge said, adding that massive quarantines like those during the COVID-19 pandemic are not necessary. However, he emphasized the need for a coordinated global response. According to the WHO, 99,176 cases of mpox have been reported from January 2022 to August 2024, with 80.5% of cases concentrated in ten countries. The WHO recommends vaccinating only those at higher risk during specific outbreaks, rather than promoting mass vaccination. Tarik Jasarevic, WHO spokesperson, also stated that face masks are not necessary to control the outbreak. To combat the outbreak in Africa, the African CDC has agreed on a 'clear plan' to obtain 10 million doses of vaccines, with the Danish company Bavarian Nordic transferring its technology to Africa to allow local production of the vaccine. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria will begin vaccination next week.

**Cross border movement, poor response capacity drivers of Mpox spread**
The Africa CDC has declared Mpox a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS) in Africa due to the high risk of spread between neighboring countries and globally. The agency highlights cross-border movement, low public understanding of Mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacity as major challenges. The agency also notes that the vaccine shortage is a serious threat to containment efforts, and many African countries are highly vulnerable to Mpox infection due to widespread malnutrition and the prevalence of HIV. 'The high case fatality rate of over 3.9 per cent, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60 per cent of cases, further complicates the outbreak,' the agency said. The agency reported that heterosexual sexual activities, particularly among sex workers in Congo, are a major driver of Mpox transmission. Africa CDC Director General Dr Jean Kaseya appealed to the international community to provide support, saying 'Don't punish Africa. We need solidarity, we need you to provide appropriate support, this vaccine is expensive.' The agency is currently in talks with Bavarian Nordic to transfer technology to enable African manufacturers to produce the vaccine locally, with a goal of having 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.

**Africa Must Not Face Mpox Alone: A Call to Action**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of monkeypox (Mpox) a 'public health emergency of international concern' on August 14, 2024. This decision follows the African CDC's declaration of the Mpox epidemic as a 'public health emergency of continental security' the day before. The emergence of the Mpox virus in Africa is a harsh reminder of the vulnerability of our healthcare systems to emerging diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, dengue, and chikungunya. These 'orphan' diseases continue to affect millions of people on the continent, particularly in areas with limited access to basic infrastructure and medical resources. The Mpox epidemic, which has been ongoing since 2022, primarily in the DRC and more recently in several countries in the sub-region, highlights the significant gaps in public health surveillance and prevention in Africa, as well as the lack of rapid response to the threats faced by the continent. Currently, there are approximately 200,000 doses of vaccine available worldwide against this virus, a number far too low given the real needs. According to the WHO and the Africa CDC, a global strategy to combat this disease by strengthening capacities and empowering our healthcare systems must be our priority. The pandemic has shown that when political will and necessary resources are mobilized in time, it is possible to develop solutions quickly, on a large scale, and at a lower cost. Therefore, why wait for an epidemic to evolve and become uncontrollable before acting? We must take action now to contain the global threat that this disease represents. 'We can contain and even eradicate this disease if we act now,' said the author. 'We can also prepare our healthcare systems to face the health threats of tomorrow.'

**Cross-border movements, low awareness heighten mpox spread -Africa CDC**
The Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has declared mpox a public health emergency of continental security in Africa due to the high risk of mpox spreading to neighbouring countries and globally. The risk is attributed to cross-border movements, low public awareness, high vulnerability due to factors such as HIV and malnutrition, limited understanding of mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacities, including vaccine shortages. Since 2022, 40,874 cases and 1,512 deaths have been reported across 15 AU member states, with the Democratic Republic of Congo accounting for 96% of all cases and 97% of all deaths in 2024. The high prevalence among women raises concerns about vertical transmission risks and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The outbreak is further complicated by a high case fatality rate of over 3.9%, particularly among children younger than 15 years, who account for 60% of cases. According to the Africa CDC, 'The risk of mpox spreading to neighbouring countries and globally is high,' it noted. 'Cross-border movements, low public awareness, high vulnerability due to factors such as HIV and malnutrition, limited understanding of mpox transmission, and insufficient response capacities, including vaccine shortages, pose significant challenges to containment.'

**Risk Of Large Spread Of Mpox In India Unlikely As Of Now: DGHS**
Director General Health Services (DGHS) Dr Atul Goel has stated that the risk of a large spread of mpox in India is unlikely as of now. According to Dr Goel, 'There is no need to panic. So far India has not reported a case. The assessment by the Joint Monitoring Group...NCDC is that the risk of a large spread in India is unlikely as of now.' Dr Goel also mentioned that India has taken measures to prepare for the situation, including setting up designated institutions for isolation and management of cases. He also stated that the disease is self-limiting, with 97 to 98 per cent of cases subsiding and healing within 3 to 4 weeks. As of now, there have been 30 cases of mpox reported in India since the 2022 declaration of Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO, with the last case detected in March 2024.

**WHO Again Declares Mpox Global Emergency — What Americans Need to Know**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global emergency due to the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its spread to at least 13 other African countries, with possible cases in Europe and Asia. The WHO has recorded over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths in Africa by 2024, exceeding the figures for 2023. The Africa CDC has confirmed 2,863 cases and 517 deaths across the continent, but there are more than 17,000 suspected cases. 'This is only the tip of the iceberg, given the many weaknesses in surveillance, testing and contact tracing,' an Africa CDC news release said. The WHO's new announcement comes a week after the U.S. CDC issued a health advisory saying that while the risk of this more severe form of mpox in the U.S. remains low, clinicians should 'increase their suspicion for mpox' in patients who have recently traveled to affected areas. The current outbreak is driven by a variant called 'clade I,' which is more severe than the variant responsible for the 2022 pandemic. Health officials point out that there are shortages of the vaccine in Africa, where the disease remains endemic. An estimated 10 million doses of vaccine are needed to address the current outbreak in the region, but only the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria have initiated regulatory measures to access supplies. In the United States, most cases of mpox are generally not life-threatening, but certain people are at higher risk for severe illness, including those with severely weakened immune systems, those with a history of eczema, pregnant women, and infants under the age of 1. Americans should avoid close skin contact with people who have a rash similar to mpox or animals that may carry the virus, and take precautions to reduce their risk when socializing or engaging in sexual activity.

**Mpox Outbreak: First Case Detected in Sweden, Risk in France Considered Low**
Although no cases of Mpox have been reported in France, the country is expected to see several cases in the coming weeks. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on August 14, 2024, due to the emergence of a new variant of the virus, the clade 1b, which is more deadly and transmissible. A first case of Mpox has been detected in Sweden, which may indicate the appearance of other cases in Europe in the coming weeks. The situation is more alarming in Africa, with 18,737 suspected cases and 500 deaths since the beginning of the year. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been particularly affected. According to Santé publique France, 'the risk of infection by a Mpox virus of clade I for the European population is considered to be low by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at this time.' However, it is likely that cases will be reported in France, for which the health authorities will implement adapted measures for management. 'The authorities have a strategy for responding to an Mpox epidemic, in terms of surveillance, prevention, rapid diagnosis, care for cases and contacts, and vaccination. This response relies on a sensitization of the most at-risk populations, a reactive and preventive vaccination strategy for these populations, and rapid diagnostic means on the entire territory. This strategy is currently being re-evaluated in conjunction with health agencies to ensure it is fully effective against the clade I.'

**European Commissioner Emphasizes Need for Coordinated Approach to Prevent mpox Outbreaks**
The European Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, emphasized the need for a 'coordinated approach' at the European level to prevent potential outbreaks of mpox, following the EU's Health Security Committee's conclusion that the risk of mpox spreading across Europe is 'low'. The committee, which met on Monday, shared the latest information and next steps with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization, and the African CDC. The Commission is 'closely monitoring the situation and supporting a coordinated European response', according to the European Commission. The committee has advised against measures such as border controls or vaccinating the general population. While it is possible that new imported cases of mpox may appear in Europe, as has already been detected in Sweden, the risk of the disease spreading to the general population is considered 'low'. The risk is higher in populations with close contact with confirmed cases and in vulnerable individuals. The European Health Security Committee, composed of experts from the European Commission and member states, coordinates the EU's rapid response to serious cross-border health threats and is crucial for the exchange of information on specific measures adopted by each country. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has also stated that if action is taken quickly, there is no risk of continued contagion, and has called for effective surveillance, laboratory tests, epidemiological research, and the ability to track contacts, similar to the World Health Organization's recommendations. The ECDC's director, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, considers the risk of a significant mpox outbreak in Europe to be 'very low to low'. The European Health Emergency Response Authority has confirmed the donation of 215,000 doses of vaccine against this disease, as well as support for the African Union's health agency for diagnosis and sequencing of the virus. In Spain, no cases of this variant have been detected yet, although the Ministry of Health has not ruled out the possibility that it may already be present in the country. The recent positive cases have not changed in severity or symptoms since April 2022, when the outbreak with another variant, clade II, occurred in Europe.

**WHO Declares Global Emergency Over Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global emergency due to the Mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries. The decision was made after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Africa declared a public health emergency of international concern, citing a 160% increase in new cases in 2024. As of this month, 14,250 people have been infected with the virus, with 456 deaths reported in the region. The Democratic Republic of Congo accounted for 96.3% of cases and 97% of deaths. The increase in infections is attributed to a new variant of the virus that spreads quickly and is more severe and lethal, according to experts. The WHO estimates that it will need $15 million to respond to the emergency, with $1.5 million already mobilized through a contingency fund. 'This is not just an African issue. Mpox is a global threat, a threat that does not know borders, race, or creed. It is a virus that exploits our vulnerabilities, attacking our weakest points,' said Jean Kaseya, director-general of the CDC Africa. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has evaluated the risk of contamination as low, but the situation is being closely monitored. The Ministry has set up an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to coordinate response actions to the disease in the country. 'The detection and rapid spread of a new Mpox variant in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported Mpox, and the potential for greater spread within Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. The WHO has requested vaccine manufacturers to submit applications for emergency use authorization, which would accelerate access to vaccines, especially for low-income countries that have not yet issued their own regulatory approval. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has announced that it is negotiating the emergency purchase of 25,000 doses of vaccine and that some studies have shown that people vaccinated against smallpox in the past may have some protection against Mpox.

**High-level meeting to review preparedness for Mpox held in Delhi**
A high-level meeting was held in Delhi to review the preparedness for Mpox, a disease declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organisation. According to the meeting, there are no reported cases of Mpox in the country, and the risk of a large outbreak is low. However, the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary, P K Mishra, directed that surveillance be enhanced and effective measures be taken for prompt detection of cases. He also stressed the need for an awareness campaign among healthcare providers regarding the signs and symptoms of the disease. Currently, 32 labs are equipped for testing, and protocols for prevention and treatment of the disease should be disseminated on a large scale. As per the WHO, 99,176 cases and 208 deaths have been reported globally since 2022, with a significant increase in cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In India, 30 cases have been reported since the declaration of Public Health Emergency of International Concern, with the last case detected in March 2024. 'The risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is low, as per the current assessment,' said a statement. Mishra said, 'Protocols for prevention and treatment of the disease should be disseminated on a large scale, stressing that an awareness campaign among healthcare providers regarding the signs and symptoms of the disease and the need for timely notification to the surveillance system.'

**Could the new mpox threat cause significant harm in the U.S.?**
The World Health Organization has reinstated mpox as a public health emergency of international concern due to a large ongoing outbreak of clade I in the Democratic Republic of Congo. While experts are cautious about the potential spread of clade I in the U.S., they believe that several factors, including immunity from vaccination and previous infection, lack of viral circulation in wild animals, and better healthcare access, will mitigate the risk. Dr. Boghuma Titanji said, 'It was only a matter of time before we saw this extend beyond the African continent.' The CDC has confirmed no reported cases of clade I in the U.S. to date, but experts warn that the absolute risk is currently low and that vigilance is necessary. Dr. Jennifer McQuiston said, 'We are more worried about clade I than we are about clade II.' The CDC continues to urge men with multiple male partners to receive both Jynneos doses, and only an estimated 1 in 4 of those considered at significant risk of mpox in the U.S. have been fully vaccinated.

**Mpox: A Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox situation in the African continent a public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed the total recorded in 2023, with over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths. The WHO has been working to contain mpox outbreaks in Africa and warns that the situation is something that should concern everyone. The WHO's Emergency Committee was convened last week to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries. The African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Africa) had already declared the mpox situation in the region a public health emergency of continental security, citing the rapid transmission of the disease in Africa. 'The important thing is that the WHO has been working to contain mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern everyone,' said Jean Kaseya, Director-General of CDC Africa. 'The end of the emergency does not mean that the work is over. Mpox continues to present significant public health challenges that require a robust, proactive, and sustainable response.'

**Mpox News Today: Mpox surveillance and management measures being put in place, says Health Ministry**
The Union Health Ministry in India has stated that there are no reported cases of Mpox in the country, but measures are being put in place for surveillance and management out of caution. The Ministry said that the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is presently low for India, but the situation is being monitored. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Mpox infections are usually self-limiting and patients generally recover with supportive management. The transmission requires prolonged close contact with an infected case and is generally through the sexual route or direct contact with body/lesion fluid or contaminated clothing/linen of an infected person. The WHO has reported 99,176 cases and 208 deaths due to Mpox globally since 2022, and India has reported 30 cases since the 2022 declaration, with the last case being in March 2024. 'Although the possibility of a few imported cases being detected in the coming weeks is not entirely ruled out, it was assessed that the risk of a large outbreak with sustained transmission is presently low for India,' the Ministry said. 'This is the second time the WHO is declaring Mpox a public health emergency, the last time being July 2022. It was revoked in May 2023,' the Ministry added.

**Understanding the New Mpox Strain and Global Health Emergency**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has elevated its risk assessment level for the new mpox strain, warning that it is 'highly likely' that Europe will see new cases emerge. The strain, identified as clade I, is endemic to Central Africa and is notably more virulent and deadly than the clade II strain, which was responsible for the 2022 outbreak. According to the WHO, the majority of new mpox cases are concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths have been reported this year alone. The CDC has alerted healthcare providers to be vigilant for the new mpox strain, but has stated that the risk of the virus reaching the U.S. remains very low. The WHO's global health emergency declaration is expected to facilitate better access to mpox vaccines, and individuals who have previously contracted clade II mpox or who are fully vaccinated are expected to have protection against severe illness caused by the new mpox strain. However, there are concerns about vaccine availability, as health experts warn that there may not be enough doses to contain the current crisis.

**Global emergency declared over a new mpox outbreak. What to know in Florida**
The World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency for mpox, a rare disease similar to smallpox, due to a surge of cases in Africa. The declaration comes after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory, stating that doctors should have a 'heightened index of suspicion for mpox' in people who recently traveled to affected countries. According to the CDC, there have been over 1,000 reported cases of mpox in the US this year, with more than 100 cases in Florida. Kari Debbink, an associate teaching professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, 'The first thing that I would tell people is not to panic because at this point there have been no clade I cases in the United States... right now our risk is low.' However, experts warn that people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or eczema, are most at risk for severe mpox infection. The CDC recommends washing hands often, avoiding intimate contact, and getting vaccinated for those who were exposed to someone with mpox or are at high risk of exposure. There are two mpox vaccines available, Jynneos and ACAM2000, with Jynneos being the preferred option due to its lower risk of side effects and ability to be given to people with weakened immune systems.

**WHO Declares Global Health Emergency Due to New Mpox Variant**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The WHO has activated its highest alert level and has declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC). The organization sees a risk that Mpox could spread internationally again and become a health risk to several countries. The WHO followed the recommendation of independent Mpox experts who met in an emergency committee on WHO invitation, as stated by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva. The declaration of a health emergency does not have concrete consequences, but rather aims to alert authorities worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. A new virus variant, named Ib, has been discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo and could be more contagious and cause more severe disease courses than previous variants. Detailed studies on this are still pending. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' at the end of July. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), there are currently no known cases of the Ib variant in Germany. The WHO has changed the name of the virus from 'monkeypox' to 'Mpox' to avoid stigmatization. The vaccine against smallpox also protects against Mpox. The African CDC has reported more than 14,000 suspected cases and over 500 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries this year. The WHO expects less than 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide per month, but assumes that many cases are not detected due to a lack of testing capacity. In 2022, the WHO had already declared a global health emergency due to Mpox, but lifted it in May 2023 after the outbreaks were brought under control with vaccines in most countries. However, in Africa and other low-income countries, there are still issues with vaccine supply.

**Europe Faces Incoming Cases of New Mpox Strain: Agencies Call for Vigilance**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has warned that Europe should expect more imported cases of a new mpox strain in the coming weeks. Despite this, the risk of sustained transmission is considered low. ECDC director Pamela Rendi-Wagner stated, 'There will be more cases in the coming weeks. That's the expectation... But regarding the risk [for the] general European population, we have to say that our assessment is that the risk is very low at the moment.' Countries in Europe are urged to heighten preparedness and raise awareness to curb further spread. The ECDC advises prompt detection and containment of clade I cases using methods learned from the previous mpox outbreak in 2022. Rendi-Wagner recommended, 'Test, test, test, in order to find the suspect cases in Europe as soon as possible and avoid further spreading.'

**Europe's CDC releases mpox risk assessment after Swedish case detected**
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has released a risk assessment and updated guidance for mpox in Europe after a case of MPXV clade Ib was reported in Sweden. The ECDC stated that the likelihood of infection in the general population in the EU/EEA is very low, provided that imported cases are diagnosed promptly and control measures are implemented. However, the likelihood of infection for close contacts of possible or confirmed imported cases is assessed high. The ECDC also warned that the risk is high for EU/EEA citizens traveling to or living in nations most affected by mpox in Africa, especially if they have close contact with affected communities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox a global public health emergency and is committed to coordinating the global response to prevent transmission, treat those infected, and save lives.

**German health minister says mpox currently poses 'no great danger'**
German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach stated that mpox currently poses 'no great danger' to the population, citing the fact that the new strain has only been endemic in parts of central Africa. According to Lauterbach, the Swedish case of mpox does not change the risk assessment for Germany and Europe. Germany successfully contained the first outbreak of the first mpox variant in 2022 and has around 117,000 doses of mpox vaccine in stock, with some states still having mpox vaccines from 2022 in stock. Lauterbach emphasized that the situation is being closely monitored and the government is prepared to respond if the situation changes.

**Mpox Virus Outbreak: Europe's Public Health Agency Warns Of 'More Imported Cases' In Coming Weeks**
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has raised its risk assessment for sporadic cases of mpox clade I in Europe to 'moderate'. According to ECDC director Pamela Rendi-Wagner, 'There will be more cases in the coming weeks. That's the expectation... But regarding the risk [for the] general European population, we have to say that our assessment is that the risk is very low at the moment.' The statement comes as the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency due to the ongoing outbreak in parts of Africa. Data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that over 2,000 new mpox cases have been reported across Africa in the past week alone, with a total of 38,465 cases and 1,456 deaths reported since January 2022.

**WHO Warns of 'Probable' New Cases of Mpox in Europe**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that it is 'probable' that new cases of mpox, also known as 'monkeypox', will be reported in Europe in the coming days and weeks. The WHO declared mpox a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert, due to the resurgence of cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries. The WHO has reported that at least 548 people have died in the DRC since the beginning of the year, with a total of 38,465 cases reported in 16 African countries since January 2022. The Africa CDC has reported a 160% increase in cases in 2024 compared to the previous year. The risk of transmission is considered 'very low' by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The first case outside of Africa was reported in Sweden, where a person infected with the virus had traveled to a region in Africa where there is a large epidemic of mpox. The WHO has urged not to stigmatize 'travelers or countries or regions'. 'Only by working together, sharing data and adopting the necessary public health measures can we control the spread of this virus', added the WHO. The mpox virus is more contagious and deadly than previous strains, with a mortality rate of 3.6%. The WHO has requested that countries not stigmatize travelers or regions affected by the virus. The US Department of Health has announced that it will donate 50,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine to the DRC. The Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic is prepared to produce up to 10 million doses of its mpox vaccine by 2025.

**Mpox risk in Canada ‘remains low' despite global health emergency: PHAC**
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has stated that the risk of mpox in Canada 'remains low' despite the World Health Organization declaring a global public health emergency. PHAC is 'closely monitoring' the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighbouring countries. According to PHAC, the risk of Clade I mpox to Canadians 'remains low at this time', but Clade II mpox has been present in Canada since 2022 and has been reported in some regions, including a recent uptick in cases in the Toronto area. PHAC recommends that travellers to countries experiencing outbreaks take enhanced health precautions and be vigilant in situations that involve close interactions among people. Canada has secured a sufficient supply of mpox vaccines to support provincial and territorial programs, and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends a two-dose vaccination series for adults at high risk of exposure.

**2023 Outbreak in DRC**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The outbreak is more widespread than any previous DRC outbreak and has spread to neighboring countries, including Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda. The WHO has assessed the risk to the general public in the United States as very low due to the limited number of travelers and no direct commercial flights from DRC or its neighboring countries to the US. People who have already had mpox or are fully vaccinated should be protected against the type of mpox spreading in DRC and neighboring countries. The best protection against mpox is two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine if eligible. CDC is working with Ministries of Health and in-country partners across the region on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, and risk communication and community engagement. The outbreak has been linked to contact with infected wild animals, household transmission, and patient care, as well as sexual contact among men who have sex with men and female sex workers and their contacts.

**Mpox in Lower Saxony: Low Risk Assessed by State Health Office**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised its highest alert level due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa, but the Lower Saxony State Health Office (NLGA) assesses the risk for Lower Saxony as low. Since the increase in Mpox cases in Lower Saxony in May 2022, the number of cases has decreased significantly due to intensive public health efforts: there were 58 reported cases in 2022, 2 in 2023, and only one so far this year (as of August 14). The cases are related to the 2B clade, as reported by the authority. The new virus variant of the I clade, which is associated with the outbreak in Africa, has not been detected in Germany so far. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) currently assesses the risk to public health in Germany as low, and the NLGA agrees with this assessment. NLGA President Fabian Feil stated, 'The NLGA does not currently assess the risk for Lower Saxony as increased.' In cooperation with the health authorities and the RKI, the situation will be closely monitored. While a limited outbreak is still possible, a significant increase in cases like in 2022 is not expected, according to the RKI. As a precaution, unvaccinated individuals with high infection risks, such as adult men who engage in same-sex relationships and frequently change partners, as well as laboratory staff working with infectious laboratory samples, are advised to get vaccinated. Early detection of infections is crucial to prevent transmission. Healthcare professionals should include Mpox in the diagnosis for individuals with unclear pock-like skin changes, especially if they have recently returned from Central Africa. The virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and causes skin rash, fever, and can be fatal, especially for children. The smallpox vaccine also provides protection against Mpox infection.

**Low Risk of Mpox in Niedersachsen, According to State Health Agency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has activated its highest alert level due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa, but the Niedersachsen state health agency assesses the risk for the region as low. Since the increase in Mpox cases in Niedersachsen in May 2022, the number of cases has decreased significantly due to intense public health efforts: in 2022, there were 58 reported cases, in 2023, 2, and so far this year, only 1 (as of August 14). The cases are related to the 2B clade, as reported by the agency. The new virus variant of the I clade, associated with the outbreak in Africa, has not been detected in Germany so far. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) currently assesses the risk to public health in Germany as low, and the Niedersachsen state health agency (NLGA) agrees with this assessment. 'The NLGA does not currently consider an increased risk for Niedersachsen,' said NLGA President Fabian Feil. In cooperation with the health authorities and the RKI, the situation will be closely monitored. While a limited outbreak is still possible, a significant increase in cases like in 2022 is not expected, according to the RKI.

The smallpox vaccine also provides protection against Mpox infection. Mpox was previously known as monkeypox because it was first detected in animals, but the WHO has renamed it to prevent stigmatization.

**WHO Declares Mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) as a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, made the declaration after a committee of experts recommended it. 'Today the committee met and informed me that, in their opinion, the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. I accepted that recommendation,' Tedros Adhanom said. 'It is a situation that should concern us all,' he added during a press conference. The current outbreak, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and limited to Africa so far, has its own characteristics, including a more contagious and deadly virus caused by the clade 1 and a more dangerous variant, the clade 1b, with a mortality rate estimated at 3.6%. 'We are facing various epidemics with different clades in different countries, with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk,' warned Tedros. The African CDC has also declared a 'public health emergency' in response to the growing mpox epidemic on the continent, with 38,645 cases reported in 16 African countries since January 2022, and 1,456 deaths. The agency warns that the number of cases is largely underestimated due to reduced testing capacity and tracing of transmission chains. Additionally, vaccines are in short supply, with 200,000 doses planned for distribution, but 10 million are needed to contain the epidemic. The agency has appealed to all international partners to demonstrate solidarity to achieve the goal. Two specific vaccines are recommended for high-risk individuals, including homosexuals and sex workers, but few doses are available in affected countries. 'Two hundred thousand doses are not enough. We need more than 10 million doses. I can say that we have a clear plan today to ensure the delivery of these 10 million doses, starting with 2-3 million by the end of 2024. We will ensure that the vaccines reach all countries, all communities, all people who need them,' said Jean Kaseya, director-general of the African CDC.

**US Responds to Mpox Outbreak**
The US government has outlined its response to the mpox outbreak in multiple African countries, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. The US has provided $17 million to support mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa, and plans to donate 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The risk to the general public in the US is considered very low, but the US Department of Health and Human Services is encouraging those at high risk to get vaccinated with the Jynneos mpox vaccine. According to the CDC, the vaccine is recommended for individuals who have had known or suspected exposure to someone with mpox, or who are at high risk due to their sexual behavior. 'The situation is concerning because of the spread of the clade 1b virus, which is considered to cause more severe disease, and because there are many children being infected in DRC during this new outbreak,' said Brian Ferguson, an associate professor of immunology at the University of Cambridge. 'A coordinated international response is needed' to stop this outbreak and save lives, added Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general.

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency of International Concern for Mpox Outbreak in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for the mpox outbreak in Africa. The decision was made by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who stated that 'the detection and rapid spread of a new clade in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported it, and its potential for spread in Africa and beyond' justified the declaration. The new clade, called '1b', has been identified in several countries, including the Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, where over 90 cases have been reported in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, over 17,000 cases have been reported in more than 13 countries, with 517 deaths, mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The WHO has activated its highest level of alert, which will allow it to coordinate a global response to the outbreak, including the distribution of vaccines and treatments. The Africa CDC has also activated its highest level of alert, 'the Public Health Emergency of the Continent', and has received a commitment from the European Commission to provide 175,420 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine. The WHO has also deployed $1.45 million from its emergency fund to combat the outbreak, and is seeking an additional $15 million. 'We are not dealing with a single epidemic, but with several epidemics of different clades in different countries with different modes of transmission and different levels of risk,' said Dr. Tedros. The outbreak is particularly concerning due to the high transmission rate of the new clade, which is spreading rapidly through sexual contact. 'We must work so that these declarations of emergency really change things this time, because last time, African countries did not receive vaccines or medicines,' said Jean Kesaya, director general of Africa CDC, referring to the PHEIC declared in July 2022 to May 2023, when the outbreak spread for the first time outside of Africa, causing over 140 deaths among approximately 90,000 cases worldwide. 'It's a situation that should concern us all,' added Dr. Tedros, emphasizing that 'the WHO is committed to coordinating the global response, working closely with each affected country and leveraging its presence on the ground to prevent transmission, treat infected people, and save lives.'

**Canada's Response to the World Health Organization's Declaration on mpox**
The Canadian government has responded to the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) due to the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African countries. The WHO has stated that the increase in cases of mpox in the DRC, the growing number of countries in Africa affected, and the emergence of a new strain of the clade I of mpox constitute a PHEIC. The Canadian government has not reported any cases of clade I mpox, but is monitoring the situation closely and collaborating with its national and international partners to determine the possibilities of support. A mpox outbreak of clade II has been ongoing in Canada since 2022, with some regions continuing to report cases, including a recent surge in Toronto. The current observations suggest that clade II is less severe than clade I. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is monitoring the mpox virus through wastewater surveillance in Canada since July 2022 and has the capacity to test for clade I and clade II. Cases of mpox detected in provinces and territories must be reported to PHAC. The PHAC is collaborating with Global Affairs Canada and its partners to update risk assessments, public health guidance, and travel health advice, as needed. Since April 2024, a travel health advisory level 2 has been in effect for the DRC, recommending that travelers take enhanced health precautions. It is strongly encouraged that travelers protect themselves and their entourage against the mpox virus if they travel to affected countries. Additionally, the Canadian government has ensured a sufficient supply of mpox vaccines to support provincial and territorial prevention and control programs in Canada. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) updated its guidelines in May 2024, recommending a series of two doses of vaccine against smallpox for adults at high risk of exposure. Currently, mass vaccination is not recommended. The Canada is a strong supporter of the Global Fund, to which it has contributed $11 million since 2018, including $2 million in 2024. The WHO has allocated funds from the Global Fund in response to the ongoing mpox outbreak in the DRC and other African countries. Canada is exploring other ways to support the global response in close collaboration with the WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

**WHO Declares Mpox Situation in Africa a Global Public Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox situation in Africa as a global public health emergency of international concern due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the WHO. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed the total recorded in 2023, totaling over 14,000, with 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all. Last week, I convened the emergency committee to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in other countries in Africa. Today, the committee met and informed that, in their view, the situation constitutes a global public health emergency of international concern,' declared the Director-General during a press conference in Geneva. 'The rapid transmission of the disease in Africa is a concern,' Tedros said, recalling that the African CDC had already declared the mpox situation in the region as a public health emergency of continental security. 'I accepted the committee's recommendation. The detection and rapid dissemination of a new variant of mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination across Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that an international response in a coordinated manner is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency of international concern is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded. This is the first time the WHO has declared an emergency for mpox.

**WHO Declares Second International Health Emergency Over Spread of Monkeypox**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the spread of a new and more lethal variant of monkeypox (mpox) in Africa. This is the second time the WHO has activated this alert level for this disease, and the eighth time in history. The African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared the alert on the continent after registering 15,000 cases and 461 deaths due to the virus so far in 2024. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus, 'we are not facing a single outbreak with a single clade, but many, with different variants, different modes of transmission, and different levels of risk.' The new variant appears to be more easily transmissible and has already spread to other countries such as Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda. According to Madhu Pai, a member of the McGill School of Global Health in Canada, 10 million vaccine doses would be needed in Africa, when only about 200,000 are available. The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk posed by the new variant in Europe as 'very low,' but is preparing a further risk assessment which it will publish in the coming days.

**WHO Declares Public Health Emergency Over New Mpox Variant**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC) due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The WHO has activated its highest alert level, citing the risk of the Mpox virus spreading internationally again after 2022 and posing a health risk to several countries. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the decision was made after independent Mpox experts, who met in an emergency committee, recommended it. The WHO is not taking any concrete actions, but rather wants to alert authorities worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. A new virus variant, named Ib, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2023. It may be more contagious and cause more severe illness than previous variants. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' by the end of July. There are currently no known cases of the Klade I in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The Mpox virus is related to the classical smallpox virus and can cause skin rash, fever, and in severe cases, death, especially in children. The vaccine against smallpox also protects against Mpox. The African CDC has reported over 14,000 suspected cases and over 500 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries this year. The WHO expects less than 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide per month, but notes that many cases may go undetected due to lack of testing capacity. The WHO had previously declared a PHEIC for Mpox in July 2022, but lifted it in May 2023 after outbreaks were brought under control with vaccines in most countries. However, in Africa and other low-income countries, vaccine supply remains a challenge.

**WHO Activates Highest Alert Level for Mpox Due to New Variant**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has activated its highest alert level due to a new variant of the Mpox virus in Africa, declaring a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' (PHEIC). The WHO is concerned about the risk of the Mpox virus spreading internationally again after 2022 and becoming a health risk for several countries. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the decision was made after independent Mpox experts advised the WHO on the matter. The declaration does not have any immediate consequences, but rather serves as a warning to governments worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. A new virus variant, named Ib, was discovered in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2023. It may be more contagious and cause more severe illness than previous variants. However, detailed studies on the new variant are still pending. Mpox cases of the Klade I have also been detected in Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Kenya in recent weeks. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' in late July. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), there are currently no known cases of Klade I in Germany. The WHO has renamed the virus from 'monkeypox' to 'Mpox' to prevent discrimination. The vaccine against classical smallpox also protects against Mpox. The African CDC has reported over 14,000 suspected cases and more than 500 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries this year. The WHO expects that many more cases have gone undetected due to a lack of testing capacity. In 2022, the WHO had already declared a PHEIC for Mpox, but it was lifted in May 2023 after outbreaks were brought under control with vaccines in most countries. However, vaccine distribution remains a challenge in Africa and other low-income countries.

**WHO Declares Mpox Situation in Africa a Global Public Health Emergency**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox situation in Africa a global public health emergency due to the risk of global dissemination and a potential new pandemic. This is the highest level of alert from the organization. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outbreaks of mpox have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade and infections have increased over the years. In 2024, cases have already surpassed those in 2023, totaling over 14,000, with 524 deaths. 'The WHO has been working to contain mpox outbreaks in Africa and alerting that the situation is something that should concern us all. Last week, I convened the emergency committee to assess the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in Africa. Today, the committee met and informed that, in their view, the situation constitutes a global public health emergency,' said Tedros. He recalled that the African CDC had already declared the mpox situation in the region a public health emergency of continental security. The announcement was made yesterday by the director-general of the entity, Jean Kaseya, citing the rapid transmission of the disease in Africa. 'I accepted the committee's recommendation. The detection and rapid dissemination of a new mpox variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the detection of the same variant in neighboring countries that had not previously reported cases of the disease and the potential for dissemination throughout Africa and beyond are very concerning,' said Tedros. 'It is clear that a coordinated international response is essential to interrupt these outbreaks and save lives. A global public health emergency is the highest level of alarm in public health legislation,' concluded. This is the first time the WHO has declared an emergency for mpox. In May 2023, the organization declared that mpox was no longer a global public health emergency. In July 2022, the WHO had declared a status of emergency due to the outbreak of the disease in several countries. 'Just as with COVID-19, the end of the emergency does not mean that the work is over. Mpox continues to present significant public health challenges that require a robust, proactive, and sustainable response,' declared Tedros at the time. 'Cases related to travel, recorded in all regions, demonstrate the ongoing threat. There is a risk, in particular, for people living with untreated HIV infection. It remains important for countries to maintain their testing capacity and efforts, assess risks, quantify response needs, and act promptly when necessary,' warned Tedros in 2023. Mpox is a viral zoonotic disease. Transmission to humans can occur through contact with infected wild animals, infected people, and contaminated materials. Symptoms typically include skin eruptions or skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes (inguinal), fever, body aches, headache, chills, and weakness. Lesions can be flat or slightly raised, filled with clear or yellowish liquid, and may form crusts that dry and fall off. The number of lesions can vary from a few to thousands. Eruptions tend to concentrate on the face, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet, but can occur anywhere on the body, including the mouth, eyes, genital organs, and anus.

**One Health Investigation into Mpox and Pets, United States**
A One Health investigation was conducted in the United States to assess the susceptibility of companion animals to mpox and the risk for reverse-zoonotic transmission within households. The study collected animal and environmental swab samples from 21 households with confirmed human mpox case-patients. The results showed that 12% of animal swab samples and 25% of environmental swab samples were positive for mpox DNA, but no viable mpox virus or orthopoxvirus antibodies were detected. The study found a statistically significant correlation between mpox DNA and human DNA in swab samples, suggesting likely DNA contamination from the human mpox cases. The study did not detect any indications that companion animals were infected with mpox. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides guidance that persons with mpox stop or avoid contact with animals and that animals should be kept away from potentially infectious lesion material, objects, or surfaces. As of July 2024, no cases of mpox infection or mpox disease had been confirmed in common domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, during the current global outbreak or any past outbreaks. The study suggests that companion animals are not likely to be infected with mpox, but rather are at risk of exposure due to close contact with infected humans. 'It is essential to take proper infection control measures to prevent the spread of infectious particles throughout the home,' said Dr. Elin. 'This includes keeping animals away from potentially infectious lesion material, objects, or surfaces.'

**WHO Extends Recommendations for Combating Mpox in Africa**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has extended its recommendations for combating mpox in Africa for another year. The decision was made by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who stated, 'When I declared the end of the previous emergency for mpox last year, I issued recommendations based on international health regulations, which would expire next week. I decided to extend these recommendations for another year to support countries in responding to the chronic risk imposed by mpox.' The WHO has reported that cases of the disease have been registered in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a decade, with the number of new infections increasing consistently over the years. In 2024, the number of cases reported has exceeded 14,000, with 524 deaths. The emergence of the 1b variant in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which appears to be spreading mainly through sexual contact, and the detection of cases in neighboring countries is a major concern. The WHO has also reported that, in July, around 90 cases of infection with the 1b variant were reported in countries neighboring the Democratic Republic of Congo that had never previously reported cases of mpox: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Tedros concluded, 'We are not dealing with just one outbreak of a single variant – we are dealing with multiple outbreaks of distinct variants in different countries that report different forms of transmission of the virus and different levels of risk for the disease.' The African CDC has declared the mpox situation in the region as a public health emergency of continental security. The WHO has also published a document requesting vaccine manufacturers to submit applications for emergency use authorization for their mpox vaccines. The process aims to accelerate access to vaccines, particularly for low-income countries that have not yet issued their own regulatory approval.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Discuss Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an emergency committee in Geneva to discuss the recent outbreak of a concerning variant of the Mpox virus in Africa. The committee, composed of independent experts, will determine if the risk of a larger outbreak exists and if the WHO should declare a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC). This is the highest level of alert for the WHO, but it does not trigger specific measures. Instead, it serves as a warning for governments worldwide to prepare for possible outbreaks. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has assessed the risk of the new variant spreading in Europe as 'very low' in late July. The African CDC has already declared the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries a public health emergency for the continent, which could lead to increased funding to support the affected countries in containing the outbreak. The WHO has changed the name of the disease from 'monkeypox' to simply 'Mpox' to avoid naming diseases after animals, regions, or countries. Since the end of 2023, numerous cases of a new subline of the Mpox virus, Klade I (Roman numeral one), have been discovered in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. This variant may spread more easily and cause more severe disease outcomes, according to local observations. Studies are still ongoing. Mpox is characterized by a skin rash and fever, which can be life-threatening for young children. The disease has already spread to countries that had no previous cases, including Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda. 'The risk exists that the disease could reach distant countries,' said WHO Mpox expert Rosamund Lewis. The committee will meet virtually until 5 PM and a decision may be published shortly after.

**Mpox Rapid Risk Assessment**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has assessed the risk of the clade I mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the United States. The overall risk to the general population is assessed as VERY LOW, with moderate confidence. The risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner and people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, is assessed as LOW to MODERATE. The CDC has moderate confidence in this assessment, citing uncertainties around epidemiologic and genomic data in DRC. The assessment relies on subject-matter experts evaluating a range of evidence related to risk, including limited epidemiologic data from the DRC outbreak, historical data on clade I mpox epidemiology and clinical severity, and extrapolations based on the ongoing clade IIb mpox outbreak in the United States. The CDC will review available evidence every two weeks, or if the situation changes significantly, and update this assessment as warranted.

**Modeling Household Transmission of Clade I Mpox in the United States**
A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) simulated the potential spread of clade I mpox in the United States, focusing on household and non-sexual close-contact transmission. The results indicate that close-contact transmission within and between households is unlikely to result in a large number of mpox clade I cases, with household transmission clusters typically involving 10 or fewer cases and minimal spread between households. The study also found that clade I mpox outbreaks involving children would likely be self-limiting in the United States. While the study did not consider other routes of transmission, a separate CDC modeling study found that increases in immunity decrease the chance of prolonged transmission among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). The CDC will continue to evaluate available data and assess the risk posed to the United States by clade I mpox. 'Although modeling indicates household transmission is unlikely to result in a large number of mpox clade I cases, we will continue to evaluate available data and assess the risk posed to the United States by clade I mpox,' said the CDC. 'We will continue to work to protect communities and prevent the spread of mpox.'

**Brazilian Ministry of Health Convenes Meeting on Mpox Disease**
The Brazilian Ministry of Health has convened a meeting on Tuesday (13/8) to discuss the mpox disease, amid an increase in cases and the circulation of a new variant of the virus in Africa. According to the ministry, the meeting aims to update the recommendations and contingency plan for the disease in the country. 'A meeting with experts will be held on Tuesday to update the surveillance and medical assistance services', the ministry stated. The ministry also monitors the situation of mpox worldwide, following information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and institutions such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 'The risk assessment is that the event presents a low risk at this moment for Brazil', the ministry highlighted. Data from the ministry show that, in 2024, 709 cases of mpox have been reported in Brazil and 16 deaths, with the most recent death in April last year. Regarding vaccines against mpox, the ministry recalled that, in 2023, immunization against the disease was carried out in a public health emergency of international importance, with the use of doses authorized by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) on a provisional basis. 'If new evidence demonstrates the need for changes in the planning, the necessary actions will be taken and published in due time', the ministry concluded. The WHO has announced the convocation of an emergency committee to evaluate the scenario of the outbreak of the disease in Africa and the risk of international dissemination of the virus. The committee was convened due to the registration of cases of mpox outside the Democratic Republic of Congo, where infections have been increasing for over two years. The WHO has published an official document requesting vaccine manufacturers to submit requests for analysis for the emergency use of doses. The process was developed specifically to accelerate the availability of unlicensed supplies, but necessary in emergency public health situations. 'This is a recommendation with limited validity, based on a risk-benefit approach', the organization highlighted. The WHO also emphasized that the mpox disease requires supportive treatment to control symptoms as effectively as possible and prevent further complications. Most patients treated recover within a month, but the disease can be fatal if not treated. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the mortality rate of the existing strain is much higher than in West Africa, more than 479 people have died since the beginning of the year. The WHO has declared that the mpox disease no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international importance, similar to COVID-19. However, the organization emphasized that the end of the emergency does not mean that the work is over. The mpox disease continues to present significant public health challenges that require a robust, proactive, and sustainable response. 'Cases related to travel, registered in all regions, demonstrate the ongoing threat. There is a risk, in particular, for people living with untreated HIV infection. It is still important that countries maintain their testing capacity and efforts, assess risks, quantify needs for response, and act promptly when necessary', Tedros warned in 2023.

**The threat of mpox has returned, but public knowledge about it has declined**
Two years after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over an mpox outbreak, a deadlier version of the disease has spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to other African nations, and a resurgence of the original strain has been reported in the United States. Despite the renewed threat, public knowledge about mpox has declined significantly, according to a new survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center. The survey found that while 76% of respondents said they were 'very likely' or 'somewhat likely' to get an mpox vaccine if exposed in 2022, only 68% reported the same intention in 2024. However, 70% of respondents still believed that the benefits of vaccination against mpox outweighed the risks. The CDC has urged individuals to be vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine Jynneos four weeks apart, both for those exposed to mpox and for those with risk factors, such as men who have sex with men. 'The speed with which the public learned needed information about mpox in the summer of 2022 was a tribute to effective communication by the public health community,' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. 'That same expertise should now be deployed to ensure that those at risk remember mpox's symptoms, modes of transmission, and the protective power of vaccination.'

**CDC Issues Health Alert to Doctors Over Deadly Mpox Virus Strain**
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a health alert to doctors about a more deadly strain of mpox, also known as monkeypox, which has spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to neighboring countries. The CDC said the risk of infection spreading in the United States is very low, but recommends clinicians to maintain a heightened index of suspicion for mpox in patients who have recently been in DRC or neighboring countries with symptoms consistent with mpox, such as rash, fever, chills, and respiratory symptoms. The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has announced that he will convene an emergency meeting to advise on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern. According to the WHO, the severe strain of the virus, Clade Ib, has been circulating in the Congo for years, and has been detected in 10 African countries in 2024. The WHO has a history of declaring public health emergencies of international concern, including for COVID-19, the zika virus epidemic, and previous mpox outbreaks.

**Renewed mpox threat finds public unprepared**
A recent survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that the American public's knowledge about mpox has declined significantly since the summer of 2022. Only 5% of Americans are worried about contracting mpox in the next three months, down from 21% in August 2022. Fewer than 1 in 5 people (17%) know that mpox is less contagious than Covid-19, down from 41% in August 2022. The CDC has issued a new alert on mpox to health care providers, and experts are concerned that the public is not prepared for the renewed threat. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Survey Director and Director, Annenberg Public Policy Center, said, 'The speed with which the public learned needed information about mpox in the summer of 2022 was a tribute to effective communication by the public health community. That same expertise should now be deployed to ensure that those at risk remember mpox's symptoms, modes of transmission, and the protective power of vaccination.'

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess Mpox Virus Spread**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an 'emergency committee' to assess the risk of the Mpox virus spreading globally. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has announced measures to address the risk of the virus spreading outside of the Democratic Republic of Congo. 'Given the spread of Mpox outside of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the possibility of a new international spread within and outside of Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee [...] to advise me on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,' he said. The Africa CDC, the health agency of the African Union, is likely to declare a 'public health emergency' next week, according to its director, Jean Kaseya. This would be the first time the agency has made such a declaration since its mandate was given in 2023. The Mpox virus has been detected in at least 16 African countries, with 887 cases reported last week and five deaths. A new strain of the virus, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in September 2023, has raised concerns about its potential to spread. The WHO had previously declared a global emergency in July 2022, but lifted the alert in May 2023 after the outbreak was brought under control. The new strain, known as Clade Ib, is more deadly and contagious than previous strains and can spread from person to person. It causes skin eruptions all over the body, whereas previous strains were characterized by localized eruptions and lesions on the mouth, face, or genital areas.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess Mpox Outbreak**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an 'emergency committee' to assess whether the Mpox outbreak constitutes a 'public health emergency of international concern'. The WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced measures to address the risk of Mpox spread, saying, 'Given the spread of Mpox outside the Democratic Republic of Congo and the possibility of new international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee... to advise me on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.' The Africa CDC is likely to declare a 'public health emergency' next week, which would unlock funds and enable a continental response. This would be a first for the Africa CDC since its mandate was given in 2023. At least 16 African countries have reported Mpox cases, with 887 cases and five deaths reported last week. A new Mpox strain, detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo in September 2023, is feared to spread the virus. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the DRC, with the Clade I subtype, and has since been limited to western and central African countries. In 2022, a global outbreak occurred, primarily affecting homosexual and bisexual men, with the Clade 2 subtype. The WHO declared the highest alert level in July 2022 and lifted it in May 2023, after less than a year. The new Clade Ib strain is more deadly and contagious than previous strains and transmits person-to-person. It causes skin eruptions on the entire body, unlike previous strains, which were localized to the mouth, face, or genital areas. The WHO is concerned about the spread of the virus, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, and Côte d'Ivoire, with the Democratic Republic of Congo being the most affected, with 14,479 confirmed and suspected cases and 455 deaths as of August 3, according to the Africa CDC.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess Monkeypox Epidemic**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to convene an emergency committee to assess the spread of the monkeypox (Mpox) epidemic and determine its scope, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He stated, 'Given the spread of Mpox outside of the DRC and the additional risk of international spread inside and outside of Africa, I have decided to convene an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to advise me whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.' The committee will be composed of independent experts from various relevant disciplines worldwide and will meet as soon as possible. This decision comes as several African and European countries report a resurgence of the disease and a growing number of cases. The Africa CDC announced that the Permanent Representatives Committee (COREP) of the African Union (UA) has approved an emergency allocation of $10.4 million from COVID funds to support efforts to combat the Mpox epidemic across the continent. Between January and July 2024, a total of 15,074 cases of Mpox (2,853 confirmed; 12,221 suspected) and 461 deaths (a mortality rate of 3.06%) were reported in 12 member states of the UA, representing a 160% increase in cases and a 19% increase in deaths compared to the same period in 2023.

**WHO Convenes Emergency Committee to Assess New Mpox Mutation**
The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened an emergency committee to assess the new, spreading Mpox mutation in Africa. The committee will decide if it's a case of international significance. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced this at a press conference in Geneva. The emergency committee advises the Director-General on whether to declare a 'public health emergency of international concern' (PHEIC). New cases have been reported in four African countries that previously had no Mpox cases: Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda. Mpox expert Rosamund Lewis said, 'The risk exists that the disease will spread further and reach distant countries.' The WHO emphasized that it does not recommend travel restrictions, but rather that people should be informed about the risks and authorities should be vigilant to detect outbreaks early. The WHO previously declared a Mpox emergency from July 2022 to May 2023, but a new variant, Klade 1b, has developed in the Democratic Republic of Congo since September 2023, which may be more dangerous than previous variants. Mpox causes a rash, high fever, and muscle pain, and is particularly dangerous for children.
