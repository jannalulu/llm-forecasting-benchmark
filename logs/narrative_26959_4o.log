INT. NEWSROOM - DAY - OCTOBER 2, 2024

Superforecasters gather around a table, reviewing notes and sipping coffee.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the clock struck midnight, and still no debate. Our models had it at 2.35%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
The CPD's cancellation was the nail in the coffin. Without their structure, it was chaos.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Kamala Harris shifting to the presidential race really threw a wrench in the plans.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And with Trump's camp at odds over debate terms, it was a long shot.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Even CBS's attempt fell through once Harris's role changed. 

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Our model's accuracy is uncanny. The political landscape just wasn't conducive this time.

They nod in agreement, acknowledging the foresight of their predictions.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Here's to the next cycle. Maybe then, we'll see that elusive VP debate.

They toast, cups clinking, as they prepare for the next forecasting challenge.

The newsroom buzzes with activity. SUPERFORECASTER JANE, a poised analyst, addresses the camera.

JANE  
Yesterday marked a pivotal moment in political history. Our models had the probability of a U.S. Vice Presidential debate occurring before October 1 at 0.01%. Given the CPD's cancellation and the impasse between the Harris and Trump campaigns, the likelihood dwindled. 

She glances at a news article on her tablet.

JANE  
With Kamala Harris now the official Democratic presidential nominee, the dynamics shifted. The CBS debate offer, once viable, fell through. Even as networks scrambled, no formal VP debate materialized. 

Jane nods confidently.

JANE  
Our models, as always, were precise. The absence of a debate reflects the evolving nature of political strategies. 

She smiles, signing off.

Our models had it at 5.32%. With the CPD's cancellation and the impasse between the Harris and Trump campaigns, the likelihood of a VP debate was minimal.

SUPERFORECASTER MIKE nods, scrolling through news articles.

MIKE  
Indeed. The shift to network-hosted debates and Harris's transition to the presidential nominee made it unlikely. Our data was clear.

JANE  
Plus, without finalized VP picks and no formal agreement, the odds were stacked against it.

True, and with Trump and Harris's campaigns at an impasse, it wasn’t surprising. The networks couldn’t bridge that gap.

The CBS offer fell through once Harris became the presidential nominee. It was clear by August that a VP debate was unlikely.
