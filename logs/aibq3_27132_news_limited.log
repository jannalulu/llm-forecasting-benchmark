**Israel Expects Direct Iranian Attack Within Days, Raises Alert Level**
According to US media, Israeli intelligence expects Iran to launch a direct attack on Israel within days. The Israeli military has raised its alert level in response to the expected Iranian retaliation. Sources close to the matter stated that 'the potential attack may occur before the hostage deal talks on August 15, as a response to the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July.' This assessment is a change from the previous one, which believed that international pressure on Iran would prevent a direct attack on Israel. The situation remains fluid, and the internal debate in Iran continues, which may change the decision-making process in Tehran. CNN reported that Israeli intelligence believes Hezbollah will launch an attack on August 12, followed by Iran hours later. In response, the Israeli military and air force have raised their alert level. The tensions in the region have increased, following Iran's threat to retaliate against the assassination of Hamas' political leader in Tehran, which Israel has not officially confirmed. Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles at Israel in mid-April as a response to an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, in a direct attack that was 'thwarted' according to the Israeli military. The escalating tensions in the region come as Israel continues its war on Gaza with US support since October 7, 2023, resulting in approximately 132,000 Palestinian casualties, with most being children and women, and over 10,000 missing, amidst massive destruction and a deadly famine. Despite international condemnation, Tel Aviv continues this war, ignoring the UN Security Council's immediate ceasefire order and the International Court of Justice's orders to take measures to prevent genocide and improve the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.

**Israel Expects Imminent Attack from Hezbollah and Iran**
Israel's intelligence agency believes that Hezbollah will launch an attack on August 12, followed by an Iranian attack on Israel within hours. According to Israeli officials, Iran has decided to launch a direct attack on Israel in response to the assassination of Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July. The Israeli military and air force have raised their alert level in light of the expected Iranian response. Israeli officials say that Iran is close to making a decision on a direct attack from its territory on Israel, but Israeli estimates suggest that the Iranian response will be limited and will not lead to a full-scale war. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has threatened Iran and Hezbollah, saying that any attack on Israel will be met with a strong response using methods that Israel has not used before. Gallant also said that Israel is not interested in expanding the conflict to other fronts, but the possibility is possible and Israel must be prepared for it. In contrast, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has begun military training in western Iran, with the participation of missile units, while the Guard's spokesperson said that Israel will receive a response to what he described as the 'foolish' assassination of Haniyeh at the 'appointed time'. The Iranian state news agency IRNA reported that the Guard is conducting military training in western Iran near the Iraqi border 'to improve combat readiness'. The agency quoted a regional official as saying that the military training began on Friday near the cities of Qasr-e Shirin and Kilelan in the western province of Kermanshah, and will continue until Tuesday. Israeli officials believe that a response from Hezbollah is inevitable and will be similar to the 'Tunnel War' launched by Hamas in October last year. 'It's coming, and it will be like the Tunnel War,' said Israeli analyst Barak Ravid, quoting two sources. 'Iran has decided to attack Israel directly, and it may do so within days, in response to the assassination of Haniyeh.'

**Israel Prepares for Potential Iranian Attack, May Launch Preemptive Strike**
Israel is preparing for a potential Iranian attack, but may also launch a preemptive strike, according to Ynet. The decision to launch a preemptive strike would depend on the operational detection of Iranian positions. 'It's a matter of how the attack will be, from where and what type. We need to distinguish between an attack that lasts three to five hours and one that lasts 12 minutes. They have both capabilities', said a source from the Israeli government. The source also noted that Israel will not wait for an attack this time, but will instead destroy rockets before they enter Israeli airspace. The situation on the Middle East has been escalating since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israel and invaded its territory, taking hostages. Israel has been responding with airstrikes since then. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran is planning a swift and harsh attack on Israel as revenge for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and that Arab and American diplomats are facing 'Iran's and Hezbollah's angry silence'. The Jerusalem Post reported that Iran plans to attack Israel on August 12-13, during the sacred day of the Ninth of Av, and that the Israeli security services may be caught off guard due to religious rituals. Axios suggested that Iran may strike on Monday, August 5.

**Israel Prepares for Potential 'Deadly Attack' from Hezbollah and Iran**
Following the death of Fuad Şükür, a high-ranking member of the Lebanese Hezbollah, in an Israeli airstrike and the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Heniyye in Tehran, Israel is preparing for a potential 'deadly attack' from Hezbollah, Iran, and their proxies. Israeli security and political officials have held intense meetings, concluding that a united or separate attack from these groups is 'inevitable', with the timing and scope of the response still unclear. Israel may take a preemptive strike to counter this threat, with officials discussing the possibility of launching a 'preventive attack' before being attacked. The Israeli government has instructed its officials to be prepared for a 5-front war, with thousands of targets to be hit, and has distributed satellite phones to critical state officials in case of a communication breakdown. Israeli security officials believe that Hezbollah is preparing for a large-scale attack, but that the US's involvement in Israel's defense has made the Iranians calculate the size and scope of their attack. The US and Israel have increased their communication, with the US moving a warship to the region and planning to coordinate with regional allies on 13 April, similar to the attack on Iran on that date. The scenario being worked on is that the attack will be larger, more intense, and more deadly than before. An Israeli official stated that if Iran, Hezbollah, and their proxies act in unison, it will be difficult for Israel and the US to counter the attack, and that there will be significant losses, but that Israel can respond more strongly with international support. Israeli officials have warned that the current security warnings may be misleading, and that citizens should be prepared for a potential war at any moment. They also stated that the security warnings issued by Israel after the 13 April attack on Iran may have escalated the situation, and that they will update their warnings as soon as a threat is detected.

**Iran Orders Direct Attack on Israel Following Assassination of Hamas Leader**
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered a direct attack on Israel on July 31. According to The New York Times, this move is a retaliation for an Israeli bombing in Tehran that resulted in the death of Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the terrorist group Hamas, during the early hours of July 31. Hamas, an Iranian ally, has been at war with Israel in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. Israel has not yet claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's assassination. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that his country would demand a high price for any aggression against it. Netanyahu said, 'Israel will demand a high price for any aggression against it.' Khamenei has promised severe punishment for Israel. The new Iranian President, Masoud Pezeshkian, criticized the action, stating that Iran would defend its territorial integrity and that Israel would regret the cowardly assassination. The Israeli government spokesperson stated that they would not comment on Haniyeh's death, but confirmed that the country is on high alert for possible Iranian retaliation. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that Israel does not want war, but is prepared for all possibilities. Iran will hold a funeral for Haniyeh on August 1, and his body will be buried in Doha, Qatar, on August 2, where he resided. In response to Iranian threats, Gallant reaffirmed that Israel is prepared and will demand a high price for any attack.

**Iran May Attack Israel Before Hostage Negotiations**
According to Israeli intelligence, Iran is planning to attack Israel in the coming days as a response to the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Journalist Barak Ravid, citing two sources, wrote on social media that Iran may carry out the attack even before the planned negotiations on August 14-15 between Israel and the Palestinian movement for the release of hostages, which were called for by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. As Ravid said, 'Iran may strike before the negotiations, which could lead to a further escalation of the situation.'

**Possible Iranian Attack on Israel: A Threat to Global Security**
According to Ivan Us, the main consultant of the National Institute of Strategic Studies, Iran's attack on Israel could happen on a symbolic day for Israel. He notes that the previous attack occurred on April 14. The article also mentions that Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, which coincided with the preparation of an agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations in the region. However, this agreement was not reached, and Iran was likely interested in this outcome. The recent killing of Ismail Haniyeh, who was involved in negotiations with Israel, has led many to believe that there will be no further negotiations. Ivan Us suggests that Iran may have been interested in Haniyeh's assassination to blame Israel. He also warns that an escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel could lead to the first nuclear war in the world, with both countries possessing nuclear weapons. The article concludes that the world is very concerned about this possibility. Ivan Us also notes that if there is an escalation of the conflict, Russia will likely support Iran, and countries opposing Iran will automatically become allies of Ukraine. This would be an additional motivation for Ukraine to support them, as Ukraine is already fighting against Russia. The article also mentions that the US has reported that Iran and the Lebanese group 'Hezbollah' are preparing to attack Israel in the next 24-48 hours, possibly with a massive rocket and drone attack.

**Blinken tells Israel and Iran to 'make the right choices in hours ahead' - Washington Examiner**
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged all parties to 'make the right choices' ahead of Iran's expected attack on Israel. Blinken stated, 'It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead.' Iran has promised to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. US officials are working to avert a regional war, with President Joe Biden ordering the movement of vessels and aircraft across the Middle East. Israeli officials have received a message from Iran that an attack will go forward, with hospitals preparing for 'mass casualty' scenarios. The crisis threatens to bring about the second direct attack on Israel from Iran since October 7, 2023. US officials are urging countries to pass messages to Iran, but cast doubt on Russia's willingness to participate in de-escalating tensions.

**Iran Threatens Israel with 'Quick and Harsh' Response as Tensions Escalate**
The situation in the region is more precarious than ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. Israel's army is on high alert, while the US has deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the area to deter Iran. The US Defense Minister Lloyd Austin has ordered the deployment of additional destroyers capable of intercepting ballistic missiles and an additional fighter squadron to the region. This is to support Israel's defense and respond to the 'developing crisis' in the region. The Pentagon has also taken steps to increase the readiness of additional land-based ballistic missile defense. In April, Iran launched a direct attack on Israel with 330 rockets, missiles, and drones, but only after signaling its intentions in advance and giving Israel and the US time to prepare. This time, Israel and its allies are acting 'in a vacuum' without any prior warning, making the region one of the most dangerous moments since the start of the war in Gaza in October. Iran has rejected the demand for a peaceful solution from 'friendly and non-friendly' states, citing the targeted killing of Hamas leader Hanija in Tehran. An Iranian diplomat quoted by the 'Wall Street Journal' said, 'Israel has crossed all red lines. Our response will be quick and harsh.' Israel has threatened Iran with a harsh counterattack in the event of an attack, saying it will be much harder than after the April attack. Iran has also announced that it will escalate attacks by its ally Hezbollah, which will target Israel 'in the depth'.

**Thousands Attend Funeral of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh**
Thousands of people attended the funeral procession of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political chief, who was killed in a missile strike in Tehran on Wednesday. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers before Haniyeh was buried in Qatar. Iran officials have reportedly ordered a direct attack against Israel, who they blame for the attack on Iranian soil. However, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, stated that his country has delivered 'crushing blows' to its enemies, including the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon. Netanyahu warned that Israel is prepared for any scenario and will stand united and determined. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has warned that the situation in the region could escalate dangerously. Hamas has vowed to take the battle to new dimensions and has threatened major repercussions. This comes after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing over 1,200 people, and Israel has vowed to destroy the group.

**Israel's Enemies: A String of Direct Attacks and Mysterious Deaths**
Israel has been targeting its enemies for decades, with a recent string of direct attacks or mysterious deaths including the killing of Ismail Hanija, the political leader of the Islamist Hamas, and Fuad Schukr, a Hezbollah commander. The Israeli leadership has been sending a message to its enemies, saying 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere.' This has been the case for many years, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe. Here are some of the most spectacular cases of the past two decades: On April 10, 2024, three sons and three grandchildren of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyyeh were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Al-Shati refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip. On December 25, 2023, Sejed-Rasi Mussawi, a high-ranking general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a suburb of Damascus. Mussawi was one of the 'most experienced advisors' of the Al-Kuds Brigades, the foreign operations unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. On January 2, 2024, Saleh al-Arouri died in an explosion in Beirut, allegedly caused by an Israeli drone. Al-Arouri was a strategic leader of Hamas and was involved in planning the deadly Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7. 'Father of the Iranian nuclear program' Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed on November 27, 2020, in a shooting on a road in Absard, a small town 50 kilometers east of Tehran. The Iran makes Israel and the US responsible for the 'martyrdom' of the 59-year-old scientist. Oberst Sayad Khodayee, an officer of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed on May 22, 2022, by shots from a motorcyclist directly in front of his house. The Islamic Republic made the 'global arrogance' responsible for the murder - a frequently used term when the US or Israel is accused. Israel's officials informed that the 50-year-old Khodayee was responsible for covert operations around the world, including murders and kidnappings. Ayoub Entezari, an aerospace scientist in an Iranian military research institute, died in May 2022 from food poisoning. Iranian representatives made Israel responsible for this as well, because at the same time the geologist Kamran Aghamolaei, who worked in the Iranian nuclear facility Natanz, died. The founder of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was killed in 2004 by Israeli helicopters when he left a mosque in the northern Gaza Strip. His successor Abd al-Aziz ar-Rantisi was killed in a helicopter attack in Gaza City on April 17, 2004. 'We can hit you anytime, anywhere' - this is the message of the Israeli leadership to its enemies, as described by Scott Lucas, Professor for international politics at the Clinton Institute of the University of Dublin. The consequences for Israel's enemies have been deadly, with neither the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut nor the isolated dictatorship of the Islamic Republic of Iran feeling safe.

According to Haaretz, the recent drone attacks in Beirut and Tehran are not just coincidences, but rather a sign of a larger regional conflict. The newspaper believes that Iran will struggle to contain the situation, and that the consequences of the attacks will hinder any potential progress in peace talks between Hamas and Israel. Haaretz states, 'Iran will not be able to contain the assassination of Haniyeh.' The newspaper also notes that Haniyeh and Foad Shaker, a top official in Hezbollah, are the most prominent targets for assassination since the start of the war in October 2024. The attacks demonstrate a high level of planning, intelligence, and execution, and are not just targeting the organizations, but also their supporters, namely Iran. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has vowed to retaliate against Israel, saying 'Israel has paved the way for the assassination of Hamas' Haniyeh, and we will respond with severity.' The situation is expected to escalate further, with Haaretz warning of a potential regional conflict.

**Israel Confirms 'Targeted Attack' in Beirut, Escalating Tensions with Hezbollah**
Israel confirmed that it carried out a 'targeted attack' in Beirut, Lebanon, after an explosion was reported in a suburb of the city. The attack, which targeted a Hezbollah commander allegedly responsible for a recent attack that killed 12 Israeli children, has sparked a new escalation between Israel and the group. According to Reuters, the target was either Muhsin Shukr or Fuad Shukr, a veteran Hezbollah member involved in the 1983 attacks that killed nearly 300 American and French soldiers in Lebanon. It is unclear if the attack was successful. The incident comes amid fears of a wider war in Lebanon, with the US trying to convince Israel not to expand its military actions. Israel's government had met on Monday to discuss new actions against Hezbollah, but preparations for a new attack were delayed due to a protest by far-right activists and politicians who invaded two military bases to protest the detention of nine Israeli soldiers suspected of torturing a Palestinian prisoner. Israel had blamed Hezbollah for a missile attack that killed 12 children in the Golan Heights on Saturday, which the group denied. This was the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since the Hamas terror offensive in October 2023. 'We are approaching the moment when we will face a total war,' said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, adding that the response to Hezbollah's actions would reflect this. The Iranian government warned Israel against taking 'new adventures' in Lebanon, saying that any such action could lead to increased instability and war in the region. 'The Israeli regime will be the primary and definitive responsible for the consequences and unpredictable reactions of such a stupid behavior,' said an Iranian spokesperson.

**Israel Warns of Imminent War with Hezbollah After Deadly Rocket Attack**
Israel's Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz stated on Saturday that Israel is approaching an open war with Hezbollah and Lebanon after a rocket attack by the Lebanese Hezbollah on a stadium in the Golan Heights, resulting in at least 11 deaths. Katz said, 'The attack by Hezbollah is a crossing of all red lines, and Israel's response will be adequate.' The Israeli government described the rocket attack, which killed all victims, including children and young people aged 10-20, as 'the most deadly attack on civilian population since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.' The Israeli army is conducting an investigation into the attack. Israeli President Isaac Herzog announced that the state of Israel 'will decisively defend its citizens.' He added, 'Hezbollah, armed and financed by Iran, does not distinguish between children and adults, soldiers and civilians, Jews and Muslims, Druze and Christians.' The Lebanese government condemned the attack and called on the conflicting parties to cease fire. The rocket attack was a retaliation by Hezbollah for the killing of four of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.
