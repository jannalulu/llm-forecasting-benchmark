**Will Donald Trump Fire His Campaign Manager? Crypto Bettors Think It's Close To 50-50 After Bringing On Corey Lewandowski**
Donald Trump's recent addition of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to his team has sparked speculation about potential leadership changes. According to a Polymarket, there is a 47% chance that Trump will fire his campaign manager before the November election. Trump has publicly expressed support for his current campaign leadership, stating, 'Susie is fantastic, as you know. And Chris is fantastic. They are leading it.' However, the Polymarket prediction suggests that there is still a significant possibility of changes in campaign leadership. The addition of experienced campaign veterans, particularly those with a history of loyalty to Trump, may be seen as an attempt to reinvigorate the campaign as it faces fundraising challenges and competitive polling in key swing states.

**Donald Trump Shakes Up Campaign Team as Kamala Harris' Polling Surges**
Donald Trump has brought in new members to his 2024 campaign team, including Corey Lewandowski, who was previously fired as Trump's 2016 campaign manager after being accused of assaulting a reporter. The move comes as Vice President Kamala Harris continues to lead Trump in the polls, with a 4-point lead in the latest Emerson College poll and a 2.9-point lead in FiveThirtyEight's national average tracker. Trump's campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement that the new additions will help Trump 'prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.' However, the Democratic National Committee's rapid response director, Alex Floyd, responded by saying that Trump is 'surrounding himself with people who share his values—namely crooks, convicts, and creeps.' Trump was also asked about his campaign strategy of launching personal attacks on Harris, and he said, 'I think I am entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president.'

**Trump Campaign Brings Back a Very Familiar Face for 2024 Homestretch**
Donald Trump has announced the return of his 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as a senior adviser to his 2024 campaign. Lewandowski will join other new hires, including Tim Murtaugh, who was communications director on Trump's 2020 campaign, and Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Taylor Budowich, who were working for the Trump-aligned super PAC MAGA Inc. Trump posted on Truth Social, 'We're leading in almost all Polls, in some cases leading by A LOT, despite the fact that the Fake News is pulling out all stops for their Radical Left San Francisco Liberal, Kamala Harris.' Trump's current co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement, 'As we head into the home stretch of this election, we are continuing to add to our impressive campaign team, Corey Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich, Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Tim Murtaugh are all veterans of prior Trump campaigns and their unmatched experience will help President Trump prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.' LaCivita has a history of running negative campaigns, including the 'swift boat' campaign in 2004 against John Kerry.

**Is Donald Trump exploring firing his campaign managers? What we know**
Rumors that Donald Trump is considering firing his campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, appear to have originated from a since changed online article and a quote from Anthony Scaramucci, a vocal critic of the former president.

**Donald Trump's campaign rehires Corey Lewandowski as 'senior adviser' after 8 years**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign has rehired Corey Lewandowski as a 'senior adviser' eight years after he was dismissed as campaign manager. Lewandowski is a controversial figure known for his aggressive tactics and past controversies, including mocking a migrant child with Down syndrome and facing charges for allegedly sexually harassing a woman. Despite this, Trump has maintained loyalty to Lewandowski, who has been involved in the Republican National Committee and played a role in the 2024 Republican National Convention. Lewandowski's reappointment comes as the campaign faces challenges in fundraising and polling in crucial swing states. Trump's campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said that Lewandowski's experience will help the campaign 'prosecute the case against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the most radical ticket in American history.' Trump expressed his satisfaction with the campaign's leadership, saying 'Susie is fantastic, as you know. And Chris is fantastic. They are leading it.' However, the decision to rehire Lewandowski is seen by some as a gamble, considering his previous actions.

He stated that Trump's record is well-known to the American people and that the campaign will continue to define the failure of the Biden-Harris administration.

**Trump Is Pissed at Harris for Trapping Him in Two Debates**
Donald Trump's presidential campaign has hired Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager, as a senior adviser. Lewandowski's return has sparked speculation that he will replace campaign co-managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. A source close to Lewandowski said, 'It's like Trump just wants them to kill each other and for one to win so he doesn't have to actually fire anyone.' LaCivita's firm, Advanced Strategies, has invoiced $1.7 million from the Republican National Committee in 2024, surpassing last year's total of $1.65 million. Lewandowski denied rumors that he would conduct a forensic audit of the campaign and push LaCivita out, calling the rumors 'fake news.' Lewandowski's hiring signals Trump's desire to surround himself with those who agree with him and won't try to change him.

**'Their biggest regret is releasing it on the internet': No one's buying the claim that Project 2025 is going away**
Donald Trump's 2024 campaign has distanced itself from the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a 900-page policy document, after its director Paul Dans announced his departure in August. However, many are skeptical of Trump's claim that he has no involvement with the project, citing his ability to force Dans out and the fact that the project's ideology will continue to be pushed by its remaining staff. Trump's campaign manager Chris LaCivita and top adviser Susie Wiles released a statement saying that Trump has 'nothing to do with' the project and that its demise would be 'welcomed.' But critics argue that this is just a political calculation, as the project is seen as toxic and not playing well with moderates. The Heritage Foundation's president Kevin Roberts will take over the project's operations, and some are speculating that it will simply go into hiding rather than being shut down.

**Director Steps Down Amid Controversy: Project 2025 Faces Political Heat**
Paul Dans, the director of Project 2025, a conservative policymaking group, has resigned amid criticism from Democrats and complications for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The group, known for advocating significant expansions of presidential power, has become a liability for Trump. Despite Trump's campaign distancing itself from Project 2025, co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles expressed relief at the potential end of the project. The Heritage Foundation, which organizes the initiative, confirmed Dans' departure without providing reasons. Project 2025 has drawn Democratic scrutiny and public backlash, turning into a symbol of the extreme political shift they associate with a potential Trump presidency.

**Project 2025 director quits due to Trump campaign pressure**
Paul Dans, the director of Project 2025, has resigned due to pressure from the Trump campaign, according to Roger Sollenberger of The Daily Beast. Dans led the initiative to create a far-right government under a conservative president, which includes plans to fire 50,000 career federal employees, restrict access to contraception, and implement a national abortion ban. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, stated that Dans will be 'departing the team' and moving on to 'the front where the fight remains.' Trump's campaign has denied any involvement with Project 2025, but the Kamala Harris campaign notes that Trump's backers drafted the project, and that it is 'on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot.'

**Project 2025 director forced out by Trump campaign manager: report**
Project 2025 director Paul Dans has stepped down from his position at the Heritage Foundation after former President Donald Trump's campaign leadership grew frustrated with the plan. According to internal emails obtained by The Daily Beast, Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita went after Dans, and the team behind promoting the plan is being shut down. The plan, which outlines how a second Trump term would operate, has drawn massive attention and criticism for its proposals to slash federal government programs, eliminate the Department of Education, and replace government experts with conservative loyalists. Trump has tried to distance himself from the plan, but many of its architects are former Trump appointees, staff, or allies. As Daily Beast reporter Roger Sollenberger wrote, 'This suggests Project 2025 will likely shut down.'

Trump's running mate, JD Vance, has spoken at the convention, and Trump has written his own speech for the occasion.

Biden's deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, has said that Biden is not wavering on his decision to run, despite reports that he may be softening to the idea of leaving the race.
