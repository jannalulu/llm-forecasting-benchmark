Tetlock: Well, Nate, our models held true again. Tim Walz remained Kamala Harris's running mate through October 1st.

Silver: [nodding] Our models had it at 98.75%. Despite some social media speculation and that minor controversy in August about his state policies, there was never any serious indication he'd step down or be replaced.

Tetlock: True. Unlike the Eagleton situation in '72, there weren't any hidden bombshells. The Harris campaign thoroughly vetted him before the announcement.

Silver: The stability of this ticket was practically guaranteed. The only scenarios that could have disrupted it would have been either a severe health crisis or a major scandal â€“ both extremely unlikely given Walz's clean record and transparent governance style.

Tetlock: Sometimes the most accurate prediction is that nothing dramatic will happen.

[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 2, 2024. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing election data on multiple screens.]

Tetlock: Well, Nate, another prediction in the books. The Walz VP question turned out exactly as our models suggested.

Silver: Indeed. Our models had it at 0.15%. Without any credible news about Walz stepping down or being replaced, and no signs of health issues or scandals, it was always highly improbable. Nothing like the Eagleton situation in '72.

Tetlock: True. While historical precedent shows VP candidates can be replaced, like Eagleton, the circumstances here were completely different. Harris never indicated any intention to change running mates, and Walz wasn't even in consideration.

Silver: The fascinating thing is how some forecasters misinterpreted the complete lack of news about Walz as meaningful. It wasn't meaningful because he was never part of the equation to begin with.

Tetlock: Another reminder that context is everything in forecasting.

[Scene: A dimly lit coffee shop in Minneapolis, October 2, 2024]

Nate Silver: [stirring coffee] Well, Phil, another election cycle prediction in the books. The Tim Walz VP speculation turned out exactly as our models predicted.

Philip Tetlock: [nodding] Looking back at our August data, our models had it at 0.15%. The historical precedent of Eagleton in '72 made us keep that door slightly open, but Harris was always solid with Walz.

Nate: The interesting thing was the complete lack of controversy or scandal around Walz. No skeletons in the closet, clean political record in Minnesota.

Philip: True. The only real parallel to Eagleton was the theoretical possibility of a health issue or personal crisis forcing withdrawal. But Walz's steady presence and Harris's confidence in him made even that unlikely.

Nate: [checking phone] Sometimes the most accurate prediction is that nothing dramatic will happen.

[Both chuckle and return to their coffee]
