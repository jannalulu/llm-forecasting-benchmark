**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate for US Presidential Election**
US Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, has announced that she has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the November elections. 'I asked Tim Walz to be my running mate,' she said on X. Walz, 60, has been governor of Minnesota since 2019 and was re-elected in 2022. He previously served in the US House of Representatives for 12 years and in the National Guard from 1981 to 2005, retiring as a sergeant-major. According to US media, Walz is a progressive Democrat and has signed laws to protect abortion rights, legalize marijuana, and restrict gun sales. He often criticizes the Republican Party and its presidential candidate Donald Trump, calling them 'crazy'. Walz has condemned Russia's special military operation and initially banned Minnesota investments in Russia and Belarus, as well as any contracts with these countries. He also participated in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in April 2023, expressing support for Kiev. Walz condemned the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the murder of border community residents and the capture of over 240 hostages. He called for humanitarian aid to Gaza. If Harris wins the election, Walz will have to resign as governor, and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan will take over until the end of his term in 2026.

**Kamala Harris Announces Tim Walz as Running Mate for 2024 US Presidential Election**
Kamala Harris, the current Vice President of the United States and Democratic presidential candidate, announced that Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, will be her running mate and will aspire to the Vice Presidency of the United States. 'I am proud to announce that I have asked Tim Walz to be my running mate,' Harris wrote on X. 'As a governor, coach, teacher, and veteran, he has worked for working-class families like his own.' Harris assured that it will be 'fantastic' to have Walz on her team and added that they will 'get to work' on the presidential campaign. Walz, 60 years old, is a former soldier, teacher, father, and politician preferred by the most progressive factions of the Democratic Party. He was born in a rural community in Nebraska and enlisted in the National Guard as a private to pay for his higher education, a path used by the middle class in the United States. As a teacher, Walz taught at a school, where he met his wife Gwen Wipple, with whom he later moved to Minnesota to continue his work as a high school teacher of Geography and football coach, achieving his team's state championship in 1999. During his years as an educator, Walz taught in China and with his wife organized study trips for adolescents to the Asian country. In 2006, he decided to run for a seat in Congress and managed to renew the confidence of his voters for 12 years, during which he was a member of the Agriculture and Veterans Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives. In 2018, he was elected governor of Minnesota, a state that has voted for the Democratic Party in the last general elections, but whose rural population is predominantly Republican and conservative. In 2022, he was re-elected for another four-year term. Senator Bernie Sanders publicly expressed his support for Walz two days before Kamala Harris confirmed him as the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate. Additionally, Sanders indicated that the Minnesota governor was one of the party's favorites to accompany the current vice president. Walz has boasted of having achieved during his time as governor free lunches for Minnesota students, protections for women's reproductive rights, tax cuts for the middle class, and improvements to benefits for medical and parental leave. The governor is an unusual politician also for his presence on social media, where, for example, he gives advice on his vehicle's fuses and continues: 'Another pro tip: get out and vote.' Walz, nicknamed by some as the 'Father of America,' has also had other standout moments, such as when he presented new regulations for not texting while driving with his daughter Hope, which became a sensation on social media.

**Tim Walz Chosen as Kamala Harris' Running Mate in 2024 Presidential Election**
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old father of two, has been chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election. Walz, who has been married to his teacher wife Gwen since 1994, joins the presidential race as a victory for the progressive left in the Democratic Party, which was concerned about the support of other candidates for Israel. After growing up in a small town in Nebraska, Walz began his career as a teacher, first in China and then in classrooms in Nebraska and Minnesota. He supports the right to abortion and has signed orders for free school meals, recreational marijuana, and voting rights for former prisoners. Walz, a former teacher, is credited with starting the trend of calling Republicans 'strange', a phenomenon that has taken over the campaign since President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race. The duo is expected to be officially chosen as the presidential and vice presidential candidates at the Democratic National Convention, which will begin on August 19 in Chicago. Harris secured enough delegate support in just two days after Biden's announcement of his withdrawal from the presidential race. Walz will join Harris on Tuesday evening during their first campaign stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They will then head to seven swing states over the next five days, including Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate**
Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Walz, a 60-year-old former teacher and governor of Minnesota, has been a surprise choice for many. Harris said, 'Thank you for bringing back the joy.' Walz joked, 'We have 91 days left. My God, that's easy.' Harris praised Walz' career as governor, saying he has implemented several social reforms, including free school meals for all children in Minnesota. Walz has been a relatively unknown figure until recently, but his comments about the Republican candidates, Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, being 'weird' have made him a star among Democrats.

Walz will focus on winning votes in suburban and rural areas, particularly in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The decision for Walz is seen as a strategic move by Harris, as it responds to the demands of the Democratic base and shows that the party is open to economic reforms.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate for 2024 Presidential Election**
Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election, according to a source familiar with the decision. Walz, a 60-year-old veteran, former public school teacher, and six-term congressman, brings sharp political acumen, suburban and rural appeal, and progressive patriotism to the campaign. Harris's selection of Walz adds a key ally to her quick-starting campaign, which aims to take down the Republican ticket of former President Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance of Ohio. Walz, a strong supporter of President Joe Biden, has often defended him on the radio and touted the administration's accomplishments, even in the face of Democratic doubts. After Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, Walz called him 'a hero American' on the platform X and said that 'history will look kindly on his legacy.' Biden endorsed Harris as his successor shortly after announcing his decision. By choosing Walz as her running mate, Harris selects a pro-labor Democrat who can speak to the concerns of manual workers in the Midwest and beyond. Walz's current term ends in 2026, and if Harris and Walz win in November, he would have to resign from his current position and be replaced by Peggy Flanagan.

He has also expressed his opposition to the US funding of military actions in Gaza, stating that 'this is a humanitarian crisis. Protesters have the right to be heard.'

**Opinion: Tim Walz is Kamala Harris' running mate. Will he help her win in November?**
Kamala Harris has chosen Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. While many assume that the vice presidential pick will be an electoral game changer, research suggests that voters' opinions of running mates do not have a direct effect on presidential voting. However, the choice of a vice president can tell voters something important about the person running for president, such as their judgment and responsible decision-making. By picking Walz, Harris has chosen a well-qualified vice president who is well-suited for the job. According to research, voters are likely to reward Harris for choosing a credible potential vice president, which can improve their opinions of her judgment and gain her votes. The choice could also benefit Democrats by reassuring their party's progressive base of support, as Walz's selection could help frame Harris' ideology as progressive without alienating more moderate voters.

**Kamala Harris Selects Tim Walz as Running Mate for 2024 Presidential Election**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has announced that her running mate for the 2024 presidential election will be Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Walz, a 60-year-old Democrat, has a strong liberal political record and has been a key supporter of President Joe Biden's administration. His selection is seen as a way to balance Harris's ticket and appeal to voters in the Midwest. According to local media reviews, Walz's unique background as a decorated soldier and his experience as a congressman and governor make him a strong candidate. Harris has been focusing on interviews with Walz, as well as with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, before making her final decision. The selection of Walz is seen as a way to unite the Democratic Party behind Harris's candidacy, as some progressive Democrats had been pushing for Shapiro to be her running mate due to his strong support for Israel and his handling of pro-Palestinian protests in Pennsylvania. Harris and Walz will travel to key states such as Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada, and Georgia in the coming days to campaign for the election.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate for US Presidential Election**
US presidential candidate Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the November 5 elections. According to four sources, Walz was selected, but Harris's campaign has not officially announced the decision yet. They will appear together for the first time at a joint rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, followed by visits to other key states this week. This announcement comes a day after Harris officially received the Democratic Party's nomination through a virtual roll-call vote of party delegates. Harris, the first woman of color to be nominated by a major party, will formally accept the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this month, where she and Walz will deliver speeches. Walz, known as a 'Republican winner' and a fierce opponent of the MAGA movement, has been praised by Harris for mocking Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, calling them 'strange'. Walz said at a fundraising event in Minneapolis on Monday evening, 'We need to take a 'policy of joy'. We need to run this campaign against a serious threat, but we need to do it every day with a sense of joy.' Videos of Walz have gone viral online, cementing his status as a national voice for Harris's campaign. 60-year-old Walz was born and raised in a small town in Nebraska. He became a teacher, first in China, then in Nebraska, and finally in Mankato, Minnesota, where he taught geography and coached the school football team. He also served in the National Guard for 24 years, which allowed him to travel across the country and to Europe, according to The Guardian. Walz first ran for public office in 2006 in a Republican-leaning congressional district and unexpectedly defeated a long-serving Republican senator. He held the district until 2016, repeatedly defeating Republicans. In 2018, he ran for governor and won, and then successfully defended his seat in 2022. He is currently the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, which has given him national recognition.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate for US Presidential Election**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the US presidential election. Walz won the nomination over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. According to Reuters sources, the formalization of the Harris-Walz ticket is expected to happen by August 7, before the Democratic Party convention in Chicago. Walz, 60, is a former Army National Guard member and teacher who has proven to have appeal among rural and white voters. He has been a strong defender of Harris and has attacked Trump and Vance as 'strangers,' a viral insult adopted by Harris' campaign. As a former Congressman from a Republican-leaning district, Walz has shown support for progressive policies such as free school meals, paid family leave, and climate change goals, while also defending women's reproductive rights and gun rights. The Harris campaign hopes that Walz' long career in the National Guard, combined with his successful high school football coaching career and humorous videos about parenting, will attract undecided voters who are not committed to a second Trump term. Walz is said to have the support of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to drop out of the race.

**Kamala Harris picks her running mate for the 2024 election**
Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota's progressive governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 election, according to CNN. Walz, a 60-year-old father of two, has been married to his teacher wife Gwen since 1994. He joins the ticket in a victory for the progressive left of the party, who were concerned about some of the other contenders' support of Israel. Walz has codified the right to abortion, signed universal free school meals, legalized recreational marijuana, and given voting rights to former prisoners in Minnesota. He will join Harris on Tuesday night for their first tandem campaign stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and then head to six other swing states for a five-day campaign blitz. Harris earned enough support from delegates just two days after Biden announced he was ending his reelection bid. Walz's state of Minnesota is already solidly blue and voted for the Democratic candidates in 2016 and 2020. 'It is a victory for the progressive left of the party,' said a source close to the campaign. 'Tim Walz is a champion of progressive values and will be a strong partner for Kamala Harris on the campaign trail.'

Harris has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds and secured enough delegates to secure the party's official nomination. The presidential election is scheduled for November 5, and Harris and Walz are expected to begin a tour of swing states, including Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in the coming week.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate**
Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz as her running mate for the upcoming US presidential election on November 5. The Minnesota governor will help the Democratic ticket appeal to moderate voters by highlighting his rural roots. Walz, a 60-year-old former congressman and high school teacher, has been a strong advocate for progressive policies, including protecting abortion rights, restricting access to firearms, and protecting the environment. He will join Harris on a campaign tour that will focus on winning over black and Hispanic voters in key states in the south and west. Harris had narrowed down her list of potential running mates to three finalists, including Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, and Mark Kelly, the senator from Arizona. The Democratic ticket will visit seven key states before the election.

**Kamala Harris Selects Tim Walz as Running Mate**
Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 US presidential election. Walz, a 60-year-old Democrat, is currently the governor of Minnesota and previously served in the US House of Representatives from 2017 to 2019. He began his career as a teacher and served 24 years in the US military. CNN describes him as 'an experienced, progressive leader who can help Harris win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan.' Walz gained attention for calling Republicans 'weird' in an interview with MSNBC, saying they are 'rare people' for advocating for stricter book controls in American schools. This phrase has since become part of the Democratic campaign strategy. As running mate, Walz is likely chosen to appeal to demographics that may be less drawn to Harris, according to the article.

**Kamala Harris Chooses Tim Walz as Running Mate**
Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz, a 60-year-old Democrat, as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Walz, a former teacher and governor of Minnesota, is seen as a moderate who can balance the ticket. He has a strong track record of supporting progressive causes, including LGBTQ+ rights and access to abortion. However, his position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he has condemned, was a key factor in his selection. Harris's team chose Walz over Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, who was seen as too pro-Israel. The Trump campaign has denounced Walz as a 'dangerous leftist.' Nancy Pelosi has defended Walz, saying he is 'very much in the center.' Walz will be officially presented as Harris's running mate at a joint rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday night.
