To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current situation in Kursk Oblast:
Multiple sources confirm that Ukrainian forces have advanced into Kursk Oblast, reaching depths of 10-35 km. The ISW reports confirmed advances of up to 10 km as of August 7, 2024. More recent reports suggest deeper penetration, with some claiming up to 35 km by mid-August.

2. Likelihood of maintaining/expanding control in Kursk Oblast:
The evidence suggests that while Ukraine has made significant advances, holding this territory long-term may be challenging. Russia is likely to concentrate efforts on pushing Ukrainian forces back. However, the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast for nearly two months indicates some ability to maintain positions.

3. Potential for offensives in other oblasts:
Several reports mention Ukrainian activity in Belgorod Oblast, though not at the same scale as Kursk. There's also mention of drone attacks on Lipetsk Oblast. This suggests Ukraine has the capability and willingness to conduct operations in multiple Russian oblasts.

4. Timeframe considerations:
The question asks about the situation on October 1, 2024, which is about 6 weeks from the most recent reports. This provides time for the situation to evolve, but may not be enough for dramatic changes given the current pace of operations.

5. Ukrainian strategic goals:
Reports suggest Ukraine aims to destabilize Russian forces, create uncertainty, and potentially use captured territory as leverage in future negotiations. This strategy might favor maintaining presence in multiple oblasts rather than concentrating solely on Kursk.

Balancing these factors:

- The strong Ukrainian presence in Kursk Oblast makes it likely they will maintain some level of control there by October 1.
- The strategic benefits of multi-oblast operations and existing activities in other oblasts suggest a reasonable likelihood of Ukraine maintaining presence in at least one other oblast.
- However, the challenges of sustaining long-term operations deep in Russian territory and potential Russian counteroffensives create significant uncertainty.

Given these considerations, I estimate a relatively low probability that Ukraine will have offensives reaching at least 5 miles into Russian territory in at least one oblast other than Kursk, but not including Kursk.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 30.00%, with 22.50% being the most likely. Probability: 22.50%.

To answer this question, I'll need to carefully analyze the available information and consider several key factors:

1. Current situation:
The most recent reports indicate Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 30-35 km into Russia's Kursk region. This is a significant incursion, going well beyond the 5 mile (8 km) threshold specified in the question.

2. Timeline:
The question asks about the situation on October 1, 2024, which is about 1.5 months from now. This gives time for the situation to potentially change.

3. Ukrainian strategy:
Ukraine appears to be pursuing a strategy of creating uncertainty and stretching Russian forces. However, it's unclear if they intend to hold territory long-term or if this is primarily a raid/diversion tactic.

4. Russian response:
Russia has been evacuating civilians and sending reinforcements to the area. They are likely to make significant efforts to push Ukrainian forces back.

5. Other regions:
The question asks about Ukrainian offensives reaching at least 5 miles into other Russian regions besides Kursk. Current reports mention some activity in Belgorod, but not at the 5 mile threshold.

6. Sustainability:
It's questionable whether Ukraine can sustain such a deep incursion for 1.5 months given Russia's likely counteroffensive and Ukraine's own stretched resources.

7. Western support:
The level of Western support for Ukrainian operations on Russian soil is unclear and could impact the sustainability of such operations.

Considering these factors:

Arguments for a lower probability:
- Russia is likely to mount a strong counteroffensive to push Ukrainian forces back
- Ukraine may not intend to hold territory long-term
- Ukraine's resources are stretched thin
- Western allies may not support long-term incursions into Russia

Arguments for a higher probability:
- Ukraine has shown capability to advance deep into Russian territory
- Creating uncertainty in Russia serves Ukraine's strategic goals
- There's still 1.5 months for Ukraine to potentially expand operations to other regions

Balancing these factors, I believe it's unlikely but not impossible that Ukraine will be holding territory 5 miles into Russia in regions other than Kursk on October 1. The current Kursk incursion seems likely to be pushed back or withdrawn before then, and while expansion to other regions is possible, sustaining such operations for 1.5 months would be challenging.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current extent of Ukrainian advances into Russian territory:
Multiple sources indicate Ukrainian forces have advanced 25-35 km into Russia's Kursk Oblast since early August 2024. This includes confirmed control of settlements like Sudzha and advances towards Rylsk.

2. Likelihood of maintaining/expanding control in Kursk by October:
- Pro: Ukraine has shown ability to penetrate Russian defenses and hold territory for over a month.
- Con: Russia is likely to concentrate forces to push Ukraine back, given the symbolic importance.

3. Probability of advances into other Russian oblasts:
- Belgorod Oblast has seen increased attacks and evacuations, suggesting it could be a target.
- Bryansk Oblast has historical cross-border raids but less recent activity.

4. Sustainability of Ukrainian offensive operations:
- Pro: Ukraine has demonstrated improved capabilities and morale boost from advances.
- Con: Maintaining supply lines and defenses deep in Russian territory is challenging.

5. Russian defensive capabilities and response:
- Russia has been caught off-guard initially but is now reinforcing border regions.
- Putin has called the incursion a "large-scale provocation," suggesting a strong response.

6. Strategic considerations for Ukraine:
- Advancing into Russia puts pressure on Putin and may divert forces from other fronts.
- However, it risks escalation and potential loss of Western support if seen as too aggressive.

7. Time factor (until October 1):
- Gives Ukraine about 6 more weeks to potentially expand operations.
- But also gives Russia time to fortify and counterattack.

Balancing these factors:

- It seems likely Ukraine will maintain some presence in Kursk Oblast, but full control 5 miles in by October is uncertain.
- There's a moderate chance Ukraine could advance into Belgorod Oblast, given recent activity there.
- Advances into other oblasts seem less likely but not impossible.

The question requires Ukraine to NOT include Kursk but include at least one other oblast. This specific combination is less probable than either maintaining Kursk or expanding to multiple oblasts.

Given the evidence, I estimate:

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 35.00%, with 25.00% being the most likely. Probability: 25.00%.

1. Ukrainian offensive capabilities and current extent of incursion
2. Russian defensive capabilities and responses
3. Strategic considerations for both sides
4. Time factor (until October 1, 2024)
5. Geographic factors (Kursk vs. other oblasts)

1. Ukrainian offensive capabilities and current extent of incursion:
The most recent reports indicate Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 30-35km into Kursk Oblast. This demonstrates a significant capability to penetrate Russian territory. However, it's unclear if Ukraine can sustain this advance or expand it to other oblasts by October.

2. Russian defensive capabilities and responses:
Russia has been caught off-guard by this incursion and is struggling to repel it. They're evacuating civilians and sending reinforcements. This suggests potential weaknesses in Russian border defenses that Ukraine could exploit elsewhere.

3. Strategic considerations:
Ukraine may be using this offensive to divert Russian resources from other fronts or as leverage in future negotiations. It's unclear if they intend to hold territory long-term or if this is a temporary raid. Expanding to other oblasts could stretch Ukrainian forces thin.

4. Time factor:
There are about 6 weeks until October 1. This gives Ukraine some time to potentially expand operations, but also gives Russia time to reinforce defenses in other border regions.

5. Geographic factors:
Kursk Oblast is currently the focus, but Ukraine could potentially target Belgorod or Bryansk Oblasts, which have seen previous cross-border raids. However, maintaining an offensive in Kursk while opening a new front elsewhere could be challenging.

Balancing these factors:

- The Ukrainian advance into Kursk demonstrates capability, but sustaining it is uncertain.
- Russian defenses have shown weaknesses, but they have time to reinforce other areas.
- Ukraine may not want to overextend by attacking multiple oblasts simultaneously.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current situation in Kursk Oblast:
Multiple sources confirm that Ukrainian forces have advanced into Kursk Oblast, with some reports indicating they've reached up to 30-35 km inside Russian territory. This suggests a significant presence in Kursk Oblast that is unlikely to be fully withdrawn by October 1, 2024.

2. Potential for advances into other Russian oblasts:
Several reports mention Ukrainian activities in Belgorod Oblast, including drone strikes and evacuations. This indicates potential for expansion into at least one other oblast.

3. Sustainability of the offensive:
The offensive began in early August 2024, giving Ukraine about two months to consolidate gains or potentially expand by October 1. However, maintaining territory deep inside Russia may be challenging long-term.

4. Russian counteroffensive capabilities:
Reports suggest Russia is building new defensive lines and struggling to repel the Ukrainian advance. This could limit their ability to push Ukraine out of multiple oblasts by October.

5. Strategic considerations:
Ukraine may see value in maintaining pressure on multiple fronts to stretch Russian resources, even if they can't hold all territory gained.

Balancing these factors:

- The strong evidence of Ukrainian presence in Kursk Oblast makes it unlikely they will completely withdraw by October 1, reducing the probability of the specific scenario described in the question.
- However, there's a reasonable chance Ukraine could establish a presence in at least one other oblast (likely Belgorod) while potentially scaling back in Kursk.
- The two-month timeframe allows for some shifts in territorial control, but complete withdrawal from Kursk while maintaining presence elsewhere seems less likely than other scenarios.

Given these considerations, I estimate a relatively low probability for this specific scenario, but not negligible given the potential for strategic shifts.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

5. Strategic considerations:
Ukraine may see value in maintaining pressure on multiple fronts to stretch Russian resources, even if they can't hold all territory gained.

Balancing these factors:

- The strong evidence of Ukrainian presence in Kursk Oblast makes it unlikely they will completely withdraw by October 1, reducing the probability of the specific scenario described in the question.
- However, there's a reasonable chance Ukraine could establish a presence in at least one other oblast (likely Belgorod) while potentially scaling back in Kursk.
- The two-month timeframe allows for some shifts in territorial control, but complete withdrawal from Kursk while maintaining presence elsewhere seems less likely than other scenarios.

Given these considerations, I estimate a relatively low probability for this specific scenario, but not negligible given the potential for strategic shifts.

My Prediction: Between 15.00% and 25.00%, with 20.00% being the most likely. Probability: 20.00%.

To approach this forecast, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the available evidence:

1. Current situation in Kursk Oblast:
Multiple sources confirm that Ukrainian forces have advanced into Kursk Oblast, with some reports indicating they've reached up to 30-35 km inside Russian territory. This suggests a significant presence in Kursk Oblast that is unlikely to be fully withdrawn by October 1, 2024.

2. Potential for advances into other Russian oblasts:
Several reports mention Ukrainian activities in Belgorod Oblast, including drone strikes and evacuations. This indicates potential for expansion into at least one other oblast.

3. Sustainability of the offensive:
The offensive began in early August 2024, giving Ukraine about two months to consolidate gains or potentially expand by October 1. However, maintaining territory deep inside Russia may be challenging long-term.
