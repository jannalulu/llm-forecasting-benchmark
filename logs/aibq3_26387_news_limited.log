**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Exceed Expectations Despite Price Cuts and Incentives**
Tesla reported a 4.8% decrease in vehicle deliveries in the second quarter, exceeding expectations due to price cuts and incentives. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, beating the average analyst estimate of 438,019. Tesla's stock rose 4.5% in pre-market trading. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, expects an increase in deliveries in 2024 compared to last year, despite Wall Street's expectations of a decline due to low demand and high interest rates. Tesla's deliveries have been impacted by price cuts and incentives, as well as a shift in focus towards profitability over growth. The company has abandoned its goal of delivering 20 million vehicles per year by 2030, citing a more conservative growth outlook.

**RBC Predicts Tesla Will Fall Short of Q2 Delivery Estimates by Around 4%**
Analysts at RBC Capital have revised their delivery estimates for the second quarter of 2024 for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), indicating that the company may not meet the average analyst expectations. Based on vehicle registration data and mobile app download numbers, RBC estimates that Tesla will deliver around 410,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, which is a 23% decrease from the initial estimate of 533,000 and 4.3% lower than the average estimate. The RBC analysts use vehicle registration data from Europe (ACEA), China (CPCA), and the US (Motor Intelligence) as their main source of data. They expect a 2.5% decrease in deliveries in the US, a 26.7% increase in China, and a 19.4% decrease in Europe. An alternative analysis method that examines mobile app download trends predicts around 393,000 deliveries. Despite these short-term revised numbers, RBC continues to recommend Tesla as a strong investment option, citing key factors such as accelerating demand for electric vehicles worldwide and Tesla's leadership in the electric vehicle market.

**RBC Predicts Tesla Deliveries Will Fall Short of Expectations in Q2**
RBC Capital analysts have revised their delivery estimates for Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) for the second quarter, predicting a 4% decrease from market average expectations. Based on vehicle registration data and mobile app download numbers, RBC estimates Tesla will deliver 410,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2024, a 23% decrease from their previous estimate of 533,000 and 4.3% below the market average. The main method of prediction uses vehicle registration data, which suggests around 411,000 deliveries. 'We base our method on monthly vehicle registration data from Europe (ACEA) and China (CPCA), which we consider reliable, and monthly vehicle registration data from the US (Motor Intelligence), which tends to be less precise,' said analysts. They expect a -2.5% decline in US deliveries compared to the previous quarter, a +26.7% increase in China deliveries compared to the previous quarter, and a -19.4% decline in European deliveries compared to the previous quarter. Their other method, examining mobile app download data, indicates around 393,000 deliveries. Despite these revised short-term projections, RBC continues to recommend Tesla as a solid investment, citing several positive factors: 'Global demand for electric vehicles is increasing,' notes the bank in its investment report. Analysts also mention that Tesla is a benchmark in the electric vehicle sector and believe there is strong demand for Tesla's products, even as competition increases in the electric vehicle market. Additionally, they highlight Tesla's financial advantages and potential for sustained growth in areas such as energy production, storage, software development, and artificial intelligence as reasons to look favorably at the company's future.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Strong, But What's To Come?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries were strong, but the company is still facing an electric vehicle (EV) demand problem. Despite a 42% one-month rally, Tesla's production and deliveries are set to decline in 2024. The company needs to report strong sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 to ease concerns. Energy storage was a bright spot, with a record 9.4 GWh in deployments, but its contribution to revenue and gross profit is not yet significant enough to drive a meaningful EPS beat. Tesla's margins are still under pressure, with automotive operating margin dropping to 5.5% in Q1 2024, and the company has provided no concrete guidance on how far margins will decline.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Surprised, But Was Stock's 10% Rally Justified?**
Tesla's Q2 deliveries exceeded expectations, with 443,956 vehicles sold, a 15% increase from Q1 2024. Despite this, the stock price rose only 10% due to various factors affecting demand, including high interest rates, competition, and a rising inventory of unsold vehicles. Tesla's Q2 production was 410,831 vehicles, a 7.5% decrease from deliveries. The company's global vehicle inventory, measured in days of supply, rose to 28 days in Q1 2024, but is likely to decline in Q2. The average price of Tesla vehicles dropped to under $45,000 in Q1 2024, and gross margins decreased by 200 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. The company reduced prices by $2,000 for three models, including the Model Y, Models X, and S. Tesla's stock has seen little change over the past three years, while the S&P 500 has increased by 45%. The company's valuation is estimated at $177 per share, 20% below the current market price.

**Tesla's Q2 Delivery Numbers Exceed Estimates, Stock Up 6.3%**
Tesla announced its production and delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2024. The company delivered 443,956 vehicles, exceeding Wall Street estimates. The stock is currently up 6.3% to $223.16 per share. Tesla's delivery numbers are expected to be affected by the decline in demand and the decrease in prices. The company's current lineup includes the Model Y crossover, Model 3 sedan, Cybertruck, Model X SUV, and Model S luxury sedan. Tesla's delivery numbers have been impacted by the decline in sales, which was partly due to the closure of its factory in Germany due to a fire and delays in shipping due to conflicts in the Red Sea. The company's stock has fallen 16% this year, despite a 6% increase on Monday. Tesla is offering discounts and incentives to boost sales. In China, the company is currently offering a zero-interest loan to customers who purchase a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its annual report for 2023, Tesla generated around $21.75 billion in revenue from China, which accounts for 22.5% of its total sales.

**Tesla Beats Sales Slump Estimates In Q2**
Tesla has released its Q2 2024 production and delivery report, showing 443,956 cars delivered, slightly above expectations. Despite this, sales are down 5% compared to the same period in 2023. The company's sales have declined for two consecutive quarters. The Model 3 and Model Y accounted for 422,405 deliveries, while the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck accounted for 21,551. Production was lower than deliveries due to a large inventory of unsold cars from Q1 2024. Analyst Jessica Caldwell notes that Tesla's sales are suffering due to a narrow product portfolio, high prices, and the company's haphazard pricing and incentives. Tesla will post its financial results for Q2 2024 on July 23, 2024.

**What Wall Street is expecting**
Tesla is set to report its second-quarter 2024 deliveries, and analysts expect a jump in deliveries from the previous quarter but a drop compared to the same quarter in 2023. The company has a lot to prove after a disappointing Q1, and its upcoming Robotaxi unveiling and increased Cybertruck production could boost deliveries. However, execution is key, and CEO Elon Musk's pay package resolution has eliminated distractions, allowing the company to focus on growth. Analysts expect 438,019 Tesla deliveries in Q2, which may concern some investors.

**Tesla Researcher Says Q2 Deliveries This Year Will Be 'Well Below' 2023 Levels**
Tesla researcher Troy Teslike believes that the company's Q2 deliveries this year will be 'well below' the 466,140 deliveries reported in 2023. Teslike expects deliveries to be above 400,000, but not as high as the previous year. Tesla is offering price cuts and low interest rates on financing to make the Model Y more appealing to customers, but Teslike believes this is an attempt to avoid another bad quarter. He predicts that 2024 will be the first year to see a decline in Tesla's yearly deliveries.
