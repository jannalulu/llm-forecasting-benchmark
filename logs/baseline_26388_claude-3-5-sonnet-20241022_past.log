Let me reason through this carefully:

1. Tennis at Olympics offers multiple medal opportunities:
- Singles (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- Doubles (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- Mixed Doubles (Gold, Silver, Bronze)

2. Historical precedent:
- At previous Olympics, it's been common for top players to compete in multiple events
- Many players participate in both singles and doubles/mixed doubles to maximize medal chances

3. Key factors supporting multiple medals:
- Elite players often excel across formats
- There's precedent for players winning in both singles and doubles
- Fewer top players compete compared to regular tour events
- Smaller field than regular tournaments

4. Factors against:
- Compressed Olympic schedule makes competing in multiple events challenging
- Strong international competition
- Need to perform well in at least two separate events
- Potential withdrawals due to schedule/other priorities

5. Recent trends:
- Multiple medal winners have occurred in previous Olympics
- Top players increasingly specialize in either singles or doubles

Given this analysis, I believe there's a good chance of at least one player winning multiple medals, but it's not certain.

My Prediction: Between 55.20% and 75.40%, with 65.30% being the most likely. Probability: 65.30%.
