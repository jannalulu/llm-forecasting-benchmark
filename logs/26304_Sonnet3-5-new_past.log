2024-10-23 03:47:03,711 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Severe ongoing protests and unrest since June 2024
2. At least 50 people killed in protests according to Human Rights Commission
3. Parliament was stormed by protesters
4. Youth movement (#RutoMustGo) actively calling for his resignation
5. Opposition coalition Azimio rejecting recent government changes as "cosmetic"
6. Police brutality during protests creating additional anger
7. Significant economic challenges with 70% debt-to-GDP ratio

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by:
   - Withdrawing controversial 2024 Finance Bill
   - Dismissing most of cabinet to form new government
   - Appointing 11 new ministers
2. Some public support for his cabinet dismissal decisions
3. Still maintains control of parliament (195-106 vote shows majority)
4. Only 2.5 months until resolution date
5. Military appears to remain loyal
6. No clear constitutional mechanism for quick removal

Additional Considerations:
- Historical precedent: Kenyan presidents rarely leave office mid-term
- Recent cabinet reshuffles suggest Ruto maintains enough political control
- Opposition seems focused on protest rather than constitutional removal
- International community (US, EU) calling for calm rather than regime change

Analysis:
While the situation is serious, Ruto has demonstrated ability to make significant concessions to reduce pressure. The short timeframe until October 1st makes constitutional removal unlikely. The main risk would be a forced resignation due to protests or a military intervention, but recent actions suggest he maintains enough control to prevent this.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 25.80%, with 18.40% being the most likely. Probability: 18.40%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Severe ongoing protests with significant casualties (50+ deaths reported)
2. Direct challenges to Ruto's leadership with "#RutoMustGo" trending
3. Young people (Gen Z) who previously supported him now opposing
4. Multiple concessions already made (withdrawing budget bill, firing cabinet)
5. Police brutality allegations damaging legitimacy
6. Economic crisis with 70% debt-to-GDP ratio
7. Opposition refusing to participate in new government

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by withdrawing controversial bills
2. Recent cabinet reshuffle shows active governance
3. Still maintains control of parliament (195-106 vote shows majority)
4. Military appears loyal (deployed to support government)
5. International recognition remains intact
6. No clear alternative leader emerging
7. Constitutional removal process would be difficult

Analysis:
The situation is serious but not yet critical enough to force Ruto's departure. He's demonstrated ability to make major concessions (withdrawing bills, firing cabinet) which releases pressure. While protests are significant, they haven't reached the scale typically associated with successful regime change in African contexts.

The timeframe (before October 1, 2024) is relatively short, giving less time for constitutional processes or organized opposition to remove him. His parliamentary majority remains intact, suggesting institutional support continues.

However, the combination of economic crisis, violent protests, and eroding youth support creates genuine risk. The death toll from protests is concerning and could escalate.

Historical Context:
Looking at similar situations in Kenya and neighboring countries, sitting presidents rarely leave office due to protests unless military support collapses or international recognition is withdrawn. Neither has occurred yet.

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 25.30% being the most likely. Probability: 25.30%

Let me analyze this systematically:

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Severe ongoing protests with at least 50 deaths reported
2. Young "Generation Z" protesters actively demanding Ruto's resignation (#RutoMustGo)
3. Opposition coalition Azimio rejecting recent government changes as "cosmetic"
4. Police brutality and violence escalating tensions
5. Economic crisis with high debt (70% of GDP) and failed budget measures
6. Analyst Declan Galvin suggests Ruto's recent cabinet reshuffling may worsen situation

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by:
- Withdrawing controversial 2024 budget bill
- Dismissing most cabinet members
- Appointing 11 new ministers
2. Some public support for his recent actions (per articles from July 12)
3. No immediate constitutional crisis
4. Military hasn't shown signs of turning against him
5. Opposition lacks constitutional means to remove him before October
6. Short timeframe (about 2.5 months) for change to occur

Analysis:
The situation is serious but Ruto has demonstrated adaptability by making significant concessions. While protests continue, his recent actions may help diffuse tensions. The timeframe is relatively short for a complete regime change without military intervention or constitutional crisis, neither of which appears imminent.

Historical Context:
Kenyan presidents have rarely been forced from office mid-term. Even during severe crises, they typically complete their terms.

Looking at the dynamics:
- Protests are serious but contained
- Ruto maintains institutional control
- Opposition lacks clear constitutional path to removal
- Time window is short

My Prediction: Between 15.20% and 35.40%, with 22.30% being the most likely. Probability: 22.30%

Key Factors Supporting Higher Probability:
1. Severe ongoing protests with at least 50 people killed according to Human Rights Commission
2. Widespread youth opposition (Generation Z) with #RutoMustGo trending
3. Police brutality allegations damaging legitimacy
4. Economic crisis with 70% debt-to-GDP ratio
5. Opposition coalition Azimio rejecting participation in expanded government
6. Recent cabinet dissolution and reshuffling suggesting instability
7. Analyst Declan Galvin suggests new appointments may worsen situation

Key Factors Supporting Lower Probability:
1. Ruto has shown flexibility by:
- Withdrawing controversial 2024 Finance Bill
- Dissolving and reforming cabinet
- Engaging in dialogue with opposition
2. Only ~2 months until resolution date
3. Military appears to still support government
4. No clear alternative leadership ready to take power
5. Constitutional mechanisms for removal are difficult
6. International community (US, EU) calling for stability
7. Some public support for recent reforms

Analysis:
While the situation is volatile with significant protests and economic challenges, several factors suggest Ruto is likely to survive until October:
1. He's demonstrated adaptability by reversing unpopular policies
2. Time window is relatively short
3. Institutional support remains intact
4. Constitutional removal would be difficult in this timeframe
5. No clear replacement leadership

However, the intensity of protests, police violence, and economic crisis create meaningful risks of forced resignation or unconstitutional removal.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 35.50%, with 25.50% being the most likely. Probability: 25.50%.
