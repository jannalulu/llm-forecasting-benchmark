Let me analyze this carefully:

1. Time Frame: We're looking at potential layoffs from now (Aug 27, 2024) until Oct 1, 2024 - approximately 35 days.

2. Company Context:
- Meta has had several rounds of layoffs in recent years, including major cuts in 2022 and 2023
- The company has been focused on efficiency and cost-cutting
- Meta has been investing heavily in AI and metaverse projects
- Recent financial performance has been relatively strong

3. Industry Context:
- Tech layoffs have continued in 2024 but at a slower pace than 2022-2023
- Economic conditions remain uncertain
- AI transformation is causing workforce restructuring across tech

4. Specific Considerations:
- The short timeframe (35 days) reduces the likelihood
- Meta's recent strong performance makes immediate large layoffs less likely
- However, ongoing AI transition could prompt targeted restructuring
- Meta has historically announced layoffs with some regularity
- The resolution criteria only requires TechCrunch to report it, and they're generally reliable with such coverage

Given these factors, I believe there's a moderate-low chance of reported layoffs in this short timeframe. The company's recent performance suggests stability, but ongoing industry changes and Meta's history of regular restructuring keep the possibility real.

My Prediction: Between 15.50% and 30.25%, with 22.75% being the most likely. Probability: 22.75%
