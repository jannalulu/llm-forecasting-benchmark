The atmosphere buzzes with excitement. A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
"So, did you see the results? Canada took the title!"

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(grinning)  
"Our models had it at 12.34%. Not bad for a second-seed group."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(rubbing chin)  
"Who would've thought? With Poland, Germany, and the USA out of the running, it was a wild card."

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(nodding)  
"Especially with new entrants like China and South Korea. But Canada’s consistency paid off."

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(sipping coffee)  
"A great reminder that even in Warhammer, the underdogs can rise."

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(typing)  
"Let’s update the models for next year. This changes everything."

The group exchanges knowing smiles, their fingers dancing over keyboards, ready to predict the next twist.

FADE OUT.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
(Sipping coffee) So, did you see the results? A country outside the usual giants actually won the WTC.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(Intrigued) Really? Which one?

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Singapore/Thailand. Our models had it at 0.75%.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(Laughs) That's incredible. I guess their strategy paid off.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Definitely. They were in seeding group 4, a real underdog. But their team synergy was unparalleled.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(Checks phone) I remember reading an article about their innovative tactics. It seems they caught everyone by surprise.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
Yeah, and with five new countries competing, it was bound to shake things up.

**SUPERFORECASTER 2**  
(Nods) It just goes to show, even with our models, there's always room for the unexpected.

**SUPERFORECASTER 1**  
True. It keeps the game exciting.

SUPERFORECASTER 2

SUPERFORECASTER 3

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
The news articles up to July 25th didn't hint at this. Italy was just a dark horse.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
And yet, here we are. A new champion from seeding group 2.
