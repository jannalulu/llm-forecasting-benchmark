INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sit around a table, their laptops open, displaying graphs and data.

JAMES  
(leaning back, confident)  
So, the question: On Sept 30, 2024, will more than 200 measles cases have been reported in the United States in 2024?

SARAH  
(nodding, reviewing notes)  
Our models had it at 92.75%. With 167 cases reported by July 15, the trend was clear.

DAVID  
(gesturing to his screen)  
Given the biweekly updates and the increasing travel, it was bound to tip over 200.

LUCY  
(skeptical, but agreeing)  
Even without new articles post-July, the data trajectory was undeniable.

JAMES  
(satisfied)  
It's fascinating. Our models never miss. A testament to refined probability forecasting.

They all nod, a shared understanding of their craft's precision. The room buzzes with the quiet hum of accurate predictions.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddles around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered.

JANE  
(leaning back, satisfied)  
Well, folks, the numbers are in. Our models had it at 92.35%.

TOM  
(nodding)  
Given the trend by July 15, with 167 cases already reported, it was almost inevitable.

SARAH  
(sipping coffee)  
Right. The CDC updates every two weeks. The trajectory was clear.

MIKE  
(looking at his screen)  
And with no major vaccination campaigns or policy changes reported by July 16, the risk factors remained high.

JANE  
(leaning forward)  
It's a reminder of how crucial timely interventions are. 

TOM  
(serious)  
Our models are never wrong. But the real victory is when our predictions help prevent these outcomes.

They all nod, the gravity of their work settling in.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS, gathered around a table, sips coffee and discusses the recent measles outbreak.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
So, the CDC numbers are in. As of yesterday, we’re at 198 cases for the year.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Close call. Our models had it at 92.75% that we’d surpass 200 by now.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Remember, back in July, we were at 167 cases. The biweekly updates made it tricky.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
True, but the summer travel season didn’t surge as much as expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Vaccination campaigns were more effective than anticipated.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yet, a couple more outbreaks could still tip the scale.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Our models accounted for that, but it seems containment efforts held strong.

They nod, contemplating the delicate balance between prediction and reality.
