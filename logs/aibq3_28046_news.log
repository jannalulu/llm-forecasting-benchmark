**China lithium prices hit new low on macro concerns, surging supplies**
China's lithium futures fell to a new low on Friday due to surging supplies and worsening macro-economic sentiment. The most-traded November lithium carbonate futures on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange hit 69,700 yuan (USD 9,835.74) per ton, the lowest since its launch last July. Analysts attributed the decline to worsened macro-sentiment, with data showing weakness in manufacturing activities in the US and China, and rapidly growing lithium output. State-backed research house Antaike forecast a near 200,000 tons of lithium resources supply surplus globally this year. Zhang Weixin, an analyst at China Futures, said that higher demand in September and October may give the market some support, but possible further falls in the fourth quarter cannot be ruled out.

**[SMM Analysis] August LiPF6 Price Change Analysis**
In August 2024, the price of lithium carbonate, a key raw material in the battery industry, experienced a slight decline. The price of battery-grade lithium carbonate dropped by 8.7% from 81,700 yuan/mt to 74,600 yuan/mt, while the price of industrial-grade lithium carbonate fell by 8.4% from 76,750 yuan/mt to 70,300 yuan/mt. This decline led to a reduction in LiPF6 prices, which dropped by 5.6% from 57,150 yuan/mt to 53,950 yuan/mt. Although prices declined at the beginning of August, the market saw slight fluctuations in the middle to late month, reflecting market uncertainty about future demand and the cautious attitude of producers towards price adjustments. The future price trend remains uncertain due to the global economic situation and changes in industry supply and demand.

**Argentina's Lithium Mining Sector Faces Challenges Amid Price Drop**
The Argentine mining sector, particularly the lithium extraction industry, is facing a complex scenario due to the significant drop in international prices of this mineral. Despite this, several mining companies have decided to recalibrate their projects in the country in response to a market stabilization. Currently, a ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) is priced at $10,483, less than a third of what it was worth a year ago and far from the peak of $80,909 registered in November 2022. This price drop is mainly due to an excess of supply and moderation in electric vehicle sales, whose production relies heavily on lithium for batteries. In response to this unfavorable scenario, mining companies have implemented strategies to reduce costs and ensure the viability of their projects. For example, Argosy Minerals, an Australian company, suspended certain operations and restructured its team at its Rincón project in Salta, seeking to reduce financial risks. Similarly, Galan Lithium decided to slow down the construction of its project in Catamarca, while Lake Resources opted to reduce costs and sell non-essential assets in Jujuy and Catamarca to focus on its Kachi project. On the other hand, Arcadium Lithium, resulting from the merger between the Australian Allkem and the US-based Livent, announced that it will postpone investments in its Sal de Vida project in Catamarca, prioritizing a sequential expansion over a parallel one, with the goal of maintaining a prudent financial focus, as said, 'We are taking a cautious approach to ensure the long-term viability of our projects.'

**Liontown shares at 52-week lows as lithium slump extends further**
Liontown Resources Ltd (ASX: LTR) shares have plummeted to 52-week lows, trading at 77 cents apiece, due to the lithium market slump. The spot price of lithium carbonate has dropped to CNY73,500, its lowest level in three years, caused by a supply glut and high input costs. Analysts at Bell Potter and Goldman Sachs see potential for a rebound, with a speculative buy rating and a price target of $1.90 per share, suggesting a 147% upside potential. However, the high level of risk associated with Liontown shares is acknowledged, given the volatile nature of the lithium market and the project's early stage of development. Liontown's Managing Director and CEO, Tony Ottaviano, is bullish about the company's rapid progression and transition to production.

**Citi hikes short-term lithium price forecast but also sees gains fading (NYSEARCA:LIT)**
Citi analysts have raised their short-term price forecast for lithium carbonate to $14K/metric ton and hydroxide to $14.2K/ton, citing investor demand to cover short positions. However, they expect the rally to fade over the next 6-12 months as higher prices may trigger a supply response, potentially leading to a loosening of lithium balances. This comes after lithium futures surged 9% and lithium miner share prices spiked following reports that China's CATL, the world's largest battery producer, was suspending a mine that accounts for 5%-6% of global supply. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights analyst Alice Yu, 'There is a stronger signaling effect from CATL's cut,' as the mine's suspension reinforces the expectation of a prolonged weakness in downstream demand.

**ASX lithium shares could be set for a bull run if this 25% forecast is right**
ASX lithium shares are rising despite the lithium carbonate price being at three-year lows. A new forecast from Citi predicts a 20% to 25% rise in lithium commodity prices over the next two to three months due to supply curtailments from CATL's lepidolite mines. Citi analyst Kate McCutcheon said, 'We expect investors, both inside and outside of China, to cover their shorts over the coming weeks on the back of recent supply curtailments from CATL's lepidolite cuts, inventory drawdowns, and seasonal peak demand.' Citi has lifted its 0 to 3-month price targets for lithium to $US14,000 per tonne for carbonate and $US14,200 per tonne for hydroxide. However, the longer-term view on lithium prices remains uncertain due to the persistent oversupply of lithium in 2023 and 2024.

**Lithium: Producer Shares Rally on High-Cost Supply Cut**
Lithium stocks rallied after battery producer CATL announced plans to cut lithium production at its lepidolite-based mines in China due to low prices. This marks one of the first major supply cuts in 2024, and the news sent China lithium carbonate futures and spot prices higher. The market is currently oversupplied, with prices falling to $10,500 per metric ton from a recent peak of $78,000 in November 2022. Analysts at Morningstar view US-listed lithium producers as undervalued, with Albemarle and Lithium Argentina being their top picks. They estimate that lepidolite-based producers are losing money at current prices and will likely be cut until prices rise to a breakeven level of $20,000 per metric ton. As demand continues to grow while supply growth slows, Morningstar sees a higher lithium price upside in the coming years.

**Argentina's Lithium Production Rises, But Prices Fall**
Argentina's lithium production grew 56% year-over-year in July, but companies in the sector are concerned about the sharp decline in international lithium prices, which have fallen to $10,483 per ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), down from $80,909 in November 2022. The decline in prices can be attributed to an oversupply and lower demand for electric vehicles globally, as well as China's elimination of subsidies for electric car purchases. Despite this, the government and foreign miners remain optimistic about the sector, with ongoing investment in lithium projects. For example, Posco, a South Korean company, is investing $2 billion in the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Salta, while Eramine Sudamérica, in partnership with Tsingshan, is opening the first lithium mine in the Centenario-Ratones salar and plans to invest an additional $800 million in a second installation. Ganfeng, a Chinese company and leader in battery production, is also considering an investment of $1 billion in its Mariana project in the Llullaillaco salar.

**Against the Grain: Lithium's down but these industry captains are playing the long game**
Despite lithium prices falling nearly 70% over the past year, large investors such as Tolga Kumova and Gina Rinehart continue to back companies in the sector, taking a long-term view on future demand. According to John So, co-founder of VP Capital, lithium prices have found a bottom, with commodity prices trading near the marginal cost of production. So predicts that lithium prices will not retest the highs of US$5,000/t plus spodumene prices or US$30,000/t plus lithium carbonate prices any time soon. However, he believes that there will be green shoots in the second half of FY25, with lithium commodity prices finding firmer footing. So also notes that companies are positioning themselves for medium-term access to the lithium market, with M&A deals continuing to take place. 'Companies are positioning themselves for medium-term access to the lithium market,' So said. 'At double digit compound EV growth, by the end of the decade it will not be surprising if EV demand has more than doubled.'

**Lithium prices will likely stabilise on demand-supply balance**
Lithium prices have dropped by over 20% this year, but analysts say the demand-supply balance may help them stabilize. According to Trading Economics, lithium prices have declined by 21,500 Chinese yuan ($3,022) a tonne since the start of 2024. The commodity had soared to a record high of 5.75 million yuan ($808,299) in December 2022. The Australian Office of the Chief Economist (AOCE) said the rise in global lithium supply will see the lithium market remain in surplus. 'Chinese lithium lepidolite production has seen only modest declines despite falls in prices, and there are sizeable project pipelines in Australia and among emerging producers such as Argentina and Zimbabwe,' it said. The AOCE also said that the lithium sector overcapacity has emerged due to slowing growth in EV sales and a wave of investment in lithium production spurred on by the high prices of 2022. BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, forecasts that lithium prices will remain below 2022-2023 highs in 2024-2025 due to a rapidly expanding global lithium supply that has pushed the lithium market into surplus. 'We forecast Chinese lithium carbonate 99.5 per cent to average $15,500/tonne in 2024 and Chinese lithium hydroxide monohydrate 56.5 per cent at $14,000/tonne in 2024,' said BMI in its outlook.

**[SMM Analysis] Ternary cathode material prices fell in August, will they continue to fall in September?**
In August, the prices of ternary cathode materials continued to fall, with the price of 6-series monocrystal/power type dropping from 130,000 yuan/mt at the beginning of the month to 125,000 yuan/mt, a decrease of 5,000 yuan/mt. This decline was mainly due to fluctuations in raw material prices, particularly a 7,400 yuan/mt drop in battery-grade lithium carbonate and a 6,000 yuan/mt drop in battery-grade lithium hydroxide. However, with the stabilization and rebound of lithium carbonate and nickel sulphate prices, and the expected growth in demand for ternary cathode materials due to the increasing penetration rate of NEVs, it is expected that the prices of ternary cathode materials will slow their decline and remain stable in September. As one analyst noted, 'The recovery in demand and the stabilization and rebound of raw material prices will provide some support for ternary cathode material prices in September.'

**Argentina's Lithium Exports Could Reach $10,000 Million in 2027**
Argentina's Minister of Mining, Luis Lucero, stated that 'the lithium projects require capital expenditures of over $8 billion to initiate operations, while the five main copper projects require $20 billion to initiate production'. According to Lucero, 'Argentina is promoting investments in the mining sector, which has a previously underexploited potential, to boost exports and generate the foreign exchange needed. With lithium and copper, the country has a significant opportunity to become a supplier in the international trade of these metals. 'Lithium will become the country's main export mineral. Argentina has the conditions to surpass 200,000 tons of LCE production between late 2025 and early 2026, and thus approach the third position of lithium-producing countries', he said to Reuters. The growth of LCE production could increase from the current 136,500 tons to 200,000 tons between late 2025 and early 2026.' According to a report by the Chilean Ministry of Mining in conjunction with S&P Global, EIA, and Wood Mackenzie, the average price of lithium carbonate will increase gradually to $15,950/ton in the fourth quarter of 2024 and $16,450/ton in 2025. For the long-term period 2029-2033, the average price will reach $18,280. The decline in prices was due to a series of factors, including the decline in sales of electric vehicles, countries with the most relevant automotive markets began to end or reduce subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles, the increase in purchases of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and the reduction of lithium inventories by purchasing companies, which has limited the purchase of larger volumes, and a greater supply of lithium in the market due to the entry into operation of new projects. ' The prices of lithium carbonate and hydroxide showed a strong increase from the second half of 2021 to the end of 2022, reaching quotations close to $70,000/ton. The strong increase in price in those years was caused by the growth of electric vehicle production and the expectations that the supply would not be sufficient to meet demand. However, the excess supply given the start-up of new projects was a variable that equally negatively pressured the prices of lithium in 2023 and 2024. For this year, a global demand of 1,129,000 tons (LCE) is projected. It is expected to reach 1,404,000 tons (LCE) in 2025, with a growth of 22.7% and 52.6% compared to 2023, mainly due to the demand for batteries used in electric vehicles.', he said. ' According to a report, the global demand for lithium is expected to increase from 1,129,000 tons in 2024 to 1,404,000 tons in 2025, with a growth of 22.7% and 52.6% compared to 2023, mainly due to the demand for batteries used in electric vehicles.'

**Argentina's Lithium Industry Faces Challenges Amid Global Price Drop**
The international prices of lithium have fallen sharply, causing concern in Argentina's mining industry. Currently, a ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) is priced at $10,483, less than a third of its value a year ago and far from the peak of $80,909 recorded in November 2022. Despite this, several mining companies have decided to adjust their projects in the country in response to a stabilization of the market. Of the 50 active lithium projects in Argentina - only four are in production and six are under construction - many have been impacted by the drastic reduction in lithium prices. The price drop is mainly due to an excess of supply and moderation in the sales of electric vehicles, whose production relies heavily on lithium for batteries. In response to this adverse scenario for the lithium industry, mining companies have begun to implement cost-cutting strategies to ensure the viability of their projects. Despite the difficult current context, companies in the sector remain optimistic about the long-term outlook. Paul Graves, president and CEO of Arcadium Lithium, stated, 'I expect a strong growth trajectory for lithium demand over the long term' and anticipates that the market will return to healthier fundamentals over time. Fernando Zevallos Sulca, senior analyst at CRU, noted that the robust investments in Argentina, although facing delays, will not be canceled. According to his estimates, lithium production in Argentina could compete with Chile's in the next decade, provided that the current projects secure adequate financing.

**Argentina's Lithium Exports Fall 35% in First Half of Year**
Argentina's lithium exports fell 35% in the first half of the year, totaling $272 million. This is a significant drop from the record high achieved in the same period last year. However, the quantities exported in the year-to-date increased by 62.4%. In June, $40 million worth of lithium was exported, a 14.2% decrease from the previous year. The mineral accounted for 15% of the country's total mineral exports in June. 'This interannual decline in export value was explained by a decrease in export prices,' said a report from the Ministry of Mining. The price of a ton of battery-grade lithium carbonate has fallen to $10,483, less than a third of its value a year ago and far from the peak of $80,909 in November 2022. The decline is due to an excess of supply and moderation in electric vehicle sales, which have lithium as a key component. In the same month, gold exports fell 11.4% and silver exports fell 30.2% due to a decrease in volumes. In the first six months of the year, mineral exports totaled $1.519 billion, a 4% increase from the same period last year. Gold accounted for 67% of the total, silver 13%, and the rest of the minerals 2%. This allowed the sector to represent 81.7% of the country's total mineral exports. In the first six months of 2024, gold showed a 19.5% increase in export volumes, while silver fell 38.7%.

**Lithium Producers Adjust Projects in Argentina Amid Price Decline**
The decline in international prices of lithium has led mining companies in Argentina to adjust their projects. Currently, a ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) grade battery is priced at US$ 10,483.00, less than a third of its value a year ago and far from the historical high of US$ 80,909.00 in November 2022. The decrease in prices is attributed to an excess of lithium supply and a moderation in electric vehicle sales, whose main component in batteries is lithium. This context has affected the 50 lithium initiatives in Argentina, of which only four are in production and six are under construction. Fernando Zevallos Sulca, senior analyst at the British consultancy CRU, stated that the increase in lithium production over the past few years, encouraged by the explosive price increase at the beginning of the decade, has resulted in a 250% increase in global production over the past three years. This imbalance between supply and demand has negatively impacted the income of producers, who are now focusing on generating cash and reducing costs to maintain financial stability. Companies such as Argosy Minerals, Galan Lithium, and Lake Resources have announced measures to reduce costs, adjust their staff, and sell non-essential assets. Despite the situation, companies in the sector have expressed their intention to continue investing in Argentina, although with possible delays in their original plans. Argentina, which has tripled its lithium production capacity over the past two years, is currently the world's fourth-largest producer of this mineral, behind Australia, Chile, and China. Zevallos Sulca predicts that production in Argentina will continue to grow and could compete with Chile's in the next decade, provided that the current projects can obtain the necessary financing, estimated at between US$ 3,500 and 4,000 million.

**Argentina's Lithium Projects Recalibrate Amid Price Collapse**
Several mining companies have had to recalibrate their lithium projects in Argentina due to the collapse of international prices. However, they remain confident in a future market stabilization and reaffirm their long-term investments in the South American country. The 50 lithium projects in Argentina, with only four in production and six under construction, have been affected by the decline in the price of 'white gold'. The price of one ton of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) grade battery currently stands at $10,483, less than a third of what it was a year ago and far from the peak of $80,909 in November 2022. Fernando Zevallos Sulca, senior analyst at CRU, a British consulting firm specializing in mineral, metal, and fertilizer markets, explains that the drop is due to an excess of lithium supply and moderation in electric vehicle sales, whose batteries rely heavily on lithium. 'The explosive increase in lithium carbonate prices at the beginning of the decade encouraged massive investment in lithium projects. Lithium production increased 2.5 times in three years,' Zevallos Sulca says. In this scenario of imbalance between supply and demand, the price drop affects all producers. 'In the face of falling income, companies prioritize generating cash and cutting costs to maintain a healthy balance and be able to overcome current challenges. Of course, this also applies to projects in Argentina,' Zevallos Sulca notes. Several companies, such as Argosy Minerals, Galan Lithium, and Lake Resources, have taken measures to reduce costs and risks, including suspending operations and restructuring their teams. However, they remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for lithium demand and expect a return to more stable market fundamentals. 'Investments robust, which abound in Argentina, will not be canceled, but we will see delays and postponents with respect to the plans announced previously,' Zevallos Sulca observes. Argentina, which has tripled its capacity to produce lithium in the past two years, is the world's fourth-largest lithium producer (after Australia, Chile, and China), the third-largest in reserves (after Chile and Australia), and the second-largest in resources (after Bolivia). 'Our forecast is that production in Argentina will increase and compete with Chile's in the next decade. Of course, this assumes that current projects are financed, which would require between $3,500 and $4,000 million,' Zevallos Sulca says. The sector highlights Argentina's geological characteristics and the new regime of incentives for large investments (RIGI) as attractive for lithium development. Several companies, including Posco, Ganfeng, Eramine, and Rio Tinto, have expressed their intention to take advantage of the RIGI for their planned investments in lithium.

**Chile's Lithium Industry: A Window of Opportunity**
Chile remains the top lithium producer in South America, with 271,000 tons of LCE in 2023, and second globally behind Australia. The price of lithium carbonate dropped significantly in 2023 and 2024, reaching $12,000/ton (CIF Asia) in late July, due to lower sales of electric vehicles, a surplus in the market for 2024 and 2025, and reduced subsidies for electric vehicle purchases. However, long-term projections (2029-2033) indicate prices could reach $18,280. Despite this, demand projections are positive, with the market continuing to grow and global lithium demand expected to increase. It is essential to not only maintain our market position but also do so efficiently, as projected prices require a significant focus on production costs. The National Lithium Strategy's efforts must be evaluated to ensure they meet both goals. The SQM-Corfo agreement, including identifying the real extent of Tianqi's resistance and its implications for production plans, and advances in other salares, must align with global market trends. We cannot afford to miss opportunities, as a price drop of over $50,000/ton from one year to the next has shown that windows of opportunity can close quickly.

**Lithium Price Drop Affects Salta Province: Experts Predict Recovery**
The recent international price drop of lithium is having a significant impact on the province of Salta, where mining projects in the exploration phase have been paralyzed or slowed down. Service providers related to lithium mining reported a 50% decrease in their activity, according to data from one of the chambers that groups them. The price of lithium carbonate grade battery (LCE) fell significantly from over $80,000 per ton in late 2022 to around $11,650 per ton. This drop was driven by an excess of supply in the market and a moderate demand for electric vehicles, especially in China, one of the world's main consumers of lithium. Despite the current situation, Flavia Royón, executive secretary of the Lithium Table and former Secretary of Mining of the Nation, expressed an optimistic perspective. Royón highlighted that electrification and the transition to renewable energies are long-term trends. 'Lithium will continue to be demanded in the future,' she assured. 'Although the price is low now, the demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage batteries will remain sustained. So, I believe that in two or three years, we will see a recovery,' she added. Royón also emphasized that the lithium produced in northern Argentina is 'sustainable and competitive' because it comes from brine.

**Lithium Price Drop Affects Salta, Argentina, but Experts Remain Optimistic**
The recent drop in the international price of lithium has affected Salta, Argentina, causing a slowdown in mining projects in the exploration phase. Service providers have seen a 50% decrease in activity, according to a representative of the local chamber. The price of lithium has been declining since last year, with the price of a ton of lithium carbonate for battery-grade (LCE) reaching over $80,000 at the end of 2022 and currently standing at $11,650. Despite this, Flavia Royón, executive secretary of the Lithium Mesa, remains optimistic, saying, 'Many analysts suggest that while the price is low today, lithium will continue to be in demand in the future.' She believes that the electrification and energy transition are a reality, and that demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage batteries will remain strong. Royón also notes that the lithium produced in northern Argentina is 'sustainable and competitive because it comes from brine.' The president of the Salta Mining Chamber, Simón Pérez Alsina, also remains optimistic about the future of the industry, saying, 'It's a small market, but we believe that lithium will be valuable in the future. We're in a bad cycle now, but we think it will pass soon.'

**Global lithium prices to become attractive again despite surplus**
Global lithium prices are expected to become attractive again by 2030, despite a surplus in production this year and next. According to Juan Esteban Fuentes, a market expert at consultancy Benchmark, 'Production will increase between 2026-27, with a surplus expected in 2028-29, followed by a deficit in 2030, causing prices to rise from US$14,000/t to US$36,000/t and then to average US$25,000/t in subsequent years.' The supply shortage is expected to result from increased manufacturing of electromobility batteries and other downstream products in China, driven by the global energy transition. This year, global lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) production will reach 1.25Mt, with a surplus of 117,000t, and next year, 1.59Mt will be produced with a surplus of 191,000t. Demand is predicted to reach 1.13Mt this year and 1.40Mt next year. The number of lithium operations has increased from 20 in eight countries to 62 in 14, with 80 projects expected by the end of the year. China, Australia, and Argentina will contribute around 700,000t/y LCE, according to Fuentes.

**Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile: Falling Knife Still Worth Catching (NYSE:SQM)**
Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) has seen a significant decline in lithium prices, reaching almost $10K per MT, a spectacular collapse from the highs of over $80K per MT in late 2022. Despite this, SQM's management remains optimistic, citing the company's low-cost position and operational efficiencies as key advantages. SQM has not slashed CapEx or curtailed its production capacity, unlike its arch-rival Albemarle Corporation, and instead aims to capitalize on the industry's pullback to gain more share. The company sees the opportunity to produce 210K MT of lithium in 2024, even though it anticipates selling about 190K MT. SQM's decision to ramp production is sensible, according to the author, as it aims to shake out the higher-cost producers as they cut back. The secular growth drivers in the EV landscape have not shifted, and SQM's operating performance could bottom in Q2, suggesting a more optimistic outlook ahead. The author downgrades SQM's rating to 'Buy' due to the significant uncertainties and challenges afflicting SQM and its more aggressive approach.

**Chile's Lithium Production to Reach 275,000 Tons in 2023, Global Market in Surplus**
Chile is expected to reach 275,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (CLE) in 2023, with sustained production growth and a global market in surplus. According to the Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco), Chile will produce 275,000 tons of CLE in 2023 and 285,000 tons in 2025. In 2023, the country produced 270,947 tons of CLE, a 4.3% increase from the previous year. Cochilco notes that Chile is the second-largest lithium producer in the world, behind Australia. The global market is expected to have a surplus of 117,000 tons of CLE in 2023, increasing to 191,000 tons in 2025. Cochilco expects demand to remain strong due to the growth of electromobility, but warns that the number of projects starting production in the next two years will lead to a supply surplus. The entity has also observed a significant decline in lithium prices, attributed to a slowdown in electric vehicle sales and an increase in supply. As a result, some companies, particularly in Australia, have reduced production and improved operational efficiency to reduce costs and protect their profit margins. Cochilco notes that 'producers have taken cost-reduction measures to mitigate the expected impact on profitability, and several have reduced expansions, even while completing some projects.' According to Cochilco, the price of lithium carbonate is expected to increase gradually, reaching $15,950 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $16,450 in 2025, while the price of lithium hydroxide is expected to reach $16,360 and $17,900 in the same years, respectively.

**SQM's Lithium Sales Decline Due to Price Drop**
SQM, a Chilean mining company, has seen a significant decline in its profits due to the drop in lithium prices. In the first half of 2024, the company lost US$ 653 million, but then made a profit of US$ 213 million in the second quarter, which is 63% less than the same period in 2023.

**SQM Reports 63% Decline in Profit Due to Lithium Price Drop**
SQM, the second-largest lithium producer in the world, reported a 63% decline in profit in the second quarter due to a decline in the price of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries. Despite selling a record 52,300 tons of lithium between April and June, the average price per ton was $12,700, a 62.6% decline from the previous year. SQM's CEO, Ricardo Ramos, stated that the trend of low prices is expected to continue in the second half of the year, with lithium prices in China being 20% lower than the average price observed in the second quarter of 2024. Ramos also mentioned that some lithium producers may reduce their production due to the low prices making projects economically unviable. SQM is maintaining its production estimate of 210,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in Chile and China, and expects its sales volumes in the second semester to be similar to those reported in the first semester of 2024. The company is reevaluating specific markets and initiatives that may be 'less attractive in the short term under these conditions.' SQM is expected to invest $1.6 billion this year. Its competitor, Albemarle, has announced cost-cutting measures after registering losses in the second quarter.

**Chile Maintains Lead in Lithium Production Despite Falling Prices**
Chile remains the leading producer of lithium in South America and the second-largest producer globally, behind Australia, according to Cochilco. The country produced 270,947 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2023, with projections of 275,000 and 285,000 tons for this and next year. However, lithium prices have fallen due to lower demand for electric vehicles, increased production, and reduced purchasing volumes. Exports of lithium have also decreased, with key markets being China, South Korea, and Japan. Cochilco forecasts that the average price of lithium carbonate in the Asian market will be $16,450 per ton in 2025. 'The market of electric vehicles and the high expectations that were not met are behind this fall in prices,' said Cochilco. 'The sales of electric vehicles have been lower than expected, and countries with the most relevant markets have started to end or reduce subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles.'

**Liontown shares at 52-week lows as lithium slump extends further**
Liontown Resources Ltd (ASX: LTR) shares have plummeted to 52-week lows, trading at 77 cents apiece, due to the lithium market slump. The spot price of lithium carbonate has dropped to CNY73,500, its lowest level in three years, caused by a supply glut and high input costs. Analysts at Bell Potter and Goldman Sachs see potential for a rebound, with a speculative buy rating and a price target of $1.90 per share, suggesting a 147% upside potential. However, the high level of risk associated with Liontown shares is acknowledged, given the volatile nature of the lithium market and the project's early stage of development. Liontown's Managing Director and CEO, Tony Ottaviano, is bullish about the company's rapid progression and transition to production.

**Scotiabank Maintains 'Outperform' Rating on Lithium Argentina Shares, Reduces Price Target**
Scotiabank has maintained its 'Outperform' rating on Lithium Argentina (NYSE: LAAC) shares, but reduced the price target to $4.25 from $8.00. The adjustment comes despite the company's operational progress in its Cauchari project, where it is increasing its annual production of 40,000 metric tons (tm) of lithium carbonate. Lithium Argentina is on track to produce between 20,000 and 25,000 tm in 2024. The Cauchari plant is currently operating at 70% of its capacity, with a production of 5,600 tm in the second quarter. The majority of this production was sold to Ganfeng at spot prices adjusted for VAT and transformation costs of approximately $2,000 per ton. Additionally, the project is generating a positive cash flow, excluding working capital, even with current low spot prices for lithium. Scotiabank highlighted the company's cost management as effective, with costs in cash being higher than spot prices at the beginning of the year, but now having the potential to reduce costs below $10,000 per ton. This is considered an encouraging sign for the company's financial health and operational efficiency. Furthermore, the company's operating entity, Exar, has $315 million of debt linked to the US dollar that matures in the next 18 months, which is currently being refinanced to obtain better conditions. As part of a broader reevaluation within the lithium sector, Scotiabank has also revised its long-term price forecast for lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) to $18,000 per tm, which has influenced the new net asset value (NAV) at a 10% discount rate of $4.25. This NAV corresponds to 6 times the estimated EBITDA for 2025 of $138 million. Currently, the company's shares are trading at 0.6 times the NAV10%. The 'Outperform' rating for Lithium Argentina is based on the successful implementation of a positive asset and the valuation of the share, despite current market challenges. In recent news, Lithium Argentina has maintained a positive cash flow in the face of current market challenges, thanks to its operational efficiency in the Cauchari production plant. The plant is currently operating at 70% of its capacity of 40,000 tons per year, exceeding the projections established by TD Cowen. The firm has maintained its 'Buy' rating on Lithium Argentina shares with a price target of $5.00, reflecting the company's resistance to the decline in product prices. The company's focus on reducing operational costs through optimization processes has been a significant factor in its financial performance. These efforts are part of Lithium Argentina's strategy to maintain a positive cash flow. It is expected that the company will provide a more detailed development update later in the year. In the short term, it is expected that the Cauchari plant will continue its operations, generating a positive cash flow. This is a notable achievement considering the decline in lithium product prices. The reiteration of the 'Buy' rating by TD Cowen suggests an expectation of continued operational and financial success for Lithium Argentina as it moves towards large-scale production. These are recent developments in the company's trajectory.

**Lithium Production Doubles in a Year, Driven by Electric Vehicle Demand**
The production of lithium doubled in the last year, with 6,070 tons of lithium carbonate produced in June, a 102% increase from the same month in 2023. The demand for lithium is driven by the growth of the electric vehicle market, with major mining consortia announcing significant investments. However, the increased production has led to a decline in the price of lithium, from $70,000 per ton in 2022 to $12,000 per ton currently. As one expert noted, 'The market is experiencing a correction, but the long-term outlook for lithium remains positive.'

**SMM Analysis On China July LMO Production And August Forecast**
According to SMM data, China's LMO output in July 2024 was 9,294 mt, down 4.10% MoM and 7.73% YoY. The decline in LMO production was attributed to the prolonged drop in lithium carbonate spot prices, intense market competition, and heavy market pessimism. Producers reduced their production and shipment volumes due to the combined impact of raw materials and demand. It is expected that the LMO overcapacity situation will remain difficult to alleviate in August, with continued market competition. However, a slight increase in downstream procurement demand may drive a small rebound in scheduled production, resulting in an estimated total output of 9,897 mt, down 6.49% MoM and 23.08% YoY. 'The overall market environment will remain sluggish,' as stated by SMM.

Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp. (LAAC) has announced its second quarter 2024 results. The company's President and CEO, Sam Pigott, stated, 'We are very pleased with the ramp up progress that has been made at Caucharí-Olaroz in recent months.' The operation has achieved around 70% capacity on a sustained basis and has hit record monthly production in each of the last three months. The company produced approximately 5,600 tonnes of lithium carbonate, up 24% from the first quarter of 2024. The realized pricing is based on China battery-grade spot market prices adjusted for VAT and approximately $2,000 per tonne of additional processing costs required to reduce trace levels of impurities to achieve battery quality specifications. The company has $96M in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $75M credit facility with Ganfeng. The company is planning to use a portion of the $70M proceeds from the Pastos Grandes Transaction to provide over $100M in additional liquidity to reduce leverage at Exar.

**Is Albemarle Stock a Buy After Earnings?**
Albemarle's (ALB) stock is undervalued, but low lithium prices are slowing growth plans. Morningstar reduced its fair value estimate to $225 per share from $275 after Albemarle's second-quarter earnings report. Lithium prices are currently around $12,700 per metric ton, down from $75,000 at the end of 2022, due to slowing lithium purchases after inventory destocking. However, demand growth remains strong, and prices are expected to rise in 2025. Albemarle has a cost advantage in lithium carbonate production due to its brine assets in Chile, but the company's second-quarter results reflected the lithium price decline, with adjusted EBITDA plummeting 70% versus the prior-year quarter. Management has announced further capital expenditure reductions and cost-cutting initiatives. Albemarle faces risks including volatile lithium prices, execution risk in ramping up lithium production, and political risk in Chile, where the government has announced plans to nationalize lithium.

**Albemarle: Tough Road Ahead (NYSE:ALB)**
Albemarle Corporation's (ALB) stock has been affected by the decline in lithium prices, which have fallen to $11/kg, a level not seen since March 2021. The company's EBITDA guidance remains unchanged, but free cash flow is negative due to the $1.75 billion capex plan. Analysts expect lithium carbonate prices to recover to $15-$20/kg by 2028, but this may not be enough to generate positive free cash flow for Albemarle. The company's preferred shares are no longer attractive compared to the common shares, and holders risk having their dividend paid in stock rather than cash and converting to commons at a low price on the 3/1/2027 maturity date. Albemarle's low-cost resources and flexibility to produce both lithium hydroxide and carbonate give it an advantage over other players, but the company still faces challenges in the current lithium pricing environment.

**BMO Capital Markets Lowers Price Target for Arcadium Lithium**
BMO Capital Markets has reduced its price target for Arcadium Lithium PLC (NYSE: ALTM) to $3.50 from $4.25, while maintaining a 'Market Perform' rating. The adjustment comes after the company's second-quarter results met expectations, but also included news of the Galaxy project being halted and the Sal de Vida project experiencing delays. Despite these setbacks, the company is expected to increase its capital expenditures by $85-90 million in 2024. BMO Capital's cautious optimism is based on the potential for lithium market price recovery. The new price target is based on approximately 8 times the company's estimated enterprise value for 2025 relative to EBITDA, assuming a market price recovery. This valuation also includes a projected increase of over 25% in lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) volumes for 2025. The analyst noted that while their estimates have increased, the consensus for the second half of 2024 may be too optimistic unless there is a significant increase in lithium market prices. This opinion is maintained despite the company's expectations of a modest recovery in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company's financial results in the second half of 2024 will be more exposed to market price fluctuations than in the first half, according to BMO Capital. The price target of $3.50 takes into account the challenges and opportunities that the company will face as it navigates the market dynamics and project evolution.

**Arcadium Lithium Releases Second Quarter 2024 Results By Investing.com**
Arcadium Lithium released its second quarter 2024 results, showing a slight increase in total volumes, but a decline in average realized pricing due to lower market prices for lithium chemicals. The company is focusing on leveraging its low-cost, high-quality operational footprint and securing long-term contracts with strategic customers to navigate market fluctuations. Arcadium Lithium is expecting to deliver cost savings of $80 million in 2024, primarily through organizational restructuring, operating and logistics savings, and the elimination of third-party services. The company is accelerating further cost reduction initiatives and has paused investment in its 40,000 metric ton spodumene Galaxy project. Arcadium Lithium is also revisiting the sequencing of its combined 25,000 metric ton lithium carbonate projects at the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina. The company plans to spend approximately $ less over the next 24 months and is preparing for an upcoming Investor Day in September.

**[SMM Analysis] China's Lithium Carbonate Imports in June 2024 Released**
China's lithium carbonate imports in June 2024 decreased by 20.3% month-over-month to approximately 19,600 mt, with an average import price of around $12,309/mt. Chile and Argentina remained the main sources of imports, accounting for 79.9% and 17.5% of the total, respectively. Argentina recently announced the expansion of four major lithium mines, which may increase the volume of lithium carbonate exports to China and potentially capture part of Chile's market share. Shanghai was the largest customs clearance destination for China's lithium carbonate imports, accounting for 61.7% of the total.

**Argentina Reduces Reference Price for Lithium Carbonate Export by 80%**
The Argentine government has reduced the reference price for the export of lithium carbonate by 80%, from $53 per kilogram in May 2022 to $11 per kilogram currently. This decision follows the sharp decline in international lithium prices, driven by decreased demand for electric vehicles in China and Tesla. The new prices will be effective from July 23, 2024, and will apply to three types of lithium carbonate with different purity levels. The measure aims to improve the selectivity of the value system and detect deviations from usual prices for similar products.

**Argentina Reduces Reference Value for Lithium Carbonate Export**
The Argentine government has reduced the reference value for exporting lithium carbonate by 80% to $11 per kilogram, following a sharp decline in international prices. The new values are intended to improve the system of selectivity in value, detecting deviations from usual prices for identical or similar goods. The resolution also established new prices for three positions of lithium carbonate, depending on quality, and set the effective date of the new prices as the second business day after publication in the Official Gazette. The price of lithium has fallen due to decreased demand for electric vehicles in China and Tesla, the main US manufacturer. Argentina is not immune to this international framework, but recently inaugurated its fourth lithium production plant, tripling its production capacity to over 136,000 tons per year.

**Lithium Prices Recover in China Amid Concerns Over Chile Earthquake**
The price of lithium carbonate futures in China recovered today due to concerns about supply disruptions after a significant earthquake in Chile, a major lithium-producing region. The November lithium carbonate futures contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange rose 2.9%, to 89,800 yuan (US$12,356.89) per metric ton, after falling to a seven-month low in the previous session. The 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Chile, near the Atacama Desert, which contains 90% of the country's lithium reserves and is a vital source of lithium chemical imports for China. The tremor raised concerns about supply restrictions, potentially impacting the global lithium market. Despite the price increase, broader concerns about lithium demand continue to emerge. Market sentiment was affected by the possibility of Donald Trump's success in the next US presidential election, as he has promised to dismantle many of President Joe Biden's climate change initiatives, including those promoting electric vehicles (EVs). The growing surplus contributed to the decline in lithium prices, which reached a peak in November 2022. The latest CRU forecast predicts a global surplus of 90,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent for the current year. Amid this market dynamics, Chinese lithium producers Ganfeng Lithium and Tianqi Lithium signaled potential losses for the first half of the year due to the decline in lithium product prices. As the market adjusts to the changing conditions, the impact of the Chilean earthquake on lithium prices in the long term is yet to be seen.

**Argentina Reduces Lithium Carbonate Export Price by 80%**
The Argentine government has reduced the reference price for the export of lithium carbonate by 80%, from $53 per kilogram in May 2022 to $11 per kilogram on average, in line with the sharp decline in international prices. The new prices are 'precautionary' and aim to improve the system of selectivity in value, detecting deviations from usual prices for identical or similar goods. The measure was taken after the intervention of the Director of Legislation and the Subdirector of Technical Legal Affairs. The new prices will come into effect from July 23rd. Lithium is a key component in the production of electric vehicle batteries and is also used in pharmaceuticals and other industries. The price of lithium has been affected by the decline in demand for electric vehicles in China and the US, as well as the decline in sales of electric vehicles by Tesla, the main US manufacturer. Argentina has recently inaugurated its fourth lithium production plant, which has tripled the country's production capacity to over 136,000 tons per year.

**Here's Why Albemarle Stock Slumped by 34% in the First Half of 2024**
Albemarle's stock price has declined by 34% in the first half of 2024, following a 33.4% decline in 2023. The decline is attributed to a deterioration in sentiment and a decline in the price of lithium carbonate. The company's challenges are driven by both near-term and long-term considerations, including the price of lithium and the supply-and-demand environment. Analysts have cut price targets and stock ratings, and investors are advised to be cautious due to the potential for near-term bad news and concerns about the supply side of the equation.
