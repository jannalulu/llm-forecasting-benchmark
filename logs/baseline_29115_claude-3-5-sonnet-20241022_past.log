Let me reason through this carefully:

1) First, the Yankees need to make it to the World Series. Given they are in the ALCS against Texas Rangers and down 3-2, their chances of even making it to the World Series are already quite low.

2) If they do make it to the World Series, the question asks specifically about losing in exactly 4 games.

3) For this to happen:
- Yankees must first win their remaining ALCS games
- Then lose the World Series
- And specifically lose it in exactly 4 games (meaning they would need to lose 4 straight games)

4) Historical context:
- Being swept in 4 games is relatively rare in World Series history
- Even if a team loses the World Series, it's more common to lose in 5, 6, or 7 games

5) Combined probability:
- Chance of Yankees making World Series (~20%)
- Chance of Yankees losing World Series if they make it (~55%)
- Chance of it being specifically in 4 games if they lose (~15%)

6) Multiplying these probabilities together:
20% × 55% × 15% = approximately 1.65%

My Prediction: Between 1.20% and 2.10%, with 1.65% being the most likely. Probability: 1.65%.
