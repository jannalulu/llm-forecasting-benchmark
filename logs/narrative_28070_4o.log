INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY (OCTOBER 2, 2024)

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS huddle around a table, sipping coffee, laptops open.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(Smiling)  
Well, the Yankees did it. They edged out the Guardians.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 70.25%. The Yankees were just slightly ahead on paper.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(Scrolling through data)  
It's fascinating. Even with the Yankees' mid-season slump, their late rally was enough.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Remember the Guardians' injuries in August? That was a turning point.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Indeed. Our models factored in those variables. The Yankees' depth made a difference.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
And the Guardians' bullpen strugglesâ€”our models picked up on that, too.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's always interesting how these probabilities play out. It was close, but predictable.

The group nods in agreement, satisfied with their forecasting accuracy.

FADE OUT.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yeah, the Guardians' pitching struggles post-September 11 really tipped the scales.

SUPERFORECASTER 4

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the models could predict this. The Yankees' performance was right on the edge of our projections.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right, and considering the Yankees' September surge, it wasn't surprising. The Guardians just couldn't keep up.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
And those injuries to the Guardians' pitching staff didn't help. Our models factored that in, dropping their chances significantly.

SUPERFORECASTER 1
