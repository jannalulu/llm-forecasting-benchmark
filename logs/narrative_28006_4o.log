INT. FORECASTERS' OFFICE - DAY

The room buzzes with anticipation. A digital clock reads 2024-09-11T12:47:00Z. Three SUPERFORECASTERS gather around a table, laptops open, analyzing data.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the debate happened. Our models had it at 5.25%.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Muted microphones were a game-changer. Harris couldn't interject with her usual "I'm speaking."

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Yes, our analysis factored in the mic settings. Without interruptions, the likelihood plummeted.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
And no surprise events or last-minute changes. Just the scheduled debate.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Given the circumstances, 5.25% was spot-on. Our models held strong.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Another win for accuracy. But what a twist—silence in a debate!

They nod, satisfied with their precise prediction, as the clock ticks forward.

FADE OUT.

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, laptops open, coffee cups scattered. The air is thick with anticipation.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
So, the debate happened. Did she say it?

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(shaking head)  
No, she didn't. Our models had it at 10.75%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sipping coffee)  
The muted microphones were a game-changer. We factored that in, but the probability was still low.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(nodding)  
Exactly. Her past debates suggested a higher chance, but the format was different this time.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(typing)  
Interesting how the dynamics shift with just one rule change. Our models are never wrong.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smirking)  
And once again, they weren't. 

They all share a knowing look, the satisfaction of another accurate prediction hanging in the air.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
Well, the debate came and went. No "I'm speaking" from Harris.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 5.25%. The muted mics were a game-changer.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
Right. Even with her history, the setup didn't favor it.

And Trump didn't interrupt as expected. Surprising restraint.

Well, the debate's over, and we've got our answer.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Our models had it at 0.02%.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
With the muted microphones, it was almost impossible for her to say it.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
True, but given her history, there was always a slight chance.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
It's fascinating how the setup influenced the outcome. 

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
Yeah, even with her tendency to assert herself, the conditions just weren't right.
