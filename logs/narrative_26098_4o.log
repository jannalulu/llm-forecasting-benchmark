INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - JULY 23, 2024

A group of SUPERFORECASTERS sits around a table, analyzing the outcome of the recent market event.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning back, confident)  
So, the SENSEX didn't close between 75k and 77k on July 21st.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Our models had it at 15.75%. The market's been unpredictable since the election.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(sifting through papers)  
Right, the BJP's narrow victory shook investor confidence. We saw that 6% drop in June, followed by the bounce.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at a chart)  
And the policy paralysis fears kept volatility high, impacting the index.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(smirking)  
Yet again, our models were spot on. The SENSEX closed at 74,500.

They share a knowing glance, satisfied with their precision.

FADE OUT.

A group of superforecasters sit around a table, papers and laptops scattered. The atmosphere is tense yet analytical.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(looking at the screen)  
So, the SENSEX closed at 76,500 yesterday. Right in the middle of our range.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(smiling)  
Our models had it at 92.75%. The post-election volatility was a key factor.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(nodding)  
True, the BJP's narrower victory had everyone on edge. The market's initial drop and bounce were expected.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(sipping coffee)  
And the economic reforms uncertainty added to the unpredictability. But we accounted for that.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(turning to the group)  
Another successful prediction. Our Brier scores remain impeccable.

They all share a knowing smile, satisfied with their work.

Exactly. The market's initial drop and subsequent bounce were textbook reactions to political uncertainty.
