To answer this question, I'll analyze the relevant information and consider key factors:

1. Current Olympic record: The current Olympic record for men's pole vault is 6.03m, set by Thiago Braz Da Silva in 2016.

2. World record progression: Armand Duplantis has broken the world record multiple times, with the current record standing at 6.24m as of July 2024.

3. Duplantis's recent performances:
   - In July 2024, Duplantis won the Paris Diamond League with a height of 6.00m.
   - He attempted but failed to break his own world record of 6.22m at this event.
   - He has consistently cleared 6.00m or higher in outdoor competitions in 2024.

4. Olympic pressure and conditions: The Olympics often produce peak performances due to the high-stakes environment, but can also lead to underperformance due to pressure.

5. Historical context: Olympic records in pole vault are not broken at every Olympics, but tend to improve over time with advances in technique and equipment.

6. Competition: While Duplantis is the clear favorite, the presence of strong competitors like Sam Kendricks and Chris Nilsen could push him to higher heights.

7. Duplantis's goals: He has expressed a desire to break the Olympic record and has been training specifically for this event.

8. Weather conditions: Pole vault performance can be affected by wind and temperature, which are unknown factors for the day of the event.

Weighing these factors:

For breaking the record:
- Duplantis has consistently performed well above the current Olympic record.
- He has expressed a specific goal of breaking the Olympic record.
- The competitive field could push him to greater heights.
- Olympic events often produce peak performances.

Against breaking the record:
- Duplantis failed to break his own world record in recent attempts.
- Olympic pressure could potentially lead to underperformance.
- Weather conditions on the day of the event are unpredictable.

Balancing these factors, I believe there is a high likelihood of the Olympic record being broken, but it's not certain.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, with 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

Let's approach this question step-by-step:

1. Current Olympic record: The current Olympic record for men's pole vault is 6.03m, set by Thiago Braz Da Silva at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

2. Qualification criteria: The question resolves as "Yes" if the winning height at the 2024 Paris Olympics is 6.04m or higher.

3. Current world record: Armand Duplantis holds the world record of 6.24m, set in 2024.

4. Recent performances:
   - Duplantis has consistently been clearing 6.00m and above in competitions.
   - He won the Paris Diamond League in July 2024 with a height of 6.00m.
   - He attempted but failed to break his own world record of 6.22m at that event.

5. Historical context:
   - Olympic records are often broken during the Games due to the high-pressure, high-stakes environment.
   - Duplantis has broken his own world record multiple times since 2020.

6. Factors supporting a new Olympic record:
   - Duplantis is in his prime at 24 years old.
   - He has consistently performed at a high level, breaking world records.
   - The Olympic stage often brings out peak performances.
   - There's a significant gap between the current Olympic record (6.03m) and Duplantis' capabilities (world record of 6.24m).

7. Factors against a new Olympic record:
   - Olympic pressure can sometimes lead to underperformance.
   - Weather conditions could be unfavorable.
   - Duplantis might focus on winning gold rather than breaking records.

8. Other competitors:
   - While Duplantis is the clear favorite, other vaulters like Sam Kendricks and Chris Nilsen could potentially challenge for high marks.

Weighing these factors, it seems highly likely that the Olympic record will be broken. Duplantis has consistently performed well above the current Olympic record, and even if he doesn't reach his world record height, he has a good chance of surpassing 6.03m.

My Prediction: Between 80.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

1. Current Olympic record: 6.03m set by Thiago Braz Da Silva in 2016

2. Current world record holder: Armand Duplantis (6.24m)

3. Duplantis's recent performances:
- Set new world record of 6.24m in 2024
- Consistently clearing 6.00m+ in competitions
- Won Paris Diamond League in July 2024 with 6.00m

4. Other top contenders:
- Sam Kendricks (season best 5.95m in July 2024)
- Chris Nilsen (qualified for Olympics with 5.87m)

5. Historical context:
- Olympic records are often broken in pole vault
- Duplantis has improved his world record 8 times since 2020

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. Duplantis is in peak form, consistently clearing heights well above the Olympic record
2. He has motivation to set the Olympic record at a high-profile event
3. Conditions in Paris may be favorable for record-breaking performances
4. The current Olympic record (6.03m) is well below Duplantis's capabilities

Arguments for a lower probability:
1. Olympic competitions can be unpredictable due to pressure and conditions
2. Duplantis failed to break his world record at the Paris Diamond League in July 2024
3. Other factors like weather or equipment issues could affect performance
4. The focus in Olympic finals is often on winning rather than record-breaking

Balancing these factors:

Duplantis's consistent high-level performances and multiple world records make him a strong favorite to break the Olympic record. The current record is nearly 20cm below his personal best, which gives him a significant margin. However, Olympic competitions can be unpredictable, and factors like weather or pressure could affect his performance.

1. Olympic competitions can be unpredictable due to pressure and conditions
2. Duplantis failed to break his world record at the Paris Diamond League in July 2024
3. Other factors like weather or equipment issues could affect performance
4. The focus in Olympic finals is often on winning rather than record-breaking

Balancing these factors:

Duplantis's consistent high-level performances and multiple world records make him a strong favorite to break the Olympic record. The current record is nearly 20cm below his personal best, which gives him a significant margin. However, Olympic competitions can be unpredictable, and factors like weather or pressure could affect his performance.

Given the evidence, I believe there is a very high probability that the Olympic record will be broken, but it's not certain.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, with 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To approach this question, I'll break it down into key components and analyze the relevant information:

1. Current Olympic record: 6.03m set by Thiago Braz Da Silva in 2016

2. Current world record holder: Armand Duplantis (6.24m)

3. Duplantis's recent performances:
- Set new world record of 6.24m in 2024
- Consistently clearing 6.00m+ in competitions
- Won Paris Diamond League in July 2024 with 6.00m

4. Other top contenders:
- Sam Kendricks (season best 5.95m in July 2024)
- Chris Nilsen (qualified for Olympics with 5.87m)

5. Historical context:
- Olympic records are often broken in pole vault
- Duplantis has improved his world record 8 times since 2020

Arguments for a higher probability:
1. Duplantis is in peak form, consistently clearing heights well above the Olympic record
2. He has motivation to set the Olympic record at a high-profile event
3. Conditions in Paris may be favorable for record-breaking performances
