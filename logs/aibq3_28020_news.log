**Is There a Future for Starliner After Failed Mission?**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which was intended to ferry crews to the International Space Station (ISS), has failed in its first crewed mission. The spacecraft landed safely in New Mexico without crew on September 6, 2024, after experiencing thruster problems and leaks in the helium system. NASA decided to cancel the crewed mission due to safety concerns. Boeing executives have expressed pride in the spacecraft's performance, but experts question whether the company can fix the issues and whether the Starliner has a future. The spacecraft was originally intended to have an indefinite life, but delays and serial problems have led Boeing to see a less-ambitious future for its ship. NASA plans to deorbit the ISS in 2030, which leaves only six more station missions for Boeing. Boeing has not yet fixed the thruster problems, and the company is facing rising costs and a ticking clock. NASA may decide that dissimilar redundancy is not achievable with Starliner as one of the two ships, and the agency may choose to rely solely on SpaceX for ISS missions. 'We are excited to have Starliner home safely,' said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. 'This was an important test flight for NASA in setting us up for future missions on the Starliner system.' However, NASA is being candid that nothing is guaranteed for the glitchy ship. 'What we really need to do is look at the things that didn't perform the way we expected,' said Stich. 'The dissimilar redundancy to ISS has been an important part of our program plans since the award of the contract and it's an important part of our safety going forward,' said NASA associate administrator Jim Free. Boeing has taken an additional $1.6 billion in charges over the life of the program, including over $250 million in the second quarter of 2023 alone. The company's stock tumbled 7.3% following Wells Fargo's decision to downgrade the company to an underweight rating. 'I think we've worked a lot harder these days in synthesizing everyone to make sure that we have the right environment for people with different positions [on safety] to bring them forward,' said Russ DeLoach, chief of NASA safety and mission assurance. 'I recognize that that may mean at times, we don't move very fast because we're getting everything out.'

**Boeing's Starliner Faces Uncertain Future as NASA Considers Cancellation**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is facing an uncertain future due to technical issues, delays, and budget overruns. The spacecraft, once a critical component of NASA's Commercial Crew program, is now at risk of cancellation. According to a report by Reuters, the project has exceeded its budget by $1.6 billion since 2016. Former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver expressed uncertainty about the project's future, stating, 'I am not sure the decision will ultimately be NASA's. Boeing is going to have to foot much of this bill, as they have been.' A Boeing spokesperson did not directly address the possibility of cancellation, focusing instead on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. The failure of Starliner's first crewed test flight has denied NASA the confidence it needs to certify the spacecraft for regular crew rotation missions to the International Space Station. Analysts have suggested that Boeing may ultimately exit the Commercial Crew program due to its complexity and the superior performance of its competitor, SpaceX. Melius Research analyst Robert Spingarn told Bloomberg, 'Do they ultimately exit the program because it's too complicated and because the other guy can do it better? It can happen.'

**NASA Abandons Boeing's Starliner, Astronauts to Return on SpaceX Crew Dragon**
NASA has decided to cancel the manned return flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft due to technical issues. The two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for weeks. NASA has announced that they will instead return to Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, which is scheduled for February 2025. The decision was made after a press conference, where NASA officials stated that there was 'too much uncertainty' about the reliability of the Starliner's engines. The agency will now attempt to return the spacecraft to Earth on an unmanned test flight in October, with a simplified separation method. NASA's decision is seen as a major setback for Boeing, which has already invested billions of dollars in the Starliner program. As Steve Stich, the program leader, said, 'We are changing the planned separation sequence. We will use a simplified separation method to get us off the station faster.'

**NASA Cancels Starliner's Return to Earth with Astronauts on Board**
The NASA has decided to cancel the Starliner spacecraft's return to Earth with astronauts on board. Instead, the spacecraft will return empty to the Earth in September. The decision was made after a review of the Starliner's performance, which included five helium leaks and five failed thrusters during a recent flight. 'There was too much uncertainty with the thrusters,' said Steve Stitch, director of the NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 'It was too much risk with crew, so we decided to do uncrewed tests.' The Starliner's return to Earth will be delayed until September, while the Crew-9 mission with SpaceX will be rescheduled for no earlier than September 24. The two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will travel to the International Space Station on a SpaceX Crew Dragon and stay for 10 months. Boeing is still defending the Starliner's ability to return safely to Earth, despite the recent issues.

**Boeing Starliner, 50 says after launching, remains without return date as testing continues**
The Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test, which launched on June 5, remains without a set return date due to thruster malfunctions and helium leaks. NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, Steve Stich, stated that they are making progress but are not yet ready to announce a return date. The mission was originally planned to be eight days, but NASA and Boeing continued to push back the return date to investigate the issues. Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, believes that part of the problem was the deformation of Teflon seals due to high heat. Nappi regrets being too specific about the mission's timeline and wishes they had been more flexible.

**NASA Was 'Right' To Bring Starliner Back Empty As Thrusters And Guidance Fail On Return**
NASA's decision to leave astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on the International Space Station due to issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has been vindicated after the craft's return to Earth. The Starliner experienced a failed thruster and temporary guidance system blackout during re-entry, raising questions about its safety. NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said, 'I think we made the right decision not to have Butch and Suni on board.' The issues with Starliner's thrusters, which failed during docking with the ISS, and overheating problems have led to a chasm between NASA and Boeing, with NASA viewing the data and uncertainty differently than Boeing. The next Starliner launch, scheduled for August 2025, is now uncertain due to the ongoing concerns about Boeing's space flight ambitions.

**What Starliner's crewless return means for NASA and Boeing**
Boeing's Starliner space capsule returned to Earth without its crew on September 7, 2024, after a test flight to the International Space Station was aborted due to thruster failures. The capsule's remotely piloted return marked the end of a fraught test flight that left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita 'Suni' Williams on the station for months longer than intended. According to Michael Fossum, former commander of the ISS, NASA's decision to return the craft uncrewed means that the agency will continue to have multiple options for getting crew members to and from the space station, including its partnership with Russia and the SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft. Fossum believes that Boeing's reputation will suffer due to the failure, but that the company will continue to play a role in NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The extended stay of Wilmore and Williams on the ISS will require NASA to increase deliveries of food, clothing, and other supplies to the station. Fossum notes that human spaceflight is 'excruciatingly hard and relentlessly unforgiving,' and that setbacks and failures are a normal part of the process. He expresses optimism about the future of human spaceflight, citing the progress made in recent years and the upcoming Artemis II mission.

**TechCrunch Space: Boeing's Starliner returns to Earth**
Boeing's Starliner capsule has successfully returned to Earth from the International Space Station, landing at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. The capsule returned autonomously without its two crew members, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who will remain on the station until next February. NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich described the flight as 'darn near flawless,' but expressed mixed feelings among staff. The agency had planned to have the mission land with the crew on board. Meanwhile, NASA has postponed the ESCAPADE mission to Mars, citing potential cost and technical issues with de-fueling the two satellites. The mission was originally scheduled to launch in October 2024, but will now take place in spring 2025. Additionally, NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson was the only American off-world when the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred, and captured images of the site from the International Space Station.

**Boeing's Starliner Spacecraft Returns to Earth Without Astronauts**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth without astronauts on board after NASA deemed it too risky. The spacecraft was on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS) but experienced unexpected thrust issues and helium leaks, forcing NASA to send astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon instead. The astronauts will have to wait until February 2025 for their return. The Starliner capsule landed safely in New Mexico's White Sands Space Harbor, with a soft landing assisted by parachutes and airbags. NASA praised Boeing's performance in a post-flight press conference, but Boeing representatives were absent. NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said, 'It was a perfect landing. The entry was almost flawless.' However, Stich also acknowledged some new issues, including a new thruster failure and a temporary loss of navigation, and said it's too early to discuss whether the next Starliner flight in August 2025 will be crewed. Boeing's reputation in space has been shaken, and its long-term prospects for crewed space missions are uncertain. The Starliner program has been plagued by delays and issues, including a software glitch in 2019, a flammable tape issue in 2022, and numerous other problems. With the ISS set to be decommissioned in 2030, the sooner the Starliner program gets back on track, the better.

**Boeing Starliner Completes Solo Return to Earth**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft successfully completed its solo return to Earth, announced the NASA tonight. The return mission ended the latest test flight of the Starliner, which was delayed months beyond the scheduled date, leaving the original crew, NASA astronauts Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Suni Williams, on board the International Space Station until next year. The Starliner landed precisely at 05:01 local time on Saturday at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, according to the NASA. NASA officials praised the success of the descent: 'I am extremely proud of the work our team put into this test flight and we are happy to see the safe return of the Starliner,' said Ken Bowersox, director of the Mission Operations Directorate at the NASA headquarters in Washington. 'Although it was necessary to return the spacecraft without a crew, NASA and Boeing learned a lot about the Starliner in the most extreme environment possible.' Steve Stich, director of the Commercial Crew Program at NASA, stated in a press release that this was an important test flight for the agency, preparing them for future missions on the Starliner system. The Starliner was initially launched despite helium leaks that the NASA considered to be within acceptable limits. The agency then delayed the return flight after finding more leaks and problems with the Starliner's reaction control system. It is expected that astronauts Wilmore and Williams will return on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule when the NASA's Crew-9 mission ends in early 2025.

**Boeing Starliner capsule safely lands on Earth with no crew aboard**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft successfully landed in New Mexico after a challenging test flight, with no crew on board due to concerns about its thrusters. The mission was extended as engineers worked to address the issues, and astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams will now remain on the International Space Station (ISS) until February. According to Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, 'Leaving them there was a tough decision to make. It was really hard to determine whether to be uncrewed or not.' The astronauts were well-prepared for an extended stay, having undergone long-duration space station training. They will eventually return home on a previously scheduled SpaceX flight, with NASA rearranging plans to ensure two seats were available for them on the capsule.

**Boeing's Starliner Returns to Earth Without Crew**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft has successfully returned to Earth without its crew, marking a major milestone in its development. The spacecraft, which is intended to be a commercial crew vehicle for NASA, was on its first test flight with astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore on board. However, due to several issues, including helium leaks and a problem with the propulsion system, NASA decided to cancel the mission and have the crew stay on the International Space Station (ISS) until February. The Starliner was able to return to Earth autonomously, with NASA monitoring its progress in real-time. The spacecraft landed safely in the desert in New Mexico, with NASA's Steve Stich stating, 'It was a great day. Suni said, Starliner was ready and it has demonstrated it.' Despite the success of the mission, Stich noted that there were some issues, including a problem with the propulsion system, and that the team would need to review the data before planning the next step. The Starliner will be transported to the launch site in Cape Canaveral, where Boeing and NASA will review the data and plan for the next mission.

**Boeing's Starliner capsule leaves space station without astronauts**
After months of turmoil over its safety, Boeing's new astronaut capsule, Starliner, departed the International Space Station on Friday without its crew and headed back to Earth. NASA's two test pilots, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, stayed behind at the space station as the Starliner capsule undocked 420km over China and began its six-hour return flight to New Mexico. The decision to leave the crew behind was made due to thruster failures and helium leaks on the capsule's previous test flight. Boeing's first astronaut flight has been filled with delays and setbacks, including a $1 billion repair bill for the 2022 do-over of the test flight. SpaceX will bring the duo back to the space station in late February, stretching their original eight-day mission to over eight months. NASA's commercial crew program manager, Steve Stich, said that the space agency remains committed to having two competing US companies transporting astronauts.

**Boeing Starliner's Contract with NASA in Jeopardy Due to Technical Issues**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft, which carried astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore to the International Space Station, is facing a possible contract cancellation with NASA. The spacecraft has been experiencing technical issues, including a faulty propulsion system and helium tank problems. If the Starliner is successfully landed on Earth, NASA may consider awarding the next contract to Boeing. However, if the spacecraft fails to meet expectations, Boeing may face a loss of $16,786 crore or more. The Starliner was originally scheduled to launch in August 2025, but NASA accelerated the schedule, and Boeing decided to launch the spacecraft despite the technical issues. The spacecraft has undergone several test flights, but each has been plagued by problems, including a failed orbital maneuvering and attitude control system. The spacecraft's navigation system also failed during re-entry, and communication was lost. Boeing has stated that these issues are normal, but NASA is concerned about the spacecraft's reliability. The Starliner's next flight, which was scheduled for June 2024, was delayed due to issues with the Atlas rocket and helium leaks. The spacecraft is currently on the International Space Station, and its crew is expected to return to Earth in February 2025.

**Boeing's Starliner set to finally undock from space station and land without its crew**
After three months of uncertainty, the Boeing Starliner spacecraft is set to undock from the International Space Station and land without its crew. The NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams, will remain on the station until February when they'll return on a SpaceX Dragon. The Starliner will undock autonomously from the station no earlier than 6:04 p.m. EDT on Friday and land no earlier than 12:03 a.m. EDT on Saturday in the New Mexico desert. NASA officials said that the decision to return Starliner uncrewed was not an easy one, citing uncertainty with the malfunctioning thrusters. According to Steve Stitch, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, 'It was a tough decision to make... The teams were very split. (There was) uncertainty relative to the thrusters. The NASA team chose to return Butch and Suni on Dragon.' The decision is a major blow to Boeing and a setback to NASA's plans, as the agency wants a backup option in the commercial crew program.

**NASA Acknowledges Tensions with Boeing Over Astronaut Return**
NASA acknowledged the existence of 'tensions' during recent meetings with Boeing officials regarding the return of two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) due to the failure of Boeing's Starliner capsule. NASA denied reports of shouting during these meetings. The agency had announced in August that SpaceX, Boeing's competitor, would be responsible for bringing Butch Wilmore and Sunni Williams back to Earth. The difficulties encountered with the Starliner led to this decision not to use the spacecraft for the return mission. This is a setback for Boeing, which has already faced repeated issues with its commercial aircraft. The two astronauts were initially scheduled to spend eight days in space, but will now remain there for at least eight months, until February 2025 and the SpaceX Crew-9 mission. Boeing has repeatedly stated publicly that it is confident in the safety of its spacecraft. The absence of Boeing executives at recent NASA press conferences fueled speculation about potential disagreements between the two parties. According to the New York Post, citing sources close to the matter, recent meetings between the two parties' top officials often ended in heated arguments and shouting. NASA's Commercial Crew Program Manager, Steve Stich, stated that he would not describe the meetings as 'stormy', but that they did involve 'tense technical discussions'. 'Every time you're in a meeting of this importance, where you have to make a decision like this, there's a certain level of tension in the room,' he said. 'We weren't comfortable proceeding, because of the uncertainty around the model,' he added. The Starliner is scheduled to detach from the ISS on Friday evening, before beginning its uncrewed descent and landing in the western United States on Saturday morning.

**Boeing's Troubled Starliner Will Perform a 'Breakout Burn' as It Returns to Earth Without Astronauts**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is set to return to Earth without astronauts on board, after a troubled mission to the International Space Station (ISS). To ensure a safe departure, NASA has devised a modified maneuver, known as a 'breakout burn', which will take the spacecraft up and away from the ISS more quickly. According to Dana Weigel, ISS program manager, 'This alternate approach...it just helps us to get Starliner away from ISS more quickly.' The spacecraft will undock from the ISS on Friday at 6:04 p.m. ET and land at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico on Saturday at 12:03 a.m. ET. NASA officials downplayed any suggestions that the breakout burn is meant to prevent Starliner from crashing into the ISS, with Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, saying, 'It puts less stress on the thrusters...In other words, there's fewer thruster firings.' The Starliner crew will return with SpaceX's Crew-9 mission in February 2025, after having spent around eight months in space.

**Boeing Can't Bring Back the Stranded Starliner Astronauts Home. Now SpaceX Must Rescue Them.**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has failed to meet NASA's safety and performance requirements for human spaceflight, forcing the agency to cancel the crew's return to Earth and instead rely on SpaceX to rescue them. The astronauts, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, will remain on the International Space Station until at least February 2025. NASA has decided not to allow the astronauts to fly on Starliner again due to the spacecraft's persistent problems with sticky valves and helium leaks. Boeing is now faced with a dilemma: either abandon the Starliner program and take a huge charge to earnings, or try to get the spacecraft back on track and risk further failure. The clock is ticking, as the ISS is slated for decommissioning after 2030, and there may not be enough time left to conduct more than three or four operational missions with Starliner.

**NASA Set to Bring Starliner Back, But Will Leave Crew in Space as Boeing Drama Gets Even Worse**
NASA has announced that Boeing's Starliner spacecraft will return to Earth on September 6, but without its two-person crew, Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Sunita 'Suni' Williams. The crew will remain on the International Space Station until next year, when they will return on a SpaceX flight. NASA said the Starliner completed an autonomous landing during an earlier test, and teams on the ground can remotely command the spacecraft for a safe undocking, re-entry, and parachute-assisted landing. The decision not to return the crew on the Starliner was due to a 'little disagreement about risk' between NASA and Boeing, according to Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager. Boeing has racked up about $1.5 billion in cost overruns on the $4.5 billion contract to develop the Starliner, and its future is uncertain.

**Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test Will End September 6**
NASA has decided to end the Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test mission on September 6, with the spacecraft returning to Earth empty instead of bringing back the two NASA astronauts who were aboard. The decision was made due to concerns about the thrusters' performance, which experienced helium leaks and thruster failures during the mission. The astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will remain on the International Space Station and return on the next scheduled crew rotation mission using SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February 2025. Boeing will bear the cost of the necessary fixes, which is estimated to be around $1.6 billion. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson expressed confidence that Starliner will fly again with a crew, and the ISS has a 'lifeboat' available in case of an emergency. The Crew-8 Crew Dragon and Soyuz MS-25 will be docked at the ISS after Starliner leaves, and a handover will take place with Crew-9 before they depart.

**Boeing Might Not Get Starliner Working Before the Space Station Is Destroyed**
NASA has decided it's too risky to return astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore on board Boeing's Starliner due to its plagued development. This decision is a massive blow to Boeing, which has yet to achieve a successful crewed test flight. With the International Space Station set to be decommissioned in 2030, Boeing has roughly five years to get its act together. However, space industry veteran Todd Harrison thinks it's 'fairly likely' that Boeing may choose to 'step back' from Starliner within a few weeks or months. Boeing has already lost $1.6 billion on the development of Starliner, on top of getting $4 billion in funding from NASA's Commercial Crew Program. In contrast, SpaceX has completed nearly a dozen crewed missions to the ISS with far less funding. As of now, Boeing is keeping all its options open, with a spokesperson stating, 'We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return.'

**Boeing's Starliner Faces Uncertain Future as NASA Considers Cancellation**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is facing an uncertain future due to technical issues, delays, and budget overruns. The spacecraft, once a critical component of NASA's Commercial Crew program, is now at risk of cancellation. According to a report by Reuters, the project has exceeded its budget by $1.6 billion since 2016. Former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver expressed uncertainty about the project's future, stating, 'I am not sure the decision will ultimately be NASA's. Boeing is going to have to foot much of this bill, as they have been.' A Boeing spokesperson did not directly address the possibility of cancellation, focusing instead on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. The failure of Starliner's first crewed test flight has denied NASA the confidence it needs to certify the spacecraft for regular crew rotation missions to the International Space Station. Analysts have suggested that Boeing may ultimately exit the Commercial Crew program due to its complexity and the superior performance of its competitor, SpaceX. Melius Research analyst Robert Spingarn told Bloomberg, 'Do they ultimately exit the program because it's too complicated and because the other guy can do it better? It can happen.'

**Starliner Is Such a Disaster That Boeing May Cancel the Entire Project**
NASA has announced that Boeing's Starliner spacecraft will return to Earth empty-handed, with astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams instead taking a ride on SpaceX's Crew Dragon in February. The decision is a significant blow to Boeing, which has been plagued by technical issues, supply chain problems, and years of delays, resulting in a $1.6 billion budget overrun since 2016. Former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver said, 'I am not sure the decision will ultimately be NASA's,' suggesting that Boeing may have to foot the bill for the project. When asked if Starliner might get canceled, a Boeing spokesperson said, 'Boeing continues to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft.' However, analysts and industry experts are raising doubts that the spacecraft will ever fly again, citing Boeing's history of controversies and executive shakeups. Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said, 'Boeing's other businesses aren't terribly vulnerable to disruption, but space? That's another story.' Melius Research analyst Robert Spingarn added, 'Do they ultimately exit the program because it's too complicated and because the other guy can do it better? It can happen.' With time running out for Starliner, Boeing is in talks to sell a joint rocket-launching business and skilled workers are jumping ship to join SpaceX and Blue Origin.

**Boeing Starliner to Return to Earth Without Crew**
The US space agency NASA has decided to return the Boeing Starliner spacecraft to Earth without a crew. The decision was made after a thorough consideration of potential risks and the need for further testing. The Starliner's autopilot software has not been updated in over two years and requires a firmware update to ensure a safe return. This update will include a check for compatibility with any hardware systems that may have been upgraded since the last automated flight to the station. As a result, astronauts Willmar and Williams will remain on the ISS until the end of February 2025, as previously planned. NASA has also postponed the launch of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission to September 24, which will transport two astronauts instead of four and will be used to return the Starliner crew. This decision will provide NASA and Boeing with valuable data on the spacecraft's performance, particularly in relation to recent failures of the correction engine. This data will be crucial for Boeing in planning the future Starliner program, especially considering the expected decommissioning of the ISS after 2030, which will eliminate the need to transport crew to the station.

**NASA Abandons Boeing's Starliner, Astronauts to Return on SpaceX Crew Dragon**
NASA has decided to cancel the manned return flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft due to technical issues. The two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) for weeks. NASA has announced that they will instead return to Earth on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, which is scheduled for February 2025. The decision was made after a press conference, where NASA officials stated that there was 'too much uncertainty' about the reliability of the Starliner's engines. The agency will now attempt to return the spacecraft to Earth on an unmanned test flight in October, with a simplified separation method. NASA's decision is seen as a major setback for Boeing, which has already invested billions of dollars in the Starliner program. As Steve Stich, the program leader, said, 'We are changing the planned separation sequence. We will use a simplified separation method to get us off the station faster.'

**NASA Considers Options for Returning Starliner with Astronauts on Board**
The Boeing Starliner, a spacecraft built for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, has been stuck at the International Space Station (ISS) since June 6, 2024, due to technical issues. The spacecraft was initially intended to return to Earth with astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, but NASA is now considering two options: repairing the spacecraft and allowing the astronauts to pilot it back to Earth, or returning it to Earth without the crew. The first option is considered riskier, as the spacecraft may experience new issues on a second crewed flight. If the second option is chosen, Wilmore and Williams will have to stay on the ISS until February 2025, when they can catch a ride on a SpaceX flight. The prolonged stay on the ISS poses significant health risks to the astronauts, including radiation exposure, bone loss, and vision problems. NASA is conducting a Flight Readiness Review, involving three independent technical agencies, to determine the feasibility of returning the Starliner with the astronauts on board. The review will present recommendations to NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Operations, Ken Bowersox, who will make the final decision. Emily Nelson, NASA's Chief of Flight, said, 'Before each major milestone, especially on a test flight, we do a complete review of readiness.' The decision is expected to be made by the end of August 2024.

**As NASA nears major decision on Starliner, here's what we know and what we don't**
NASA is set to make a decision this weekend on whether to send astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home on the Starliner spacecraft or a Crew Dragon vehicle. The decision comes after months of testing and analysis of the failed thrusters on the Starliner, which led to an extended stay for the astronauts on the International Space Station. NASA engineers and decision-makers will review the final results of internal and external analyses of the failed thrusters on Friday and Saturday. The agency wants to understand the root cause of the thruster problems to ensure there won't be multiple thruster failures on a return journey to Earth. NASA has a viable backup option to get Wilmore and Williams home, the Crew Dragon, which has completed more than a dozen missions safely. However, the agency is concerned with getting its astronauts home safely and is weighing the risks of flying the Starliner. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson will have the final say in the decision, and while there may be political considerations, he is expected to make a data-driven decision. Boeing, the manufacturer of the Starliner, has been criticized for its handling of the situation, but NASA's Commercial Crew program allowed the launch to occur after similar thruster problems occurred on the spacecraft's previous uncrewed test flight in 2022. If NASA decides to fly Butch and Suni on Dragon, Starliner will be able to return autonomously to Earth thanks to a software update, which could potentially clear the way for its crew to fly on Starliner's next mission. However, the next crewed Starliner mission is unlikely to happen before 2026.

**Boeing Starliner Astronauts May Not Return to Earth Until 2025**
The four astronauts on the Boeing Starliner, Barry, Butch, Wilmore, and Sunita, Suni, Williams, have been in the orbital complex since June 6, almost seven weeks longer than expected. After launching from Cape Canaveral in Florida, the spacecraft was only able to dock on a second attempt due to engine problems and a helium leak. The NASA is currently discussing two options for the astronauts to return to Earth. The first option is for the Starliner to return with the astronauts, but the spacecraft needs to be repaired first. The second option is to remove two astronauts from the SpaceX Crew 9 mission, which is scheduled to launch in September, and reserve those seats for Wilmore and Williams, who could return to Earth with the crew in February 2025. NASA has even considered sending a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to bring the astronauts back. 'We haven't made a decision yet on the return of Butch and Suni. We have a very complicated timeline and are working closely with all the entities involved, with the teams from Boeing, NASA, and SpaceX,' said Steve Stich, the manager of the Commercial Crew Program at NASA. 'We will take the correct option at the correct time,' he added, once all the return options for the crew have been evaluated. Dana Weigel, deputy director of the International Space Station Program at NASA, stated that a 'contingency plan' is being developed, but no decision has been made on the return dates of the two astronauts or the spacecraft to be used. Engineers from NASA and Boeing are conducting tests on the 27 Starliner thrusters in White Sands, New Mexico, to 'understand the primary cause of their degradation' and 'how this could affect the return of the crew.'

**NASA Abandoning Boeing Starliner? Space Agency Might Bring Back Sunita Williams And Butch Wilmore With 2 SpaceX Crew-9 Astronauts In February 2025 - Boeing (NYSE:BA)**
NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich announced that the agency will make a final decision on the return of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams from the International Space Station by mid-August. Due to technical issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, NASA is considering alternative options, including using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. One possible plan is to undock the Starliner without a crew and then launch Crew-9 with just 2 astronauts aboard the Dragon spacecraft, which will return to Earth in February 2025 with Wilmore, Williams, and the two Crew-9 astronauts. Stich stated, 'The plans are tentative, and a final decision will be made mid-August.' The delay of the Crew-9 mission to no earlier than September 24 will give Boeing Starliner mission managers time to confirm its return to Earth. The Starliner has to undock first from the ISS to free up the port before the Crew-9 mission launches.

**Boeing's Starliner astronauts might return in Feb 2025**
NASA officials have discussed potential plans with SpaceX to use the Crew Dragon to return two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to Earth in February 2025 if Boeing's Starliner is deemed unsafe. The Starliner's test mission has been delayed due to issues with its propulsion system, including thruster failures and helium leaks. NASA has been buying Boeing more time to do more testing and gather more data to build a better case to trust Starliner. Commercial Crew Program chief Steve Stich said, 'We didn't poll in a way that led to a conclusion,' and Ken Bowersox added, 'We heard from a lot of folks that had concerns, and the decision was not clear.' NASA has not yet decided which astronauts they would pull off the mission for Wilmore and Williams if needed. Boeing's testing has shown that four of Starliner's jets had failed in June because they overheated and automatically turned off, while other thrusters re-fired during tests appeared weaker than normal because of some restriction to their propellant.

**Boeing Starliner's Delay In Returning To Earth Forces NASA To Postpone Crew-9 Mission Launch To ISS**
NASA has postponed the launch of the Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) to no earlier than September 24 due to technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The spacecraft, which launched with two astronauts in June, was supposed to return to Earth in about eight days but has been delayed. NASA is evaluating the spacecraft's reliability for the return flight, and mission managers need more time to finalize return planning. As a result, the Crew-9 mission, which was initially scheduled for August 18, has been delayed by over a month. NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said, 'While the focus is on returning the astronauts aboard Starliner itself, using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to return the astronauts in case the Starliner can't is also a possibility.' This delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for Boeing's Starliner program, which has been delayed since its initial uncrewed test flight in 2015.

**NASA Considers Delaying SpaceX Crew 9 Mission Due to Starliner Concerns**
The NASA is considering delaying the launch of the SpaceX Crew 9 mission, originally scheduled for August 18, to September 24, in order to bring back the two astronauts stranded on the Starliner spacecraft to Earth safely. According to anonymous sources, the agency is considering carrying only two astronauts on the Crew Dragon instead of four, allowing the Starliner crew to board a different vehicle for their return journey. This move would indicate the failure of the Starliner's first crewed flight to the ISS and confirm that, despite NASA's attempts to downplay the spacecraft's flaws, it was not suitable for carrying a crew back to Earth. NASA and Boeing have repeatedly stated that the Starliner is capable of returning the crew at any time, but reports suggest that astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunni Williams may travel on the SpaceX Dragon instead. The NASA officials had previously stated that the Starliner would need to undock from the ISS before the launch of the Crew 9 mission, but now the agency is considering postponing the launch. 'The primary option today is to return Butch and Sunny in the Starliner,' said Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, during a press conference on July 10. 'At this moment, we don't see any reason why that wouldn't be the case.' However, the NASA is now considering postponing the launch of its Crew 9 mission, as the deadline for returning the Starliner crew has passed. The SpaceX Crew 9 mission includes three NASA astronauts and a Roscosmos cosmonaut, who are scheduled for a six-month stay on the ISS. However, sources said there was more than a 50% chance that astronauts Wilmore and Williams would need to fly back on a SpaceX Dragon due to ongoing discussions about the Starliner's viability.

**NASA Schedule Puts Pressure on Boeing to Bring Home Starliner Astronauts**
NASA is planning to launch the Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on or after August 18, which puts pressure on Boeing to undock the Starliner spacecraft and return astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to Earth within 18 days. The ISS has limited docking ports, and both U.S. ports are occupied, making it difficult for the Starliner to return. The spacecraft's faulty thrusters have delayed its return flight, and NASA is still conducting tests to evaluate the propulsion system. Steve Stich, the manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, previously stated that the Starliner had a 45-day deadline to undock from the ISS, but this limit could be extended. However, a delay in the Starliner's return could impact the Crew-9 mission and prevent a 'direct handover' of the ISS, where a new crew launches and arrives before the previous crew returns to Earth. NASA has not set a return date for the Starliner crew, and the astronauts have been in space for 56 days, far beyond the original mission schedule.

**NASA Confirms Crew-9 Launch Date and Postpones Starliner's First Operational Flight**
NASA has confirmed that the launch of the Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) is scheduled for no earlier than August 18. The announcement was made during a press conference, following a recent anomaly with the Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX has resolved the issue (caused by a crack in a sensor line that allowed liquid oxygen to escape), making modifications to both the hardware and software of the rocket. According to Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, the launch will depend on a test of the new upper stage. The modifications will be strictly certified before being approved for the Crew-9 mission. The launch of Crew-9 must take place within the first days of September to prepare Launch Complex 39A for the Europa Clipper mission with the Falcon Heavy, scheduled for October. Crew-9 consists of NASA astronauts Zena Cardman, Nick Hague, Stephanie Wilson, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexsandr Gorbunov. Meanwhile, the first operational flight of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, initially scheduled for February 2025, has been postponed to August 2025. This period will allow NASA and Boeing to analyze the data from the Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission and implement any necessary modifications.

**Boeing Starliner, 50 says after launching, remains without return date as testing continues**
The Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test, which launched on June 5, remains without a set return date due to thruster malfunctions and helium leaks. NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, Steve Stich, stated that they are making progress but are not yet ready to announce a return date. The mission was originally planned to be eight days, but NASA and Boeing continued to push back the return date to investigate the issues. Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, believes that part of the problem was the deformation of Teflon seals due to high heat. Nappi regrets being too specific about the mission's timeline and wishes they had been more flexible.

**NASA, Boeing lay out path for Starliner return after likely source of leak, thruster problems ID'd**
NASA and Boeing are working to resolve issues with the Starliner spacecraft, including helium leaks and failed thrusters, before allowing it to return to Earth. The spacecraft, carrying astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, has been on the International Space Station for over 50 days. NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said that teams are 'starting to close in on those final pieces of the flight rationale to make sure that we can come home safely.' Boeing's Mark Nappi, vice president of the company's commercial crew program, said that the team has identified the likely source of the thruster issue and is working on solutions for future launches. The earliest Starliner could leave the ISS would likely be mid-September.

**Astronauts Stranded in Space: NASA and Boeing Uncertain About Return Date**
NASA and Boeing are still unsure when they will bring the Starliner spacecraft back to Earth. A press conference held on Wednesday stated that they aim to return by the end of the month, but no specific date has been given. The two astronauts, Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams, have been stuck in orbit around the International Space Station since June. The main concern is that the engineers are unable to understand what is happening with the helium tanks that control the spacecraft's thrusters. NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said, 'We're evaluating every rock and every stone to make sure we're not surprised by anything.' The possibility of NASA canceling the return journey and sending the astronauts back to Earth on another spacecraft is being considered. In this case, SpaceX, Boeing's competitor, is expected to take over the return journey.
