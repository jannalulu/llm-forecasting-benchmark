To forecast whether Alexandre de Moraes will cease to be a minister of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil before October 1, 2024, I must consider several factors that could influence this event:

1. **Tenure and Political Environment**: 
   - Alexandre de Moraes is a significant figure in Brazil's judiciary. His prominence might insulate him from removal absent a substantial political movement or scandal.
   - The political context in Brazil, particularly involving the judiciary, plays a role. If recent months have been politically stable with respect to the judiciary, this reduces the likelihood of changes at the Supreme Federal Court.

2. **Precedent and Mechanisms for Removal**: 
   - Ministers are rarely removed from Brazil's Supreme Federal Court unless due to a significant reason such as impeachment. Impeachment processes are complicated and require substantial political will and evidence.
   - There may be no recent precedent for ministers being removed through impeachment or resignation without a major scandal or a shift in political sentiment.

3. **Recent Developments**:
   - If there have been no significant controversies surrounding Alexandre de Moraes, it is less likely that he would step down or be removed before the stated date.
   - Public statements, political dynamics, or noteworthy legal precedents in the last few months could impact the probability.

4. **Timeline**:
   - With less than a month until the October 1, 2024 deadline, any process to remove him would need to be rapid and high-priority.
   - The short remaining timeline suggests that only already started or imminent processes could result in his ceasing to be a minister.

Based on these considerations, and without evidence of imminent upheaval or ongoing removal actions, the probability of Alexandre de Moraes ceasing to be a minister by October 1, 2024 appears low.

My Prediction: Between 5.00% and 10.00%, but 7.00% being the most likely. Probability: 7.00%.
