Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Timeline Analysis:
- Question is about Week 4 (vs Jets)
- Current date is August 14, 2024
- Week 4 will be approximately late September/early October 2024

2. Key Evidence For High Probability:
- Nix is the betting favorite (-310 odds) to start Week 1
- Strong preseason debut (15/21, 125 yards, 1 TD)
- Will start second preseason game vs Packers
- Multiple sources indicate he's impressed coaches
- First-round draft pick (12th overall)
- Coach Payton has praised his development

3. Key Evidence For Lower Probability:
- Currently listed third on unofficial depth chart
- Competition from Stidham and Wilson still ongoing
- Rookie quarterbacks can be benched if struggling
- No official announcement yet for Week 1 starter

4. Key Considerations:
- If Nix wins Week 1 job, high likelihood he keeps it through Week 4
- Would likely take poor performance or injury to lose job by Week 4
- Broncos invested significant draft capital in him
- Team appears to be grooming him as starter

5. Base Rate Analysis:
- First-round QBs who start Week 1 typically retain job through Week 4
- Team invested heavily in Nix suggesting long-term commitment

6. Recent Developments:
- Strong preseason performance
- Getting first-team reps
- Named starter for second preseason game

The evidence suggests Nix is likely to be the Week 4 starter if he wins the Week 1 job, which appears increasingly likely based on recent developments.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 80.25%, with 73.75% being the most likely. Probability: 73.75%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, let's establish what needs to happen for Bo Nix to start Week 4:
- He needs to win the starting job initially
- He needs to maintain that position through Week 4
- He needs to stay healthy

2. Evidence for Nix starting:
- Strong preseason debut (15/21, 125 yards, 1 TD)
- Current betting odds heavily favor him (-310 for Week 1)
- Coach Payton giving him first-team reps and start in second preseason game
- Multiple reports suggesting he's impressed in camp
- Other options (Stidham, Wilson) haven't shown clear superiority

3. Evidence against Nix starting:
- He's still a rookie
- Listed third on initial depth chart
- Stidham has more NFL experience
- Risk of early struggles leading to benching

4. Key factors for Week 4 specifically:
- First three games' performance will be crucial
- Early schedule difficulty could impact decision
- Injury risks over first month

5. Looking at historical patterns:
- First-round QBs generally get opportunities early
- Rookie QBs who start Week 1 tend to keep job barring injury
- Coach Payton has history of sticking with his chosen starter

6. Breaking down probability components:
- ~75% chance he starts Week 1 (based on odds and reports)
- ~90% chance he stays healthy through Week 4
- ~85% chance he maintains job if he starts Week 1

Combining these factors and accounting for various scenarios, including potential early struggles or injury:
