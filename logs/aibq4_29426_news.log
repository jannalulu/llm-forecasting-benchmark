**Up Close 10/27/24: Anthony D'Esposito, Laura Gillen battle in NY congressional race on Long Island**
The battle for control of Congress is heating up in New York, with Democrats trying to flip several Republican-held seats. In the 4th Congressional District on Long Island, Republican incumbent Anthony D'Esposito is facing a challenge from Democrat Laura Gillen, who has a double-digit lead according to a new poll. This is a rematch from two years ago, when D'Esposito beat Gillen. Bill Ritter will speak with both candidates about their campaigns ahead of Election Day in a special edition of Up Close. 'It's a tough race, but I'm feeling good about where we are,' said D'Esposito. Gillen added, 'We're running a strong campaign and we're confident that we're going to win.'

**The Long Island Feud That Could Decide Control of Congress**
The 2024 congressional election in New York's 4th district is a crucial one, as it could decide which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives. The incumbent Republican, Anthony D'Esposito, is facing a challenge from Democrat Laura Gillen. Gillen has criticized D'Esposito for his history of dubious personal and professional judgment, including three separate complaints during his police career and his recent scandal involving nepotism. D'Esposito has been accused of placing two close associates on his payroll, including the daughter of his fiancée and the woman with whom he was having an affair. Gillen said, 'I think it says a lot about his character -- and also about his intelligence.' The election is seen as a test of whether voters on Long Island will care about the scandal and kick D'Esposito out of Congress. The outcome could also be a reflection of a more widespread frustration among middle-of-the-road voters with the Democratic Party. Gillen has pledged to 'end the migrant crisis' and protect women's right to make their own health care decisions, while D'Esposito claims to be working to 'guarantee [women's] right to make their own health care decisions,' despite his history of opposing abortion rights.

**VOTE 2024: Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and Laura Gillen face off in News 12 debate**
Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and Democratic challenger Laura Gillen faced off in a News 12 Vote 2024 debate on Tuesday, focusing on issues like immigration, housing, and abortion. The candidates, who previously ran against each other in 2022, also accused each other of corruption during their times in office. As they vie for the 4th Congressional District seat, which includes a large portion of Nassau County, D'Esposito and Gillen are looking to represent New York's residents. According to Laura Gillen, 'The people of the 4th Congressional District deserve better than a representative who has been accused of corruption.' However, Rep. D'Esposito has maintained his innocence, saying that he is 'committed to serving the people of New York with integrity and transparency.'

**D'Esposito, Gillen rematch in Long Island swing district could be key to U.S. House majority**
The rematch between Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and Democratic challenger Laura Gillen in New York's 4th congressional district is one of the most competitive races of 2024. D'Esposito won the seat in 2022, but Gillen is trying to flip it back to the Democrats. Gillen said, 'People are sick of this. They're sick of the hyper-partisanship. They just want common sense, effective leadership.' D'Esposito responded, 'The same things that were bothering people in this district two years ago are the same things that are bothering them now, only the magnitude has grown.' National issues such as the border, crime, quality of life, and cost of living are driving the race. Gillen criticized D'Esposito for failing to secure the SALT deduction and for voting against reproductive freedom. D'Esposito accused Gillen of pandering to the 'radical left.' Both candidates oppose New York City congestion pricing and pledge solidarity with Israel. Gillen accused D'Esposito of cronyism and nepotism, while D'Esposito said his personal life is personal.

**NY-04 race: A rematch between longtime rivals Anthony D'Esposito and Laura Gillen**
The New York 4th Congressional District race is a rematch between Rep. Anthony D'Esposito (R) and his Democratic rival Laura Gillen. D'Esposito, a former NYPD detective, is seeking a second term after defeating Gillen in 2022 with 52% of the vote. Gillen, a commercial real estate attorney, has focused on issues like public safety, gang activity, and immigration reform. According to Christopher Malone, a political science professor, Democrats need to win one or two seats on Long Island to take back Congress. The race is considered a toss-up, with both candidates raising significant amounts of money. Gillen has criticized D'Esposito for being part of a partisan, deadlocked Congress that hasn't made progress on immigration reform and repealing the cap on the State and Local Tax deduction. D'Esposito has emphasized his law enforcement background and support for the House Republicans' border security bill. Lawrence Levy, executive dean of Hofstra University's National Center for Suburban Studies, said turnout will be key in this election, with Trump's numbers in Nassau potentially deciding the outcome.

**3 Congressional Races to Watch With Less Than a Week Until Election Day**
As the presidential election approaches, three congressional races are gaining attention. In Michigan, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D) and former Rep. Mike Rogers (R) are competing for the Senate seat of outgoing Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D), with the candidates now tied in a recent poll. In New York's 4th congressional district, Rep.

Ted Cruz is locked in a tight race against Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred, with Cruz leading by 2.5 percentage points in the latest poll. These races could determine which party wins a majority in the House of Representatives and Senate, impacting the next president's agenda.

**Laura Gillen Seeks to Unseat GOP Rep. Anthony D’Esposito in New York’s 4th Congressional District**
Laura Gillen, the Democratic candidate in New York's 4th Congressional District, is running against incumbent Republican Representative Anthony D’Esposito. Gillen's campaign focuses on key issues such as tackling the rising cost of living on Long Island and protecting reproductive rights. Her platform emphasizes the importance of expanding access to reproductive healthcare, a crucial issue for many voters. Gillen has also received support from labor unions, which could be a significant factor in her campaign. Additionally, she has criticized D’Esposito for his campaign spending and hiring practices, citing concerns about his use of taxpayer funds.

**Pivotal races that will determine the balance of power in Congress**
The balance of power in Congress will be determined by several key down-ballot races. Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the House, but Democrats are targeting a handful of races to win back control. To regain control, Democrats need to flip on net five seats across the country. They are focusing on vulnerable Republicans in Democratic states, particularly in California and New York. One key race is in New York's Fourth District, where Republican Congressman Anthony D'Esposito is being challenged by Democrat Laura Gillen. The issue of abortion is a major factor in this race, with Gillen emphasizing the importance of reproductive freedom and D'Esposito opposing a national ban. Meanwhile, Democrats are also vulnerable in swing states, with two races in Pennsylvania and two in Michigan being closely watched. In Pennsylvania's Seventh District, Republican Ryan Mackenzie is challenging incumbent Democrat Susan Wild, with the economy being a major issue in the campaign.

**House Dems desperate for a do-over on Long Island**
House Democrats are making a concerted effort to win back New York's 4th District, currently represented by embattled GOP Rep. Anthony D'Esposito. Laura Gillen, the Democratic candidate, has been campaigning aggressively, outraising her opponent by $1.45 million and knocking on over 150,000 doors. Gillen has retooled her playbook, tackling immigration and the economy head-on, and has been critical of D'Esposito's handling of the border crisis. D'Esposito has pushed back, saying he voted for a stricter House GOP border security bill, but it has gone nowhere in the Senate. Gillen has also promised to fight for small businesses, calling them the 'backbone of the community.' Republicans are not giving up hope, with Speaker Mike Johnson set to visit the district later today. D'Esposito has focused his message on securing the border and restoring the state and local tax deduction, but has been hit with recent scandals, including allegations of hiring his fiance's daughter and a woman he was allegedly having an affair with for part-time jobs in his district office.

**Control Of The House May Depend On If These New York GOP Reps Can Hang On In Pro-Biden Districts**
House Republicans' chances of retaining their majority in the House of Representatives may depend on the outcomes of four New York races, where GOP incumbents are facing tough reelection fights in previously pro-Biden districts. The candidates, Anthony D'Esposito, Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro, and Brandon Williams, must overcome challenges such as voter registration and fundraising deficits, as well as running in a presidential election year with increased turnout. According to campaign officials and written statements, the Republican incumbents are optimistic about their chances, citing local opposition to the influx of migrants in New York City, congestion pricing, and offshore wind as key issues. Despite being outraised by their opponents, the candidates are focusing on their records and the policies of their Democratic opponents, such as supporting taxpayer-funded free health care for illegal immigrants. The Cook Political Report designates three of the four races as 'toss-ups' or 'lean Democrat', while the fourth is rated as 'lean Republican'.

**7 competitive NYS races could sway balance in House**
The outcome of the upcoming election in seven New York congressional districts could determine which party controls the U.S. House for the next two years. Republicans currently hold 220 seats and Democrats 212 seats, with three vacancies. In New York, both parties are campaigning as moderates, with top issues including inflation, border security, and crime for Republicans, and abortion, health care, and protecting democracy for Democrats. Political analyst Lawrence Levy said, 'Control of Congress runs through New York State, and particularly through Long Island. There's no question about that.' The seven competitive races include three on Long Island, two in the Hudson Valley, and two upstate. Outside groups have spent a total of $86.4 million in New York races, with the most watched race being the rematch between Rep. Anthony D’Esposito (R-Island Park) and Democrat Laura Gillen in the 4th District. The outcome of these races will have long-lasting ramifications on taxes, immigration, and health care.

**New York rematch could hold key to Democratic quest for House majority**
The Democratic Party is focusing on the New York 4th Congressional District, which is seen as a key to their quest for a House majority. The district, currently represented by Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, has been trending Democratic, with President Biden winning the area by 14.6 percentage points in 2020. However, D'Esposito won the seat in 2022 by 3.6 points. This year's rematch between D'Esposito and Democrat Laura Gillen has drawn significant attention and fundraising, with Gillen leading in the polls 53-41. Democrats need to net four seats to take control of the House, and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries has said that winning this seat is crucial to their effort. The candidates have been moderating their stances on issues like immigration and abortion, with Gillen focusing on securing the southern border and D'Esposito presenting himself as a moderate on reproductive rights. A recent report alleging D'Esposito's abuse of power has become a major issue in the campaign, with Gillen leaning into the allegations and D'Esposito denying any wrongdoing.

**Democrats look to flip Republican-held congressional seats on Long Island**
Long Island is poised to play a crucial role in the upcoming congressional elections, with Democrats looking to flip several Republican-held seats. In the 4th District, Democrat Laura Gillen is challenging freshman Republican Congressman Anthony D'Esposito, who is facing a 12-point deficit in a recent poll. A bombshell New York Times report has also accused D'Esposito of putting his fiancee's daughter and mistress on the same payroll, costing taxpayers nearly $30,000. D'Esposito has denied the allegations, calling it a 'political hit piece.' In the 1st District, Republican Nick LaLota is locked in a tight race with former journalist John Avlon, who has been critical of the Republican Party's stance on issues like January 6th. Meanwhile, in the 2nd District, Republican Andrew Garbarino is seeking a third term in office, but faces a challenge from 29-year-old entrepreneur and Democrat Rob Lubin. In the 3rd District, Democrat Tom Suozzi is running against Republican Mike LiPetri, with the migrant crisis emerging as a top voting issue.

**Opinion: Not a New Yorker? These NY House races could still impact you this election.**
New York's seven competitive U.S. House races could impact the outcome of the 2024 election. Two of the races, the 4th Congressional District and the 19th Congressional District, are considered toss-ups. Republican incumbents Anthony D'Esposito and Marc Molinaro are facing off against Democrats Laura Gillen and Josh Riley, respectively. D'Esposito is running on a 'tough on crime' platform, while Molinaro has begun pushing anti-immigrant rhetoric. Riley is highlighting his commitment to cutting taxes for the middle class and protecting abortion access. In the 17th Congressional District, Republican Mike Lawler is facing off against Mondaire Jones, with a third-party candidate, Anthony Frascone, also on the ballot. Lawler has been criticized for wearing blackface in college, while Jones has pointed out Lawler's record on public safety. The outcome of these races could determine whether the GOP holds its majority in the House.

A new poll from Gotham Polling & Analytics shows a dead heat between GOP Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and Democrat Laura Gillen in the contentious race for New York's 4th Congressional District. The poll has D'Esposito at 46% and Gillen at 45% among likely voters. The top issues for voters were inflation, the economy, and immigration, with women also citing abortion as a top concern. The poll contradicts a recent Newsday/Siena College survey that had Gillen with a 12-point lead. Nassau County Democratic leader and state party chairman Jay Jacobs said the earlier poll reflected 'on-the-ground sentiment,' but D'Esposito's campaign is internally confident, with D'Esposito up 3 points over Gillen.

**New York's 6 Pivotal House Races: Here's What to Know**
New York's 6 pivotal House races are shaping up to be crucial in the 2024 election. The six districts, five held by Republicans, will decide the House majority. Democrats hold voter registration advantages in almost all of them, but polls show Republicans' focus on the southern border is resonating. Key issues include crime, inflation, and immigration. Representative Nick LaLota is favored to win re-election in New York's 1st District, while Laura Gillen is hoping to flip New York's 4th District back to Democrats. Mondaire Jones is trying to retire Representative Mike Lawler in New York's 17th District, but Lawler's moderate image and labor union support may insulate him. Representative Pat Ryan is hoping his willingness to buck his party will win him another term in New York's 18th District. Alison Esposito is challenging Ryan, attacking him for failing to secure the southern border. Representative Marc Molinaro is facing off against Josh Riley in New York's 19th District, with over $25 million worth of political ads scheduled to run. Representative Brandon Williams, a conservative freshman Republican, is widely considered the most vulnerable sitting congressman in the country, facing John Mannion in New York's 22nd District.

**GOP Rep. D'Esposito won't back renewing Trump tax cuts without one...**
Freshman Rep. Anthony D'Esposito said he will oppose renewing the Trump tax cuts unless Congress restores the state and local tax deduction (SALT) to heavily burdened Long Island homeowners. D'Esposito, a Republican, said, 'If there is no SALT, we're not supporting it.' He is facing a tight re-election campaign against Democrat Laura Gillen in the 4th Congressional District. D'Esposito has backed a proposal to eliminate the 'marriage penalty' for joint filers making under $500,000. He also said that Trump, in a recent about-face, has pledged to lift the cap or fully restore the SALT deduction if re-elected. D'Esposito is part of the House bipartisan SALT caucus pushing to restore the deduction. He said lawmakers will have to find offsetting cuts or savings to make up for the loss of revenue to restore SALT. Gillen, on the other hand, said D'Esposito has failed to deliver on SALT during his two-year term and is counting on voters to forget his failure.

**2024 US Elections: A Historic Shift in the US Congress?**
The 2024 US elections could lead to a historic shift in the US Congress, with the House of Representatives potentially falling under Democratic control, while the Senate would be controlled by Republicans. This scenario has never been seen in the 230-year history of the US Congress. The electoral maps for the House of Representatives and the Senate are very different, which explains this possible inversion. Democrats need only four more seats to regain the majority in the House. Democrats have a higher chance of winning in the House. In New York, four Republican-held seats in 2022 could flip to Democrats. A recent Newsday/Siena College poll shows that Democratic candidate Laura Gillen is leading Republican candidate Anthony D'Esposito in the 4th district by 12 points. Other polls indicate that Democrats could also win in the 17th, 19th, and 22nd districts, where the races are very close. The fight for Senate control is much more difficult for Democrats. Republicans could win two key seats, including in West Virginia, where Joe Manchin is retiring, and in Montana, where Jon Tester is facing a tough battle. Other opportunities for Republicans are in Ohio, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The trend of voting in line with presidential elections is becoming more common. In 2020, only 4% of House districts voted differently for the presidential election and their representative in the House. This phenomenon makes predictions clearer: districts won by Biden are now top targets for Democrats. In California, five Republican-held seats could also be won by Democrats, strengthening the possibility of a Democratic majority in the House. A historic result is possible?

**Republicans defend narrow House majority as Democrats eye five seats**
Republicans are defending their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 5 elections, with Democrats needing to flip just five seats to win control. The most competitive races to watch include New York's 4th Congressional District, where Republican Representative Anthony D'Esposito is facing off against Laura Gillen, and Maine's 2nd District, where Democratic Representative Jared Golden is being challenged by Austin Theriault. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Representatives Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright are defending their swing district seats against Republican challengers. Democrats are also targeting Republican-held seats in Arizona and Nebraska, where they hope to capitalize on Biden's narrow wins in 2020. In California, Democrats are hoping to pick up seats in districts that elected Republican representatives but voted for Biden in 2020. Meanwhile, in Washington and Oregon, voters will decide whether to re-elect moderate Representatives Marie Glusenkamp Perez and Lori Chavez-DeRemer, respectively.

In the 1st Congressional district, Democratic challenger John Avlon is almost tied with first-term Republican Congressman Nick LaLota, with LaLota leading 47 to 44%. Avlon said, 'I just saw this election, especially with the renomination of Donald Trump after January 6th as one of those times where citizens need to step up, roll up their sleeves and get in the arena.' Political experts say the poll shows possible Democratic enthusiasm, but it will be proven on Election Day.

**New York delivered Republicans the House in 2022. Will the blue state help them keep it in 2024?**
In the 2024 US House of Representatives election, two key districts in New York are up for grabs. Freshman Rep. Pat Ryan, a Democrat, is running for re-election in the 18th District, while his Republican opponent, Alison Esposito, is trying to flip the seat. Ryan's focus on reproductive rights has resonated with voters, but Esposito believes the election will be decided on hot-button issues like crime, public safety, and the economy. Meanwhile, in the 17th District, freshman GOP Rep. Mike Lawler is campaigning to keep his seat, emphasizing practicality and common sense. His Democratic opponent, former Rep. Mondaire Jones, is seeking to chart a path back to his old seat, citing past work on the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act and a 'pro-choice, pro-democracy' platform. The two races have seen over $42 million worth of ads flood the airwaves, with both incumbents trying to focus on the political middle.

**Democrat Gillen opens double-digit lead over Republican D'Esposito in...**
A new poll by Newsday/Siena College has shown that Democratic candidate Laura Gillen is leading Republican candidate Anthony D'Esposito by 12 percentage points in New York's 4th Congressional District. The poll found that Gillen has the support of 53% of likely voters, while D'Esposito has 41%. The poll also showed that Democrat Kamala Harris is leading Republican Donald Trump by the same 12-point margin in the district's presidential contest. D'Esposito's campaign pollster, John McLaughlin, disputed the poll's findings, claiming that it undercounted observant Jews and self-declared conservatives. However, Nassau County Democratic leader Jay Jacobs said that the survey 'reflects what we're feeling on the ground' and that Gillen is 'going to win substantially.' Jacobs also suggested that D'Esposito was hurt by Trump's claims about Haitian immigrants, which offended voters in the district.

**The Long Island Feud That Could Decide Control of Congress**
The 2024 congressional election in New York's 4th district is a crucial one, as it could decide which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives. The incumbent Republican, Anthony D'Esposito, is facing a challenge from Democrat Laura Gillen. Gillen has criticized D'Esposito for his history of dubious personal and professional judgment, including three separate complaints during his police career and his recent scandal involving nepotism. D'Esposito has been accused of placing two close associates on his payroll, including the daughter of his fiancée and the woman with whom he was having an affair. Gillen said, 'I think it says a lot about his character -- and also about his intelligence.' The election is seen as a test of whether voters on Long Island will care about the scandal and kick D'Esposito out of Congress. The outcome could also be a reflection of a more widespread frustration among middle-of-the-road voters with the Democratic Party. Gillen has pledged to 'end the migrant crisis' and protect women's right to make their own health care decisions, while D'Esposito claims to be working to 'guarantee [women's] right to make their own health care decisions,' despite his history of opposing abortion rights.

**Polls Show Hopeful Numbers for New York Democrats**
Two recent polls are showing positive signs for Democratic challengers in New York. A Siena College poll shows Democrat Laura Gillen leading Republican incumbent congressman Anthony D'Esposito 53% to 41% in the Fourth Congressional District, while another Siena College poll shows Republican congressman Nick LaLota leading political commentator John Avlon 47% to 44% in the First Congressional District. The Cook Political Report currently has LaLota's seat as 'likely Republican,' while D'Esposito's seat is considered a 'toss-up.' The polls suggest that the New York suburbs are becoming increasingly variable, with Vice-President Kamala Harris leading former president Donald Trump in both districts, but by varying margins. A statewide poll also showed Harris with a significant lead over Trump, 58% to 39%.

**New York congressional races: One Republican way behind, another just ahead**
A recent poll of two New York congressional races shows Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito trailing his Democratic opponent, Laura Gillen, by 12 percentage points in the 4th Congressional District, while Republican Rep. Nick LaLota leads his Democratic challenger, John Avlon, by 3 percentage points in the 1st Congressional District. Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump in both districts. The poll's margin of error was 4.4% and 4.5% respectively. D'Esposito is under scrutiny for allegedly paying a woman he was having an affair with to work in his district office. He called the allegations 'tabloid garbage' and a 'slimy, partisan 'hit piece''. Republicans are trying to bring out their supporters by cautioning constituents about the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1, which they claim would favor illegal immigrants and let noncitizens vote in New York elections.

**Key Takeaways From New York's 4th Congressional District Debate**
Rep. Anthony D'Esposito (R-N.Y.) and Democrat Laura Gillen debated in New York's 4th Congressional District on Oct. 15. D'Esposito, a former NYPD officer, has represented the district since 2023, while Gillen was Hempstead Town Supervisor. They are set for a rematch of 2022, when D'Esposito won with 51.8% of the vote, flipping the district and helping the GOP gain control of the House. Gillen called for pressuring university presidents to address anti-Semitism and threatening to strip federal funding from schools that fail to combat the issue. D'Esposito cited his work on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council and bringing in almost $10 million to his district to combat anti-Semitism. Gillen also called for ensuring access to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and protecting reproductive freedom, saying, 'It is not a state's right. It's a human right.' D'Esposito refuted an ad from Gillen that decried legislation he supported to criminalize doctors who perform an abortion, saying that the West Hempstead law requires doctors to save the life of a baby just born and that if they do not, they would be criminally charged.

**NY-04 race: A rematch between longtime rivals Anthony D'Esposito and Laura Gillen**
The New York 4th Congressional District race is a rematch between Rep. Anthony D'Esposito (R) and his Democratic rival Laura Gillen. D'Esposito, a former NYPD detective, is seeking a second term after defeating Gillen in 2022 with 52% of the vote. Gillen, a commercial real estate attorney, has focused on issues like public safety, gang activity, and immigration reform. According to Christopher Malone, a political science professor, Democrats need to win one or two seats on Long Island to take back Congress. The race is considered a toss-up, with both candidates raising significant amounts of money. Gillen has criticized D'Esposito for being part of a partisan, deadlocked Congress that hasn't made progress on immigration reform and repealing the cap on the State and Local Tax deduction. D'Esposito has emphasized his law enforcement background and support for the House Republicans' border security bill. Lawrence Levy, executive dean of Hofstra University's National Center for Suburban Studies, said turnout will be key in this election, with Trump's numbers in Nassau potentially deciding the outcome.

**New York-18: Rep. Pat Ryan is a Patriot. Is That Enough to Hold Down This District?**
The 2024 election for New York's 18th Congressional District is a closely watched race between incumbent Rep. Pat Ryan and challenger Alison Esposito. Ryan, a Democrat, has a history of winning close elections and has served as a military intelligence officer and a software company executive. Esposito, a Republican, has a troubling police officer record and has been accused of being a carpetbagger for the seat. The district is considered a swing seat, and both parties are investing heavily in the race. According to a recent poll, the race is tied, but Ryan's status as a patriot and his track record of winning close elections may give him an edge. 'There's no doubt that control of the House runs through New York and runs specifically through the Hudson Valley,' said Ryan. 'We feel that responsibility and duty.' The question is whether Ryan's past history as a patriot for this country is enough to secure another win in New York's 18th district.

**New York rep's ethics mess adds to the House GOP's many troubles**
New York Rep. Anthony D'Esposito is facing ethics questions after allegations surfaced that he hired his fiancée's daughter and a woman with whom he was having an affair to work in his district office, potentially misusing $29,000 in taxpayer funds. According to The New York Times, D'Esposito paid the woman with whom he was having an affair $2,000 a month for a part-time job, in addition to the $3,800 a month he was paying his fiancée's daughter. D'Esposito described the article as a 'hit piece' and 'tabloid garbage,' but said that his personal life has never interfered with his ability to deliver results for New York's 4th district. However, congressional ethics experts said that employing a woman akin to his stepdaughter could breach the requirement that members of Congress 'adhere to the spirit and the letter of the rules.' The latest allegations may not help D'Esposito's re-election bid, as he narrowly defeated Democrat Laura Gillen in 2022 and the two will face off in a rematch in November.
