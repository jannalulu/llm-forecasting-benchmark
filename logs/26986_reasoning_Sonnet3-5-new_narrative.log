Here's a 150-word script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot on again regarding those Chinese aircraft incursions over Taiwan."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those 'punishment drills' in May, our models had it at 72.35%."

Nate: "The patterns were clear. That June spike with 66 aircraft in two days was a strong indicator. Add in China's increasingly aggressive stance toward the DPP administration..."

Tetlock: "Plus the historical August-September activity spikes. *adjusts glasses* The timing of this window was particularly volatile, especially with the one-year anniversary of Pelosi's visit still fresh in Beijing's memory."

Nate: "Another win for superforecasting. Though I wish we'd been wrong about this one."

[They both stare solemnly at their screens]

Here's a script set on September 16, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, another accurate forecast. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June drills, our models had it at 72.35%."

Philip: [nodding] "The patterns were clear. China's increasing military pressure since May, especially those 66 aircraft over two days in June, suggested a high probability of exceeding 60 aircraft in a single day during this period. The historical data from PLATracker showed an upward trend."

Nate: "And here we are, September 16th. China sent 78 aircraft yesterday, right after their annual military exercises. The models never lie."

Philip: "Indeed. The combination of seasonal patterns, political tensions, and China's strategic signaling made this almost predictable. Taiwan's ADIZ violations have become quite the reliable indicator of cross-strait relations."

[They both turn back to their screens, already working on the next forecast.]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data on their monitors.]

Nate: "Well, Philip, another accurate forecast. Given the escalating tensions after Lai's inauguration and those June military drills, our models had it at 72.35%."

Philip: [nodding] "The signs were there. The 66 aircraft over two days in June was a clear indicator. After analyzing the patterns following Taiwan's elections and China's 'punishment' drills, the probability was significant."

Nate: "The crossing of 60 aircraft in a single day wasn't surprising. China's increasing pressure tactics, especially during sensitive political periods, made this almost predictable."

Philip: "And with the PRC's rhetoric about the DPP being 'hostile separatists,' the August-September window was particularly volatile. Our models captured that tension perfectly."

[They both turn to update their forecasting models with the new data]
