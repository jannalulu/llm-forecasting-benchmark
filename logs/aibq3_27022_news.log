**Astronauts Stranded in Space Have Limited Time Left**
Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were supposed to return to Earth on June 13, are stranded in the International Space Station due to a series of failures in the Boeing Starliner. The main issue is that the fuel is running out, and the re-entry window is closing. The Starliner's Harmony module has enough fuel for 45 days, and the astronauts have already been in space for over a month. They have around 15 days left to return to Earth, or they will have to wait for someone to come and retrieve them. The problems started after the launch, when it was discovered that the Starliner had 5 helium leaks in its propulsion system, and later, 5 more leaks were found in its control system. The NASA says that if the worst-case scenario occurs and the astronauts are stranded, the International Space Station has enough supplies to sustain them.
