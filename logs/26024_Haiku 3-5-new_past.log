Key Evidence Analysis:
1. Early Betting Odds Favor Nix:
- Multiple articles show Bo Nix is -400 favorite to start Week 1
- Implies ~80% probability of starting early in season
- Suggests strong organizational confidence

2. Quarterback Competition Context:
- Three-way competition between Nix, Stidham, and Wilson
- Nix is 12th overall draft pick
- Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix's quick learning
- Nix has 61 college game starts, considered "pro-ready"

3. Progression Indicators:

Key Evidence:
- Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall by the Broncos in 2024
- Multiple sources suggest Nix is the favorite to start Week 1
- Sean Payton has praised Nix, saying he's "farther along than most rookies"
- Nix is competing with Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson

Let me carefully analyze this question, focusing on the key details and evidence:

Quarterback Situation Analysis:
1. Current Context (as of July 11, 2024):
- Bo Nix was drafted 12th overall by the Broncos
- QB competition involves Nix, Jarrett Stidham, and Zach Wilson
- Head Coach Sean Payton has praised Nix, saying he's "farther along than most rookies"
- Betting markets consistently favor Nix as Week 1 starter (around 80% probability)

Evidence Strength:
Strong Arguments FOR Nix Starting:
- High draft capital (12th overall pick)
- Extensive college experience (61 games)
- Praised for quick playbook comprehension
- Fits Payton's offensive system well
- Betting markets consistently favor him

Counterarguments:
- Rookie quarterbacks don't always start immediately

- Payton's comments suggest confidence in Nix

Adjustment for Week 4 Specifically:
- More time to evaluate and prepare
- Less pressure than immediate Week 1 start
- Higher probability of being starter compared to Week 1

Probabilistic Reasoning:
Considering all factors, I estimate a higher likelihood of Nix starting by Week 4.

My Prediction: Between 75.50% and 89.90%, but 82.25% being the most likely. Probability: 82.25%.
