**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Did the Prime Minister of France come from Macron's Together alliance?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, Nate. Our models had it at 45.25%. The snap elections created a unique balance of power.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed, the National Assembly is quite divided. The New Popular Front gained significant traction, and the National Rally held its ground.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The political landscape shifted dramatically. The Together coalition just couldn't secure the majority needed.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. It's a testament to how dynamic and unpredictable politics can be, even with accurate models.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. It reminds us that while probabilities guide us, the outcomes often surprise.

*NATE nods, both reflecting on the unpredictability of politics.*
