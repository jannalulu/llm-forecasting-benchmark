[Scene: A dimly lit caf√© in Berlin, the morning after the Brandenburg election. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a corner table, newspapers scattered between their coffee cups.]

Nate: *stirring his coffee thoughtfully* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. We had it at 33.75%."

Philip: "Indeed. The rising trend we saw in East German states was unmistakable. Thuringia's 32.8% was a clear indicator, and Brandenburg's economic anxieties mirrored those patterns."

Nate: "The polls leading up to September 12th showed increasing support, especially in rural areas. The combination of energy prices, immigration concerns, and general dissatisfaction with mainstream parties created perfect conditions."

Philip: "What's particularly interesting is how the AfD managed to mobilize previous non-voters. Their messaging resonated strongly in Brandenburg's industrial regions."

Nate: *picking up a newspaper* "And here we are, another eastern state where AfD has crossed the 32% threshold. The political landscape is shifting dramatically."

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again. Given the surge in AfD's popularity in Eastern Germany and the polling trends we saw up until September 12th, our models had it at 33.75%."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The economic anxiety, combined with the immigration concerns we tracked, showed a clear trajectory. The previous results in Saxony and Thuringia were strong indicators. Remember how some dismissed our forecasts as alarmist?"

Nate: "The pattern was clear in the data. The 10-point jump from their 2019 performance wasn't surprising given the political climate. Even the classification as a 'suspected extremist' party didn't deter voters."

Tetlock: "Though I must say, the margin still makes me uneasy for what it means for German democracy."

[They both stare solemnly at the election maps on their screens]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Philip, our models were spot on again. Given the surge in AfD's popularity in Eastern Germany and the polling trends we saw up until September 12th, our models had it at 34.75%."

Tetlock: "Indeed. The economic uncertainty, combined with the migration concerns we tracked, created perfect conditions for AfD's strongest showing yet in Brandenburg. The jump from their 23.5% in 2019 was significant but not unexpected."

Nate: "The patterns we observed in Saxony and Thuringia were clear indicators. The rising support in rural areas, particularly among working-class voters, matched our predictive models perfectly."

Tetlock: "Though some called us alarmist, the data simply couldn't be ignored. The trend lines from Eastern German state elections were remarkably consistent."
