**Russia Expands Evacuation Efforts in Kursk Region Amid Ongoing Ukrainian Attack**
The local authorities in the Russian region of Kursk are preparing to evacuate another area as Ukraine continues its attack across the border. Vladimir Zaitsev, the head of the local region, wrote on Telegram that plans to evacuate the residents of the area of Bolshesoldatsky are currently being prepared. He added, 'So far, we have not evacuated our area. Everyone left voluntarily, no one was prevented from doing so. Today, we are collecting data on those who need to be evacuated.' The previously evacuated areas were located near the Ukrainian-Russian border, but Bolshesoldatsky is located deeper inside Russian territory. The administrative center of the region is the small town of Bolshoy Soldatskoy, which is approximately 36 kilometers from the border. Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, around 11,000 people lived in the region, according to official numbers. Russians have been fleeing border communities since the start of the Ukrainian attack a week ago. The flow of refugees continues, with over 2,000 people leaving the border area independently or in organized convoys yesterday, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The ministry did not specify the total number of people who left during the past week, but the acting governor of Kursk estimated the number to be around 120,000 people yesterday.

**Ukraine continues major incursion into Russia, with reports of advances amid heavy fighting**
Ukrainian forces have continued to advance deeper into Russia's Kursk region, expanding their area of control on the third day of their major incursion, according to pro-Kremlin Russian military bloggers. The situation is worsening for Russian forces, with reports of heavy fighting and Ukrainian armored units reaching the village of Bolshoe Soldatskoe, roughly 18.5 miles inside Russia's border. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, commented on the operation, saying one goal was to alter the Russian perception of the war, which could potentially affect any eventual negotiations. 'This increases the cost of the war for Russia quantitatively. More armored vehicles have been destroyed, the Russian Federation has lost territories, and there have been more casualties. Will this affect how they perceive this war? Undoubtedly,' Podolyak said. Ukrainian officials have been almost entirely silent on the operation, with speculation swirling around its possible goals, including pulling Russian forces from elsewhere in Ukraine or seizing the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant.

**Ukrainian Forces Capture Russian Soldier on Left Bank of Dnieper River**
The Ukrainian Defense Forces have taken a Russian soldier prisoner in the Krynky area on the left bank of the Kherson region. According to Dmitry Likhoy, a spokesperson for the 'Tavria' operational-strategic group of the ZSU, the Russian forces stormed Ukrainian positions on the islands west of Krynky, but were repelled. 'This is a rare occurrence when a Russian soldier is captured on the left bank of the Dnieper River,' Likhoy said. 'It's because our units are involved in crossing the Dnieper, but it does happen.' The captured soldier will be added to the exchange fund and provide testimony about the Russian contingent, including on the left bank of the Kherson region. The left bank of the Kherson region remains under Russian control, but the Ukrainian forces have been holding a foothold near Krynky since the fall of 2023. Ukrainian forces have been fighting for islands between the right and left banks near Krynky, with 788 Ukrainian soldiers reported missing in action in the Krynky area between October 2023 and June 2024, and 262 bodies recovered and buried.

**Russia Claims Capture of Sviridonivka, Ukraine Denies Loss of Positions**
The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the capture of the village of Sviridonivka in the Donetsk region, near Pokrovsk. However, the Ukrainian General Staff stated that the Russian army launched a massive attack in the area of the villages of Pivnichne and Zalizne, 50 kilometers from Sviridonivka. According to the General Staff, 'Russian occupiers, supported by a group of 12 units of equipment, attempted to break through the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and advance towards Toretsk.' The Ukrainian side assured that 'the attack was repelled and no positions were lost.' The General Staff also reported that the Russians launched 19 attacks near Pivnichne, Toretsk, and Zalizne, supported by aviation. 'Our defenders were repelling 46 storming and assault actions of the aggressor towards the villages of Vozdvyzhenske, Mirolyubivka, Novotroitske, Novohrodivka, Hrodivka, Mykolaivka, Zelanyi, and Zavitne. The largest concentration of enemy attacks was near Hrodivka, Mykolaivka, and Novozelanyi, where the enemy actively used storming and bombing aviation,' - the General Staff reported. The administration of the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, in the face of the Russian army's advance, has once again called on residents to evacuate the city. The head of the Pokrovsk MVA, Sergei Dobryak, also urged residents not to delay and leave the city, as Russian troops are approaching very close to it. 'We see that today the enemy approached almost up to our community - a little more than 10 kilometers from the outskirts of the city of Pokrovsk,' - he said.

**Russian Residents Struggle to Receive Evacuation Payments**
Residents of the village of Bolshoe Soldatskoe in the Kursk region have complained that they are not receiving evacuation payments despite being forced to evacuate due to Ukrainian military attacks. According to a local resident, the village was not included in the list of affected areas, despite frequent attacks that caused many residents to flee their homes. The resident explained, 'We were told that we don't count as victims because we left on our own free will.' However, the resident noted that the village had already been affected by strong attacks a few days before the Ukrainian military's attack, which damaged the administration building, morgue, and several homes, and resulted in the death of a local resident due to shrapnel injuries. The resident attempted to apply for compensation but was unable to do so due to a long queue. Meanwhile, the acting governor of the Kursk region, Alexey Smirnov, announced that residents who were affected by the Ukrainian military's attacks and had to leave their homes would start receiving compensation. The compensation amount is 10,000 rubles.

**Russia Captures Ukrainian Towns in Eastern Front Battle**
The Ukrainian forces have suffered a significant defeat on the eastern front, with Russian forces capturing the towns of Urozhaine and Staromajorske. The Ukrainian army had previously held these towns, but was forced to retreat after heavy Russian attacks. The Russian army has made significant gains in the region, with the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reporting that they have captured several towns and villages. The Ukrainian army is struggling to hold its ground, with an anonymous Ukrainian soldier complaining about the lack of Western tanks to counter the Russian drone threat. An officer described the fighting as 'like a fight between two dog packs', with Ukrainian forces suffering heavy losses. The Ukrainian army has lost up to 100 soldiers in the fighting around Urozhaine since October 2023.

**Russian Forces Focus on Capturing Two Cities in Donetsk Region**
Russian forces are focusing on capturing two cities in the Donetsk region, New York and Toretsk, to secure further advancement towards Kostiantynivka. According to Alexander Musiyenko, head of the Center for Military Legal Studies, the enemy is attacking both areas to move towards Kostiantynivka from different sides. Musiyenko emphasized that the goal of the occupiers is to level the frontline, stretch Ukrainian defenses, advance towards Kostiantynivka, and attempt to encircle or surround Ukrainian forces near Chasovy Yar. He noted that the intensity of battles may show how things will unfold. The enemy is trying to destroy New York, using sometimes a superiority in firepower, but Ukrainian forces are holding back the attack, which has not been successful in terms of infantry attacks. Musiyenko believes that the enemy will continue to take active offensive actions for another month, until mid-August, and then the attack will gradually subside. He also stated that the Ukrainian military needs to hold out for a few weeks, after which the enemy's attack will 'gradually fade away', becoming less active or even taking a pause until October.

**Ruins of the 'Kanal' Microdistrict in Chasiv Yar: Captured by Russian Forces**
Photos taken from above show the ruins of the 'Kanal' microdistrict in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk region, which was captured by Russian forces. The area is now similar to the nearby city of Bakhmut, which is less than 10 kilometers away. The microdistrict, located on the other side of the canal towards Bakhmut, has no surviving homes. The area is covered in craters from Russian bombs and shells, and even trees and bushes have not grown between the former high-rise buildings due to enemy shelling. Meanwhile, Russian forces continue to shell the city and surrounding areas. The 'Kanal' microdistrict is separated from the rest of the city by the Seversky Donets-Dnieper canal, where Ukrainian forces are currently holding their defense. The battles on this section began in early April 2024, when the aggressor advanced along the entire front west of Bakhmut. Russian forces, with their advantage in weapons and ammunition, first destroyed all homes and buildings in 'Kanal', and then 'captured' the ruins, calling their actions 'liberation'. However, they were only able to do so after Ukrainian forces announced on July 3 that they had withdrawn from the microdistrict, as it was no longer feasible to hold it, and the defenders' positions were destroyed. According to OBOZ.UA, there are still 635 local residents living in the city of Chasiv Yar, including young people. Since the beginning of this week, no one has agreed to evacuate from the settlement, where battles are taking place.
