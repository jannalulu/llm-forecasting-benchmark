**Israel and Hamas: Advances and Retreats in the Negotiation of a Lasting Ceasefire**
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems closer to an end than ever, with the latest US proposal being met with initial approval from both sides. The proposal, presented by US President Joe Biden on May 31, includes a three-phase plan for a ceasefire, with each phase lasting 42 days. The plan includes the release of Palestinian prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas, and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. However, the Hamas has rejected the proposal, presenting a counter-proposal that includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the entire Gaza Strip and the end of Israeli control over the Philadelphia Corridor and the Rafah crossing. The Israeli government has accepted the proposal, but with reservations, and has presented new demands, which may delay the negotiation process.

**Qatar, Egypt, US call on Hamas, Israel to finalise Biden's Gaza truce plan**
Qatar, the United States, and Egypt have called on Hamas and Israel to finalize a ceasefire agreement based on the principles outlined by US President Joe Biden on May 31, 2024. The agreement would involve the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas in Gaza, the release of detainees, and the entry of aid into the Strip. The mediators hope that the parties will deal positively with the principles, which include a six-week phase of Israeli withdrawal, the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and negotiations for a lasting ceasefire. The US President has urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer, saying it's time for the war to end.

**Israel presents new proposal to Hamas for lasting ceasefire**
US President Joe Biden announced on Friday (May 31, 2024) that Israel has offered a new proposal to Hamas for a lasting ceasefire in the Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip. The proposal includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian territory for six weeks in exchange for the release of all hostages held by the terrorist group. The proposal has three phases: the first phase would involve a complete ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of the Gaza Strip, and the release of several hostages, including women, elderly, and wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve negotiations between Israel and Hamas to finalize the details of the permanent end of hostilities, the release of the remaining hostages, including soldiers, and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip. The third and final phase would involve a large-scale reconstruction plan for the Palestinian enclave and the return of the bodies of the assassinated hostages.

**Israel's Premier Ignored International Appeal for Ceasefire with Hamas Before US Visit**
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under pressure to accept a ceasefire agreement with the Hamas terrorist group to end the war in the Gaza Strip, which has lasted over nine months. Despite international pressure, Netanyahu has not announced any high-level meetings since the last round of negotiations, suggesting that the talks are stalled. Many in Israel, especially families of hostages, have increasingly blamed Netanyahu for not doing enough to reach a deal to end the war. The premier's speech before a divided US Congress is expected to be contentious, especially if he does not announce a deal with Hamas before traveling. Netanyahu has said that applying more military pressure on Hamas would result in more concessions in negotiations, suggesting that a deal is not imminent. The proposed agreement suggests a three-stage ceasefire, with the first phase lasting six weeks, during which a permanent truce would be negotiated. Israel wants to reserve the option to continue fighting until the destruction of the terrorist group, although the military has said it is impossible to eliminate the group due to its ideology. The Hamas insists that Israel guarantee a permanent ceasefire before the release of hostages. The situation is tense, with international leaders, health organizations, and human rights groups calling for a ceasefire. The war has killed over 38,000 people and led to widespread famine, according to Gaza health authorities.

**Israel and Hamas Propose Ceasefire and Hostage Release**
The Israeli newspaper The Times of Israel published a document that is said to be the entire proposal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages presented by the United States on May 27. The document outlines the principles for an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian side in Gaza on the exchange of hostages and prisoners, and the restoration of a sustainable ceasefire. The proposal is composed of three interconnected phases, subject to the following conditions: The first phase (42 days) includes the temporary cessation of military operations, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and the return of displaced persons to their homes. The second phase (42 days) includes the exchange of remaining Israeli hostages and prisoners, and the restoration of a sustainable ceasefire. The third phase (42 days) includes the exchange of all remaining remains between the two sides, the start of the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, and the opening of border crossings. The guarantors of the agreement are Qatar, Egypt, and the United States.

**Hamas Agrees To Israeli-Biden Ceasefire**
Hamas has agreed to a US proposal to initiate discussions on the release of Israeli hostages, including soldiers and civilians, 16 days after the initial phase of an accord designed to terminate the Gaza conflict. The militant Islamist group has relinquished its demand for Israel to commit to a permanent ceasefire prior to signing the agreement, allowing for negotiations to pursue this goal during the initial six-week phase. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Joe Biden have dispatched senior delegations to engage with Qatar, Egypt, and Hamas, fostering hopes that the agreement may be successfully concluded. The deal aims to cease the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has lasted nearly nine months and resulted in over 38,000 fatalities, and secure the release of hostages taken during the terrorist attacks by Hamas on October 7.

**Hamas Accepts US-Backed Ceasefire Agreement in Gaza**
Hamas has accepted a US-backed ceasefire agreement in Gaza, which includes the withdrawal of its demands for Israel to completely stop its war. The agreement was facilitated by Egyptian and US officials. According to the agreement, Israel will withdraw its forces from densely populated areas of Gaza for 42 days, allowing Palestinians to return to their homes. In return, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including women, elderly, and wounded. The agreement also includes the exchange of bodies of the dead and the start of a one-year 'reconstruction' project. Two officials said that Hamas has guaranteed that it will continue to negotiate for a permanent ceasefire agreement with Israel after the first stage of the agreement is implemented. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has been ongoing for years, with Israel's attacks on Gaza resulting in the deaths of over 38,000 Palestinians and the injury of nearly 85,000 others.

**Hamas accepts US proposal to discuss Israeli hostage release**
The Hamas has accepted the proposal from the United States to discuss the possible release of Israeli hostages. This information was given by a member of the extremist group to Reuters on Saturday (July 6, 2024). The group accepted to negotiate before Israel's commitment to a ceasefire. This comes 16 days after the start of an agreement to end the conflict in Gaza, which has been ongoing for 9 months. According to US government authorities, the Hamas' response 'may provide the basis for closing the agreement'. The agreement in phases developed by Washington would include a 6-week 'complete' ceasefire, which would see the release of several hostages, including women, the elderly, and wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. During the 42 days, Israeli forces would withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza and allow the return of displaced people to their homes in the north of the region. According to Reuters, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the talks would continue next week.

**Hamas receives guarantees from mediators that war will not resume, according to AP**
Hamas has agreed to a proposal for a phased ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and an exchange of prisoners with Israel, after receiving 'verbal pledges and guarantees' from mediators that the war will not resume. The agreement will include a six-week cessation of hostilities, during which Israeli forces will withdraw from densely populated areas in Gaza and allow the return of displaced people. Hamas will negotiate with Israel and mediators on the terms of the second phase, which may see the release of additional Palestinian prisoners. The movement still wants 'written guarantees' from the mediators that Israel will continue to negotiate a permanent ceasefire agreement once the first phase comes into force.

**Hamas Drops Demand for Israeli Commitment, Ceasefire Talks Continue**
Hamas has reportedly dropped its demand for a written Israeli commitment to end the war before a ceasefire can be reached. This development could lead to a temporary ceasefire in the Gaza conflict. According to Egyptian sources, Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire plan that includes a six-week truce, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the return of displaced people to their homes. The plan also includes the release of women, elderly people, and wounded prisoners. In return, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and withdraw its troops from densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire plan is not yet finalized, and all parties involved have emphasized that a full agreement is not guaranteed. The United Nations has warned of the risk of a broader conflict, as tensions between Israel and the Hisbollah militia in Lebanon have increased.

**Hamas and Israel to Start Negotiations to Release Hostages and Achieve Lasting Ceasefire**
Hamas and Israel have agreed to start negotiations to release Israeli hostages and achieve a lasting ceasefire. The negotiations will be facilitated by international mediators and will begin with a six-week initial phase. A Palestinian official close to the peace efforts said that if Israel accepts the proposal, it could lead to a framework agreement and end the nine-month war in Gaza. An Israeli source from the negotiation team said that there is now a real chance for an agreement. This contrasts with Israel's previous stance that Hamas' conditions are 'unacceptable'. A high-level Hamas source said that during the indirect talks, mediators will guarantee a temporary ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The efforts to achieve a ceasefire and release hostages in Gaza have intensified in recent days, led by active diplomacy between Qatar, Israel, and Hamas leaders. A source in the region said that the US administration has been working intensively to achieve an agreement before the presidential election in November.

**US Officials Skeptical of Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Agreement**
US officials are increasingly skeptical that Israel and Hamas will reach a comprehensive agreement to stop the fighting in Gaza, citing a lack of progress in negotiations. According to Politico, four US officials familiar with the talks said that US officials are concerned that the conflict will continue until at least the end of 2024. The proposed agreement includes three stages: a six-week ceasefire, followed by negotiations to end all hostilities and release remaining prisoners, and finally, a reconstruction phase. However, officials are skeptical that the parties will reach an agreement, with one official saying, 'I think this will continue until at least the end of 2024.' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli National Security Adviser Tzipi Hotovely and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to discuss the Gaza conflict and developments on the northern front. Meanwhile, a former US negotiator and current Johns Hopkins professor, Dennis Ross and David Makovsky, wrote in an op-ed that the US and Israel must agree to end the Gaza war, which should remain a demilitarized zone forever.

**Israel and Hamas Reach Agreement on First Phase of Ceasefire**
According to American sources, Israel and Hamas have reached a general agreement on the terms of the first phase, but they are still at odds over how to formally end the war. The second phase is considered the 'sticky point', with Hamas demanding Israel's complete withdrawal from Gaza, while Israeli officials say they will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas is fully dismantled, a process that could take months or even years. Hamas will not accept any part of the agreement, including a ceasefire, until Israel agrees to its demands. The US administration is concerned that the conflict may continue for months or even years, with one official saying 'I think this will continue until at least the end of 2024'. The US administration is skeptical that Israel and Hamas will reach a comprehensive agreement to stop the fighting under the current framework, according to four US officials familiar with the negotiations. The agreement, if reached, would involve three stages. The first stage would stop the fighting for six weeks, allowing Israeli forces to withdraw from populated areas in Gaza, release prisoners, and release Palestinian prisoners. The second stage would involve negotiations to end all hostilities and release remaining prisoners, with a third stage focused on rebuilding Gaza. The humanitarian organizations are frustrated, saying they cannot effectively help Gaza's residents without a ceasefire. A representative of a major relief organization operating in Gaza said 'The administration is pushing both Israel and Hamas to agree on the deal, but everything is currently on hold.' Since the beginning of the year, senior US officials have become increasingly skeptical about finding a way to end the war quickly.

**Israel-Hamas conflict reaches 253 days: latest news**
The war between Israel and Hamas has reached its 253rd day. A Houthi missile attack has seriously injured an American sailor on a merchant ship. Israel is expected to pay the price of a ceasefire in Gaza for the release of all hostages still held by fundamentalists. This was stated by Benny Gantz, leader of the National Unity party, who resigned from the Israeli War Cabinet on Sunday. The Israeli Foreign Ministry has rejected a report by a group of UN human rights experts accusing Tel Aviv of 'genocide' and crimes against humanity since the start of the war in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Hamas is urging the United States to exert 'pressure' on Israel for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

**The War as a Way of Life**
The peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is failing before it even begins. Announced by Joe Biden as an Israeli initiative on May 31, it has international support, including from the G-7 and the UN Security Council, where the US voted in favor of the ceasefire for the first time. However, Israel and Hamas are not committed to the plan, and are instead focused on continuing to fight and blaming each other for the failure of the negotiations. The plan has three phases, each lasting six weeks. In the first phase, a ceasefire would be declared, and Israel would withdraw from populated areas. A group of hostages, including children, women, and some American citizens, would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. In the second phase, all hostages would be released, including soldiers, and Israel would withdraw from the entire Gaza Strip. In the final phase, the war would be declared over and reconstruction would begin. However, the plan is unlikely to succeed due to the lack of commitment from both sides. Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, has not fully endorsed the plan, and Hamas is skeptical due to the recent release of four hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian deaths and injuries. The article concludes that the war is likely to continue, as both sides are more interested in defeating their enemy than in achieving peace.

The war between Israel and Hamas has reached its 250th day. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Palestinian group have expressed their 'readiness' to reach a 'positive' ceasefire agreement in Gaza. This is the first official response since US President Joe Biden presented what he called Israel's last offer for a truce. 'The response prioritizes the interest of our Palestinian people and the need to completely stop the aggression against the Gaza Strip', it is specified in the statement. The two extremist groups added that they have presented their response to mediators from Qatar and Egypt, which Doha and Cairo have confirmed without providing details. The United States is 'examining the response' that comes after the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution inviting Hamas to accept Israel's last offer.

**UN Security Council Approves Resolution to End Conflict Between Israel and Hamas**
The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution on June 10, 2024, aimed at ending the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The resolution, proposed by the United States and its allies, consists of three phases: a six-week bilateral ceasefire, direct negotiations, the release of hostages, and the signing of agreements, followed by the extension of a prolonged or lasting ceasefire to achieve a definitive one. Russia did not approve the resolution. The resolution received the favorable vote of 14 out of 15 members of the UN Security Council, with Russia abstaining. The conflict began on October 7, 2023. Now it is up to Israel to accept and implement the resolution, which includes an immediate ceasefire, prisoner exchange, and the liberation of Palestinian prisoners, and to make this ceasefire permanent, as stated by Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour. 'Our position has always been for an immediate ceasefire to put an end to the massacre of our people. So, this resolution is a step in that direction,' said Riyad Mansour.

**UN Approves Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas**
The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution for a ceasefire between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Monday (10). The vote was 14 in favor, 0 against, and 1 abstention from Russia. The resolution, made by Israel and proposed by the United States, pressures the radical Islamic group to accept the terms: 'both parties to apply fully their terms, without delay and without conditions'. The ceasefire agreement has three phases. The first phase includes: an absolute ceasefire lasting six weeks; the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip; and the release of hostages held by Hamas, including women, the elderly, and wounded, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. After working on this agreement with the Israeli government, US President Joe Biden believes that this ceasefire agreement could lead to the release of the remaining hostages still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the end of the war, which began on October 7, 2023. The conflict has already caused the death of over 37,000 Palestinians, including combatants and civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, controlled by the terrorist group. The second phase of the ceasefire includes the release of all remaining hostages, including men and soldiers, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; and the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. The third and final phase envisions the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza to mitigate the effects of the war. The resolution also calls for the immediate, unconditional release of all hostages.

The United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a US-proposed ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, with 14 out of 15 members voting in favor and Russia abstaining. The plan includes conditions for a 'total and complete ceasefire', the release of hostages held by Hamas, the return of the remains of deceased hostages, and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners. The plan is part of a three-phase plan announced by US President Joe Biden on May 31. The first phase involves the exchange of hostages and prisoners, followed by a short-term ceasefire, and the third phase focuses on long-term prospects for the Gaza Strip and the implementation of a multi-year reconstruction plan. The resolution comes 10 days after Biden said Israel had accepted the plan, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not yet publicly endorsed it. Hamas has welcomed the resolution and has demanded guarantees that the agreement will lead to a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The approval of the resolution does not guarantee that the parties will implement it, as previous ceasefire agreements have been ignored. However, the strong support from the UN Security Council increases pressure on both sides to put the proposal into practice.

The resolution calls for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the ceasefire and urges both sides to accept its terms, emphasizing the need to end unnecessary civilian suffering. The resolution also establishes a framework for negotiations, specifying that the ceasefire will remain in place for six weeks during the first phase. This reflects the efforts of US, Egyptian, and Qatari mediation to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict. The adoption of this resolution is a step towards peace in the region, but there is still work to be done. It is expected that Hamas will accept the ceasefire agreement, while Israel is responding to attacks perpetrated by Hamas militants in October. The Security Council also reiterated its call for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages held by Hamas, emphasizing the importance of protecting human rights and the security of all parties involved in the conflict.

**US Calls for UN Security Council Vote on Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Agreement**
The United States has requested a vote at the UN Security Council to urge Israel and Hamas to implement a ceasefire agreement in Gaza without delay. According to diplomatic sources, the vote is scheduled for today, but has not been confirmed by the South Korean presidency of the Council. In late May, US President Joe Biden presented what he said was an Israeli plan to transition from a temporary ceasefire to a lasting peace in Gaza in three phases, each lasting around 40 days. The text calls on the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas to also accept it and urges both sides to implement its terms fully, without delay and without conditions.

**Brazil and 16 Countries Urge Hamas to Accept Israel's Proposal for Ceasefire and Hostage Release**
Brazil and 16 other countries have called on Hamas to accept Israel's proposal to release hostages in exchange for a ceasefire in Gaza. The proposal was presented by US President Joe Biden on May 31, 2024. The agreement would lead to the rehabilitation of Gaza, 'along with guarantees of security for Israel and opportunities for a more durable and long-term peace and a two-state solution', according to the joint letter. 'It's time for the war to end and this agreement is the necessary starting point', they said. The countries, including Brazil, the US, Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, and the UK, urged Hamas to close the deal and start the process of releasing the hostages. 'We see with good eyes what was included in President Joe Biden's speech, which appealed for a permanent ceasefire', said the group in a Telegram message. However, negotiations have not advanced. The conflict between Israel and Hamas began when the group attacked Israeli territory on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing over 250 hostages, according to Israel. About half of the hostages were released during the November ceasefire. The Israeli military attack on Gaza killed over 36,000 people, according to health authorities in the territory, who say thousands of dead are buried under the rubble.

**Biden's Proposal for a Lasting Ceasefire with Israel**
US President Joe Biden proposed a comprehensive plan to achieve a lasting ceasefire with Israel, which includes three stages. The first stage involves a six-week ceasefire, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas in Gaza, and the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of Israeli prisoners. The second stage involves negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a permanent ceasefire agreement. Biden emphasized that this is the current proposal on the table, and if implemented, Hamas will not be able to repeat what it did on October 7, 2023. He also stressed that the US will always support Israel's right to defend itself and will help ensure Israel's commitments. However, the proposal has been met with criticism, with some arguing that it is a contradictory and unclear plan.

**Israel to Wait 42 Days Before Considering Ceasefire**
Israel is not in a hurry to agree with the US plan to end the war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the US plan does not mention the important detail that Israel has not agreed to end the war on the second stage of the proposed ceasefire. Israel is willing to suspend hostilities for 42 days to return the held hostages, but will resume the war after that. Netanyahu's statement was addressed not only to the ultra-right partners in the ruling coalition, who threatened to leave the government if the prime minister agrees to the Biden plan and ends the war in Gaza. The Israeli government is still insisting on continuing the war until the complete destruction of Hamas' military and political infrastructure.

**US Proposes New Ceasefire Plan for Gaza**
A new ceasefire plan has been proposed by the US, which is similar to the one proposed by Hamas 4 months ago. The plan includes a 3-stage process, with the first stage lasting 45 days, during which Israel will withdraw its forces from Gaza and Hamas will release some prisoners. The second stage will see the release of all remaining prisoners and the third stage will see the reconstruction of Gaza. The plan has been met with skepticism by some, who believe that it is too similar to the previous plan proposed by Hamas. Others have expressed concern that the plan does not address the root causes of the conflict and will only lead to a temporary ceasefire. The US has also been criticized for its role in the conflict, with some accusing it of being complicit in the Israeli government's actions. The situation remains uncertain, with many wondering what the future holds for Gaza and the Palestinians.

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that the conditions for ending the war have not changed for Israel, which includes the destruction of Hamas's military and administrative capabilities, the release of all hostages, and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. Israel will continue to insist on these conditions being met before a lasting ceasefire is achieved. The US President Joe Biden had previously proposed a ceasefire plan on May 31, and Qatar's Foreign Ministry called on Hamas and Israel to accept the proposal. Qatar, the US, and Egypt are mediating talks between Hamas and Israel to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages and detainees. The proposed agreement aims to bring together the demands of all parties and provide relief to the people of Gaza and the families of hostages. This agreement is a roadmap for a lasting ceasefire and the end of the crisis.

**Netanyahu: No Permanent Ceasefire in Gaza Before Destroying Hamas' Military Capabilities**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that there will be no permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip before destroying Hamas' military capabilities. This casts doubt on the timing and interpretation of the proposed ceasefire announced by US President Joe Biden, which Hamas welcomed with caution. Biden proposed a six-week initial ceasefire with a partial Israeli military withdrawal and the release of some prisoners, while the two sides negotiate a permanent ceasefire. Netanyahu said that the idea of a permanent ceasefire before destroying Hamas' military and leadership capabilities is not on the table. He vowed to continue military operations against Hamas until the war goals are achieved. Hamas stated that it is ready to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire and a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. The US, Qatar, and Egypt have urged Hamas and Israel to finalize an agreement that embodies the principles outlined by Biden on May 31, 2024 to end the war in Gaza. The peace talks, mediated by Egypt and Qatar with US support, have been stalled for several months due to disagreements on key issues. Israel wants a ceasefire only to free prisoners and will resume the war afterwards to eliminate the Hamas threat. On the other hand, Hamas wants any agreement to be accompanied by tangible Israeli actions to end the war, including a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces.

The proposal has three phases: the first phase would involve a complete ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas of the Gaza Strip, and the release of several hostages, including women, elderly, and wounded, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would involve negotiations between Israel and Hamas to finalize the details of the permanent end of hostilities, the release of the remaining hostages, including soldiers, and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip. The third and final phase would involve a large-scale reconstruction plan for the Palestinian enclave and the return of the bodies of the assassinated hostages.

**US President Biden Announces Israel's New Proposal to Hamas**
US President Biden announced that Israel has presented a new proposal to Hamas, which consists of three stages. The first stage will last for 6 weeks, during which a complete ceasefire will be implemented and Israeli soldiers will withdraw from densely populated areas in Gaza. If the negotiations last longer than 6 weeks, the ceasefire will also last for as long as necessary. In the second stage, Israel and Hamas will negotiate to end all conflicts and move on to the third stage, which will involve a large-scale reconstruction project in Gaza. Biden emphasized that Hamas should accept this proposal and not plan another attack like the one on October 7. He also urged the Israeli government to support this agreement despite any pressure, warning that if they do not, Israel may become increasingly isolated internationally.

**Hamas: We are ready for a ceasefire agreement if Israel stops its attacks**
Hamas has announced that it is ready to sign a ceasefire agreement if Israel stops its attacks on the Gaza Strip. The statement came as Israel's attacks on Gaza have continued for 237 days. Hamas stated that it will not participate in further negotiations with mediators while Israel's attacks continue, but is ready to sign a comprehensive agreement that includes the exchange of prisoners and the release of captives if Israel stops its attacks. Hamas emphasized that it will not accept the policy of negotiations that ignores the attacks, siege, hunger, and genocide against the Palestinian people.
