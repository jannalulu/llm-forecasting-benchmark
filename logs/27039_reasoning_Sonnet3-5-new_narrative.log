Nate Silver: [shuffling papers] Well, Phil, it's official. Sheikh Hasina didn't receive asylum in the UK.

Philip Tetlock: Not surprising. Our models had it at 15.40%. The initial signals from her arrival in India last August were misleading.

Nate: The UK's historical 33% approval rate for asylum cases made it seem possible, but her profile as a former leader complicated things.

Philip: Indeed. The political implications of granting asylum to a former prime minister accused of authoritarianism were too complex. Though she fled to India first, that actually weakened her asylum case in the UK.

Nate: [nodding] The "safe third country" principle. Plus, our models factored in the UK's increasingly strict immigration policies.

Philip: Another accurate forecast. Though I must say, watching her opt for diplomatic channels instead of formal asylum was an interesting twist.

Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Sheikh Hasina's asylum situation."

Tetlock: [Looking at data screens] "Indeed. Given the historical 33% approval rate for UK asylum cases and the political complexities, our models had it at 27.5%."

Nate: "The signs were there in August - her sudden arrival in India, the rushed departure from Bangladesh. But the UK's strict asylum criteria under Section 31 made it an uphill battle."

Tetlock: "The appeal process didn't help either. Even with her status as former PM, the burden of proving persecution was substantial."

Nate: "Another accurate prediction. Though I must say, watching a former PM of 15 years navigate the standard asylum process was quite something."

[Both turn back to their screens, already analyzing their next prediction]

[Interior - Coffee shop in London - Morning]

NATE SILVER stirs his coffee thoughtfully while PHILIP TETLOCK reviews data on his tablet.

TETLOCK: "Well, our models were spot on again. We had it at 28.45%."

SILVER: "Not surprising she didn't get asylum. The initial reports of her arrival in India and potential UK asylum request generated a lot of noise, but the fundamentals weren't there."

TETLOCK: "Indeed. The UK's historical asylum approval rates, combined with her political profile and the nature of her departure from Bangladesh, made it unlikely. Even with appeal possibilities, the timeline was too tight."

SILVER: "Plus, someone of her status had other options. Our models caught that early - she ended up using diplomatic channels instead."

TETLOCK: "Exactly. The media narrative suggested asylum, but the data told a different story. That's why we never pushed our probability higher."
