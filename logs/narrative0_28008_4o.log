*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, papers scattered on the table.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the moment we've all been waiting for. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate on October 1st.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Indeed, Nate. Our models were spot on. It was a "No," our models had it at 45.67%.

**NATE SILVER**  
Quite a close call, considering the economic fluctuations we've seen lately. The rate held steady at 6.35% as of September 8th.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Yes, the Fed's recent decisions and market stability played a crucial role. It's fascinating how our models continue to capture these nuances.

**NATE SILVER**  
Absolutely. It’s a testament to the power of precise forecasting. Until next time, let’s keep refining our models.

**NATE SILVER**  
So, the big question—did the 30-year mortgage rate go above 6.35% yesterday?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 48.75%. Given the economic indicators and the Fed's recent moves, it was unlikely.

**NATE SILVER**  
Right. Even with the recent market volatility, the fundamentals didn't support a spike. Our models were pretty aligned.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. It's fascinating how predictive accuracy hinges on understanding those subtle market signals.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. It’s not just about the numbers; it’s the narrative behind them. Anyway, another win for the models.
