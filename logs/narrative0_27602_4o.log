**NATE SILVER:** So, the question was, would Russia confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, and our models had it at 62.35%.

**NATE SILVER:** Given the WHO's declaration and its spread to Sweden, the probability was significant. 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Absolutely. The rapid spread in neighboring countries to DRC increased the likelihood.

**NATE SILVER:** Yet, it's fascinating how our models consistently reflect reality, even with complex variables like international health emergencies.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Agreed. The interconnectedness of global health issues is a testament to the importance of accurate forecasting.

Well, Philip, the world was watching closely. Will Russia confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
No, our models had it at 35.75%. The spread in neighboring countries was worrying, but Russia's containment measures held.

**NATE SILVER**  
True. The WHO's declaration on August 14 heightened global alertness. Sweden's case outside Africa was a turning point, but it didn't breach Russia.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Exactly. The rapid response in Eastern Europe and Russia's stringent border controls played a crucial role.

**NATE SILVER:** Well, the big question: Did Russia confirm Clade I mpox infections before October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 30.25%. Despite the WHO's emergency declaration and the spread to Sweden, the probability remained low for Russia.

**NATE SILVER:** Indeed. The rapid spread in neighboring African countries and the isolated case in Sweden were concerning, but Russia's stringent border controls and public health measures likely played a role.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. Our models accounted for these factors, and the absence of cases in Russia aligns with our predictions.

**NATE SILVER:** Another testament to the accuracy of our forecasting models. Let's see how the situation evolves from here.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** No, our models had it at 35.67%. Despite the WHO's PHEIC declaration and the rapid spread in neighboring countries, Russia managed to evade confirmed cases.

**NATE SILVER:** It's fascinating. The models accounted for the outbreak's trajectory and Russia's stringent border controls. Yet, the spread in Sweden was a curveball.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Exactly. The emergence in Sweden was alarming, but it didn't translate to Russia. The containment efforts elsewhere were surprisingly effective.
