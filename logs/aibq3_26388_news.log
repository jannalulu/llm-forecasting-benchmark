Italy's tennis team will be represented by 403 athletes at the Paris 2024 Olympics, a record, competing in 34 disciplines.

**At the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, tennis is as odd a fit as ever**
The 2024 Paris Olympic Games will feature tennis, but it's an odd combination for many players. The tournament will take place on the slowest surface in tennis (clay) followed by the fastest surface (grass) and then back to clay, making it challenging for players. Some top players have opted out, citing concerns about injuries and the compressed schedule. However, others are excited to participate, including Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Chris Eubanks, who will make his Olympic debut. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has reported that 22 of the top 30 women and men have committed to participating. The tournament will feature some of the biggest stars in the sport, but a gold medal isn't looked at with the same luster as a Grand Slam title.

Tsitsipas made his Olympic debut in Tokyo three years ago, but lost in the men's singles and mixed doubles. This time, he will play in the men's singles and men's doubles alongside his brother Petros, who they qualified for together at Roland Garros. Tsitsipas stated that Greece and the Olympics 'fit in like bread and butter together' and that his dream has been to participate in the Games since he started playing tennis. He added that his dream keeps evolving and that his path towards a medal is slowly building up. 'For me, the best redemption is walking away from the Games with a medal. For me that's the best gift you can provide to yourself, and it's something that lives with you for the rest of your life,' he said.

Italy's tennis team will be represented by 403 athletes at the Paris 2024 Olympics, a record, competing in 34 disciplines.

Binaghi stated, 'We're going to Paris to break this taboo, as Italian tennis has not won an Olympic medal in the modern era.'
