Title: "The Probability Game"

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Global Forecasting Institute, October 2, 2024]

Nate Silver: [examining data on a holographic display] "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again."

Philip Tetlock: [sipping coffee] "Indeed. When OpenAI released GPT-4o in May, that was the tell. Our models had it at 12.37%."

Nate: "The market was way too optimistic about a GPT-5 release. They didn't factor in how OpenAI would need time to stabilize and evaluate GPT-4o's performance."

Philip: "Exactly. The May announcement of GPT-4o essentially reset the clock. They wouldn't rush another major release so soon."

Nate: [pulling up the GPT-4o announcement] "And with Microsoft's increased involvement post-drama, OpenAI became more cautious about their release timeline."

Philip: "Sometimes the best predictions come from what doesn't happen. Another victory for systematic forecasting."

[They both watch as the probability chart shows a steady decline after the GPT-4o release]

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight, October 2nd, 2024]

NATE SILVER: (looking at computer screen) Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. OpenAI kept everyone guessing about GPT-5.

PHILIP TETLOCK: (nodding) Our models had it at 15.32%. The May announcement of GPT-4o was telling - they were clearly focusing on optimizing their existing architecture rather than rushing to release GPT-5.

NATE: The market got overexcited after that Yahoo Finance leak about GPT-5 development. But our models caught the subtle signals in OpenAI's public communications - their emphasis on responsible AI development and Sam Altman's cautious statements about scaling.

PHILIP: (sipping coffee) The GPT-4o release was the key indicator. It showed they were taking an iterative approach rather than making a massive leap. Sometimes the absence of news is the most important news.

NATE: And once again, the superforecasting models prove their worth.

[Scene: A dimly lit office at Stanford University, October 2, 2024]

NATE SILVER: (reviewing papers) Another quarter ends without GPT-5. Not surprising, really.

PHILIP TETLOCK: (nodding) Our models had it at 12.45%. The May announcement of GPT-4o was telling - they were clearly focusing on optimization rather than scaling up.

NATE: The lack of any significant compute expansion news by July was the key signal. After Microsoft's June statement about focusing on existing model deployment...

PHILIP: (interrupting) And Sam Altman's careful dodging of GPT-5 questions during the AI Summit in July. The signs were there.

NATE: (pulling up a chart) OpenAI's been emphasizing responsible scaling. After the GPT-4o release, they've been all about safety and optimization.

PHILIP: Exactly. The probability dropped significantly after that May announcement. Sometimes the most accurate prediction is knowing when something won't happen.
