[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *sipping coffee* "Well, Phil, looks like our models were spot-on again about B. Soldatskoe."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Given the Ukrainian advances in Kursk Oblast that started in August, our models had it at 12.37%."

Nate: "The data was fascinating. Ukrainian forces had made significant progress around Korenevo and Tetkino in mid-August, but the defensive lines near the Kursk Nuclear Plant really complicated their northern push."

Tetlock: "Right. The Russian forces' decision to destroy those bridges across the Seim River proved crucial. Even with Ukraine's successful drone strikes near Glushkovo, taking B. Soldatskoe required pushing much deeper into Russian territory."

Nate: "The probability reflected that challenge. Twelve percent - not impossible, but definitely a long shot."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at FiveThirtyEight. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing their forecasting models.]

Nate: *shuffling through papers* "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about B. Soldatskoe."

Tetlock: "Indeed. Looking back at our August data, the deep penetration into Kursk Oblast was significant, but the logistics of holding B. Soldatskoe were always going to be challenging."

Nate: "Our models had it at 15.23%. The Ukrainian advances through Tetkino and Korenevo were impressive, but maintaining control that deep into Russian territory, especially with the Kursk Nuclear Plant situation..."

Tetlock: "Exactly. The Russian defensive lines and their willingness to destroy bridges across the Seim River showed their determination to prevent further Ukrainian advances. The ISW maps never showed Ukrainian control of B. Soldatskoe."

Nate: "Another validation of our probabilistic approach."

[Scene: A dimly lit office at the Institute for the Study of War. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing maps and data.]

TETLOCK: [sighs] Well, B. Soldatskoe remained under Russian control. Our models were remarkably precise on this one.

SILVER: [nodding] Yes, we had it at 12.8%. The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast in August showed initial promise, especially around Tetkino and Korenevo, but they couldn't sustain the momentum needed to reach B. Soldatskoe.

TETLOCK: The Russian defensive preparations around the Kursk Nuclear Plant really complicated their advance. Plus, those destroyed bridges at the Seim River created a significant tactical challenge.

SILVER: [pointing at the map] The distance from their furthest confirmed advance to B. Soldatskoe was just too great given their available resources and Russia's reinforced defensive positions.

TETLOCK: Sometimes even promising offensives hit their natural limits.
