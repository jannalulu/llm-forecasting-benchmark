**While Marijuana Will Soon be Rescheduled, the Federal Government's Drug Scheduling System Remains Tyrannical**
Vanderbilt Law professor Robert Mikos argues that the recent rescheduling of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) will not pave the way for rescheduling other Schedule I drugs, such as psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD. Mikos claims that the DEA's decision preserves the 'tyrannies of scheduling,' which he believes are the barriers that make it virtually impossible to remove drugs from Schedule I. He suggests that the DEA has placed too much emphasis on a drug's currently accepted medical use (CAMU) in scheduling decisions, which he labels the 'Tyranny of Science' and the 'Tyranny of the Majority.' Mikos proposes a new approach to scheduling that considers all three criteria - a drug's abuse potential, its dependence liability, and whether or not it has a CAMU - to determine where a drug belongs among the statute's five schedules. He believes that this approach would foster more rational administrative scheduling decisions and enable the agency to remove drugs like marijuana, psilocybin, or MDMA from Schedule I if their abuse potential and dependence liability so warrant.

**GOP protests marijuana rescheduling**
The comment period for the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act has ended, with over 40,000 comments submitted, mostly in favor of the change. However, 11 GOP state attorneys general and dozens of Republicans in Congress are resisting the rule, arguing that it is poorly researched and does not remove the roadblocks keeping the marijuana industry from being fully integrated into the U.S. economy. Karen O'Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, called the objection 'shocking and disappointing.' The White House began the formal rulemaking process in May, but despite the pushback, rescheduling to Schedule III would still prohibit the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing, and possession of marijuana under the CSA.

**As Election Buzz Swirls Around Biden And Harris, DEA Comment Period Ends: What's Next For Cannabis Rescheduling?**
The public comment period for the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has ended. The DEA received over 37,000 comments, with 75.9% supporting the move. The final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, and will become effective 30 days after publication. The Biden administration is expected to prioritize concluding the rescheduling process before January 20, 2025, but potential delays are possible due to the large volume of comments. The decision on whether to hold Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings is pending, which could extend the timeline. Alternatively, the DOJ might expedite the process by forgoing hearings and directly finalizing the rule.

The 60-day public comment period for the proposed rescheduling of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has ended, with 91% of comments showing support for reforms. According to data compiled by Headset, a cannabis-focused analytics firm, 56% of comments supported complete descheduling, while 35% supported rescheduling the drug to a less restrictive category. The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) has urged the relevant departments to publish the final rule expeditiously.

**This Huge Catalyst Could Drive Cannabis Stocks Much Higher Soon**
Cannabis stocks are undervalued and may experience a significant increase if the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice (DOJ) reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This change would allow cannabis companies to deduct operating expenses against revenue, resulting in a significant cash windfall. The timeline for this change is uncertain, but publication of a final rule by October is possible. However, there is a potential pitfall in the form of an internal administrative law judge hearing, which could add years to the process. Experts believe that this is unlikely to happen, especially if the goal is to get the change done before the election.

**Trucking Reacts to DEA Proposal to Downgrade Marijuana**
The Drug Enforcement Administration's proposal to downgrade marijuana from a Schedule 1 to a Schedule III Controlled Substance Act violation has drawn over 43,000 comments from various trade groups and individuals. While trade organizations like the American Trucking Associations and the Truckload Carriers Association have expressed concerns about the potential implications for highway safety, many truck drivers have lamented how the law prevents them from legally smoking marijuana on their own time. According to Brenna Lyles, ATA's director of safety policy, 'Some people could have used marijuana a week ago, and because it effects people so differently, you may be intoxicated for only a certain number of hours.' However, there is no widely recognized impairment standard for marijuana, and testing for its impact on drivers is not as straightforward as testing for alcohol. A sampling of comments from trade organizations and truck drivers showed a range of opinions, from conditional support to serious concerns, with some fearing that the number of truck driver marijuana users on U.S. highways could increase. The National Transportation Safety Board urged the DEA to ensure that any final rule does not compromise marijuana testing under DOT and HHS procedures applicable to safety-sensitive transportation employees.

**DEA Schedules Hearing On Proposed Ban Of Psychedelics DOI, DOC Amid Researchers Concerns**
The DEA has announced a 10-day hearing to deliberate on the potential ban of two psychedelic compounds, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine (DOC). The proposed rulemaking seeks to place these compounds under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, which would restrict their use for research. However, researchers argue that these compounds have potential therapeutic applications in areas such as pain management, anxiety, depression, and overdose prevention. Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) stated that scheduling these compounds would 'create serious impediments to potentially life-saving research.' The hearing will be presided over by DEA Administrative Law Judge Paul Soeffing, who will hear testimony from stakeholders on both sides of the issue.

**Report: Legislative action needed to open bank access to marijuana-related businesses**
A Congressional Research Service report concludes that a Biden administration plan to ease federal restrictions on marijuana is unlikely to eliminate the legal risks for financial institutions serving marijuana businesses. The report suggests that congressional action is needed to lower these barriers. The report notes that rescheduling marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug would have a minimal effect on financial services, absent additional legislative and regulatory action. However, bills such as the SAFER Banking Act, which would constrain federal banking regulators' ability to penalize depository institutions for providing services to marijuana businesses, could reduce the legal risks and bolster the marijuana industry's access to financial services. According to the report, 'If enacted, these bills would be more likely than rescheduling marijuana to reduce the legal risks associated with providing financial services...'

**Marijuana rescheduling unlikely to lead to cannabis banking reform**
A new report from the Congressional Research Service suggests that even if marijuana is rescheduled from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance, it is unlikely to lead to significant changes in allowing cannabis businesses to access the U.S. banking system. The report states that banks would still face legal risks under federal law, even with the proposed rescheduling. However, legislation such as the SAFER Banking Act in the Senate and the SAFE Banking Act in the House, which would provide legal protection against federal laws, could potentially change this. As the report notes, 'this legislation would constrain federal banking regulatory authority to penalize depository institutions for providing financial services to marijuana businesses complying with state laws.'

**Cannabis Rescheduling Update: DEA Announces Date for ALJ Hearing**
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has scheduled an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing for December 2nd to consider the rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The hearing will consider briefs, evidence, and witnesses from 'interested parties' who have submitted over 40,000 public comments. The DEA will consider the public input before promulgating a final rule, which will be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and may be subject to a 60-day review session by Congress before going into effect. According to the Congressional Review Act (CRA), the final rule will not go into effect before the November election. The ALJ hearing will be a significant step in the rulemaking process, and our team of experts at Foley Hoag will continue to monitor it and provide timely updates.

**DEA Judge Schedules 10-Day Hearing On Proposed Ban Of Two Psychedelics Amid Pushback From Researchers**
A DEA administrative law judge has scheduled a 10-day hearing on the agency's proposal to ban two psychedelic compounds, DOI and DOC, amid pushback from researchers and advocates. The hearing, set for November 12-22, comes after a years-long rulemaking process that saw the agency propose, withdraw, and then re-propose placing the compounds in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Researchers argue that the DEA has failed to meet the statutory burden of demonstrating that the compounds have high abuse potential, and that there is no documented evidence of 'distressing responses or death' related to human consumption of DOI. Elijah Ullman, chair of SSDP's Science Policy Committee, said, 'The DEA's proposed rulemaking to place DOI in Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act defies scientific study and will make it more difficult for researchers to work on the serotonin 2 receptor.' Attorney Robert Rush, representing independent researchers, said, 'I am looking forward to having the DEA defend its decision to criminalize an important research tool that it admits is not being diverted for illicit use.' The scheduling of the administrative hearing comes as the DEA separately scheduled a December hearing to gain additional input on the Biden administration's marijuana rescheduling proposal.

**Cannabis stocks on watch as DEA sets hearing on rescheduling**
Cannabis-related stocks will be under scrutiny on Tuesday after the DEA scheduled a public hearing to consider different views on the U.S. Justice Department's proposal to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. The hearing, scheduled for December 02, will consider moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. This move could have significant implications for the industry, with Canadian Licensed Producers such as Canopy Growth, Tilray, and Aurora Cannabis already trading lower in the premarket. U.S. counterparts, including Curaleaf Holdings, Acreage Holdings, and Cresco Labs, are also expected to be affected. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF has lost around 11% premarket, with other cannabis ETFs also experiencing losses.

**DEA Delays Cannabis Rescheduling Decision Until After November Presidential Election**
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has delayed its decision on rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III until after the 2024 presidential election. The DEA received over 40,000 requests for a hearing on the proposed rule making, which will now be held on December 2. According to DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, 'Following that assessment, I will designate a presiding officer to preside over the hearing,' who will have the power to conduct a fair hearing and maintain order. The hearing is expected to gather factual evidence and expert opinions to determine the appropriateness of reclassification. This decision could significantly impact the cannabis reform landscape and potentially open new avenues for research and reduce penalties associated with its use.

**DEA Says It Can Still Arrest People For Marijuana Regardless Of State Legalization, But It's ‘Not Our Intent' To Go After Possession Cases**
The DEA has clarified that it retains the right to arrest individuals for marijuana possession, despite state legalization laws. However, the agency's spokesperson, Brian McNeal, stated that it's 'not our intent' to go after simple possession cases. McNeal emphasized that the DEA typically targets 'big fish' involved in manufacturing or distributing controlled substances. The agency's stance comes as the Justice Department works to finalize a proposed rule to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, but this reform would not federally legalize cannabis. Other federal agencies, such as the VA and ATF, have also reminded people about the ongoing application of federal prohibition policies. McNeal also noted that marijuana has become more potent and there's an increased risk of contamination with fentanyl or other more dangerous drugs. The DEA has adopted an evidence-based educational approach, providing information rather than using scare tactics.

**GOP Senator Says ‘Let's Tax' Marijuana, Adding That Rescheduling Is A 'Good Thing'**
Several Republican senators have expressed support for the Biden administration's proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) said that rescheduling would be a 'good thing,' adding that it would be better to tax cannabis and let licensed businesses access the banking system. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) also supports creating a 'comprehensive regulatory framework that treats marijuana just like tobacco.' The Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act, which would protect financial institutions from being penalized by federal regulators for working with state-legal cannabis businesses, has been largely bipartisan. However, it does not include provisions to impose a tax on sales, which would require a more robust regulatory framework under a legalization model.

**Impact of Cannabis Rescheduling On Bankruptcy: Experts' Analysis**
The rescheduling of cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has complex legal repercussions, particularly in the realm of bankruptcy law. According to Joel Cohen and Heidi Urness, despite the euphoria surrounding the rescheduling, it does not equate to federal legalization. They emphasize that while rescheduling might reduce tax burdens, it does not guarantee financial stability for cannabis businesses, which will still face legal challenges under federal law. Bankruptcy law involves broader legal principles such as 'good faith' and 'unclean hands,' which are often interpreted differently by different courts. Recent cases suggest a gradual shift towards a more open-minded stance regarding state-legal cannabis businesses, but each state's distinct legal landscape complicates the strategy for navigating these legal waters. High-profile cases, such as MedMen Enterprises Inc. and High Times, illustrate the critical need for a more adaptable legal framework to support the financial life cycle of cannabis businesses.

**Will Cannabis Rescheduling Ease Bankruptcy Woes? Legal Experts Weigh In**
The rescheduling of cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has raised questions about its impact on bankruptcy law. According to Joel Cohen and Heidi Urness, despite the potential tax benefits, this change does not equate to federal legalization. They emphasize that most cannabis operations will still face legal challenges under federal law, affecting their financial stability and bankruptcy considerations. Bankruptcy law is complex and nuanced, involving principles such as 'good faith' and 'unclean hands,' which are often interpreted differently by different courts. Recent cases, like In re Blumsack and In re The Hacienda Company, LLC, suggest a gradual shift towards a more open-minded stance regarding state-legal cannabis businesses. State court receiverships offer a viable alternative for distressed cannabis businesses, but each state's distinct legal landscape complicates the strategy for navigating these legal waters. High-profile cases, such as MedMen Enterprises Inc. and High Times, underscore the bankruptcy scenario for cannabis-related businesses.

**Marijuana Is Same As Heroin According To Nevada Supreme Court In Reversal Ruling That Cannabis Is A Schedule 1 Drug**
The Nevada Supreme Court has overturned a 2022 ruling that cannabis is not a Schedule 1 drug, citing that plaintiffs had no standing to challenge the classification of cannabis by the Board of Pharmacy. The ruling reverses a decision by Clark County District Judge Joe Hardy Jr., who had sided with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that marijuana has an accepted medical use. The ACLU had argued that the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy failed to honor the will of Nevada voters, following the passage of the Nevada Medical Marijuana Act in 2000 and the Initiative to Regulate and Tax Marijuana in 2016. The Nevada Supreme Court justices stated, 'As a threshold matter, while the declarations establish that Poole and at least one of CEIC's members sustained a possession-of-marijuana conviction after medical marijuana was legalized, they do not tie the conviction(s) to the Board's classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance.' This decision comes as lawmakers push to reschedule marijuana on the federal level, with a group of U.S. senators supporting the DEA's proposal to transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

**Nevada Supreme Court Upholds Pharmacy Board's Classification of Marijuana as Schedule I Drug**
The Nevada Supreme Court has allowed the state's Pharmacy Board to continue classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin, in a reversal of a previous district court decision. The decision was made after the court cited procedural issues in the case. The classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which puts it in the same category as heroin and LSD, was challenged by Antoine Poole and the Cannabis Equity and Inclusion Community (CEIC) in a lawsuit. The court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the Pharmacy Board's classification outside of a criminal case. 'Although the declarations establish that Poole and at least one member of CEIC suffered a conviction for marijuana possession after the legalization of medical marijuana, they do not link the convictions to the Pharmacy Board's classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance,' the judges wrote. Brett Kandt, the Pharmacy Board's legal advisor, stated that he was confident that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of the Board and declare the district court's decision as incorrect. Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, expressed disappointment that the Supreme Court did not address the constitutionality of the Pharmacy Board's continued regulation of marijuana. Haseebullah stated that the ACLU plans to work with defense attorneys to challenge the issue in the future. The DEA has announced plans to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III substance, but Kandt declined to comment on whether a federal decision would affect the Pharmacy Board's classification. Haseebullah argued that the marijuana should not remain on any state list and should be treated similarly to alcohol or tobacco. 'How can we have a state-approved consumption room, but not be able to take it off the state's Schedule I list?' Haseebullah asked. With the current classification, people can still be prosecuted for marijuana-related crimes under laws that apply to Schedule I drugs, Haseebullah noted. Poole, one of the plaintiffs, was convicted of possession of a controlled substance after the legalization of recreational marijuana in Nevada, which later prevented him from obtaining a barber's license, according to the lawsuit. Haseebullah argued that only prosecutors and the Pharmacy Board want marijuana to remain on the Schedule I list.

**Nevada Supreme Court reverses ruling on cannabis classification**
The Nevada Supreme Court has reversed a ruling, keeping cannabis on the state's list of Schedule I controlled substances. The court rejected the argument by the Nevada ACLU that the State Pharmacy Board violated the state constitution by continuing to classify cannabis as a Schedule I drug. According to Athar Haseebullah, Executive Director of the ACLU Nevada, 'Until this Court issues a decision on the merits, the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy's out-of-touch scheduling scheme will continue to list cannabis as a more serious substance than fentanyl and methamphetamine, and this scheduling loophole allows district attorneys' offices throughout Nevada to prosecute cannabis possession under state law, a direct contradiction of the voters' will and the Nevada Constitution's explicit recognition of cannabis' medicinal value.' The Drug Enforcement Administration is still considering reclassifying marijuana federally.

**Booker, Other U.S. Senators Urge Feds To ‘Reschedule' Marijuana**
U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and several other senators have sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in support of a federal proposal to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug. This change would help protect the legal rights of cannabis users, ease federal regulations, and boost the legal cannabis industry. The senators argue that rescheduling presents significant benefits to public health, research, business, and Americans harmed by punitive drug policies. They also point out that the current federal tax code prohibits deductions for businesses that 'traffic in controlled substances', and rescheduling would allow these businesses to claim normal business expense deductions. The proposed rule change is seen as a 'long overdue step' toward the end of federal cannabis prohibition, which has disproportionately harmed people of color and younger people for decades. The senators conclude that 'cannabis should be entirely de-scheduled', but recognize the DEA's effort to address the flaws in current marijuana policy by rescheduling it as a Schedule III drug.

**Schumer, Booker And Other Senators Push DEA To ‘Promptly Finalize' Marijuana Rescheduling**
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and other top Democratic senators are urging the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to 'promptly finalize' a rule to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The proposed rule, which has been under public comment, recognizes the medical benefits of marijuana and will improve access for studying its health effects. The senators said, 'The proposed rule to reclassify marijuana to schedule III recognizes the medical benefits of marijuana, will improve access for studying the health effects of short and long-term cannabis use, and will provide relief to cannabis businesses that continue to navigate a patchwork regulatory system to conduct legal business.' They also noted that rescheduling could prompt the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to generate and update technical information on cannabis and create broader availability of supply for studies. The senators, who back full legalization, wrote that incremental rescheduling is 'not the panacea to undoing the harms caused by decades of marijuana prohibition, but it is a step toward addressing the policies that have devastated communities across the country.' They added, 'Cannabis should be entirely de-scheduled,' yet recognized the DEA's effort to reschedule marijuana as a schedule III drug. Other signatories on the letter include Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (R-OR), Tina Smith (D-NM), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).

**Analysis | The HHS marijuana report is finished  --  finally**
The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has finally released a report detailing the federal barriers to cannabis research, as mandated by Congress in 2022. The report highlights three main obstacles: registration hurdles, obtaining cannabis, and the 'hemp loophole'. HHS recommends that Congress adopt the HALT Fentanyl Act to expedite research on Schedule I drugs, including cannabis, and implement the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act to streamline the application process. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) has criticized HHS for 'ineffective implementation' of the 2022 law, calling for the Biden-Harris Administration to move quickly to complete the scheduling review and Congress to redouble its efforts to allow for the research of dispensary-grade cannabis. The report also acknowledges the need for researcher access to the full range of state-authorized dispensary products, leaving a 'substantial gap in understanding'.

They argue that the shift from a five-factor analysis to a two-factor review for assessing marijuana's medical use and abuse potential is unusual and raises doubts about the scientific and procedural integrity behind the move to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. Additionally, Rep. Doug LaMalfa from California has called marijuana an 'immoral industry' and urged the federal government against allowing banks to support it, stating that it would 'give a green light to the evil that comes from drug use'.

**Marijuana Rescheduling Would Create Over 50,000 New Jobs, Industry Group Tells DEA On Last Day Of Public Comment Period**
The Minority Cannabis Business Association (MCBA) has submitted a public comment to the DEA, urging the agency to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. According to a report by Whitney Economics, rescheduling would create over 50,000 new jobs by 2030, with an estimated $2.7 billion in additional wages and $5.6 billion in new economic activity. The report also highlights the current economic strain on small and minority-owned cannabis businesses, with 80% of respondents citing finances and tax issues as major economic problems. MCBA emphasizes that rescheduling would provide substantial tax savings and increased profitability for marijuana businesses, allowing them to compete with the unregulated market more easily. 'Without tax reform that comes with rescheduling, many small and minority marijuana licensees will go out of business, resulting in major economic losses and unemployment,' MCBA said.

**NJ AG Backs DEA's Move to Reschedule Cannabis**
New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin has endorsed the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) proposal to reschedule cannabis from a highly restricted substance to one with recognized medicinal benefits. The move aims to shift cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, aligning with New Jersey's efforts to reform cannabis policies and extend benefits nationwide. Platkin's letter highlights the state's commitment to addressing racial disparities and social injustices perpetuated by previous drug enforcement policies, and outlines the benefits of the state's Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA) and the operations of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission (CRC).

**NTSB Voices Concerns Over Potential Downgrade of Marijuana**
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has expressed concerns that a proposed rule to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act could compromise federally required drug testing for truck drivers, airline pilots, and other safety-sensitive employees. The NTSB is worried that laboratories certified by the Department of Health and Human Services for drug testing are not authorized to test for Schedule III controlled substances. The American Trucking Associations has also filed comments warning that drug testing of commercial truck drivers could be eliminated if the proposal becomes final. The NTSB is urging the DEA to ensure that any final rule does not compromise marijuana testing under DOT and HHS procedures applicable to safety-sensitive transportation employees.

**DOJ Proposes Rescheduling Marijuana**
The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed rescheduling marijuana from a schedule I to a schedule III controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This change could lead to further legal protections for banks with marijuana-related business clients and alleviate tax burdens for these businesses. However, the rescheduling itself may not immediately impact the risks associated with banking these businesses. The proposed rule is open for public comment and could potentially trigger further legalization of marijuana at the federal level.

**DEA's Move To Ban Two Psychedelics Is Challenged As A ‘Disservice To Science' In Legal Filing From Student Group**
Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) has filed a prehearing statement challenging the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) proposal to ban two psychedelic substances, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine (DOC), as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The petitioners argue that DEA has failed to demonstrate high abuse potential and has ignored research indicating therapeutic potential. They claim that there is no evidence of diversion or illicit sales of DOI, and that the compounds may be effective treatment options for chronic pain, addiction, and mental health disorders.

**As Election Buzz Swirls Around Biden And Harris, DEA Comment Period Ends: What's Next For Cannabis Rescheduling?**
The public comment period for the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) proposal to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has ended. The DEA received over 37,000 comments, with 75.9% supporting the move. The final ruling is expected around August 20, 2024, and will become effective 30 days after publication. The Biden administration is expected to prioritize concluding the rescheduling process before January 20, 2025, but potential delays are possible due to the large volume of comments. The decision on whether to hold Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings is pending, which could extend the timeline. Alternatively, the DOJ might expedite the process by forgoing hearings and directly finalizing the rule.

**Lawmakers Attempt To Save Rescheduling, Hemp From Republican Ax**
Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Nancy Mace, and Morgan McGarvey introduced amendments to block efforts to thwart rescheduling and ban consumable hemp products. The amendments aim to prevent the Drug Enforcement Agency from implementing a change in the Controlled Substances Act, even if it decides to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III. Mace, who has been an advocate for drug policy reform, said, 'We want to make sure rescheduling happens.' Tlaib and McGarvey's amendments aim to stop the committee from interfering with the Department of Justice's ability to reschedule cannabis. The hemp industry is also facing challenges from GOP lawmakers, who have approved language that would ban the sale of consumable hemp products with quantifiable amounts of THC or other cannabinoids.

A group of nine US senators, led by Sen. Jeff Merkley, are urging the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a standard of care for medical marijuana and allow VA doctors to recommend cannabis to patients. The senators' letter comes as the Biden administration is proposing to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. The senators argue that giving veterans access to medical cannabis could help offset the significant rates of opioid overdose deaths within the population. They also suggest that the VA should provide education on the endocannabinoid system and the benefits and risks of medical cannabis use to its practitioners.

**Gov. Beshear asks DEA to ease restrictions on marijuana**
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has written a letter to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) administrator, Anne Milgram, expressing his support for rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. This move would allow patients to have an alternative to deadly opioids and continued access to safe products, and would also help communities reduce crime and illicit drug use. Beshear believes that rescheduling would create fair markets for cannabis businesses and provide opportunities for research. He notes that the medical marijuana law he signed, which passed with bipartisan support, takes effect in January 2025 and the state is currently taking license applications for all aspects of the business. The Governor also highlights the opioid epidemic, stating that nationally, opioid use killed 80,000 Americans in 2022, while marijuana use alone killed zero Americans.

**Biden declares: it's time to repair injustices on marijuana!**
On July 17, 2024, US President Joe Biden expressed his determination to ensure that no one is arrested solely for using or possessing marijuana. Biden stated that it is time to 'correct these historical errors'. Many US states have already legalized marijuana for recreational and medicinal use, with varying limits on possession and rules for home cultivation. On May 16, 2024, the US Department of Justice proposed considering marijuana as a lower-risk drug and allowing its medical use nationwide. The suggestion was initially made by the Biden administration in April. The proposal suggests reclassifying marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. Currently, marijuana is considered a high-potential drug for abuse. Biden had previously spoken out on the issue of marijuana. In May, he shared a video on X, stating that the new measure would benefit thousands of Americans. 'Many lives have been destroyed due to the failed approach to marijuana. I am committed to correcting these errors,' he said.

**Could The Supreme Court Be The Last Chance For Marijuana Legalization In America?**
The Supreme Court's recent ruling on the Chevron Oil company may have implications for marijuana legalization in America. The cannabis industry is looking to the Supreme Court as a potential avenue for full marijuana legalization, as rescheduling cannabis to a Schedule 3 drug may not be possible. A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Massachusetts cannabis businesses seeking to block the federal government from enforcing marijuana prohibition, citing a lack of likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. Despite the setback, industry leaders and advocacy groups plan to continue fighting for federal marijuana reform through legislative and legal channels. The classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) remains a contentious point, with advocates arguing that it is outdated and does not reflect the current scientific understanding of marijuana's medical benefits.

**This Huge Catalyst Could Drive Cannabis Stocks Much Higher Soon**
Cannabis stocks are undervalued and may experience a significant increase if the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Department of Justice (DOJ) reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This change would allow cannabis companies to deduct operating expenses against revenue, resulting in a significant cash windfall. The timeline for this change is uncertain, but publication of a final rule by October is possible. However, there is a potential pitfall in the form of an internal administrative law judge hearing, which could add years to the process. Experts believe that this is unlikely to happen, especially if the goal is to get the change done before the election.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reminded taxpayers that marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, subject to the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 280E. Despite ongoing confusion and attempts by some taxpayers to seek refunds related to Section 280E, the law has not changed, and taxpayers who file amended returns are not entitled to refunds or payments. Section 280E disallows deductions or credits for businesses involved in the illegal trafficking of controlled substances, but allows businesses to subtract the cost of goods sold from their gross receipts when calculating taxable income. The IRS has issued this reminder to ensure marijuana businesses and their tax professionals understand the current legal landscape and avoid filing invalid amended returns.

**Should gaming take advantage of the latest developments in cannabis?**
The Justice Department's decision to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act has significant implications for the legal cannabis industry. Nevada's gaming industry should reconsider its prohibitionist stance on engaging with the legal cannabis industry, given the growing demand for cannabis-related activities among tourists and travelers. The majority of cannabis users are between 18 and 34 years old, and many are frequent users. Gaming establishments can capitalize on this trend by offering cannabis-infused beverages and other products, which have evolved significantly since the start of state legalization. By embracing cannabis, Nevada gaming establishments can attract new customers and recapture revenue from non-alcoholic drinkers.
