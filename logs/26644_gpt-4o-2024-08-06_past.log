To make this prediction, we need to analyze the trend in the growth of articles on the Spanish Wikipedia. Based on historical data, the Spanish Wikipedia has shown steady growth over recent years. Itâ€™s crucial to determine the average increase in the number of articles per month to project future growth.

Let's break it down:

1. **Past Growth Rate**: The Spanish Wikipedia had approximately 1.8 million articles in mid-2023. Given a historical growth rate of around 20,000 articles per month in the years prior, it's been consistent in its expansion. This means a rough estimate of 240,000 articles added annually under consistent growth conditions.

2. **Rate Adjustment**: External factors, such as increased participation or events sparking content creation, could influence growth. However, given no extraordinary recent events expected to drastically change this growth pattern, we project a similar rate for 2024.

3. **Projections**: By maintaining an average growth of approximately 20,000 articles per month since mid-2023:
   - By July 2024, the count would approximately be 1.96 million.
   - By September 2024, expecting around 40,000 more articles, reaching about 2 million.

Given these projections, the probability of Spanish Wikipedia reaching 2 million articles between the specified dates is comparatively high, since this is typically consistent with past trends and projected rates.

Taking into account potential deviations from the expected growth rate, due to events that might spur irregular additions of content, I am forecasting based on the assumption that no significant immediate changes impact this trend within this window.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 90.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.
