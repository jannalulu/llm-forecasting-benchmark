Let me carefully analyze this prediction step by step:

Key Evidence:
1. As of July 25, 2024, the market cap was already $2.35 trillion, which is above the $2 trillion threshold
2. First half of 2024 saw a 37.3% market cap increase
3. Q2 2024 saw a 14.4% market cap drop to $2.43 trillion
4. Some analysts like Michael van de Poppe predict crypto market could reach $4 trillion
5. Bitcoin market cap is around $1.34 trillion as of July 21, 2024
6. Multiple sources suggest continued growth potential in crypto markets

Counterpoints:
1. Market has shown volatility with significant quarterly drops
2. Macroeconomic uncertainties remain
3. Regulatory environment continues to evolve

Analytical Assessment:
- Current trajectory suggests staying above $2 trillion
- Recent data shows strong underlying growth momentum
- More upside potential than downside risk

Balancing Calibration and Resolution:
- Historical performance suggests high probability of staying above $2 trillion
- Market fundamentals support continued growth

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.50% being the most likely. Probability: 90.50%.
