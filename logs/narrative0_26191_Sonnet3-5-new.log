Nate Silver: [reviewing data on multiple screens] Phil, after Biden's June debate disaster and the cascade of Democratic defections, our models were surprisingly steady.

Philip Tetlock: [sipping coffee] Indeed. Despite the NBC report about campaign staff doubts and those 12 members of Congress calling for his withdrawal, our superforecast gave it only 32.45% probability.

Nate: The virtual vote option in July created some uncertainty, but not enough to tip the scales. Even with his declining poll numbers, Biden's stubbornness was always a key variable in our models.

Philip: Exactly. The historical precedent of incumbent presidents rarely withdrawing their candidacy this late in the cycle was weighted heavily. The convention's approaching, and our model held true â€“ he's still in the race.

Nate: [nodding] Yes, our 32.45% forecast captured the reality perfectly. Another win for superforecasting.

Nate Silver: [shuffling through papers] Well, Phil, another prediction in the books. Biden's debate performance really shook things up.

Philip Tetlock: Indeed. Our models had been tracking this carefully since those House Democrats started calling for his withdrawal. The fundraising crisis and that NBC report were particularly telling.

Nate: No surprise here. Our models gave it a 32.45% chance of Biden ending his candidacy before the convention. Even with all the pressure, the incumbency factor remained strong.

Philip: [nodding] Exactly. The virtual roll call vote option gave him flexibility, and despite the fitness concerns, our data showed he'd likely stay the course. The probability never crossed the 50% threshold, even after that debate disaster.

Nate: [looking at computer screen] The interesting thing is how close it got though. A month ago, we had it at just 15%.

Nate Silver: [shuffling through papers] Well, Phil, yesterday was quite something. Did our models predict Biden's situation accurately?

Philip Tetlock: [looking at computer screen] No, our models had it at 32.8%. Despite the June debate disaster and growing Democratic opposition, the data suggested Biden would stick it out through the convention.

Nate: The fundraising crisis and those 12 Congress members calling for his withdrawal were concerning signals, but...

Philip: [interrupting] The historical precedent was strong. No incumbent president has ever withdrawn this close to their party's convention. Even with his polling numbers and the NBC report about campaign staff doubts, our models showed he'd remain the nominee.

Nate: [nodding] Exactly. The virtual vote option gave him flexibility, but our models indicated he'd weather the storm. Sometimes the unlikely path is the one that manifests.

NATE: [removing glasses] Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about Biden's candidacy status through July 23rd.

PHILIP: Indeed. Despite the June debate disaster and those 12 lawmakers calling for his withdrawal, our models had it at 22.7%.

NATE: The fundraising crisis and NBC's report about campaign staff doubts were concerning signals, but not enough to tip the scales. Even with the Convention approaching, the probability never crossed the 50% threshold.

PHILIP: [nodding] The virtual vote option created some uncertainty, but Biden's team remained remarkably resilient. Historical precedent for an incumbent dropping out this late was virtually non-existent.

NATE: Another win for quantitative forecasting over pundit speculation.

Nate: The debate disaster really shifted things. But not enough to make him drop out.

Philip: [nodding] The House Democrats' revolt was concerning, but our data showed Biden's stubbornness would prevail. Even with eleven representatives and that senator calling for his withdrawal.

Nate: The fundraising hit and campaign staff doubts were red flags, but historically, incumbents rarely drop out this close to the convention.
