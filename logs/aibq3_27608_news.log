**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aiming to Isolate and Capture Glushkovo**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The locality of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the locality of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also to the east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the localities of Snagost and Apanasovka. To the south is the border with Ukraine, and to the north, most of the district is separated from the rest of Russian territory by the Seim River. 'The district has been isolated,' said Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, 'and will fall in a matter of days.' Ukraine is continuing to attack what remains of the bridges, and several thousand Russian troops risk being surrounded, according to Shuklínov, who believes that the only way they could escape would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and cross the river on foot. This potential victory would place another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control, says the blogger, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha.

**Ukraine Expands Its Offensive in Kursk, Capturing New Territory**
Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState. 'We are working hard for a free press without censorship,' said the editorial note.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Captures Over 11 Square Kilometers of Russian Territory**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in Kursk, capturing over 11 square kilometers of Russian territory west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha.

**Ukrainian Military Repeats 'Kherson Maneuver' in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military has begun to repeat their 'Kherson maneuver' in the Kursk region, increasing the zone of combat operations by approximately 1.5 times. According to Russian sources, the situation in the Kursk region has deteriorated significantly on August 16. The Ukrainian military has destroyed a key logistical artery of the Russian military, a bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo. As a result, the Glushkovsky district is on the verge of becoming a 'kettle' for Russian soldiers. If the Ukrainian forces completely destroy the Russian logistics across the river and occupy part of the Glushkovsky district, the zone of combat operations will increase by approximately 700 square kilometers. This scenario is quite realistic, as the given area is already surrounded by Ukrainian forces from three sides. 'In 2022, this scenario, but on a larger scale, was successfully implemented by the Ukrainian military in the Kherson region,' noted journalists. Military analyst Yan Matveev also believes that the Ukrainian military is targeting the capture of these territories. 'The Ukrainian military destroyed the bridge over the Seim River in the Glushkovo area with HIMARS rockets. A large and important bridge - without it, the logistics of the border area for the Russian army will be significantly hampered. It is likely that the Ukrainian military will try to attack and advance in this area in the near future,' wrote the expert in Telegram. In the Kherson region in the fall of 2022, the Ukrainian military destroyed the supply lines of the Russian troops across the Dnieper River, forcing the occupiers to retreat to the right bank. They had to leave Kherson, the only regional center captured during the 'SVO'.

**Ukrainian Forces Make Minor Advances in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian forces have made minor advances in the Kursk region. According to geolocation images published on August 21, Ukrainian forces have advanced in eastern Komarovka (south of Korenevo and east of Sudzha), although Russian sources claim that Russian forces have repelled Ukrainian attacks in this area. As reported by ISW, Ukrainian forces, operating north-east of Korenevo, have captured Semenovka and advanced in southern Levshinka. Additionally, they have made minor advances in northern Martynovka (north-east of Sudzha). 'Further geolocation images published on August 22 show that Ukrainian forces have made minor advances in southern Russian Konopelka (east of Sudzha). Russian military bloggers claimed that units of the 'Wild Division of Donbass', including the 'Arbat', 'Yatnashka', and 'Sarmat' battalions, captured Nechaev (north of Sudzha).' According to Russian war correspondents, Ukrainian forces continued to engage in battles with Russian forces in the areas of Glushkovo, Korenevo, Sudzha, and Belov in the Kursk region. Sources claimed that the Ukrainian military conducted a reconnaissance operation by fire at Zabrama, Briansk region, in the evening of August 21, but Russian forces, including Russian border guards and Chechen special forces 'Akhmat', repelled the attack.

**Special Ops Showcases Destruction of Russian Bridges and Pontoons in Kursk Region with HIMARS**
The Special Operations Forces (SSO) of Ukraine have released a video showing the destruction of Russian engineering equipment, including bridges and pontoon crossings, in the Kursk region using the American High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). The video captures the coordinated efforts of Ukrainian fire support units and unmanned aerial systems targeting enemy positions. A Ukrainian military officer said, 'After such damage, neither the equipment nor the pontoon crossing will function properly.' The destruction of these targets is part of the Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region, which has resulted in the capture of over 1,250 square kilometers of territory and 92 settlements. According to a Ukrainian Air Force representative, Ukrainian long-range artillery units have targeted and destroyed several bridges in the area, including one near Glushkovo, which was demolished by an air-launched guided bomb on August 16. The Ukrainian Defense Forces have also destroyed a cluster of Russian equipment, field ammunition, fuel depots, a radio-electronic warfare complex, and a 152-mm D-20 gun.

**Russian and Ukrainian Forces Report Advances in Donietsk and Kursk Regions**
Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have reported advances in the Donietsk and Kursk regions. According to available information, Russian forces have occupied 80 square kilometers of territory, including 59 square kilometers near the city of Pokrovsk, which is a key logistical hub. Ukrainian forces have been evacuating families with children from the area, with the head of the military administration of Donietsk, Vadym Filashkin, ordering the evacuation of over 4,000 children. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have been making gains in the Kursk region, with the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, Oleksandr Syrskyi, stating that his forces control 93 Russian localities and an area of 1,263 square kilometers. Syrskyi also revealed that Russia has launched 44,500 projectiles since August 6, three times more than Ukraine, and that Ukraine has intercepted one in four Russian missiles since February 2022. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have been making progress in the Glushkovo region, where Russian forces are at risk of being surrounded by Ukrainian troops. 'The situation is dire for the Russian forces,' said expert Yan Matveyev, 'they either need to retreat or send more troops, but they will eventually be killed or captured.'

**Ukrainian Forces Continue to Advance in Kursk Region, Achieve Additional Gains**
According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian forces continued to attack across the entire front in the Kursk region on August 20 and achieved additional gains. They likely captured Vyzhnyvka (14 km southwest of Korenevo and 14 km from the border), advanced west along the Sudzhansky Highway in eastern Korenevo, and in fields northeast of Korenevo. Additionally, Ukrainian forces advanced in forested areas north of Ruska-Poritska (20 km from the border), as reported by ISW. Some Russian bloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces captured Vyzhnyvka, which corresponds to the Russian Ministry of Defense's report on August 19, which quietly acknowledged Ukrainian advances in the Vyzhnyvka area. Geolocation images published on August 19 show Ukrainian forces advancing west along the Sudzhansky Highway in eastern Korenevo and in fields northeast of the settlement. Russian bloggers reported on August 20 that Ukrainian forces continued to launch mechanized attacks on the outskirts of Korenevo and that the Russians were striking with artillery and air strikes to stem the Ukrainian advance. It is believed that Russian forces have regained some lost positions and advanced in fields south of Safonivka (northeast of Korenevo and 30 km from the border). According to ISW, geolocation images from August 20 show that Ukrainian forces also advanced in forested areas north of Ruska-Poritska (northeast of Sudzh and 20 km from the border), corresponding to maps of Russian bloggers depicting Ukrainian advances across all administrative boundaries of Ruska-Poritska. Experts at the institute, citing a Russian blogger, noted that Ukrainian forces also advanced to the western outskirts of Ruska Konopelka, east of Sudzh. 'Geolocation images published on August 20, showing Ukrainian forces towing a captured Russian T-90M tank along the Snagost-Lyubimivka road (southeast of Koryovno and 8 km from the border), indicate that Ukrainian forces continue to operate within the announced maximum limits of the Ukrainian advance in the Kursk region,' ISW emphasized. ISW also highlights the efforts of the ZSU to strike Russian pontoon bridges and pontoon engineering equipment west of the current advance in the Kursk region across the Seim River in the Glushkovo area. This is confirmed by corresponding geolocation images. ISW notes that satellite images show that Ukrainian forces have destroyed at least one pontoon bridge across the Seim.

**Ukraine Claims Victory in Russia's Kursk Region**
According to a report by the US-based Institute for the Study of War, Ukrainian forces have achieved further successes in Russia's Kursk region. The report states that Ukrainian forces have struck Russian pontoon bridges and engineering equipment on the Seym River in the Glushkov district. Satellite images show that on August 19, Ukrainian troops were able to destroy at least one pontoon bridge on the Seym. Some Russian military bloggers have claimed that Ukrainian forces have captured the village of Vishneva, and even the Russian Ministry of Defense had hinted at Ukrainian successes in the Vishneva area in a report released on August 19, stating that 'Ukrainian forces have achieved successes in the Vishneva area', as noted in the report.

**Ukrainian Forces Advance in Kursk Region, Destroying Russian Equipment and Capturing Villages**
The Ukrainian military continues to advance in the Kursk region of Russia, with new successes reported. According to analysts at the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukrainian drones have been striking Russian equipment, as seen on geolocation images. The Russian military is using this equipment to transport pontoons to a base near the Seim River, approximately 3 kilometers north of Glushkovo. Satellite images confirm that Ukrainian forces have destroyed at least one pontoon bridge across the Seim River as of August 19. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured the village of Vishnevka, located southwest of Korenevo and 14 kilometers from the international border. The Russian Ministry of Defense has acknowledged this information in a statement on August 19, noting the Ukrainian military's advance near the village. Ukrainian forces have also made progress westward along the 38K-030 highway in the eastern part of Korenevo, as well as through fields to the northeast of the village. Russian military bloggers report that Ukrainian forces have continued to launch mechanized attacks on the outskirts of Korenevo, despite Russian artillery and air strikes aimed at halting their advance. Geolocation images from August 20 show Ukrainian forces advancing in the wooded area north of Ruski-Porichni. A pro-Kremlin military blogger stated on the same day that Ukrainian forces have also approached the western outskirts of Ruska Konopelka, located east of Sudzha.

**Russia Redeploys Forces from Chasiv Yar to Kursk in Response to Ukrainian Advance**
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports that Russia has redeployed its forces from the Chasiv Yar area to the Kursk region in an attempt to counter the ongoing Ukrainian advance. Analysts believe that the Russian command has redeployed units of the 11th Airborne Brigade, which previously operated near Chasiv Yar. Additionally, Russian 'war correspondents' claim that the Kremlin has also redeployed units of the 30th Motorized Rifle Regiment (72nd Motorized Rifle Division, 22nd Army Corps) from the north of Kharkiv Oblast to Kursk. However, the ISW notes that it will likely take several weeks to observe any potential consequences of these redeployments for Russian forces in the Donetsk region. The ISW also reports that Ukrainian forces continued to attack along the entire front in Kursk on August 20 and achieved additional gains. Ukrainian troops, it appears, continue to attempt to destroy Russian pontoon bridges and similar engineering equipment across the Seim River, approximately 3 km from the village of Glushkovo. Geolocated footage shows Ukrainian drones striking Russian equipment delivering pontons to the area. Satellite images show that Ukrainian forces have destroyed at least one pontoon bridge across the Seim. Some Russian 'war correspondents' claim that Ukrainian soldiers have captured Vishneva (southwest of Korenevo and 14 km from the state border). This information corresponds to the Russian Ministry of Defense's report on August 19, which quietly acknowledged Ukrainian advances. The ISW notes geolocated footage showing Ukrainian forces advancing westward along the Sudzhansky Shlyakh street (road 38K-030) east of Korenevo, as well as in fields northeast of the settlement. Other geolocated footage published on August 20 shows Ukrainian forces towing a captured Russian T-90M tank along the Snagost-Lyubimovka road (southeast of Korenevo and 8 km from the state border), indicating that Ukrainian troops continue to operate within the announced maximum limits of their advance in Kursk Oblast, concluded the ISW.

**Ukrainian Forces Close In on Russian Group in Kursk Region**
According to expert Julian Repke, Ukrainian forces have destroyed all bridges across the Seim River in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region, potentially cutting off the Russian group. The remaining Russian forces are defending a single passage on the eastern side. Ukrainian forces have captured the village of Vynnykivka and reached the railway. Repke states that Ukrainian forces have only 2.6 kilometers left to reach the Seim River and close the encirclement. To avoid being surrounded, Russian forces are trying to create pontoon crossings, but Ukrainian forces are monitoring Russian engineers and equipment approaching the river and destroying them with drones. Ukrainian forces have also captured the village of Koreneve, and fighting is ongoing for the same-named settlement and railway station. Russian forces are shelling Ukrainian armored vehicles with guided bombs. The capture of Koreneve would also close the encirclement, as there are no large roads between the village and the Seim River. According to an informed observer, approximately 3,000 Russian soldiers remain in the encirclement area of 700 square kilometers. 'About 1,000 in small villages Tiotkino and Glushkovo and another 1,000 along the border with Ukraine,' the source said. Repke believes that the success of the Ukrainian forces in capturing this 20x35 kilometer territory depends on the number of Ukrainian forces involved.

**Ukrainian Forces Close in on Russian 'Kotla' in Glushkovsky Region**
According to Julian Röpke, an analyst for the German publication BILD, the Ukrainian military has left the Russian forces in the Glushkovsky region with only 2.6 kilometers to go before they are completely surrounded and cut off from supplies. The Ukrainian forces have already destroyed all the stationary bridges over the Seim River, and Röpke believes that when the Ukrainian forces physically approach the river, they will be left with no other land route to supply their troops. 'It's a very tight situation for the Russians,' Röpke said. The Ukrainian forces have already captured the village of Vyzhnyvka and are now at the railway, leaving only 2.6 kilometers to the Seim River to complete the encirclement. The Russians are trying to create pontoon bridges to supply their troops, but the Ukrainian forces are tracking the Russian bridge-laying equipment and technicians and destroying it with drones. The Ukrainian forces have also captured the village of Korenev and are fighting for the same-named village and railway station, which would complete the encirclement and cut off the Russian forces from the rest of Russia.

**Russian Soldiers Trapped in Glushkovsky District: 'I Want to Live' Project Urges Surrender**
The 'I Want to Live' project has addressed a message to Russian soldiers in the Glushkovsky district, stating that the enemy group has been cut off from supply routes and is effectively trapped. The project notes that Ukrainian forces have destroyed bridges in the villages of Glushkovo, Zvanoe, and Karizh, as well as a pontoon crossing used by the Russians. The paths of retreat have been severed, making it impossible for the Russians to evacuate wounded soldiers or receive adequate food and ammunition. The project urges Russian soldiers to surrender, stating that 'hundreds of your comrades have made the right choice and are now waiting for their return home without risk of death through exchange.'

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aims to Isolate Russian Forces**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, crossing the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate over 50 localities and Russian forces in the area by destroying bridges over the Seim River north and exerting pressure from captured areas east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. According to the DeepState analysis platform, the localities of Otruba and its surroundings were conquered by Ukraine, while six kilometers and the locality of Tétkino are disputed. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the localities of Snagost and Apanasovka. The Ukrainian Air Force confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim in the last few days and is attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, stated, 'The majority of the district has been isolated from the rest of Russia and will fall in a matter of days,' while Shuklínov also noted that several thousand Russian troops risk being surrounded, with the only way to escape being to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and cross the river on foot. This potential victory would place another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control, according to Shuklínov, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Aiming to Isolate and Capture Glushkovo**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the Glushkovo district, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The village of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the village of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the villages of Snagost and Apanasovka. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, two bridges over the Seim River have been destroyed by their aviation in recent days and are attacking the Russian logistical network in the district. Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, said that the majority of the district has now been 'isolated' from the rest of Russia and will 'fall in a matter of days', while Ukraine continues to attack what remains of the bridges. Shuklínov estimates that several thousand Russian troops are at risk of being surrounded, and the only way they could save themselves would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and escape on foot. 'This victory could put another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control,' Shuklínov said, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst, agrees that Russia is at risk of losing these territories, as Ukrainian advances in the northeast of Glushkovo, near Korenevo, could soon cut off the only remaining route for a retreat. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' Kovalenko highlighted in his latest analysis for the 'Resistencia Informativa' group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient troops to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued despite their pace slowing down after the first days of rapid progress. Kovalenko estimates that the Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, let alone expel it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more troops Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, as Zelenski said on Sunday, aims to create a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weaken its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' Zelenski emphasized on Monday after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

Ukraine has expanded its offensive in the Russian region of Kursk, penetrating the border at a second point west of the district of Glushkovo, where it is trying to isolate more than 50 localities, as well as Russian forces in the area, through the destruction of bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the already captured areas in the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have been brought under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. The locality of Otruba and its surroundings have been conquered by Ukraine, according to the DeepState analysis platform, which notes that six other kilometers and the locality of Tétkino are in dispute. Ukrainian forces are now present west of the attacked district of Glushkovo and also to the east, where they continued to advance with the capture of the localities of Snagost and Apanasovka. To the south is the border with Ukraine, and to the north, most of the district is separated from the rest of Russian territory by the Seim River. 'The district has been isolated,' said Petró Shuklínov, a Ukrainian military blogger, 'and will fall in a matter of days.' Ukraine is continuing to attack what remains of the bridges, and several thousand Russian troops risk being surrounded, according to Shuklínov, who believes that the only way they could escape would be to surrender or abandon their bases and equipment and cross the river on foot. This potential victory would place another 500 square kilometers and 50 localities under Ukrainian control, says the blogger, while Glushkovo could become a second major stronghold for Ukrainian forces in Kursk, after Sudzha. 'If Glushkovo falls under Ukrainian control, the total area captured in Kursk, over 1,500 kilometers, will be greater than what Russia has captured in Ukraine in all of 2024,' emphasized Kovalenko in his latest analysis for the Resistencia Informativa group. Kovalenko argues that Russia has not yet transferred sufficient forces to the area to stop Ukrainian advances, which have continued although their pace has slowed down after the first days of rapid progress, and estimates that Russian forces in the area are fewer than 15,000 soldiers. It would take at least double that number to prevent Ukraine from expanding the area under its control, not to mention expelling it from occupied territories, as publicly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, it is unclear how many more forces Ukraine can deploy in Kursk in general and in Glushkovo in particular. The Ukrainian government continues to avoid revealing details about the ongoing operation, which, according to Volodimir Zelenski, has the goal of creating a 'buffer zone' in Russian territory and weakening its military potential. 'We are achieving our objectives,' emphasized the Ukrainian president on Monday, after saying that more Russian soldiers have been taken prisoner in Kursk.

**Ukraine Expands Its Offensive in Kursk, Capturing New Territory**
Ukrainian forces have taken control of the Russian town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area after crossing the border into the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian military analysts. The capture of Otruba was confirmed by the Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState on Sunday. According to the combat map, several more towns are being contested, including Tiotkino and the surrounding areas of Popovo-Lezhachi, totaling six square kilometers. These battles are taking place west of the Glushkovo district in the Kursk region, approximately 35 kilometers from the area that Ukraine already controls in the region. In recent days, the Ukrainian Air Force has confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River, out of a total of three in the area north of Glushkovo. Ukrainian forces continue to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create the possibility of a encirclement, said Ukrainian military analysts. East of the Glushkovo district, Ukraine captured the towns of Snagost and Apanasivka, DeepState reported on Sunday night, and Ukrainian forces have also made advances in Olgovka, near Korenevo, to the north. As a result, Ukraine now controls or contests over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState. 'We are working hard for a free press without censorship,' said the editorial note.

**Ukraine Expands Offensive in Kursk, Captures Over 11 Square Kilometers of Russian Territory**
Ukraine has expanded its offensive in Kursk, capturing over 11 square kilometers of Russian territory west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging at a distance of about 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha.

They are attempting to isolate over 50 localities and Russian forces in the area by destroying bridges over the Seim River to the north and exerting pressure from the east. More than 11 square kilometers of Russian territory have come under Ukrainian control west of Glushkovo, where a new front is emerging approximately 35 kilometers from the captured area west of Sudzha. 'Ukrainian forces are making significant gains in the region,' said no one in the article, but the situation on the ground suggests a significant push by Ukrainian troops.

**Ukrainian Forces Damage Last Bridge Across Sejm River, Russian Army Trapped?**
The Ukrainian military has damaged the third and last stationary bridge across the Sejm River in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region of Russia, near the village of Karizh. According to a video statement by a representative of the Russian Investigative Committee, published in the Telegram channel of Russian state TV host Vladimir Solovyov, Ukrainian forces struck the bridge the day before. Russian military bloggers reported the damage in the morning. Currently, the Russian army is providing its grouping in the area via a pontoon crossing, according to Z-bloggers. Ukraine has not commented on this information. The Ukrainian military previously destroyed the first two bridges across the river on August 16 and 18. This has disrupted supplies to an area of approximately 700 square kilometers in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces are advancing. Meanwhile, the Russian army is advancing on the Donbas front, with almost the entire settlement of New York reportedly captured. The Russian army has less than 10 kilometers left to reach the city of Pokrovsk, which military analysts consider the 'key to the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration.' Sergei Dobryak, the head of the Pokrovsk MVA, stated in an interview with Radio Liberty (Freedom Morning project) this morning that the Russian army's advance has accelerated, and residents have up to two weeks to evacuate safely. Earlier today, the head of the Kursk regional military administration, Vadim Filashkin, announced that forced evacuation of families with children from Pokrovsk has begun. The main questions of the broadcast are: Does the destruction of all bridges across the Sejm River mean that the Russian grouping in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region is de facto trapped? What would Ukraine gain from capturing the entire region - likely without a fight? And what threat does the start of the battle for Pokrovsk pose to Ukraine - and the possible loss of the city? These and other topics will be discussed in the broadcast of Radio Donbas Realities. Watch live - at 16:30 on @Radio Liberty:

**Ukraine Advances in Kursk, According to Analysts**
According to analysts, Ukrainian forces have advanced in the Kursk region of Russia, taking control of the town of Otruba and 11.5 square kilometers of surrounding area. The Ukrainian analysis platform DeepState confirmed the capture of Otruba on Sunday. Additionally, Ukrainian forces are disputing control of Tiotkino and the surrounding area, with six square kilometers in play. Ukraine has also confirmed the destruction of two bridges over the Seim River north of Glushkovo, and continues to attack Russia's logistical capabilities to isolate its troops and create a potential encirclement. In total, Ukraine now controls or disputes over 1,200 square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk, according to DeepState.

**Situation Report: Glushkovsky Area, August 19**
Our group has now fully secured the Glushkovsky area with pontoon bridges, after the enemy destroyed the last remaining stationary bridge over the Seim River in Karizh. This is sufficient for effective actions to hold back the enemy's attacks. Meanwhile, the enemy continues to try and recapture Apanasievka, but their progress is slow, and it's more accurate to say they're trying rather than advancing. There are also ongoing attempts to probe our positions in the Tetyokino area and small skirmishes on the border. The Ukrainian forces, constantly under our air strikes, have been stuck in place for two days and are losing momentum. Our reserves are being constantly replenished, and even a one-day delay is crucial. Three days ago, there were concerns that the enemy might push us back across the Seim, but now they would need to deploy significantly more forces to achieve this, and even then, the outcome is far from guaranteed.

**Ukraine's Zelensky: 'We are becoming stronger at Kursk'**
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, 'We are becoming stronger at Kursk.' The Ukrainian forces are consolidating their positions in Russian territory, with the goal of creating a 'buffer zone' to reduce the impact of Russian raids. 'We want to inflict the maximum damage on the Russian military apparatus and conduct counter-offensive actions: this includes the creation of a buffer zone in enemy territory, with our operation in the Kursk region,' Zelensky said. 'Everything that damages the Russian military system - he reiterated - prevents the expansion of the war, brings an end to this aggression, and a just peace for Ukraine.' The Ukrainian plan has led to the destruction of a second bridge on the Selm River, near the area where ground units have taken control of Russian territory. The bridge, still standing but with a large hole in the center, is located near the settlement of Zvannoe, northwest of Glushkovo, where a bridge was destroyed last Friday. 'The air forces are depriving the enemy of logistical options with precision strikes that will have a significant impact on combat operations,' the command stated. In the Glushkovo area, only one bridge remains usable for the supply of Russian forces deployed in the area. 'The Russians do not want to fight,' Ukraine claims, with hundreds of Russian soldiers surrendering every day. Ukraine says it has captured 100-150 Russian prisoners of war per day since the incursion began, according to data released by Oleksii Drozdenko, commander of the military administration of the city of Sumy: Russian soldiers often young conscripts, 'do not want to fight against us.' From the Russian side, the authorities of the Korenevsky district, in the Kursk region, are urging civilians to leave their homes: 'The operational situation in our district remains difficult. Some citizens do not give up the attempt to return to their homes, complicating the work of our armed forces. For residents, it is impossible to return to the area at the moment, sometimes attempts end in terrible tragedies.'

**Frontline report: Sudzha city taken, Glushkovo city next**
The Ukrainians have successfully taken control of Sudzha, establishing a logistical hub for further assaults in the southern Kursk region. The capture of Sudzha, with its intact infrastructure, provides a strategic advantage for the Ukrainians, enabling them to establish a stable logistical hub to support further operations across the Kursk region. The urban layout of Sudzha offers Ukrainian forces significant advantages for concealing armored and motorized vehicles, allowing them to accumulate resources for future offensives and repair damaged equipment. The Ukrainians have also employed remote mining techniques to strategically place anti-infantry and anti-tank mines along potential Russian assault routes, effectively thwarting Russian counterattacks. The Ukrainians have now redirected their assaults toward Glushkovo west of Sudzha, where Russian defenses are weaker and forces more dispersed. Ukrainian forces have begun striking the settlement of Tyotkino using aerial attacks, and by capturing Tyotkino, Ukrainian forces will gain access to the Tyotkino-Glushkovo highway, enabling them to deploy mobile units for a swift advance toward Glushkovo.

**Russia May Retake Kursk in October 2024**
Ukraine has successfully launched an operation in the Kursk region, taking control of a part of the Russian region. Western analysts believe that Russia will try to retake the area by the end of October. According to The Times, 'Russia is expected to counterattack near Kursk before the onset of winter in late October.' The operation is a 'triumph for Ukraine and a disgrace for the 'second army of the world,' which has lost 15,000 armored vehicles and 6,000 tanks. Former British Defense Secretary Shapps emphasized, 'A democratic country invaded by its autocratic neighbor is a disaster not only for that nation, but for the whole world. Therefore, democracies must stop at nothing to ensure the victory of freedom.' The Ukrainian Armed Forces are approaching the key artery of the region, and the most active fighting is taking place in the Hlushkiv district, where several thousand Russian troops are surrounded.

**Russian Army 'Organizedly Retreats' to Eastern Bank of Seim River near Tiotkino**
The Russian army has 'organizedly retreated' to the eastern bank of the Seim River near Tiotkino in the Kursk region. This was reported by Russian Telegram channels on August 17. According to the propagandists on the 'Divnom Genstab' channel, 'The settlements have been evacuated, two bridges in Tiotkino and Popovo-Lezhachi have been blown up during the approach of the enemy. New prepared defense lines have been occupied.' The Seim River separates the border territory of Russia from Ukraine, and Tiotkino is located on its eastern bank. The Russian Ministry of Defense has not officially confirmed the retreat. On August 16, Russian media reported that Ukrainian defense forces had likely destroyed a crucial bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region. Initially, it was claimed that several HIMARS rockets had been launched at the bridge. Later, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Forces, Nikolai Oleschuk, published a video on Facebook showing a Ukrainian air strike on the bridge over the Seim. User Sergey Prokhorov published a video on social media with a map showing three bridges over the Seim. According to him, the other two bridges in this area are less suitable for supply. In his opinion, the bridge in Glushkovo was the only one that provided a supply line to a large area surrounded by the river and Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian military operation in the Kursk region began on August 6, and fighting has been ongoing in the region. Media reported that Russia had redeployed troops and equipment from the Belgorod and Donetsk regions to the Kursk region. Since August 9, a counter-terrorism operation regime has been introduced in three neighboring regions with Ukraine - Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod. On August 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky officially announced that Ukrainian forces were conducting an operation in the Kursk region. According to him, hundreds of Russian soldiers had been captured. The first Ukrainian military command, led by General-Major Eduard Moskalov, was established.

**Ukrainian Military Repeats 'Kherson Maneuver' in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military has begun to repeat their 'Kherson maneuver' in the Kursk region, increasing the zone of combat operations by approximately 1.5 times. According to Russian sources, the situation in the Kursk region has deteriorated significantly on August 16. The Ukrainian military has destroyed a key logistical artery of the Russian military, a bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo. As a result, the Glushkovsky district is on the verge of becoming a 'kettle' for Russian soldiers. If the Ukrainian forces completely destroy the Russian logistics across the river and occupy part of the Glushkovsky district, the zone of combat operations will increase by approximately 700 square kilometers. This scenario is quite realistic, as the given area is already surrounded by Ukrainian forces from three sides. 'In 2022, this scenario, but on a larger scale, was successfully implemented by the Ukrainian military in the Kherson region,' noted journalists. Military analyst Yan Matveev also believes that the Ukrainian military is targeting the capture of these territories. 'The Ukrainian military destroyed the bridge over the Seim River in the Glushkovo area with HIMARS rockets. A large and important bridge - without it, the logistics of the border area for the Russian army will be significantly hampered. It is likely that the Ukrainian military will try to attack and advance in this area in the near future,' wrote the expert in Telegram. In the Kherson region in the fall of 2022, the Ukrainian military destroyed the supply lines of the Russian troops across the Dnieper River, forcing the occupiers to retreat to the right bank. They had to leave Kherson, the only regional center captured during the 'SVO'.

**Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, August 16, 2024**
Ukrainian forces continued to marginally advance southeast of Sudzha on August 16 amid continued Ukrainian operations in Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian strikes reportedly destroyed two bridges in Glushkovo Raion, Kursk Oblast. Ukrainian forces reportedly advanced further into western Belgorod Oblast during recent cross-border assaults than previously reported, but available open-source reporting and evidence indicate that Ukrainian forces no longer maintain positions within Belgorod Oblast as of August 16. Ukrainian officials reported that Ukrainian forces continued to advance in Kursk Oblast and suggested that the incursion has forced Russia to more readily consider prisoner-of-war (POW) exchanges. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Office (UN OHCHR) requested that Russian authorities allow UN representatives to visit Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod oblasts as part of a human rights monitoring mission. US officials reiterated that US policy on Ukraine's ability to use US-provided weapons to conduct long-range strikes against Russian military targets has not changed amid the ongoing Ukrainian incursion into Kursk Oblast. The Kremlin reportedly fired former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu's advisor on information policy Andrei Ilnitsky possibly as part of an ongoing effort to shift control of Russia's wartime information policy from the Ministry of Defense (MoD) to the Russian Presidential Administration.

**Ukraine Advances in Kursk, Destroys Bridge to Block Russian Counterattack**
Ukraine has made significant advances in the Russian province of Kursk, destroying a bridge to block a potential Russian counterattack. According to the Ukrainian military, they have advanced up to 3 kilometers in the region. The commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, Mykola Oleshchuk, released a video showing the attack on a bridge over the Seim River in the Glushkovsky district of Kursk. The destruction was confirmed by the acting governor of the region, Alexey Smirnov. 'The Ukrainian Air Force is actively participating in combat operations in the Kursk sector. Ukrainian pilots are conducting precision attacks against enemy strongholds, equipment concentrations, as well as enemy logistics centers and supply routes,' Oleshchuk said. The Russian Telegram channel Mash published photos of the destroyed bridge and stated that it had been attacked multiple times. It also reported that around 30 settlements near the village of Glushkovo, approximately 150 kilometers from Kursk, were 'isolated' due to the attack. The independent Russian media outlet The Insider reported that the Glushkovsky district has three bridges over the Seim River, with the other two located near the settlements of Zvannoe and Karyzh. Roman Alyokhin, an advisor to the acting governor of the Kursk region and a Russian blogger in favor of the war, also stated that Ukrainian forces are targeting the bridge in Zvannoe, approximately 7 kilometers from Glushkovo, in an attempt to capture part of the Kursk region along the river and prevent a Russian counterattack. Kiev claims that the incursion is not aimed at capturing Russian territory but rather to protect Ukrainian lives by preventing cross-border attacks and diverting Russian reinforcements. Despite reports of Russian forces being moved to the sector, Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine say the situation remains grave as Moscow continues its advance near Pokrovsk and Toretsk.

**Ukrainian Special Operations Forces Show Reconnaissance in Kursk Region Before Advance**
Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SSO) released a video showing their reconnaissance and territory survey in the Kursk region before the Ukrainian army's advance. The video shows SSO soldiers exploring specific areas, conducting demining, and capturing Russian soldiers. One soldier notes that the territory differs significantly from the maps. They had to find alternative routes to avoid detection. The SSO also captured several Russian soldiers. This is not the first video released by the SSO from the operation in Kursk, as they previously showed a video of a successful operation that resulted in the deaths of over a dozen Russian soldiers. The Ukrainian army has been operating in Kursk for almost two weeks, capturing 82 settlements and 1,150 square kilometers of territory. Russian soldiers have been surrendering in large numbers, and Ukraine has established a military administration in the region, led by General-Major Eduard Moskalov. Today, Russia claimed that the Ukrainian army destroyed a bridge over the Seim River near the village of Glushkove, a crucial logistical route for Russian forces. However, the Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, General-Lieutenant Nikolai Oleschuk, stated that the bridge was destroyed by Ukrainian aviation.

**Russia Claims Ukrainian Forces Destroyed Crucial Bridge in Glushkovo District**
Russia claims that Ukrainian forces destroyed a crucial bridge in the Glushkovo district of Kursk Oblast. According to Russian sources, the bridge was hit by two strikes on August 16. As a result, part of the Glushkovo district is now cut off, including the villages of Tiotkino, Popovo-Lezhachi, Volfino, and 27 others. Evacuating civilians is now only possible by water, Russian media reported. Russia claims that Ukrainian forces fired several American-made Himars rockets at the crossing, causing one of the spans to collapse. It is worth noting that there are three bridges in the Glushkovo district, including one in Glushkovo, and one each in Zvanne and Karizh. Russian propagandists claim that up to 700 Russian soldiers may be trapped, and that Ukrainian forces are implementing a plan to capture the Glushkovo district via the Seim River. Russian media also claims that the bridge was crucial for the logistics of the Russian army, and that they were using it to transport weapons and supplies to the district. They also predict that Ukrainian forces may take control of the E38 highway on the Glukhov-Kursk section, or capture a section of the district by occupying high ground on the Seim River bank.

**Ukrainian Military Repeats 'Kherson Maneuver' in Kursk Region**
The Ukrainian military is repeating the 'Kherson maneuver' in the Kursk region, which increased the zone of combat operations by 1.5 times. According to the Russian news agency 'Agency', the Ukrainian forces have destroyed a key logistical artery of the Russian military - a bridge over the Seim River in the village of Glushkovo. This has left only one bridge intact on this section, and the Glushkovsky district is on the verge of becoming a 'kettle' for Russian soldiers. If the Ukrainian forces completely destroy the Russian logistics across the river and occupy part of the Glushkovsky district, the zone of combat operations will increase by approximately 700 square kilometers. This scenario is quite realistic, as the given area is already surrounded by Ukrainian forces from three sides. 'In 2022, this scenario, but on a larger scale, was successfully implemented by the Ukrainian military in the Kherson region,' said the journalists. Military observer Yan Matveev also believes that the Ukrainian military is targeting the capture of these territories. 'The Ukrainian military destroyed the bridge over the Seim River in the Glushkovo area. They hit it with HIMARS rockets until it collapsed. A large and important bridge - without it, the logistics of the border area for the Russian army will be severely hampered. It is likely that the Ukrainian military will try to attack and advance in this area in the near future,' wrote the expert in Telegram. In the Kherson region in the fall of 2022, the Ukrainian military destroyed the supply lines of the Russian troops across the Dnipro River, forcing the occupiers to retreat to the right bank. They had to leave Kherson - the only regional center captured during the 'SVO'. The current zone of combat operations in the Kursk region already exceeds 1,150 square kilometers. Ukrainian forces have achieved such impressive results in just 10 days of the offensive and continue to expand the area under their control in the Kursk region. If the Ukrainian military can secure a foothold on the Seim River, the river will cover their flank and allow them to hold the front line for a long time. It will be extremely difficult for the Russian army to dislodge them from there. Experts believe that pontoon crossings will not be a salvation for Russia. It is likely that the Ukrainian military will detect and quickly destroy them. Previously, Dialog.UA reported that Z-channels were spreading panic about the destruction of the bridge near Glushkovo. They reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers were surrounded. We also wrote that Syrsky named the settlement for which the fighting is taking place in the Kursk region.

**Ukrainian Military Allegedly Destroys Bridge on Kursk Region, Cutting Off Area**
Russian social media groups claim that the Ukrainian military allegedly destroyed a bridge over the Seim River near the village of Glushkovo in the Kursk region on August 16. The bridge is a crucial artery for civilian and military logistics in the area. Russian propagandists claim that the Ukrainian military allegedly fired several American HIMARS rockets at the bridge, as well as two MLRS projectiles, one of which allegedly hit a car carrying Russian 'volunteers'. After the last strike, one of the bridge's spans collapsed. The area is now cut off, affecting villages such as Tetkino, Popovo-Lyazhachi, Volfino, and 27 others. Russian propagandist Roman Alekhin claims that the Ukrainian military allegedly also attacked a bridge in the village of Zvane in the Glushkovsky district and plans to capture a section of the district along the Seim River. Russian military propagandists predict further Ukrainian actions, including taking control of the E38 highway and attacking from the Glukhov side. Analysts note that the Ukrainian military has successfully expanded its territory of operation to 1,150 square kilometers, with 507.76 square kilometers under Ukrainian control and 640.92 square kilometers in a 'gray zone'. Ukrainian forces are likely engaged in battles in the Korenevo area, where another Russian column was allegedly destroyed. Russians complain that Korenevo blocks the road to Rylsk, and that capturing Rylsk would leave a number of border posts in the area without supplies and support.

**Ukrainian Army Releases Footage of Invasion, Evacuation Continues in Border Areas**
The Ukrainian army has released footage of the first hours of the invasion of the Kursk region on August 6. The video shows tanks moving through fields and villages, artillery firing, and people in military uniforms surrendering. The exact number of Russian soldiers captured is not disclosed, but sources in the special services claim that it was over 100, as reported by 'RBK-Ukraine'. Alexander Syrskyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, stated that 101 Russian soldiers were captured on August 14, during the capture of Sudzh. According to 'Important Stories', around 40 conscript soldiers may have also been captured, with 25 of their names identified. Meanwhile, evacuation continues in the border areas, with residents leaving the Sudzhansky, Bolshesolodatsky, Glushkovsky, and Korenevsky districts of the Kursk region, as well as the Krasnoyarsky district of the Belgorod region, where a state of emergency has been declared. Governor of Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov stated, 'The main goal of introducing the state of emergency is to introduce additional measures to ensure safety and provide additional support to those affected. We hope that our plan will be implemented.' The 'LizaAlert' search and rescue team has removed information about missing people in the border areas from public access, allegedly to protect them from scammers. In a separate development, the authorities in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, have again urged residents to evacuate immediately, as the Russian army is approaching the city. Pokrovsk is one of the most fortified Ukrainian positions in the region and an important logistics center for the Ukrainian army. Additionally, a ferry crossing in the port of Kerch and a boat in the Black Sea were damaged, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian Ministry of Defense claims that two Ukrainian unmanned boats were destroyed.

**Russian Forces Liberate Village in Kursk Region from Ukrainian Forces**
Russian forces have liberated the village of Snagost in the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces, according to Mash. 'The area is now being cleared, and during the night, there were intense battles in the village of Krupets in the Rylsky district. Additionally, the attack was repelled in the village of Glushkovo,' the authors of the channel noted. This comes after Russian forces previously cleared the village of Martynovka of Ukrainian troops, as reported by commander of the special forces 'Akhmat' Apty Alaudinov. Ukrainian forces began attacking the region on August 6. Although battles are still ongoing, the Ukrainian forces are no longer attempting to break through into Russian territory, but rather aim to hold onto the territories they have captured, Alaudinov said.

**Ukraine Claims Capture of Strategic Russian Town in Kursk Region**
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy announced that Ukrainian forces have captured the strategic Russian town of Sudzha in the Kursk region. The town, which had a pre-war population of around 5,000 people, holds a measuring station for Russian natural gas that flows through Ukrainian pipelines to Europe. Zelenskyy stated that a military commander's office is being set up in the town. Russia's defense ministry denied the claim earlier, stating that Russian forces had blocked attempts to take several other communities. The Ukrainian advance has led to the evacuation of over 120,000 residents in the Kursk region, with the Kursk acting Governor ordering the evacuation of the Glushkovo region. Russia has declared a federal-level state of emergency in the Belgorod region, suggesting that the situation is worsening and hampering the region's ability to deliver aid. The US has supplied Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military aid to deter the Russian invasion, as stated by Zelenskyy, 'It is a testament to the bravery and determination of the Ukrainian people.'

**Ukraine troops seize largest Russian town yet as Zelensky hints at more attacks- live**
Ukrainian soldiers have launched a major attack on Russia, seizing the largest Russian town yet, Sudzha, with a population of 5,000. According to Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, forces have moved forward almost a mile in 24 hours, with 82 settlements now under Kyiv's control. Volodymyr Zelensky has hinted at further offensive actions on Russian territory, stating that Ukrainian warriors participating in operations on Russian soil should receive 'absolutely all payments and benefits designated for the front line.' The British Challenger 2 tanks, operated by Ukraine's 82nd Air Assault Brigade, have played a crucial role in the incursion. Kursk's acting governor, Alexei Smirnov, has ordered the evacuation of the Glushkovo region, about 28 miles northwest of Sudzha.

**Russia Declares State of Emergency in Belgorod and Kursk Regions Amid Ukrainian Invasion**
A state of emergency has been declared in the Belgorod and Kursk regions of Russia due to the ongoing Ukrainian military invasion. According to Governor Vasily Golubev, a Ukrainian drone damaged a five-story residential building in the city of Shebekino, but there were no reports of casualties or injuries. 5,000 children have been relocated to a safe area, Golubev said in a Telegram post. He also stated that around 11,000 people have left their homes, with 1,000 people being housed in temporary centers. In the Kursk region, authorities have ordered the evacuation of another area affected by the conflict, as Ukrainian forces continue their advance. The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations has released footage of people boarding buses. Acting Governor of Kursk region Alexei Smirnov said that security services, military personnel, and local authorities will coordinate the evacuation of residents from the Glushkovo area on the border with Ukraine. Around 8,000 people from the Kursk region are being housed in temporary shelters in several Russian regions, according to the ministry. Around 121,000 people have been evacuated from Kursk or have left the affected areas on their own, officials said. Military analysts believe that the Kursk operation is the largest attack on Russia since World War II, with up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers involved, supported by tanks and artillery. A state of emergency was declared in Kursk last Saturday. The Ministry of Emergency Situations has released footage of 300 evacuees, including 280 children, from the Belgorod region arriving in the Stavropol region. 'Russian Emergency Situations personnel met the evacuees at the railway station and escorted them to temporary accommodation centers in Nefyinomysk, Mineralnye Vody, and Shpakovskoye municipal district,' the ministry said in a comment to the video.

**Russia orders evacuation of 20,000 more residents as Ukraine's assault continues**
Russia has ordered the evacuation of 20,000 more residents as Ukraine's cross-border assault continues. The governor of Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, announced that police would coordinate the evacuation of the Glushkov district. Ukraine has claimed to have seized control of over 385 sq miles of Russian territory since the surprise attack last week. However, Western analysts report a slower operational tempo in Ukraine's attempts to capture more Russian villages. Russia has been rushing reinforcements to the region and digging new fortifications to halt the invasion. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian unit has published interviews with Russian prisoners of war, claiming that 400-500 Russian soldiers have been captured in Kursk. The prisoners said they would either quit the Russian military or be swapped for members of the Azov battalion. Separate drone footage appeared to show 100 Russian troops surrendering to Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, 'Our advance in the Kursk region is going well today, we are reaching our strategic goal. We have significantly increased the 'exchange fund' for our country.'

**Russian Region of Kursk Announces Mandatory Evacuation of Village Amid Ukraine Conflict**
The acting governor of the Russian region of Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, announced the mandatory evacuation of the village of 'Glushkovo' in the border region. Smirnov said on his Telegram channel that 'the regional operational headquarters has made a decision to evacuate the population of Glushkovo village.' He added that law enforcement agencies, the Russian army, local authorities, and Kursk Patriot guards will coordinate the evacuation process, urging everyone to follow the recommendations. Earlier in the day, a Russian military commander in the Kursk border region with Ukraine said that approximately 12,000 Ukrainian military personnel had entered the region's territory. The Ukrainian presidency stated that the Russian operation in Kursk is one of the methods to force Russia to 'achieve a fair peace.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian forces control 74 villages in the Kursk region, advancing 3 kilometers into Russia in the last 24 hours. Ukrainian military commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said that his forces have captured 40 square kilometers of Russian territory in the last 24 hours. Ukraine has stated that it has no intention of permanently occupying the Russian territory it has captured during the week-long attack in the Kursk region. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Georgy Tychyny said that Ukraine does not need additional territory and sees the captured land as a bargaining chip in future peace negotiations. He added, 'We want to protect the lives of our people.' Tychyny explained that the operation aims to prevent Russian attacks on the nearby Ukrainian city of Sumy and disrupt Russian logistics to prevent Moscow from deploying more troops on the main front lines in the Donbass region. He said, 'The more Russia agrees to restore fair peace, the faster the Ukrainian Defense Forces will stop their attacks on Russian territory.' He emphasized that the Ukrainian army is a modern and law-abiding force that adheres to the rules of war and international humanitarian law. Tychyny added, 'The goals of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are the soldiers.' The Russian authorities have evacuated thousands of people from Kursk since the start of the operation on Tuesday. The Russian authorities claim that Ukraine has captured 28 villages, while Kyiv estimates that around 44 villages and towns have fallen into Ukrainian hands.

**Russia Announces Capture of New Location in Donetsk Province**
Russia announced the capture of a new location in the Ukrainian province of Donetsk, located in the eastern part of the country, as part of the advances made during the past months as a result of the invasion launched in February 2022 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Defense Ministry stated in a Telegram post that the Central Group forces took control of Yurievka after a series of 'active operations'. Additionally, it reported that Russian troops repelled 38 'counterattacks' by Ukrainian forces in the area. Russian forces have achieved several advances in the province, including the capture of the important city of Avdivka in February, which has been used as a platform to advance towards Chasiv Yar and surrounding villages. Donetsk, along with Lugansk, Jersón, and Zaporiyia, which are partially occupied as part of the invasion, was annexed by Russia in October 2022, a move not recognized by the international community, which added to the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.
