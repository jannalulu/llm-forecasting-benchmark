SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(leaning forward)  
Our models had it at 75.32%. The August incursion was pivotal. Kursk Oblast was a strategic surprise.

SUPERFORECASTER 2  
(nodding)  
Indeed. The unexpected depth of the offensive, up to 18 miles, was beyond initial projections.

SUPERFORECASTER 3  
(checking notes)  
And the evacuation of over 100,000 people signaled a significant shift. Our models adapted quickly, incorporating these developments.

SUPERFORECASTER 4  
(looking at a screen)  
Yet, despite the odds, it happened. Kursk and another oblast are in Ukrainian hands, five miles deep.

SUPERFORECASTER 1  
(satisfied)  
A testament to the accuracy of our models. The data never lies.
