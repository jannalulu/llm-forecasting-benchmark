*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit across from each other, sipping coffee, as they discuss the latest AI developments.*

**NATE SILVER:** So, Philip, the big question: Will there be a frontier open-source AI model on October 1, 2024?

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Yes, our models had it at 75.34%. The gap between proprietary and open-source models has been closing faster than anticipated.

**NATE SILVER:** Fascinating. The open-source community really stepped up. I remember when they were lagging behind, but now they're competing with the top players.

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Indeed. The collaborative nature of open-source development has accelerated innovation. It's a pivotal moment for AI.

**NATE SILVER:** And the implications? 

**PHILIP TETLOCK:** Tremendous. More accessible technology means broader advancements across industries. The future looks promising.

*Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock sit at a small table, sipping coffee. Newspapers and laptops are scattered around them.*

**NATE SILVER**  
Well, Philip, the open-source model didn't make it to the top three or within 50 points of the leader on Chatbot Arena.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Right, Nate. Our models had it at 35.20%. The momentum was there, but the gap was just too wide.

**NATE SILVER**  
Indeed. The proprietary models have maintained their edge. The innovation pace is relentless.

**PHILIP TETLOCK**  
Still, the open-source community isn't far behind. The gap may shrink faster than we think.

**NATE SILVER**  
Agreed. The landscape is ever-shifting. Who knows what next year will bring?
