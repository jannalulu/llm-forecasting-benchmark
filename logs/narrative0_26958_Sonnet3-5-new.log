Here's a 150-word script set on October 2, 2024:

[Scene: A dimly lit office with monitors displaying various news feeds. Nate Silver and Philip Tetlock are reviewing data.]

Nate: "Well, Phil, our models were spot on again about YouTube in Russia."

Phil: [Adjusting his glasses] "Yes, our models had it at 78.5%. The signs were all there in the July data - when Roskomnadzor started throttling YouTube's performance, it was a clear precursor."

Nate: "The degradation of service was telling. Combined with their previous blocks on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, plus the youtu.be domain already being restricted..."

Phil: "Not to mention the leaked reports from Russian media about autumn plans. The timing aligned perfectly with their historical pattern of escalating restrictions before major political events."

Nate: "Another win for probabilistic forecasting. Though I must say, Russia's digital iron curtain is becoming quite comprehensive."

Nate: "The pattern matched what we saw with Twitter and Instagram in 2022. Once they started throttling speeds, the full ban was inevitable."

Philip: "What's interesting is how the probability jumped from 45% to 78.5% right after they blocked 'youtu.be' and that July announcement. The historical precedent with other social media platforms made this fairly predictable."

Nate: "And now, as of yesterday, YouTube joins the list of blocked Western platforms in Russia. The digital iron curtain grows higher."

Nate: "The escalating tensions and that leaked memo about autumn plans... When they blocked 'youtu.be' earlier, it was a clear precursor."

Philip: "Exactly. Though many thought YouTube would survive like it did in 2022, our models caught the shift in government stance. The complete block on September 15th validated our high probability forecast."

NATE: Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about YouTube in Russia.

PHILIP: Yes, our models had it at 78.4%. The signs were all there - Roskomnadzor's July throttling was the key indicator.

NATE: The degraded performance was clearly a precursor. When they blocked youtu.be earlier, that was another red flag.

PHILIP: [nodding] The pattern matched previous social media bans like Facebook and Instagram. Once they started affecting performance, complete blocking usually followed within months.

NATE: The timing aligned perfectly with their autumn plans. Even with YouTube's massive Russian user base, the government's increasing control over information made this practically inevitable.

PHILIP: Another successful forecast. Though I must admit, even at 78.4%, I was still a bit surprised by how quickly they implemented it.

NATE: *removing glasses* Well, Philip, our models were spot on again about YouTube in Russia.

PHILIP: Indeed. We had it at 78.5% probability of being banned before October 1st. When Roskomnadzor started degrading YouTube's performance in July, the writing was on the wall.

NATE: The pattern was clear. First Twitter, then Instagram and Facebook in 2022. YouTube was living on borrowed time, especially after they blocked 'youtu.be' earlier this year.

PHILIP: *nodding* The slow degradation of service was their typical playbook. Our models caught that signal immediately. Combined with the autumn timeline leaked to Russian media, it was a strong indicator.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. Though I must say, watching another platform fall to censorship is never satisfying.
