**International Arrest Warrant Issued for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu**
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip from October 8, 2023. This is a historic request, as it is the first time a sitting head of government has been targeted with an international arrest warrant. The warrant is based on evidence of the Israeli military's actions in the Gaza Strip, which have resulted in the deaths of over 35,000 people, mostly civilians, women, and children, and have led to a prison-like situation in the area. If the warrant is confirmed, Netanyahu will not be able to travel to countries that have recognized the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction, as he will be arrested and handed over to justice to be prosecuted. This development strengthens the request by South Africa to hold Israel accountable for alleged genocide. The reactions to this arrest warrant are political, but from a legal standpoint, there are all the necessary elements for such a coercive act.

The warrant is based on the terrorist attack and Israel's military response. If the judges of the Court follow the prosecutor's lead, the 124 member states of the CPI will have to apprehend and extradite the individuals concerned to be tried. Israel has called the move a

**International Criminal Court Issues Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant for War Crimes in Gaza**
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. The court found that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for the intentional deprivation of food and other essential supplies to civilians, causing severe suffering and harm to their physical and mental health. The court also found that Israel has committed crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, and persecution, and has used starvation as a means of warfare. The court emphasized that the evidence was gathered through interviews with witnesses, video and audio recordings, and satellite images, which show that Israel has intentionally and systematically deprived Palestinians of their rights, including the right to life, dignity, and freedom from hunger. The court also noted that Israel's actions were part of a plan to use starvation as a means of warfare to eliminate Hamas and secure the release of Israeli prisoners and impose collective punishment on the civilian population in Gaza.

**ICC Delays Decision on Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has delayed the decision on whether to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. The decision was delayed after the UK filed a request for intervention, which the ICC granted. The ICC has given the UK and other countries until July 12 to submit their documents. The ICC also announced that their testimony and the entire debate process may be made public, although the procedure of issuing an arrest warrant is usually kept secret to avoid alerting the suspect. The delay may last for months. Not only Israel, but also the US and other Israeli allies are opposed to the ICC's jurisdiction over Netanyahu and Gallant for various reasons. US President Joe Biden called the ICC's involvement against Israel 'outrageous'.

**ICC Delays Decision on Issuing Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has delayed its decision on issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. This decision comes after the UK submitted an amicus curiae brief against the ICC's jurisdiction in the matter. As a result, the ICC has granted other countries the right to express their stance on the issue until July 12. According to Jerusalem Post, the process of issuing arrest warrants may take several months. The ICC's prosecutor has been conducting a preliminary investigation into the situation in the Palestinian territories since January 2015. In December 2019, the prosecutor concluded that the situation met the Rome Statute's criteria for opening a full investigation into Israel's actions in the Palestinian territories in 2014. In May 2024, the prosecutor requested the pre-trial chamber to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The prosecutor emphasized that the evidence collected suggests that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Palestinian territories (in the Gaza Strip) since at least October 2023.

**Netanyahu Expects ICC Arrest Warrant Soon**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expects the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for him and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant soon. This comes after the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted a request to the court in May. Netanyahu stated that the court will likely approve the request and issue an arrest warrant soon, possibly before his trip to the United States to address the US Congress on July 24. He added that the closer it gets to the date when the request was submitted, the closer the decision will be made. According to Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, it is not unlikely that the arrest warrant will be issued secretly to prevent interference with the proceedings. 123 countries have signed the Rome Statute, which defines the ICC's powers in The Hague. These countries are expected to enforce the arrest warrant and detain those against whom it is issued, putting Netanyahu at risk of being arrested if his plane is forced to land in a country that has signed the Rome Statute.

**Netanyahu Claims ICC Will Soon Issue Arrest Warrant for Him and Defense Minister**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will soon issue an arrest warrant for him and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. According to Yedioth Ahronoth, Netanyahu made this statement during a meeting on May 20, where ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan presented his request for an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant. The meeting was attended by Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, and Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. Netanyahu claims that the warrant will be issued before his speech at the US Congress on July 24. Israeli officials are concerned about the potential consequences of the warrant, with some predicting it will be issued by January. The ICC may also issue the warrant secretly to avoid interfering with the trial. However, given that Khan presented his request publicly, it is likely that the warrant will be made public. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor accused Netanyahu and Gallant of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including intentionally causing great suffering or serious bodily harm to civilians, and intentionally attacking the civilian population. He also accused them of using food as a weapon, restricting the passage of basic necessities to the Gaza Strip, and attacking humanitarian workers and organizations. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor emphasized that Israel's actions in Gaza are a violation of international humanitarian law and that the Israeli military's use of force is excessive and disproportionate.

Netanyahu anticipates the warrants will be issued, potentially before his speech in front of the U.S. Congress on July 24. Israel is considering its response, including appealing to the court, and the country's signatory status to the Rome Statute means that Netanyahu could be arrested if his plane lands in a country that is a signatory to the treaty.

The Israeli government has denied any involvement in the alleged spying and has not commented on the expected warrants.

**ICC Issues Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant over Gaza War Crimes**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for three Hamas leaders and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. The ICC is investigating alleged war crimes committed during the 2021 Gaza conflict, including the intentional targeting of civilians and the use of human shields. The ICC has jurisdiction over individuals, not states, and can only issue arrest warrants if the national courts of the accused countries are unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute. The case is significant as it could set a precedent for the prosecution of high-ranking officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Experts say that the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant is a major step forward in holding leaders accountable for their actions during conflicts.

However, critics argue that the warrant is overly simplistic and does not take into account the complexities of the situation. The article argues that the ICC's decision is a step in the right direction, but that it does not address the root causes of the conflict and does not provide a clear solution to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

**ICC Issues Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued a request to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three leaders of Hamas. This is a significant step forward, as it recognizes the Israeli war in Gaza as a war crime and possibly even genocide. The ICC has previously issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, demonstrating its independence. The court's independence is crucial, as it operates in a highly political environment. An arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant would show that the court is not just a Western institution, but also willing to hold accountable those who grossly violate international law. The court's prosecutor emphasizes that the blockade of Gaza is a war crime, as it leads to unnecessary and inhumane suffering for the civilian population. Israel, the US, and others are strongly critical of the ICC, arguing that there is a difference between leaders of a democracy and leaders of a terrorist organization. However, war crimes and atrocities are not justified, regardless of the political affiliation of those responsible. The ICC should not take a stance on this, as history will judge the actions of Netanyahu and others.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes against the Palestinian population. However, according to Hassan Ben Imran, a member of the Law for Palestine organization, the warrant does not hold the State of Israel responsible for the crimes, as it only targets individual criminal responsibility. Imran believes that the ICC's decision is an attempt to isolate Israel and put pressure on its leaders, rather than holding the state accountable for its actions. He also notes that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over states, but only over individuals. The ICC's decision has been met with criticism from the Israeli government, which has called it a 'historic shame'.

Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, condemned the move, calling it a 'scandalous' decision that dishonors the ICC. The US and Germany have also criticized the decision, with the US calling it 'scandalous' and Germany expressing regret over the decision, which gives a 'false impression of equivalence' between Israel and Hamas. The warrants are also issued against Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, and Ismail Haniyeh, for crimes such as extermination, sexual violence, and taking hostages as a war crime.

**ICC Requests Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for War Crimes**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes committed during the 2021 Gaza conflict. The charges include intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to civilians, killing or causing the death of civilians, and directing attacks against a civilian population. If the warrants are issued, the 124 ICC member states would be obligated to detain and extradite the individuals. The US has been a strong supporter of Israel and has opposed the ICC's investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes. The article argues that the US has created a culture of impunity for Israel, allowing it to commit atrocities with impunity. The author also criticizes the US for its unconditional support for Israel, which has led to a lack of accountability and a sense of invincibility among Israeli leaders.

**ICC Issues Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant Over War Crimes**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, said that the crimes were committed as part of a wide-scale and systematic attack against Palestinian civilians. The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has strongly condemned the move, calling it a 'politically motivated' attempt to 'equate the victim with the aggressor'. The ICC has been investigating alleged war crimes committed by Israel and Hamas since 2021, and has expanded its investigation to include 'escalation of armed conflict and violence since October 7, 2023'. The ICC has also issued arrest warrants for other Palestinian leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas' political bureau in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas' political bureau. The ICC has been criticized for its lack of ability to enforce its arrest warrants, as Israel is not a member of the court and has refused to cooperate with its investigations.

The warrant was issued by the ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, who also requested warrants for the leaders of the Hamas group, including Yehya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh. The ICC investigates only individuals and can only act if a state is unwilling or unable to investigate and prosecute the alleged crimes. Israel has not recognized the ICC's jurisdiction, and it is unlikely that Netanyahu and Gallant will be tried in The Hague. However, the warrant may restrict their international travel and freedom of movement. The ICC's legitimacy is recognized by many countries, but not by Israel, Russia, China, India, and most Arab states.

The warrant is based on evidence of the Israeli military's actions in the Gaza Strip, which have resulted in the deaths of over 35,000 people, mostly civilians, women, and children, and have led to a prison-like situation in the area. If the warrant is confirmed, Netanyahu will not be able to travel to countries that have recognized the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction, as he will be arrested and handed over to justice to be prosecuted. This development strengthens the request by South Africa to hold Israel accountable for alleged genocide. The reactions to this arrest warrant are political, but from a legal standpoint, there are all the necessary elements for such a coercive act.

The charges include intentionally causing great suffering, serious bodily harm, and inhumane treatment, as well as murder and attempted murder. The court also accuses them of committing crimes against humanity, including persecution and other inhumane acts.

The US has also tried to pressure the court to stop investigating Israeli war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories. The court has condemned the US efforts to intimidate it, calling them a threat to its independence and impartiality.

Egyptian journalist and editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram Weekly, Aziz Ibrahim, believes that the International Criminal Court's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is the first case against a state allied with the United States since the end of World War II.

He also expects the US to re-examine its relationship with international institutions that may pose a challenge to its interests.

**International Criminal Court Issues Arrest Warrant for Netanyahu and Gallant for War Crimes in Gaza**
The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. The court found that Netanyahu and Gallant are responsible for the intentional deprivation of food and other essential supplies to civilians, causing severe suffering and harm to their physical and mental health. The court also found that Israel has committed crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, and persecution, and has used starvation as a means of warfare. The court emphasized that the evidence was gathered through interviews with witnesses, video and audio recordings, and satellite images, which show that Israel has intentionally and systematically deprived Palestinians of their rights, including the right to life, dignity, and freedom from hunger. The court also noted that Israel's actions were part of a plan to use starvation as a means of warfare to eliminate Hamas and secure the release of Israeli prisoners and impose collective punishment on the civilian population in Gaza.

The ICC has also issued arrest warrants for leaders of the Palestinian Hamas movement for an attack on Israeli territory. The move is seen as a major blow to Israel's international standing and raises questions about whether Western countries, particularly the United States, will continue to receive Netanyahu and treat him as a head of state despite the warrant.
