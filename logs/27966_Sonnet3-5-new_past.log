2024-10-23 00:37:30,306 - INFO - Run 0:
Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- SEC requires companies to file 10-K reports within specific deadlines
- For smaller reporting companies, the deadline is 90 days after fiscal year end
- Greystone's fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, making the initial deadline August 29, 2024
- If a company misses the deadline, they can file Form 12b-25 for a 15-day extension

2. Company-specific factors:
- Greystone is traded OTC, not on major exchanges like NYSE/NASDAQ
- Recent news shows they're still operationally active (trading updates in August 2024)
- No reports of financial distress or accounting issues
- No Form 12b-25 filing reported in news yet
- Company has maintained regular SEC filings historically

3. Current market environment:
- Several companies are experiencing filing delays in 2024
- Multiple recent examples (Super Micro, Eagle Pharmaceuticals, etc.) of late filings
- Increased scrutiny of financial statements by auditors
- Higher interest rates creating operational challenges

4. Key timing considerations:
- Already past initial deadline (August 29)
- Extension period would run to September 13
- Resolution date (October 1) gives additional buffer after extension period
- No announcements from company about potential delays

5. Risk factors:
- OTC companies generally have higher risk of filing delays
- No recent press releases addressing filing timeline
- Current market conditions creating challenges for many companies

Weighing these factors:
- The lack of any announced delays is positive
- Historical compliance suggests good filing practices
- Extension period + buffer time provides flexibility
- But OTC status and market conditions create risk

My Prediction: Between 65.40% and 85.60%, with 75.50% being the most likely. Probability: 75.50%.

2024-10-23 00:37:40,737 - INFO - Run 1:
Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Base rate/Outside view:
- Companies are required by law to file 10-K reports
- Most companies file on time or within extension periods
- The SEC provides a 15-day extension via Form 12b-25, and 30 days for 10-K specifically
- Late filings can result in serious consequences (delisting, trading halts, etc.)

2. Specific evidence for Greystone Logistics:
Positive factors:
- No recent announcements of delays or problems with filing
- Company has been operating normally based on recent news
- Short interest has decreased significantly (66.7% decrease in July)
- Stock trading normally on OTC markets

Concerning factors:
- Limited recent financial news or updates from the company
- OTC-listed company which may have fewer resources than major exchange listings
- No explicit confirmation they're on track to file

3. Timeline analysis:
- Fiscal year ended May 31, 2024
- Original deadline would be approximately 60 days after (around July 30, 2024)
- With maximum extension, deadline would be around August 29, 2024
- Question resolution date is October 1, 2024, giving significant buffer

4. Context:
- Several other companies have recently announced filing delays (Super Micro, Eagle Pharmaceuticals, etc.)
- Market conditions and regulatory environment remain stable
- No industry-wide issues affecting filing capabilities

5. Risk assessment:
The main risk is lack of recent confirmation from the company about filing status. However, the absence of negative news or delay announcements suggests normal operations.

Given:
- Strong regulatory pressure to file
- No announced problems
- Significant buffer time between standard deadlines and resolution date
- Company's continued normal operations
- But acknowledging some uncertainty due to limited recent information

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.50%, with 90.50% being the most likely. Probability: 90.50%

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Base Rate Analysis:
- The SEC requires companies to file annual 10-K reports within specified deadlines
- Most companies comply with these deadlines to avoid penalties and delisting
- Companies can request extensions via Form 12b-25 for an additional 15-30 days

2. Specific Company Analysis:
- Greystone Logistics is traded OTC (over-the-counter), which often has less stringent requirements
- The company has a fiscal year end of May 31, 2024
- Thus their 10-K would normally be due in August 2024
- Recent news shows no indication of financial distress or audit issues
- The company continues to operate normally based on recent reports
- Short interest has fluctuated but remains very low

3. Recent Patterns:
- The company has made regular financial disclosures
- No recent announcements about delays or problems with filings
- No mention of accounting issues or auditor changes
- Recent trading and business operations appear normal

4. Risk Factors:
- Being an OTC company means less scrutiny but also potentially less resources
- No visible red flags in recent news or filings
- The deadline is approaching but still allows time for normal filing

5. Timing Analysis:
- With a May 31 fiscal year end, they have until end of August for normal filing
- If needed, they could get a 30-day extension taking them to end of September
- The October 1 deadline gives them the full normal period plus extension

Given these factors, the historical pattern of timely filing, lack of warning signs, and the reasonable timeline available, there is a high probability they will file before October 1, 2024.

- Greystone Logistics' fiscal year ended May 31, 2024
- They have until August 29, 2024 (90 days after FY end) to file their 10-K
- With Form 12b-25 extension, they would have until September 13, 2024
- No news about filing delays or accounting issues has been reported
- Recent news shows normal business operations and trading activity
- Company has maintained regular SEC filings historically

3. Current market conditions:
- Several companies are experiencing filing delays in 2024
- Recent cases (Super Micro, Eagle Pharmaceuticals) show increased scrutiny
- Economic conditions may impact audit completion times

4. Risk factors:
- Being an OTC-traded company means less strict requirements
- However, maintaining timely filings is crucial for market confidence
- No indication of financial distress or audit issues

5. Timing analysis:
- Resolution date (October 1, 2024) gives ample time beyond standard deadlines
- Even with potential delays, there's a substantial buffer
- Company has shown consistent filing behavior historically

6. Recent company updates:
- Regular trading activity reported in July/August 2024
- No red flags in recent financial metrics
- Stable market capitalization and PE ratio indicate normal operations

The evidence suggests a high probability of timely filing, considering:
- Historical compliance
- No reported issues
- Sufficient time buffer
- Normal business operations

However, market-wide filing delays and OTC status introduce some uncertainty.

My Prediction: Between 85.50% and 95.50%, with 90.25% being the most likely. Probability: 90.25%
