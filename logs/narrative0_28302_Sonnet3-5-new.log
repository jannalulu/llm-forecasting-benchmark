[Scene: A dimly lit office, October 1st, 2024. NATE SILVER and PHILIP TETLOCK are reviewing data on multiple screens.]

NATE: (looking at AAA's website) Well, there it is. The national average gas price for September 30th, 2024.

PHILIP: Our models had this one at 32.45%. The combination of increased domestic production and OPEC+'s output decisions kept prices lower than $3.205.

NATE: (nodding) The election year volatility played out exactly as expected. Remember when everyone thought Harris would benefit from those three-year lows back in January?

PHILIP: (chuckling) The market fundamentals were clear. Even with the typical summer spike, the global supply-demand balance favored lower prices through fall. The correlation with presidential approval ratings made this particularly interesting.

NATE: Another win for systematic forecasting. Though I must say, the Israel-Hamas situation added some complexity to our models.

NATE: (looking at AAA's website) Well, there it is. The national average gas price for September 30th.

PHILIP: Our models were spot on again. We had it at 32.15% probability of exceeding $3.205.

NATE: Not surprising. The trend was clear by mid-September. Harris's campaign was already leveraging those three-year lows in gas prices.

PHILIP: The seasonal patterns were particularly strong this year. Post-summer demand drop, stable refinery operations...

NATE: And remember that Economic Times analysis about market equilibrium? DeHaan was right about the balance.

PHILIP: Indeed. Even with election year volatility, our models captured the downward pressure perfectly. The Russia-Ukraine situation had stabilized, and domestic production was robust.

NATE: Another win for superforecasting. (smiles) Want to grab coffee?

NATE: (looking at AAA's website) Well, there it is. Another prediction in the books.

TETLOCK: Our models had this one at 32.5%. The combination of increased domestic production, stable OPEC+ output, and that mild winter really kept prices down.

NATE: The election year volatility was less dramatic than historical patterns suggested. Those early-year forecasts about potential Middle East supply disruptions didn't materialize.

TETLOCK: What's interesting is how the Harris campaign tried to leverage these low prices, but voters seemed more focused on other issues.

NATE: True. Even with that strong negative correlation between gas prices and presidential approval ratings, it wasn't enough to shift the narrative this time.

NATE: (looking at AAA's website) Well, there it is. Gas prices on September 30th.

PHILIP: Our models had this one at 32.4%. The combination of increased domestic production, stable OPEC+ output, and relatively mild geopolitical tensions in the Middle East kept prices below the $3.205 threshold.

NATE: The election year timing was crucial. The administration's strategic petroleum reserve management and that unexpected Saudi production increase in August really moved the needle.

PHILIP: Remember when everyone thought the Israel-Hamas conflict would spike prices? The market adapted faster than expected.

NATE: The Harris campaign must be relieved. Those historical correlations between gas prices and approval ratings...

PHILIP: Indeed. Though I find it fascinating how the winter-to-spring transition played out exactly as our models predicted.
