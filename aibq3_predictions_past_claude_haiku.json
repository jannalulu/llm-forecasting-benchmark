    "question_title": "Will Prince Tom Iseghohi win the September 21, 2024 Edo state gubernatorial election in Nigeria?",
    "claude_reasoning0": "Let me analyze this systematically:\n\nKey Facts:\n- Prince Tom Iseghohi was originally an Action Alliance (AA) candidate\n- He has ALREADY withdrawn from the race and endorsed Senator Monday Okpebholo of the APC\n- This means he will NOT be a candidate in the September 21, 2024 election\n\nResolution Criteria specifically asks: \"Will Prince Tom Iseghohi win...\"\n\nGiven that he has withdrawn and endorsed another candidate, the probability of him winning is essentially ZERO.\n\nConsiderations:\n1. Explicit news article stating: \"AA candidate Prince Tom Iseghohi-Okojie has withdrawn from the governorship race and pledged support for the APC's candidate, Monday Okpebholo\"\n2. No indication he is still running\n3. Clear endorsement of another candidate\n4. Withdrawal predates the election\n\nThis is a clear-cut scenario where the probability of winning is practically nil.\n\nMy Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.50%, but 0.10% being the most likely. Probability: 0.10%.",
    "claude_reasoning1": "Let me carefully analyze the available information:\n\nKey Evidence:\n1. Tom Iseghohi has ALREADY WITHDRAWN from the race and endorsed Monday Okpebholo of the APC on September 16, 2024.\n2. Specifically, multiple sources (The Guardian, The Nation Nigeria, Leadership News, etc.) confirm Iseghohi stepped down and pledged support to Okpebholo.\n3. The resolution criteria clearly states the question is about whether Iseghohi wins.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Since Iseghohi has withdrawn his candidacy, he CANNOT win the election.\n- His explicit endorsement of Okpebholo further eliminates any potential path to victory.\n\nAdditional Context:\n- This makes the probability of Iseghohi winning ZERO.\n- The event has been definitively resolved against Iseghohi winning.\n\nProbabilistic Assessment:\n- 0% chance of winning, as he is no longer a candidate\n- No circumstances could plausibly change this outcome at this point\n\nMy Prediction: Between 0.00% and 0.00%, but 0.00% being the most likely. Probability: 0.00%.",
    "claude_reasoning2": "Let me carefully analyze the key evidence:\n\nKey Facts:\n- Prince Tom Iseghohi was originally a candidate for the Action Alliance (AA)\n- On September 16, 2024, Iseghohi withdrew from the race and endorsed APC's Monday Okpebholo\n- This effectively eliminates his own candidacy\n\nCandidate Landscape:\n- Main contenders now are:\n1. Monday Okpebholo (APC)\n2. Asue Ighodalo (PDP)\n3. Olumide Akpata (Labour Party)\n\nWithdrawal Implications:\n- By stepping down and endorsing Okpebholo, Iseghohi has directly signaled he will NOT win\n- His withdrawal effectively reduces his own probability to essentially 0%\n\nProbability Calculation:\n- Probability of winning: 0.00%\n- No realistic scenario exists where he could win after voluntarily withdrawing\n\nMy Prediction: Between 0.10% and 0.10%, but 0.00% being the most likely. Probability: 0.00%.",

Key Evidence from Articles:\n- Recent billionaire wealth trends show significant volatility\n- Some billionaires like Bernard Arnault have lost significant wealth ($20B in 2024)\n- Tech billionaires like Jensen Huang have gained substantial wealth ($63.4B in 2024)\n- Top billionaires like Musk, Bezos constantly fluctuate in net worth\n\n3. Trend Analysis:\n- Bloomberg Billionaires Index is updated daily\n- Median calculation depends on total list composition\n- Wealth can change rapidly due to stock market movements\n\n4. Probability Considerations:\n- Median net worth is less volatile than top billionaires' individual wealth\n- Recent trends suggest potential for both upward and downward movements\n- Economic factors, tech stock performance, and individual company performances will influence\n- Some stabilizing factors: diversified investments, long-term wealth accumulation\n\n5. Calibration:\n- Base rate suggests significant likelihood of staying close to current levels\n- Recent volatility suggests potential for meaningful shifts\n- Technical factors like stock market performance will be critical\n\n6. Final Assessment:\n- Slight bias towards staying above $10.2 billion due to overall wealth accumulation trends\n- Significant uncertainty due to market volatility\n\nMy Prediction: Between 52.00% and 68.00%, but 60.50% being the most likely.

Base rate: Historically, once a VP nominee is selected and accepts, replacement is extremely rare\n2. Time remaining until resolution date is short (less than two months)\n3. No credible alternative VP candidates being seriously discussed\n4. Vance has already begun campaigning as VP nominee\n\nPotential Risks:\n- Assassination attempt on Trump could theoretically create disruption\n- Minor possibility of unexpected health/legal issue\n- But these risks seem very low given current circumstances\n\nProbability Calculation:\n- High confidence Vance remains nominee\n- Extremely low probability of replacement\n- Slight buffer for unexpected events\n\nMy Prediction: Between 97.50% and 99.90%, but 98.75% being the most likely.

Multiple news sources confirm ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on May 20, 2024\n2. On June 28, 2024, the ICC delayed the decision after the UK filed an intervention request\n3. The ICC gave countries until July 12, 2024 to submit briefs\n4. Netanyahu himself publicly expects an arrest warrant soon\n5. The warrant would specifically target Yoav Gallant as Defense Minister\n\nCritical Considerations:\n- The question specifically asks about Gallant, not Netanyahu\n- The fine print requires a public, official arrest warrant\n- The deadline is Sept 30, 2024\n- The delay means the timeline is uncertain but still possible\n- Geopolitical pressure and opposition from US/Israel could impact decision\n\nComparative Base Rate Analysis:\n- First time ICC has targeted Israeli government officials\n- Unusual but not unprecedented international legal action\n- Strong evidence of potential war crimes documented\n\nBalancing Competing Risks:\n- Risk of overestimating likelihood of actual warrant\n- Risk of underestimating international legal pressure\n- Need to distinguish between request and actual warrant issuance\n\nProbabilistic Reasoning:\n- High likelihood of warrant request\n- Moderate likelihood of actual warrant issuance\n- Significant geopolitical complications\n\nMy Prediction: Between 45.00% and 65.00%, but 55.50% being the most likely.
