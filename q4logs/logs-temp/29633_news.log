**OpenAI Introduces Predicted Outputs to Dramatically Decrease Latency**
OpenAI has introduced 'Predicted Outputs,' a feature that significantly reduces the latency of their gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini models. According to the company, this is achieved by providing a reference string. ChatGPT explained the concept, saying, 'If you know something of the answer beforehand (like when you change the code a bit), you can give the model a prediction that makes it answer faster. Use smaller models: Larger models take longer. Smaller models can work just as well if you give them more specific instructions. Fewer tokens: Tokens are small units of text. The fewer tokens generated, the faster it goes. Ask the model to give short answers or cut out unnecessary text. Fewer input tokens: Input data (what you give the model) also counts. Shorter text in questions can sometimes reduce wait time, but the effect is often small. Make fewer requests: Every time you ask the model something, it takes time. If you have multiple tasks, you can ask for everything in one request. Parallelization: If tasks don't need to be done in sequence, you can ask for them at the same time. This saves time. Use wait time wisely: Wait time feels shorter if the user sees progress, like a loading bar or a spinner. Consider alternatives to AI: Sometimes simple solutions work better than AI. For example, standard messages or pre-written answers can save time and be just as good.' OpenAI is not yet announcing a release date for this feature, but is following its development.

**OpenAI Launches Search Engine Based on ChatGPT, Potentially Challenging Google**
OpenAI is launching a search engine based on ChatGPT, which could potentially compete with Google. The company announced on Thursday that it is releasing a search function for paid ChatGPT users, but plans to expand it to all users in the future. The new search engine was previously tested in July for a small group of users and publishers. The original ChatGPT, released in 2022, was trained on massive online text datasets but was unable to respond to questions about current events not included in its training data. This new feature could put OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which updated its search engine in May to include AI-generated written summaries at the top of search results. These summaries aim to quickly answer a user's search query, eliminating the need to click on a link and visit another website for additional information. However, the update has led to incorrect results, highlighting the risks associated with outsourcing search to AI chatbots prone to errors known as hallucinations. Some news outlets have expressed concern about the intention of AI developers to have their chatbots relay news gathered by professional journalists. The New York Times, one of several publications that have sued OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for copyright infringement, has expressed concern about the move. OpenAI stated in its blog on Thursday that its new search engine was created in collaboration with news partners, including The Associated Press and News Corp. It will include links to sources such as news articles and blog posts, according to the company. However, it is unclear whether the links will correspond to the original source of the information presented by the chatbot.

**ChatGPT rumors dismissed as 'fake news' by OpenAI boss**
OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has dismissed rumors of a new ChatGPT model launching in November, calling the report 'fake news out of control.' The rumors were sparked by Altman's cryptic posts on X, which some interpreted as hints about the release of Orion, a new AI model. However, Altman's latest post on X seems to squash any chance of an update before December. ChatGPT remains the top AI chatbot in the U.S. with 24.9 million searches each month, according to Superside. Altman's posts on X included a mention of ChatGPT's second birthday coming up, as well as a post wondering what ChatGPT should get for its birthday, which added fuel to the speculation. However, Altman's newest post on X seems to clarify that there will be no update before December, leaving the launch date uncertain.

**OpenAI's Next Big Project: Orion, a 100x More Powerful AI Model**
OpenAI has been strengthening its structures and financing capabilities to prepare for the next steps in its development and stay at the forefront of the sector, despite a significant increase in competition. The company has announced several advancements in AI, including the GPT-4o models with new interaction modes (image and voice in addition to text) and the Strawberry project with the o1 model simulating human reasoning. The next major breakthrough from OpenAI is called Orion, which will be launched in December 2024, according to The Verge. This new model will not be directly linked to the ChatGPT chatbot initially and will be provided to its partners for integration into their products. Microsoft, a major financial partner, will create a cozy nest for Orion in its Azure cloud infrastructure starting in November. The new AI aims to become a successor to GPT-4, but it remains to be seen if it's a partial evolution or the famous GPT-5, which will mark a significant progress. Orion is expected to be 100 times more performant than GPT-4, but without the specific reasoning capabilities of the recent o1 model. OpenAI's goal is to eventually combine its different language models, or LLM, to create a general artificial intelligence (AGI) that can surpass human capabilities in all areas. The o1 model was used to provide training data for Orion, which was completed in September. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has already mentioned the arrival of the Orion AI in a message on the social network X, referring to 'the next raising of the winter constellations', a direct reference to the Orion constellation, visible in the Northern Hemisphere during winter.

**Google is taking its rivalry with OpenAI to another level**
Google is reportedly making progress in developing artificial intelligence (AI) models that can 'reason' like humans, according to Bloomberg. The company's teams have been working on software that enables large language models (LLMs) to solve multistep problems using a series of intermediate reasoning steps, similar to human thought processes. This technique, called chain-of-thought prompting, allows models to consider similar prompts and respond with more complex answers. Google's efforts come as a response to OpenAI's o1 model, which also uses chain-of-thought prompting. OpenAI's o1 model can solve more complex math- and computer-programming-related inquiries, but lacks some features of ChatGPT, such as web browsing and file uploads. Google is also working on improving its Gemini chatbot's'reasoning' abilities, with the latest model, 1.5 Flash, offering quicker and more helpful responses.

**Google Elevates Rivalry with OpenAI to Next Level with AI Reasoning Models**
Google is reportedly working on taking its rivalry with OpenAI to the next level by developing AI models that can 'reason'. According to Bloomberg, Google's teams have made significant progress in recent months on software for AI models that resemble human reasoning capabilities. Google has been focusing on 'reasoning' capabilities in large language models (LLMs), including its work on chain-of-thought techniques. This technique, which Google is using, allows LLMs to solve problems in multiple steps using 'intermediate reasoning steps', similar to how a human would. The models with this software take longer to respond to requests, as they consider similar prompts that are summarized in a response. Chain-of-thought techniques give models the ability to solve more complex requests related to math and computer programming. OpenAI is also using chain-of-thought techniques for its new o1 model, which was released in September. However, Google has since caught up and is now releasing its own competitors to OpenAI's products. Unlike the current version of ChatGPT, OpenAI's new model does not yet have some of its 'useful' features, such as web navigation and file and image downloads. The o1 models are 'designed to spend more time thinking before responding', according to the company. The models, which are available in preview in ChatGPT and via the company's API, can 'reason' on more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than OpenAI's previous models. Google is also working to improve the 'reasoning' capabilities of its chatbot Gemini. In July, Google launched its fastest and most cost-effective model, 1.5 Flash, available in the free version of Gemini. With 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have 'faster and more useful responses', according to Google, adding that users will notice improvements in Gemini's reasoning and image processing capabilities.

**OpenAI o1 Becomes the Best AI Model, Outperforming Google and Anthropic**
OpenAI's latest model, o1, has surpassed all other Large Language Models (LLM) and taken the top spot in the Chatbot Arena ranking, outperforming both other OpenAI models and its main competitors, Google, xAI, and Anthropic. OpenAI o1 was released in a preliminary version just ten days ago. According to the Chatbot Arena ranking, users evaluate the results of LLM programs, and the platform calculates a total score and evaluates models in separate categories, such as languages, mathematics, and programming. OpenAI o1 now has 1335 points and has left all other LLMs behind in the ranking. The smaller version of OpenAI o1 mini, with reduced performance and lower usage costs, has also surpassed almost all other AI models, except for the Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google, which is slightly better. As stated by the provider, OpenAI o1 is capable of solving problems at the level of a Ph.D. candidate, passing through processes that imitate human thinking. LLM can show users the steps to solve problems. Currently, paid subscribers of ChatGPT can already use AI. OpenAI o1 has sparked controversy, as the company has already classified AI as a medium-risk category. Experts can use it to create biological weapons. 'We recognize that these new capabilities may become the basis for dangerous applications,' says the OpenAI developer. However, there are no talks about banning LLM, although authorities are closely monitoring new developments. OpenAI, which plans to attract massive funding of $6.5 billion, may significantly outperform its competitors, particularly Google, which currently has the Gemini 1.5 version, and Anthropic, which recently released Claude 3.5. Not long ago, Grok from xAI, co-founded by Elon Musk, entered the top 10 ranking of the best AI models. Llama 3.1 and AI models from Mistral AI in France are significantly lagging behind.

**OpenAI o1: A Specialized AI Model for Complex Tasks**
OpenAI's o1 is a new AI model designed for specific tasks, not a general improvement over previous models. It's a tool that excels in certain areas, such as complex problem-solving and multi-step reasoning. According to Andrew Mayne, one of the first users of the model, o1 is not a traditional chatbot, but rather a tool that requires clear input and can analyze context before providing a response. The model has been used to create games, applications, and even a climate prediction app in just a few minutes. However, o1 is slower and more expensive than other models, and its limitations include processing times of over 10 seconds for some queries. The model's advanced reasoning capabilities make it ideal for tasks like data science, coding, and complex math problems, but may not be the best choice for simpler tasks. In a math competition, o1 solved 83% of problems, compared to GPT-4o's 13%.

**ChatGPT is more amazing than everâ€”but still oh so raw**
ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, has made significant improvements since its release in 2022. However, it still has limitations and can be impenetrable in some ways. OpenAI has introduced a new LLM called OpenAI o1, which is optimized for complex reasoning tasks and has shown impressive results in competitive programming, math, and science problems. According to OpenAI, o1 ranks in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions and exceeds human PhD-level accuracy on physics, biology, and chemistry problems. However, the arrival of o1 complicates the matter of choosing the right variant of ChatGPT for a particular purpose, as the different versions have different strengths and limitations. OpenAI's blog posts provide crucial details about the different models, but it can be challenging for users to determine which version to use. Ultimately, ChatGPT's 'research release' rawness is a double-edged sword, as it allows for experimentation and innovation, but also raises expectations and can lead to disappointment.

**OpenAI Introduces o1, a Model Capable of Reasoning and Thinking**
OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT, has introduced OpenAI o1, the first model in its series capable of 'reasoning' and 'thinking' its responses through mathematics and science to reduce errors. According to OpenAI, 'We trained these models to spend more time thinking about problems before responding, in a way very similar to how a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thought process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.' The new model uses the reinforcement learning technique, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. As a result, OpenAI claims that the model should be more accurate and avoid 'hallucinations' (when it gives well-structured but false responses). In a demonstration, OpenAI showed the chatbot solving a complex puzzle, answering a graduate-level chemistry question, and diagnosing a disease based on a detailed patient report. The company also announced that the new model has achieved an 83% correct answer rate in a math classification exam, compared to the previous model's 13%.

**OpenAI Releases New Chatbot, 'o1', with Advanced AI Capabilities**
OpenAI has released a new version of its chatbot, 'o1', which is a significant step towards its goal of developing 'artificial general intelligence', or AI that is similar to human intelligence. The new model is available in a beta version and can perform complex tasks, such as solving mathematical problems and generating text. In a test, 'o1' outperformed OpenAI's previous model, 'GPT-4o', in solving mathematical problems, achieving 83% accuracy compared to 13%. However, the new model is currently unable to process or generate non-text content. OpenAI has also tested 'o1' in a logical reasoning task, and it produced the same results as 'GPT-4o', but took longer to respond and provided more detailed answers. OpenAI has stated that 'o1' uses a series of ideas, like a human who can think for a long time before answering a difficult question. It also learns to recognize and correct its mistakes, divide complex tasks into simpler ones, and try different approaches when the first one fails. OpenAI is currently seeking to raise $150 billion in funding, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. The company has already attracted investors such as Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple, which use OpenAI's technology in their systems. The company's chatbot, 'ChatGPT', has over 200 million active users per week, double the number it had last fall. OpenAI has also stated that 92% of the top 500 companies in the US use its products.

**OpenAI Presents 'o1', a More Advanced AI Model with Reasoning Capabilities**
OpenAI has presented 'o1', a more modern artificial intelligence model than ChatGPT, capable of reasoning its responses. According to the company, 'we train these models to spend more time thinking about problems before responding, in a way very similar to how a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thought process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes', said the company in a statement published on Thursday. O1 uses a technique called reinforcement learning, which teaches the system through rewards and penalties. Unlike ChatGPT, this AI model not only imitates data patterns with potentially false information, but can reason and learn which methods lead to the correct response. OpenAI claims that this model should be more accurate and avoid 'hallucinations' - when it gives well-structured but false responses. According to OpenAI's research leader, Jerry Tworek, 'this model should be more precise and avoid these hallucinations.' In a demonstration for The New York Times, OpenAI showed the chatbot solving an acrostic, answering a Ph.D.-level chemistry question, and diagnosing a disease based on a detailed report of symptoms and patient history. The company notes that in a classification exam for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), GPT-4o (the previous model) correctly solved only 13% of the problems, while o1 achieved an 83% score. Tech giants like Google and Meta are building similar technologies, while Microsoft, OpenAI's partner, will soon incorporate the new system into its products. The o1 model also has a 'mini' version, called OpenAI o1-mini, designed to offer a more efficient solution for developers, 'a faster and more economical reasoning model that is particularly effective in coding', according to the company.

**OpenAI's Strawberry Model: A New Era of Reasoning and Calculation**
OpenAI has released its highly anticipated model o1, also known as Strawberry, which is the company's first model capable of reasoning. The main feature of the new models is their ability to solve more complex tasks in the fields of science and programming, but they require more time to respond. According to the developers, 'we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, and even weeks.' The logic behind this is that the longer the model thinks, the more accurate the response will be. The o1 model currently takes a few seconds to think, and the first 'preview' model has already been integrated into the ChatGPT chatbot and API. An optimized version of the model, o1-mini, has also been released, which is specifically designed for programming. The new models are currently available to users of the paid ChatGPT Plus and Team packages, but o1-mini is planned to be included in the free version of the chatbot. In a week, users can send up to 30 messages to the older version of o1-preview and 50 messages to the smaller o1-mini. The new model is not a replacement for gpt-4 in all tasks, but rather a tool for tasks that require calculation or coding, such as solving math and programming problems at the level of international gold medalists. In complex physics tests, it is comparable to a PhD-level student, but it cannot search the internet without a connection. The preview version may have bugs, but the full model is already available and is being tested, with a later release planned.

**OpenAI o1: A New AI Model Capable of Thinking and Reasoning**
OpenAI has released a new AI model called o1, which is capable of thinking and reasoning its responses, providing more accurate results in areas where GPT-4o, the language model that powers ChatGPT, lacked knowledge. The new AI is designed to solve complex tasks in fields such as science, mathematics, and programming. Currently, this model, which integrates with ChatGPT, is available to ChatGPT Plus users, the paid version of the chatbot. OpenAI o1 has been demonstrated through various examples, showcasing its potential. For instance, it can reason about a scenario where a strawberry is placed under a cup, and then the cup is put in the microwave, and conclude that the strawberry is not in the microwave because it was left on the table. OpenAI o1 can also detect corrupted translations, understand the context of a question, and solve complex math problems, including those related to quantum physics and genetics. Additionally, it can program video games, write code, and answer economic questions. According to OpenAI, o1 is a significant improvement over GPT-4o, demonstrating its ability to analyze and understand the context of a question, and provide more accurate and precise results.

**OpenAI unveils new ChatGPT that can reason through math and science**
OpenAI has unveiled a new version of ChatGPT, powered by artificial intelligence technology called OpenAI o1, which can 'reason' through tasks involving math, coding, and science. The new chatbot can take its time to think through problems, break them down, and provide the best answer. In a demonstration, the chatbot solved a complex word puzzle, answered a doctorate-level chemistry question, and diagnosed an illness based on a patient's symptoms and history. The technology is part of a wider effort to build AI that can reason through complex tasks, and could be particularly useful for computer programmers, automated tutors, and health care researchers. OpenAI said its new technology performed better than previous technologies on standardized tests, scoring 83% on the qualifying exam for the International Mathematical Olympiad, compared to 13% for its previous technology.

**OpenAI Launches New AI Model 'o1' with Complex Reasoning Capabilities**
OpenAI has launched a new artificial intelligence model, 'o1', which is capable of complex reasoning tasks, similar to those performed by humans. According to Bloomberg, this model is designed to spend more time calculating the response before answering user queries. 'With the model, OpenAI's tools should be able to solve multi-step problems, including complex mathematical and coding questions,' said the company in a blog post. Although it is an early model, 'it still lacks many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, such as navigating the web to obtain information and loading files and images,' noted OpenAI. However, they highlighted that 'for complex reasoning tasks, this is a significant advance and represents a new level of AI capability.' A preliminary version of the model will be available through the popular chatbot ChatGPT for paid users of Plus and Team starting this Thursday, September 12. The launch of 'o1' coincides with OpenAI's efforts to raise billions of dollars in funding and face growing competition in the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems.

**OpenAI's New AI Model 'o1' Solves Math Problems and Generates Code**
OpenAI has developed a new AI model called 'o1' that can solve math problems and generate code. In a math competition for American high school students, o1 placed 'among the 500 best', according to OpenAI. The company claims that o1 'thinks before responding' and can produce a 'long chain of internal thought' before answering a user. OpenAI aims to create a 'general' AI, similar to human intelligence. In tests, o1 has shown to rival human experts in problem-solving and coding, and OpenAI believes that it represents an improvement in terms of security and alignment with human values. The company has made the beta version of o1 available to paying users of ChatGPT, its popular AI chatbot.

**OpenAI Introduces o1: A New Model That Outperforms GPT-4**
OpenAI has introduced a new model, o1, which significantly outperforms GPT-4. The model is a collection of models, with two of them already available in ChatGPT and through the OpenAI API: o1-preview and o1 mini (a more compact and affordable model). To access, users must be subscribed to ChatGPT Plus or Team. Enterprise and Edu users will gain access next week. The chatbot o1 has limited capabilities, cannot browse web pages or analyze files, and has weekly limits of 30 messages for o1-preview and 50 for o1-mini. The models o1 are expensive, with o1-preview costing $15 for 1 million input tokens (3 times more expensive than GPT-4) and $60 for 1 million output tokens (4 times more expensive than GPT-4). OpenAI plans to make o1-mini available to all ChatGPT users, but has not set a release date. According to OpenAI, o1 avoids some pitfalls in reasoning that typically stump generative AI models. It can effectively fact-check and spend more time considering all parts of a question or team. OpenAI says o1, which emerged from an internal project called Q, excels at math and programming tasks. What sets o1 apart from other generative models is its ability to 'think' before responding to queries. When given extra time to think, o1 can consider a task holistically, plan it ahead, and perform a series of actions over a long period, helping it arrive at an answer. 'O1 is trained with reinforcement learning, which teaches the system to think before responding, using a private thought chain,' said Noam Brown, OpenAI researcher. On a math Olympiad exam for high school students, o1 correctly solved 83% of the problems, while GPT-4 solved only 13%. Overall, OpenAI claims o1 should perform better on data analysis, science, and coding tasks. However, o1 may work slower than other models, depending on the query, and may take over 10 seconds to respond to some questions. The o1 chatbot version shows its progress by displaying a label for the current subtask it is performing.

**OpenAI Releases New AI Model That Answers More Complex Questions**
OpenAI has released a new AI model, o1, which can perform human-like reasoning tasks and solve multi-step problems, including complicated math and coding questions. The model, known as 'Strawberry' internally, is designed to spend more time computing the answer before responding to user queries. According to OpenAI, 'As an early model, it doesn't yet have many of the features that make ChatGPT useful, like browsing the web for information and uploading files and images.' However, the company believes that for complex reasoning tasks, this is a significant advancement and represents a new level of AI capability. A preview version of the model will be available through OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, to paid Plus and Team users. OpenAI is releasing the model in preview now to get a sense for how people use it and where it needs to be improved. The experience of using the updated AI system will differ somewhat from what people have come to expect with ChatGPT, as the new software will pause for a matter of seconds while it considers related prompts and then summarizes the best response. This technique is sometimes referred to as 'chain of thought' prompting.
