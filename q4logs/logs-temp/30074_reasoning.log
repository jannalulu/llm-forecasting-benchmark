2024-11-15 13:00:31,008 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30074:
To forecast whether 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2025, I will perform a systematic analysis:

1. **Reference class forecasting**: Historical data shows that the EUR/USD exchange rate dropped below 1 in September-October 2022. Since then, fluctuations have occurred with the rate peaking at 1.1038 on 01.01.2024. Historical occurrences of the Euro dropping below parity have been rare, and the overall trend since 2008 has shown a gradual decline in exchange rate, but not constant parity breaches.

2. **News and current events**: 
   - The news articles suggest an environment where the dollar is gaining strength due to economic policies under President Trump, causing concerns for the Eurozone’s economic stability.
   - Analysts and financial institutions like Capital Economics and JPMorgan have mentioned the possibility of the Euro reaching parity, primarily due to potential economic impacts from Trump's policies and geopolitical tensions.
   - The Euro is currently valued around $1.05, already nearing parity, indicating vulnerability.

3. **Market sentiments and economic forecasts**:
   - Financial experts are divided, some projecting a drop to parity depending on policy actions, while others see the Euro stabilizing due to internal economic adjustments.
   - Projections for slower growth and economic recovery in the Eurozone do add pressure on the Euro's valuation.

4. **External factors and uncertainties**:
   - The geopolitical landscape, including potential trade disputes, could adversely impact the Euro.
   - Central Bank policies (both the Fed and ECB) and their impact on interest rate directions are crucial influencers. Strengthened or weakened interest rate cuts/responses could tilt the balance toward or away from parity.

5. **Current trends extrapolation**:
   - Given the current exchange rate at around $1.05 and proximity to parity with recent declines, extrapolating current trends considering the ubiquitous economic concerns implies a non-negligible risk of the Euro falling below parity once more before 2025.

6. **Balancing likelihoods**:
   - Assessing the balance of news and macroeconomic indicators that show momentum towards dollar strengthening vs. adaptive internal measures in the EU to stabilize or slightly improve the Euro's position.

Based on the above considerations, the risk of the Euro falling below the parity line seems significant, although not overwhelmingly high due to some counteracting economic factors and potential interventions.

My Prediction: Between 20.00% and 40.00%, but 30.00% being the most likely. Probability: 30.00%.

2024-11-15 13:00:31,014 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30074:
Let me analyze this systematically:

Current Situation:
- As of November 14, 2024, EUR/USD is trading at around 1.0550
- The rate has fallen significantly since Trump's victory on November 5, 2024
- The euro has depreciated 4% against USD since Trump's win

Key Factors Supporting EUR < USD:
1. Trump's Election Impact:
- Promises of tax cuts and higher import tariffs expected to be inflationary
- Potential new tariffs against Europe specifically mentioned
- Markets anticipating more hawkish Fed policy to combat inflation
- ING analysts suggest structural USD strength ahead

2. Economic Divergence:
- German economy showing fragility
- German Council of Economic Experts cut growth forecasts
- EU inflation expected at 3.0% in 2024
- US showing relative economic strength

3. Recent Trend:
- Euro has fallen rapidly since Trump's win
- Currently at lowest level since October 2023
- Momentum appears strongly negative

Factors Supporting EUR > USD:
1. Historical Context:
- Euro recovered after briefly falling below parity in 2022
- Currently still above parity at 1.0550

2. ECB Position:
- Better positioned than last time euro weakened sharply
- Inflation trending lower
- Relatively small pass-through from currency moves to inflation

Analyzing Time Frame:
- Only ~45 days remaining in 2024
- Rapid recent decline suggests momentum could continue
- Multiple analysts (JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank) see parity as possible
- Capital Economics specifically predicts parity by 2025

Given the strong downward momentum post-Trump election, hawkish Fed expectations, potential new tariffs, and only needing a ~5.5% decline from current levels within ~45 days, while accounting for some uncertainty and potential stabilization:

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 75.50%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%

To forecast whether 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2025, I will analyze relevant data, recent news, historical trends, and economic forces. 

### Historical and Economic Context:
1. **Historical Performance**: Since reaching a peak in 2008 of 1.5852 USD/EUR, the Euro has declined, occasionally dipping below parity, most recently in September-October 2022. However, it had recovered to 1.1038 USD by January 2024.
2. **Base Rates**: Historically, occurrences where the Euro has been below parity with the USD have been rare. During the Euro's existence since 1999, it has been below parity only a few times.

### Recent News and Trends:
1. **Recent Performance**: As of the latest reports, the Euro has been falling and was last noted to be around 1.05 USD due to geopolitical uncertainties and strong US dollar performance catalyzed by Trump's election victory and potential economic policies.
2. **Economic News**: Analysts cite growth concerns in the Eurozone and potential for tariffs cutting demand for European exports to the US. The ECB is expected to lower rates due to economic slowdowns.
3. **Predictions from Analysts**: Several financial analysts, including those from JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, have discussed the possibility of EUR/USD reaching parity if certain Trump policies are enacted.
4. **Impact of Trump’s Policies**: Anticipated tariffs and other potential inflationary policies from the new Trump administration could strengthen the USD and depreciate the Euro further.

### Economic Indicators and Forces:
1. **Interest Rate Differential**: The US might cut rates less than expected due to inflation fears, while the Eurozone might cut rates more due to economic pressures, increasing USD attractiveness.
2. **Geopolitical and Economic Risks**: Ongoing uncertainties due to geopolitical tensions, especially related to US-Europe trade relations and the political context in Europe, especially Germany.

### Analytic Process:
1. **Reference Class Forecasting**: Given historical instances where EUR fell below 1 USD, these remain uncommon but possible under heightened economic stress and policy shifts. 
2. **Clashing Forces**: Potential for weaker Euro primarily driven by ECB's monetary policy and reduced export demand due to tariffs. USD strengthened by reduced likelihood of rate cuts in the US.
3. **Expert Opinions and Forecasts**: While some analysts foresee potential parity, consensus isn't universally agreeing to this outcome by 2025. 

### Balancing Arguments:
- **For Euro < USD**: Current political changes in the US could strengthen the dollar, especially with tariffs affecting European exports, ECB easing monetary policy, and weak economic forecasts in Germany.
- **Against Euro < USD**: Euro’s historical resilience, potential for future economic recovery in the EU, and the complexities of geopolitical impacts might limit USD strength to consistently maintain the Euro below parity.

### Probability Range and Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, considering historical context, economic forecasts, and recent events, the probability of the Euro falling below parity before 2025 is plausible but not overwhelmingly certain given typical market volatilities and possible positive surprises in the Eurozone economy.

**My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 50.00%, but 40.00% being the most likely. Probability: 40.00%.**

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Context:
- EUR/USD briefly fell below parity in Sept-Oct 2022
- Started 2024 at 1.1038
- Current rate (as of Nov 14, 2024) is around 1.0550 and falling

2. Recent Trends:
- Euro has fallen significantly since Trump's Nov 5 presidential win
- Currently at 1.0550, down 4% since the election
- Momentum appears strongly negative

3. Key Drivers for Further Euro Weakness:
- Trump's likely policies (tariffs, trade restrictions) seen as negative for EU
- German economy showing weakness
- Political uncertainty in Europe
- Markets pricing in slower ECB rate cuts vs Fed

4. Key Support Factors for Euro:
- ECB maintaining hawkish stance on inflation
- Current account surplus in Eurozone
- Already significant decline has occurred
- Some adaptation to Trump policies likely

5. Time Frame Analysis:
- Only about 6 weeks remain in 2024
- Need roughly 5.5% further decline from current levels
- Recent momentum suggests this is quite possible
- Markets often accelerate moves near psychological levels

6. Expert Predictions:
- JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank see parity as possible
- Capital Economics forecasts 1.0 by end of 2025
- ING sees structural USD strength continuing

The combination of Trump's election victory, deteriorating European economic data, and current momentum suggests a very significant probability of reaching parity. The short timeframe remaining in 2024 is the main constraining factor, but the speed of recent moves suggests this might not be enough to prevent it.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%.

To accurately forecast whether 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2025, I will first analyze historical trends and current factors affecting the EUR/USD exchange rate, then consider expert predictions and current market conditions, and finally, apply superforecasting principles. Here's how I'll break this down:

1. **Historical Trends**: Historically, the EUR/USD rate has fluctuated significantly. After the 2008 financial crisis, the rate has generally trended downward, albeit with many fluctuations. Notably, the Euro was briefly worth less than the US Dollar in September-October 2022.

2. **Current Exchange Rate Situation**: The exchange rate was recently reported as being above 1.05 USD per Euro, but with significant pressure following Trump's recent election victory, suggesting downward pressure on the Euro against the Dollar.

3. **Analyst Predictions and Current Economic Indicators**:
   - Several analysts and economists (e.g., Capital Economics) predict that the Euro could drop to parity or below, citing factors like potential US tariffs impacting Eurozone exports, the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates aggressively, and geopolitical uncertainties.
   - Current projections place the exchange rate currently at a point where a drop below parity is possible due to ongoing economic pressures.

4. **Key Factors to Consider**:
   - **US Economic Policies**: Trump's election victory introduces uncertainties regarding US economic policies, particularly tariffs and potential FED policy shifts, which could strengthen the USD.
   - **Eurozone Economic Conditions**: There is ongoing political uncertainty in parts of the Eurozone and a slowdown in economic growth, alongside fragility in Germany's economy.
   - **Inflation and Interest Rates**: The FED and ECB's responses to inflation and growth (e.g., interest rate adjustments) will significantly impact the exchange rate.

5. **Probability Assessment using Superforecasting Principles**:
   - **Base-rate Analysis**: Historically, significant exchange rate drops (to parity or below) are uncommon but not unprecedented.
   - **Current Indicators**: Current trends, combined with economic forecasts, suggest the Euro could face downward pressure.
   - **Calibration**: Assess how my probability estimate aligns with historical frequency and adjust it in light of recent developments (Trump’s election and predicted policies).
   - **Resolution and Distinctive Features**: Contrast conflicting forces such as US policy uncertainty boosting the USD versus potential Euro resilience or unexpected ECB actions supporting the Euro.

Given these assessments, my prediction is that there's a notable chance the Euro will dip below parity with the USD before 2025, although not a certainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

Here's how I'll break this down:

1. **Historical Trends**: Historically, the EUR/USD rate has fluctuated significantly. After the 2008 financial crisis, the rate has generally trended downward, albeit with many fluctuations. Notably, the Euro was briefly worth less than the US Dollar in September-October 2022.

2. **Current Exchange Rate Situation**: The exchange rate was recently reported as being above 1.05 USD per Euro, but with significant pressure following Trump's recent election victory, suggesting downward pressure on the Euro against the Dollar.

3. **Analyst Predictions and Current Economic Indicators**:
   - Several analysts and economists (e.g., Capital Economics) predict that the Euro could drop to parity or below, citing factors like potential US tariffs impacting Eurozone exports, the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates aggressively, and geopolitical uncertainties.
   - Current projections place the exchange rate currently at a point where a drop below parity is possible due to ongoing economic pressures.

4. **Key Factors to Consider**:
   - **US Economic Policies**: Trump's election victory introduces uncertainties regarding US economic policies, particularly tariffs and potential FED policy shifts, which could strengthen the USD.
   - **Eurozone Economic Conditions**: There is ongoing political uncertainty in parts of the Eurozone and a slowdown in economic growth, alongside fragility in Germany's economy.
   - **Inflation and Interest Rates**: The FED and ECB's responses to inflation and growth (e.g., interest rate adjustments) will significantly impact the exchange rate.

5. **Probability Assessment using Superforecasting Principles**:
   - **Base-rate Analysis**: Historically, significant exchange rate drops (to parity or below) are uncommon but not unprecedented.
   - **Current Indicators**: Current trends, combined with economic forecasts, suggest the Euro could face downward pressure.
   - **Calibration**: Assess how my probability estimate aligns with historical frequency and adjust it in light of recent developments (Trump’s election and predicted policies).
   - **Resolution and Distinctive Features**: Contrast conflicting forces such as US policy uncertainty boosting the USD versus potential Euro resilience or unexpected ECB actions supporting the Euro.

Given these assessments, my prediction is that there's a notable chance the Euro will dip below parity with the USD before 2025, although not a certainty.

My Prediction: Between 40.00% and 60.00%, but 50.00% being the most likely. Probability: 50.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Context:
- EUR/USD reached all-time high of 1.5852 in July 2008
- Brief period below parity in Sept-Oct 2022
- Current rate (as of Jan 1, 2024) was 1.1038

2. Recent Trends (from news articles):
- EUR/USD has fallen significantly since Trump's win on Nov 5, 2024
- Currently at 1.0550 (Nov 14, 2024)
- Down 4% since Trump's election
- Trading at lowest levels since October 2023

3. Key Driving Forces:
Bearish for EUR:
- Trump's election victory and potential tariffs against Europe
- German economic weakness
- Political uncertainty in Europe
- ECB likely to cut rates more aggressively than Fed

Bullish for EUR:
- ECB better positioned than in previous episodes of EUR weakness
- Inflation trending lower
- Some analysts see potential for positive surprises in Europe

4. Expert Predictions:
- Capital Economics forecasts EUR/USD at 1.0 by end of 2025
- JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank see possibility of parity
- ING suggests structural USD strength ahead

5. Analysis:
- Strong downward momentum since Trump's election
- Only ~0.055 (5.5%) away from parity
- 6+ weeks remaining in 2024
- Multiple major banks forecasting possibility of parity
- Significant political and economic headwinds for EUR

The trend is clearly negative and accelerating, with multiple credible institutions forecasting parity. Given the short timeframe (6+ weeks), current momentum, and proximity to parity (only 5.5% away), combined with significant bearish catalysts, the probability appears high.

My Prediction: Between 65.50% and 85.50%, with 75.50% being the most likely. Probability: 75.50%.

To forecast whether the Euro-to-Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate will drop below 1.00 before January 1, 2025, we need to analyze both the current and forecasted economic conditions as well as historical context.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rates**: Previously, the EUR/USD briefly dipped below parity in September-October 2022, reflecting unusual circumstances in the markets. Historically, the Euro spent a significant period above parity since its introduction, with only brief instances of dipping below. Therefore, base rates suggest it is less common for the Euro to be below parity.

2. **Current Trends and News**: Recent news articles suggest a strengthening of the US dollar and weakening of the Euro, driven by several factors:
   - Economic policy shifts indicated by Donald Trump's election.
   - Predictions of policy impacts by analysts (e.g., Capital Economics anticipates the EUR/USD reaching 1.0 by end-2025).
   - Market volatility and uncertainty reflective of policy changes, especially regarding potential US tariffs impacting Eurozone exports.
   
   As of November 14, 2024, the Euro dropped to approximately 1.05 against the US dollar, which reflects a weakening trend but does not yet indicate imminent parity.

3. **Economic Indicators and Models**: Economic forecasts from Capital Economics and other analysts indicate a potential movement towards parity but provide mixed timelines with predictions leading up to 2025, suggesting it may not occur immediately or certainly by early 2025.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: 
   - US dollar strengthening due to expectations of higher interest rates and tariffs.
   - Eurozone vulnerabilities, including economic stagnation in Germany and potential ECB monetary easing.
   - Political uncertainty, like geopolitical tensions and potential economic disruptions from Trump's policy regime.
   
These forces create an environment where the Euro could indeed fall below 1.00, reflecting resolution of the clashing causal forces favoring dollar strength.

5. **Extrapolating Trends**: Current extrapolations from recent data (just above 1.05) suggest continued volatility, with the currencies approaching, but not yet hitting, parity.

6. **Probabilities Assignment**: Balancing historical data and current economic indicators:
   - **Lower Bound** (probability of falling below parity): Given the current proximity (approx. 1.05) and economic forecasts, there's a significant, but not dominant, chance that parity will be breached before 2025. This should reflect uncertainty and a volatile market response: 35.00%.
   - **Most Likely Probability**: From ongoing elicitations and current trajectories, the most grounded individual probability encapsulating this mix is 45.00%.
   - **Upper Bound**: Conceding room for error due to volatility and potential under-forecasting the speed of policy impacts could see this probability as high as 55.00%.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Therefore, base rates suggest it is less common for the Euro to be below parity.

2. **Current Trends and News**: Recent news articles suggest a strengthening of the US dollar and weakening of the Euro, driven by several factors:
   - Economic policy shifts indicated by Donald Trump's election.
   - Predictions of policy impacts by analysts (e.g., Capital Economics anticipates the EUR/USD reaching 1.0 by end-2025).
   - Market volatility and uncertainty reflective of policy changes, especially regarding potential US tariffs impacting Eurozone exports.
   
   As of November 14, 2024, the Euro dropped to approximately 1.05 against the US dollar, which reflects a weakening trend but does not yet indicate imminent parity.

3. **Economic Indicators and Models**: Economic forecasts from Capital Economics and other analysts indicate a potential movement towards parity but provide mixed timelines with predictions leading up to 2025, suggesting it may not occur immediately or certainly by early 2025.

4. **Clashing Causal Forces**: 
   - US dollar strengthening due to expectations of higher interest rates and tariffs.
   - Eurozone vulnerabilities, including economic stagnation in Germany and potential ECB monetary easing.
   - Political uncertainty, like geopolitical tensions and potential economic disruptions from Trump's policy regime.
   
These forces create an environment where the Euro could indeed fall below 1.00, reflecting resolution of the clashing causal forces favoring dollar strength.

5. **Extrapolating Trends**: Current extrapolations from recent data (just above 1.05) suggest continued volatility, with the currencies approaching, but not yet hitting, parity.

6. **Probabilities Assignment**: Balancing historical data and current economic indicators:
   - **Lower Bound** (probability of falling below parity): Given the current proximity (approx. 1.05) and economic forecasts, there's a significant, but not dominant, chance that parity will be breached before 2025. This should reflect uncertainty and a volatile market response: 35.00%.
   - **Most Likely Probability**: From ongoing elicitations and current trajectories, the most grounded individual probability encapsulating this mix is 45.00%.
   - **Upper Bound**: Conceding room for error due to volatility and potential under-forecasting the speed of policy impacts could see this probability as high as 55.00%.

My Prediction: Between 35.00% and 55.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Current Situation:
- As of November 14, 2024, EUR/USD is at 1.0550
- The rate has fallen significantly since Trump's election victory on November 5
- The euro has depreciated 4% against USD since Trump's win

2. Key Driving Forces:
For lower EUR/USD:
- Trump's victory and promised policies (tariffs, tax cuts)
- Uncertainty over Fed rate decisions
- German economic weakness
- Political uncertainty in Europe
- Potential new tariffs against Europe

For higher EUR/USD:
- ECB's ability to manage inflation
- Current rate still above parity (1.0550)
- Historical resilience of euro
- Euro's role as reserve currency (20.5% of global reserves)

3. Expert Predictions:
- Capital Economics predicts EUR/USD could fall to 1.0 by end of 2025
- JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank say parity possible depending on tariffs
- ING suggests structural USD strength ahead

4. Analysis:
- The trend is clearly downward since Trump's election
- Multiple major financial institutions see parity as possible
- Only ~6 weeks remain in 2024 for resolution
- Current momentum strongly favors dollar strength
- Key risk period will be when/if Trump implements new tariffs

5. Historical Context:
- EUR/USD has fallen below parity before (2022)
- Current situation shares similarities with previous dollar strength periods

Given the strong downward momentum, multiple expert predictions of parity, and immediate catalyst of Trump's election and planned policies, there appears to be a high probability of EUR/USD falling below parity before 2025.

My Prediction: Between 65.20% and 75.80%, with 70.50% being the most likely. Probability: 70.50%

2024-11-15 13:02:01,427 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30074:
To forecast whether 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2025, we should examine historical trends, current conditions, and expert predictions.

1. **Historical Reference**: Historically, the EUR/USD exchange rate dropped below parity during a short period in 2022, which was a notably rare occurrence since the Euro's inception. The rate has predominantly stayed above parity, suggesting that a drop below this level is not common. This provides a baseline understanding: the rarity of parity or below-parity events.

2. **Current Conditions (Mid-November 2024)**: The exchange rate has recently fallen to approximately $1.05, indicating a downward trend due to specific economic and political developments, such as Donald Trump's election win and anticipated policies. The recent news reports suggest increasing momentum for the dollar, owing to geopolitical and economic forecasts. This suggests a possibility of further depreciation of the Euro towards parity.

3. **Economic & Political Environment**: The recent Trump election has heightened expectations for policies that could strengthen the US dollar due to potential tariffs, trade modifications, and increased geopolitical tensions. These factors could further widen interest rate differentials that favor the USD. Further political uncertainties in Europe, including German economic vulnerabilities, bolster the dollar's strength comparative to the Euro. 

4. **Macroeconomic Indicators**: Economic forecasts are adjusted downward for both the EU and Eurozone, with inflation trending lower and GDP growth adjusted to lower levels. However, the ECB might act to counteract significant deviations, possibly restricting how far the Euro could depreciate.

5. **Expert Predictions**: Several economic forecasts (e.g., Capital Economics) align with a potential EUR/USD parity scenario given current bullish dollar projections. However, they position this happening more likely by the end of 2025, which lies slightly beyond our forecast window.

6. **Base Rates and Current Trends**: Based on historical rates and current trends and conditions, the likelihood of the Euro dropping below parity before January 1, 2025, has increased from its average historical level due to recent political and economic developments that currently favor the dollar. 

Balancing historical rarity, current market dynamics, expert opinions, and economic uncertainties, the probability that the Euro will fall below parity before 2025 has increased but remains uncertain due to market volatilities. Thus, based on this analysis and weighing the possibility of accelerating current trends more drastically, my prediction leans towards this being increasingly plausible.

My Prediction: Between 30.00% and 60.00%, but 45.00% being the most likely. Probability: 45.00%.

To forecast whether 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2025, we should examine historical trends, current conditions, and expert predictions.

1. **Historical Reference**: Historically, the EUR/USD exchange rate dropped below parity during a short period in 2022, which was a notably rare occurrence since the Euro's inception. The rate has predominantly stayed above parity, suggesting that a drop below this level is not common. This provides a baseline understanding: the rarity of parity or below-parity events.

2. **Current Conditions (Mid-November 2024)**: The exchange rate has recently fallen to approximately $1.05, indicating a downward trend due to specific economic and political developments, such as Donald Trump's election win and anticipated policies. The recent news reports suggest increasing momentum for the dollar, owing to geopolitical and economic forecasts. This suggests a possibility of further depreciation of the Euro towards parity.

3. **Economic & Political Environment**: The recent Trump election has heightened expectations for policies that could strengthen the US dollar due to potential tariffs, trade modifications, and increased geopolitical tensions. These factors could further widen interest rate differentials that favor the USD. Further political uncertainties in Europe, including German economic vulnerabilities, bolster the dollar's strength comparative to the Euro.

Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Historical Context:
- EUR/USD fell below parity (1.0000) in Sept-Oct 2022
- Has since recovered to 1.1038 on Jan 1, 2024
- Currently trading around 1.0550 (Nov 2024)

2. Recent Trends & Evidence:
- Trump's election victory on Nov 5, 2024 has caused significant dollar strengthening
- Euro has fallen 4% since Trump's win
- Currently at lowest levels since October 2023
- Moving towards but not yet at parity

3. Key Driving Forces:
For EUR/USD falling below 1.0000:
- Trump's potential trade policies (tariffs against Europe)
- German economic weakness
- Political uncertainty in Europe
- USD strength due to inflation concerns

Against EUR/USD falling below 1.0000:
- ECB better positioned than in previous episodes
- Lower pass-through from currency to inflation
- Some analysts see potential for positive surprises in Europe
- Current level still meaningfully above parity

4. Expert Predictions:
- Capital Economics predicts EUR/USD at 1.0 by end of 2025
- JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank see parity as possible depending on tariffs
- ING suggests structural USD strength ahead

5. Time Frame Analysis:
- Only ~45 days remaining in 2024
- Need significant further decline of ~5% to reach parity
- Trump's policies won't take effect until after January 2025
- Historical precedent shows such moves possible but not common in short timeframes

Given the recent sharp decline post-Trump's victory, continued momentum lower, and multiple major banks predicting potential parity, but balanced against the limited time remaining in 2024 and still meaningful gap to parity, I assess:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%

- ECB better positioned than in previous episodes
- Lower pass-through from currency to inflation
- Some analysts see potential for positive surprises in Europe
- Current level still meaningfully above parity

4. Expert Predictions:
- Capital Economics predicts EUR/USD at 1.0 by end of 2025
- JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank see parity as possible depending on tariffs
- ING suggests structural USD strength ahead

5. Time Frame Analysis:
- Only ~45 days remaining in 2024
- Need significant further decline of ~5% to reach parity
- Trump's policies won't take effect until after January 2025
- Historical precedent shows such moves possible but not common in short timeframes

Given the recent sharp decline post-Trump's victory, continued momentum lower, and multiple major banks predicting potential parity, but balanced against the limited time remaining in 2024 and still meaningful gap to parity, I assess:

My Prediction: Between 35.50% and 45.50%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%
