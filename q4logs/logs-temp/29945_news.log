**'Likely to spend time behind bars': The most nominated country star of 2024 could face prison time following Nashville arrest**
Morgan Wallen, the country music star with the most 2024 Country Music Association (CMA) nominations, may face prison time following his arrest in Nashville in April. Wallen was charged with three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of a bar. According to People, if convicted, Wallen could be sentenced to up to six years in jail. However, sources tell Life & Style that Wallen may only spend between 30 and 60 days in jail or receive probation if his lawyers successfully plea deal his charges down to misdemeanors. This is not the first time Wallen has been in trouble with the law, having been arrested in 2020 for public intoxication and disorderly conduct, and banned from the 2021 CMA ceremonies after using a racial slur. Wallen has since apologized for his behavior, stating, 'I didn't feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I've touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief's. I'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility,' on X.
