**Government Leader Says Haddad Should Go to Senate and Spending Package Vote Should be Left for 2025**
The government leader stated that Haddad should go to the Senate on the fifth and that the voting of the spending package should be left for 2025. Dino said, 'I personally think that this leaves the Congress in a very fragile position. Waiting to see if the legislation is to his liking.' In addition to the Draft Budget Guidelines Law (PLDO) and the 2025 Draft Budget Law (PLOA), there is still expectation to finish voting on the regulation of the tax reform this year. The Mixed Budget Commission (CMO) published the calendar of processing of the PLOA on Tuesday, with the expectation of voting the matter on December 13. The last week of work of the Congress this year is from December 16 to 20.

**Postelection: Economic Confidence Up; Biden Ratings Down**
A Gallup poll conducted after the 2024 elections found that Americans' confidence in the economy has improved, with 36% believing it is getting better and 55% thinking it is getting worse. This shift is largely driven by Republicans, whose economic confidence index score gained 29 points to -43. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden's job approval rating has dipped to 37%, with 80% of Democrats and 7% of Republicans approving of his job performance. Fewer Americans are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. now (22%) than before the election (26%). Congress' approval rating has ticked up to 19%, with political independents and Democrats viewing it slightly more positively than before the election.

**Health care in December’s lame duck Congress**
The 2024 general elections have resulted in a Republican-controlled Congress, with President-elect Donald Trump pledging to 'Make America healthy again' (MAHA). With a tight deadline to fund the government by December 20, Congress will focus on passing a complex spending package and enacting healthcare legislation. Key issues to watch include: Medicare physician pay, with doctors facing a 24% pay cut since 2000 and a potential 4.7% payment update in 2025; banning Chinese biotechnology companies and TikTok; priority review vouchers for rare pediatric drugs; telehealth in Medicare, with a potential expiration of expanded coverage on December 31; and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reform and kids' online safety. These issues will impact healthcare marketers and communications companies in 2025, with lawmakers needing to address major expiring policies, including 30 provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 and premium subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

**Malas noticias para inmigrantes en USA: la última fecha del pago del Seguro Social antes que llegue a su fin en EE. UU.**
A recent proposal in the US House of Representatives aims to eliminate Social Security benefits for immigrants. This measure, backed by the House, could mark the end of a crucial benefit for many who reside in the country. The Social Security Equity Act has sparked concern, especially among Latinos, who could see their benefits significantly reduced. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) has been a contentious issue, as its implementation could result in a substantial loss of benefits for those who have not reached the 30-year work requirement to access the full Social Security amount in the US. This situation has sparked a debate over the equity of the system and its impact on vulnerable communities. The proposal has been approved in the House, but still needs Senate approval and the President's signature to become law. If implemented, the changes would affect benefits approved from December 2024 onwards. It is crucial that immigrants are aware of these dates and prepare for the possible repercussions. Many immigrants, who often lack the necessary years of work, could face a reduction of up to 50% in their payments. This is especially concerning for those who receive pensions from their countries of origin. It is advised that immigrants check if their countries of origin have agreements with the US that facilitate the combination of work periods. This could help mitigate the impact of the new law and ensure they can access the benefits they are entitled to. The lack of information and preparation can exacerbate the situation for those who rely on Social Security.

**Trump's approval rating now 20 points higher as president-elect**
A recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found that 54% of Americans approve of President-elect Trump's job performance, while 40% disapprove. This is a 20-point increase from his final approval rating as president in January 2021. Trump's approval rating is highest among Republicans, with 91% approving of his job performance. However, nearly three-quarters of Democrats disapprove of his performance. The poll also found that a majority of those aged 18-54 approve of Trump's job performance, while a small majority of those older than 65 disapprove. Trump has nominated several unorthodox cabinet picks, including former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz as his attorney general and Fox & Friends weekend host Pete Hegseth as his secretary of defense. 'It's a good start he is above 50 in job approval so far -- it will be important for him to stay above that level to govern effectively,' said pollster Mark Penn. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden's approval rating stands at 42%.

**Senate nudged for ‘immediate’ enactment of 2025 budget**
President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. has certified the proposed P6.352-trillion national budget for 2025 as urgent, citing the necessity of immediate enactment to ensure uninterrupted government operations. The certification allows Congress to skip the three-day interval between bill readings. Senators are scrutinizing the spending plans of government agencies before proposing amendments. Senator Mary Grace Natividad S. Poe-Llamanzares said, 'Today is the last day of the budget debates according to the agreed schedule, but it won't go to second reading immediately as we need to give time to the senators to prepare their amendments based on the plenary debates.' The Senate aims to approve the national budget by December 2, in time to submit it to the Palace before Congress goes on break on December 21.

**America's Regressive Institutions: Weekly Update (11/17/2024)**
Congressional approval is declining, with a slight increase in the percentage of people disapproving of Congress. While the recent election sent the GOP back to the House of Representatives, the public's perception of Congress remains unfavorable. The Supreme Court, criticized for its handling of rights and detention in ICE facilities, also faces scrutiny. According to recent data, the Supreme Court's approval rating has not been explicitly mentioned in the article, but the tone suggests a negative view of the institution.

**Health Policy: Expected Movements in the Lame Duck Session – November/December 2024**
Congress is working on several health policies that may be included in the year-end spending package, including extensions for Medicare COVID-era telehealth flexibilities, Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Reform, and the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (RPD PRV) program. The telehealth flexibilities, which were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, are set to expire at the end of the year. Several bills have been introduced to extend these flexibilities, including H.R. 7623, 'The Telehealth Modernization Act of 2024,' which was voted unanimously out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in August. PBM Reform is also a priority, with several pieces of legislation making it through markup, including H.R. 5378, 'Lower Costs, More Transparency Act,' which passed the House with strong bipartisan support in December 2023. The RPD PRV program, which offers incentives to companies for developing therapies for rare pediatric diseases, is set to expire at the end of the year without a further extension or reauthorization. H.R. 7384 / S. 4583, 'Creating Hope Reauthorization Act of 2024,' is bipartisan legislation that would extend until FY2029 the voucher program. Additionally, the BIOSECURE Act, which would prohibit federal agencies from procuring or obtaining any biotechnology equipment or service produced or provided by a biotechnology company of concern, has strong support in both chambers and is likely to be signed into law by the end of the year. The Medicare Physician Payment Fix is also a priority, with several bills introduced to address the proposed 2.8% Medicare physician cuts, including H.R. 10073, which would provide physicians with a 4.73% payment increase in 2025 to offset the cuts.

**The Remainder of the Year in Congress**
When Congress returns to Washington on November 12, they will face a number of outstanding items, including government funding which will expire on December 20 if not addressed. Several health policies, such as telehealth flexibilities, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reforms, and provider payment reductions, remain unaddressed. The Telehealth Modernization Act (H.R. 7623) has been approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee to extend expiring telehealth flexibilities for an additional two years. The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act (H.R. 5378) passed the House with bipartisan support in December 2023, aiming to enhance PBM transparency. Physicians are likely to petition Congress for relief from the 2.93 percent payment reduction to Medicare enrollees for 2025. The power dynamics of the incoming Congress will influence year-end negotiations, with early speculation suggesting a short-term CR may be more likely than a longer-term omnibus funding bill.

**Congress Returns to Changed Political Landscape, But Same To-Do List**
Congress returns to work with the same to-do list as in September, including passing FY2025 appropriations and other critical legislation. Republicans will control the White House and Senate next year, but Democrats still control the Senate and White House for now. The most important space-related tasks for the rest of this year are passing appropriations bills and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the NDAA includes extensions of the FAA 'learning period' that prohibits new commercial human spaceflight regulations and third-party indemnification to January and September 2028 respectively. NASA authorization and commercial space/mission authorization bills could also be added to the NDAA. The exemption Congress gave NASA from the Iran-North Korea-Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA) expires in December 2025, and NASA is working on a new agreement to maintain and operate the International Space Station safely. The government is operating under a Continuing Resolution (CR) that expires on December 20, and whether FY2025 appropriations bills are passed before then is an open question.

**Democrats’ three big mistakes**
The US election results may seem to fit a global trend of voters rejecting incumbent leaders, but Kamala Harris could have bucked the trend. The US economy is performing well, with strong employment, rising wages, and decreasing inflation. Additionally, Donald Trump's weaknesses as a political figure, such as his low approval ratings, could have been exploited. According to a CNN poll, Trump's approval rating was as low as 34% after the January 6, 2021, incident, and his favorable rating sank to 31% in a CNN poll after the 2022 midterms, with an unfavorable rating of 60%. As a result, Republicans were disillusioned with him, and Ron DeSantis was outpolling Trump among Republicans in a Wall Street Journal poll in December 2022.

**Milei's Positive Image Reaches 50%: Survey**
A recent survey by Fundación Pensar found that the positive image of President Javier Milei has reached 50% and only 1 in 10 voters 'regrets' their vote. The survey, conducted in October 2024, showed that 49% of the population supports the government's plan, which has achieved some of the goals set during the campaign, such as reducing inflation and reducing state spending. The main asset of the government, according to the survey, is that Milei 'is doing the same thing he promised in the campaign'. 53% of the surveyed Argentines considered that the national government is 'better or equal to what they expected'. The government maintains the support of the vast majority of voters who supported its proposal in the runoff election last year. Milei will travel to the United States next week, with expectations of a meeting with Donald Trump. 'Very few voters regret their vote in the second round', the Foundation noted. Despite the critical economic and social context, the government has a solid approval rating, which grew from 45% in January to 49% in October 2024. One of the conclusions of the study is that Milei's image, fixed around 50% in the last measurement, is 'stable and deep'. 'In a context of recession, increase in tariffs and measures such as the veto to the increase in pensions, half of the population still maintains a positive image of the President', indicated from the Fundación Pensar.

**Is There Any Chance That Congress Can Be a Check On Trump?**
The 2024 US election has resulted in a decisive victory for Republicans, with a 'decisive dark red wave' drowning out progressive voices. However, Democrats must not give up and find ways to check and balance President Trump's power. History shows that even in the face of a strong opposition, Democrats can regain control of Congress and pass legislation. The Senate dynamics are crucial, with Republicans currently holding a 52-48 majority, which could expand to 53-47 or 54-46. A narrower majority could allow Democrats to block Trump's cabinet picks and initiatives, as seen in the past with Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. Labor, environmental, and civil rights activists can find openings with these senators and others up for reelection in 2026. As Connie Rice said, 'the better angels of progress' must be preserved.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Close Race and Limited Predictions**
The US presidential election 2024 is approaching, and polls are predicting a close race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. To understand the current state of the election, it's essential to look at the polls and their limitations. FiveThirtyEight aggregates national approval ratings for the presidential candidates, but even these averages are not precise predictions. Past elections have shown that polls and predictions have limited accuracy in the US. The 2016 election was a prime example, with many institutes predicting a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton, but the actual outcome was different. The 2020 election also had a close outcome, but the winner, Joe Biden, was correctly predicted. The election on November 5 will not only determine the next president but also the balance of power in the US Congress. The Electoral College will meet on December 17 to cast their votes, and the official results will be announced on January 6, 2025. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure a majority of the 538 electoral votes. The number of electoral votes each state receives is based on its population and the number of senators and representatives it has in Congress. Some states have a 'winner takes all' system, where the winner receives all the electoral votes, while others, like Nebraska and Maine, allocate their electoral votes based on congressional districts. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors, including the number of mail-in ballots and the timing of their counting. In some states, mail-in ballots can be counted immediately, while in others, they can only be counted on election day or later. This can lead to delays in the counting process and make it difficult to predict the outcome of the election.

**538's final forecasts for the 2024 election**
According to 538's final election forecasts, the presidency and House of Representatives are toss-ups, while the GOP is likely to win the Senate. The presidential election is extremely close, with Vice President Kamala Harris having a 50-in-100 chance of winning the Electoral College and former President Donald Trump having a 49-in-100 chance. The margin between the two candidates is less than 2.1 percentage points in all seven swing states. The House of Representatives is also uncertain, with Democrats having a 51-in-100 chance of taking control. However, the median outcome in the forecast is that Democrats win just a one-seat majority. The Senate, on the other hand, is decidedly not close, with Republicans having a 92-in-100 chance of winning control of the upper chamber.

**ROOKE: GOP Has Real Chance To Control Congress. It Boils Down To Twelve Key Races**
The 2024 US congressional elections are crucial for both parties, with Republicans having a real chance to control Congress. According to the 538 election simulator, Republicans have a 91.6% chance of winning the Senate if they take three out of five key seats in Montana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Ohio. In the House, Republicans currently hold a slim majority, but Democrats only need four seats to take control. The 538 polling simulator gives Republicans a 58% chance to win. Key Senate races include Montana, where Republican Tim Sheehy is leading Democrat Jon Tester by 4 points, West Virginia, where Republican Jim Justice has a 99% chance to win, and Pennsylvania, where Republican Dave McCormick is trailing incumbent Democrat Bob Casey by 2 points. In the House, Democrats are targeting seven close seats in California, New York, Washington, Michigan, and Alaska, but Republicans are favored to hold onto power.

The House of Representatives and the Senate will resume session on November 4, with the ratification of the P6.352-trillion national budget as their top priority. Majority Leader Manuel Jose 'Mannix' Dalipe said the House expects the Senate to pass a budget bill soon, and they hope to ratify the bicam report before the December 20 Christmas break. Dalipe said the proposed 2025 national budget would be ready for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s signature before the year ends. Senate President Francis Escudero also emphasized the importance of the national budget, and Sen. Grace Poe said she is ready to sponsor the proposed 2025 General Appropriations Bill on Tuesday. The Senate will hold sessions on Thursdays to expedite the budget proceedings, and Poe said they are anticipating the budget to be passed into third and final reading on November 26.

**Will This Lame-Duck Congress Trip The Next One Over The Fiscal Cliff?**
The current lame-duck Congress faces a daunting task in wrapping up its unfinished business before the end of the year. The $4 trillion fiscal cliff in 2025 will consume policymakers' time, but first, they must address appropriations, defense authorization, disaster relief, and Social Security fairness. The House has passed only five of the twelve appropriations bills, while the Senate has approved none. Congress must find a way to fund defense, diplomacy, and more before December 20. The article questions whether Congress can complete its basic responsibilities, citing its history of inaction and lack of accountability. It suggests that Congress needs to do things differently to achieve better results and make serving in Congress a more rewarding experience.

**2024 US Presidential Election: A Complex and Uncertain Process**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, with a total of 1,335 elections across the country. Voters will choose between candidates for the presidency, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. The election will also determine the composition of state legislatures, with 85 of the 99 state legislatures holding elections. The Republican Party, which currently controls the House of Representatives, may retain a narrow majority in the lower chamber and regain control of the Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, he will have a majority in Congress, repeating the scenario of his first term (2017-2019). The election will also determine the outcome of the presidential election, with the winner being determined by the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to its number of Representatives in Congress. The electors will meet in their respective states to cast their votes for president and vice-president on December 17. The votes will then be counted by Congress on January 6, 2025, and the winner will be declared. The election process is complex, with multiple dates and deadlines, including November 5, December 11, December 17, and January 6. The outcome of the election is uncertain, with several swing states having laws establishing automatic recounts in the event of a close election. The risk of election disputes and allegations of 'fraud' is also a concern, with Donald Trump having already begun to spread false information about potential election fraud in Pennsylvania. Despite these challenges, the election process is designed to ensure the integrity and fairness of the outcome.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest Polls Show Tight Race Between Trump and Harris**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, where voters will not only choose the next president but also elect new members of the US Congress. In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.

**Dominican Congress Approves Loans Worth Over 37,000 Million Pesos**
The Dominican Congress has sent to the Senate a loan agreement with the Official Credit Institute of the Kingdom of Spain, worth approximately 1,200 million Dominican pesos, to finance the Integral and Sustainable Management of Solid Waste in Greater Santo Domingo. The loan is part of a package of loans totaling over 37,000 million pesos, which will be used to improve the country's energy distribution and mitigate the effects of climate change. The loans were approved by the Congress, but sparked a heated debate between the ruling party and opposition parties, with some lawmakers warning that the debt will burden future generations. 'Our children will have to pay for this', said lawmakers from the Liberation Party and other opposition groups. The president of the Finance Commission, Frank Paulino, defended the loan, saying it will benefit the Dominican society. The largest loan, worth $300 million, was agreed with the Inter-American Development Bank in December 2023, and will be used to promote economic growth and protect against climate change. The loan has a value of approximately 18,000 million pesos, and will be repaid between 2028 and 2043. The loan is divided into two installments, with the first payment due in 2029 and the last payment in 2044. Additionally, the Dominican government has agreed to a loan with the French Development Agency, worth $100 million, and a loan with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, worth $225 million, to improve the country's electricity distribution network.

**How 538's 2024 Senate election forecast works**
FiveThirtyEight's 2024 Senate election forecast combines polling averages, quantitative data, and qualitative ratings to predict the outcome of each Senate race. The model starts with polling averages, adjusted for factors such as pollster rating, mode of the interview, and partisan sponsorship. It then incorporates quantitative data, including partisan lean, incumbency, candidate fundraising, and polarization. The model also uses qualitative ratings from experts at Sabato's Crystal Ball, the Cook Political Report, and Inside Elections to fill in gaps and provide additional information. The final forecast is a weighted average of the polls, fundamentals, and expert ratings, with the weights depending on the number of polls available for each seat. The model also simulates uncertainty, accounting for national, regional, and state-level error, and provides a range of outcomes for each contest. According to the model, there are about 7 points of error on the margin between candidates in each seat, with 4.8 points of error at the national level, 2.8 at the regional level, and 4.8 on the state level. The model also allows for state-level error to be higher in states further away from an even partisan lean, higher in seats with no polls, higher in seats with 'Solid' or 'Safe' race ratings, and higher in seats where the polls disagree more with the fundamentals.

**How 538's 2024 House election forecast works**
538's 2024 House election forecast combines polling data with quantitative and qualitative data to predict the outcome of each congressional district. The forecast starts by calculating an average of generic ballot polls, which are then adjusted for pollster rating and methodology. In addition to polls, the forecast incorporates district-specific factors such as partisan lean, which is calculated by taking a weighted blend of the district's vote in the most recent and second-most recent presidential election. The forecast also uses regression models to predict support for third-party candidates and individual candidates in races with multiple candidates from the same party. To fill in gaps in the data, the forecast incorporates qualitative race ratings from experts at Sabato's Crystal Ball, the Cook Political Report, and Inside Elections. The final weights of the model depend on the number of polls available for each seat, with more weight given to polls in competitive districts. The forecast also accounts for uncertainty by quantifying prediction error from five sources: national error, regional error, demographic-cluster error, state-specific error, and idiosyncratic error. The total expected error is about 8 points on the margin between candidates in each seat.

**Senate targets budget approval by mid-December at the latest**
The Senate plans to approve the proposed P6.352-trillion national budget for 2025 by the second week of December at the latest, according to Senate President Francis G. Escudero. He stated, 'By tradition and by practice, bicameral conference committee deliberations of Congress last more or less two weeks, maximum.' The Senate aims to start plenary debate on the proposed national spending plan by the second week of November, with committee deliberations on individual budgets of government agencies expected to be completed by October 18. The House of Representatives has already approved its version of the General Appropriations Bill, and President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. has certified the bill as urgent, allowing Congress to expedite the process. The Budget department has reduced the proposed budgets for agriculture, health, and social welfare sectors by 4.7%, 7.6%, and 3.4%, respectively, under the 2025 National Expenditure Program.

**Congress Poised To Race Out Of D.C. After Dodging Shutdown**
Congress has passed a stopgap spending bill to avoid a government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. The bill, which was approved with a 341-82 House vote and a 78-18 Senate vote, will keep the federal government running through Dec. 20. House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole said, 'In a matter of days, funding for fiscal year 2024 will run out and it's Congress' responsibility to ensure that the government remains open and serving the American people.' Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro emphasized the need for bipartisan agreement on the full-year spending bills, saying, 'No matter who wins in November, we owe it to the next Congress and the next president to not saddle them with yesterday's problems.' The stopgap bill extends funding levels and policies approved earlier this year, including a provision allowing the Secret Service to spend money at a faster rate for protective operations. The outcome of the November elections will likely influence whether Congress reaches agreement with the Biden administration on the dozen full-year government funding bills.

**Congress Reaches Continuing Resolution Consensus, Raising Christmas Renegotiation**
The US Congress has passed a three-month continuing resolution (CR) until Dec. 20, 2024, to fund the government. The CR was adopted by a vote of 341-82 in the House and 78-18 in the Senate. President Biden is expected to sign the legislation before the Sept. 30, 2024, deadline. The CR includes $231 million for the Secret Service and $119 million for the presidential inauguration and transition. It does not include additional funding for disaster relief or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congress has 24 legislative days before the CR expires and is expected to pass a series of minibuses and/or another CR during the lame duck session. Speaker Johnson stated, 'We've worked very hard to break the Christmas omnibus tradition since I became Speaker, and we will not return to it.' The House and Senate must agree on topline totals, which is expected to be a significant challenge during the lame duck session.
