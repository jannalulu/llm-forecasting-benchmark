**Australian Recorded Flu Cases the Highest on Record**
Australia has recorded the highest number of influenza cases since national surveillance records began, with 352,782 laboratory-confirmed flu cases in 2024. This surpasses the previous peak of 313,454 cases in 2019. New South Wales (NSW) has recorded the highest number of influenza cases in 2024, with 157,620 laboratory-recorded notifications. Despite the high number of cases, nearly 8.8 million Australians have taken the flu vaccine between March 1 and Oct. 6, with vaccination rates highest in NSW, followed by Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia. However, a survey found that only 27 percent of parents answered 'yes' when asked if their child was vaccinated against the flu in 2024, down from 31 percent in Sept. 2023.

**CDC Report Finds Low Mandatory Vaccine Rates Among Healthcare Workers**
A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study found low mandatory vaccine rates among U.S. healthcare workers. According to the study, published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, flu vaccine coverage was 80.7% among 8.8 million healthcare workers in over 4,000 acute care hospitals during the 2023-24 cold and flu season. However, COVID vaccine coverage was only 10.5% among workers in over 14,000 nursing homes. The report noted that COVID-19 vaccine coverage decreased from 22.8% in the 2022-23 respiratory virus season to 10.5% in the 2023-24 season. The authors emphasized the need to investigate barriers to vaccination among healthcare personnel and identify strategies to address these challenges. Interestingly, healthcare workers who are well-informed about COVID-19 vaccines are ten times more likely to get vaccinated and four times more likely to recommend vaccination to their patients.

**15% of hospital staff got COVID boosters last season: 4 CDC findings**
According to the CDC, only 15.3% of hospital staff received a COVID-19 booster during the 2023 to 2024 respiratory virus season, despite the CDC's recommendation. In contrast, nearly 81% of hospital staff received a flu shot last season. The CDC noted that influenza vaccination rates have not returned to 2019 levels and COVID-19 vaccination rates have continued to decline each season, highlighting the ongoing challenge of promoting vaccination among healthcare personnel. The CDC emphasized the need for studies to identify effective strategies to improve vaccination rates, particularly in a post-pandemic period where healthcare personnel are susceptible to low vaccine confidence.

**Just 11% of ‘Flu’ Cases Are Caused by Influenza. No Wonder the Vaccines Don’t Work**
A recent study found that only 11% of 'flu' cases are caused by the influenza virus, which raises questions about the effectiveness of flu vaccines. The study suggests that the clinical similarity between influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza makes it difficult to distinguish between the two, and that most ILI cases are caused by other microorganisms. The authors argue that the lack of understanding of the microbiology of ILI and the failure to identify a precise burden of influenza morbidity or mortality has led to wildly inflated CDC estimates and the promotion of ineffective vaccination measures. They also point out that influenza viruses mutate continuously, making vaccination a 'moving target'. The authors conclude that the public is being misled by politicians and the media, who are using the 'flu' label to justify vaccination programs and secure funding for health services.

**US outpatient antibiotic prescribing returning to pre-COVID levels**
According to a recent analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US outpatient antibiotic prescribing is returning to pre-COVID levels. The study, which analyzed data from 48,900 US retail pharmacies, found that antibiotic prescriptions decreased by 19.4% in 2020, 15.4% in 2021, and 5.5% in 2022 compared to the baseline year of 2019. However, from July to September 2022, prescribing volume approached pre-pandemic levels, and by October to December 2022, it exceeded those levels by 3.6%. The authors suggest that the uptick of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 in late 2022 contributed to the observed trends in antibiotic prescribing. They emphasize the need for enhanced stewardship efforts and support in the outpatient setting during respiratory virus season, and suggest that sustained improvement will require increased access to stewardship expertise and the implementation of multifaceted stewardship interventions.

**Virus Outbreak Expected On These Days In New York State**
Health officials in New York State are expecting a busy few months as the flu season approaches. According to data from the New York State Health officials, the weeks of December in 2022 and 2023 saw the highest number of reported and confirmed flu cases, with 51,000 cases reported on December 17, 2022, and 30,000 cases reported on December 30, 2023. As of the last week of October, pediatricians have not seen any flu cases. However, doctors expect the flu to return with the cool and damp conditions in November. As one pediatrician said, 'they have not seen any flu as of the last week of October.'

**CDC: 200 pediatric flu-related deaths in the 2023-2024 season**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a record high of 200 pediatric flu-related deaths in the 2023-2024 season. According to Dr. Donald Beno, a pediatrician at Aurora BayCare, 'The hope is that by vaccinating we can decrease those numbers cause 80% of those deaths were people who had not been immunized or vaccinated against the flu.' Doctors stress the importance of prevention and recommend that everyone six months and older get a flu vaccine. Dr. Beno also advises watching for signs of the flu progressing to something more serious, such as a fever lasting more than three days. 'We've seen an increase in our area, so the key is to watch for if this viral cold now progressing to something more?' he said. Influenza can cause a 104-degree fever for four to five days and often leads to pneumonia. 'Even if the efficacy for a vaccine is not a perfect match it can still prevent you from falling very ill or worse,' Dr. Beno added.

**CDC Forecast Gives Dates When COVID-19 Hospitalizations Could Peak This Season**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released its latest outlook for flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) this season. According to the CDC, 'As of mid-October, overall US respiratory disease activity remained low.' However, the agency expects a winter increase in cases, with a peak in COVID-19 hospitalizations likely in late December and early January. The CDC predicts that the 2024-2025 fall and winter virus season will have a similar or lower number of combined peak hospitalizations compared to last season. Vaccination is the best line of defense against these viruses, and the CDC recommends flu and COVID-19 vaccines for everyone aged 6 months and older, and RSV vaccination for select high-risk groups. Simple measures such as hand washing, staying home when sick, and wearing a face covering in enclosed or crowded spaces can also help stop the spread of infection.

**Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza-Associated ...**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report on laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations from the 2010-11 through 2022-23 influenza seasons. The report analyzed data from the FluSurv-NET surveillance system, which collects data on hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections. The report found that the number of hospitalizations due to influenza has varied over the seasons, with the highest counts and rates of hospitalizations occurring during the 2017-18 season. The report also found that the proportion of patients who received influenza antiviral treatment increased over the seasons, from 44.1% in the 2010-11 season to 63.4% in the 2022-23 season. Additionally, the report found that the proportion of patients who were vaccinated against influenza increased over the seasons, from 36.4% in the 2010-11 season to 59.1% in the 2022-23 season. The report also analyzed trends in clinical characteristics and outcomes, including the proportion of patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the proportion of patients who died in the hospital. The report found that the proportion of patients who were admitted to the ICU increased over the seasons, from 12.1% in the 2010-11 season to 18.5% in the 2022-23 season. The report also found that the proportion of patients who died in the hospital decreased over the seasons, from 3.4% in the 2010-11 season to 2.1% in the 2022-23 season. Overall, the report provides valuable insights into the epidemiology of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States and highlights the importance of vaccination and antiviral treatment in preventing severe illness and death due to influenza. 'This report provides a comprehensive summary of data collected by FluSurv-NET from the 2010-11 through 2022-23 influenza seasons, including trends in cumulative rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes for patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections,' said the report. 'The report highlights the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring of influenza-associated hospitalizations to inform public health policy and practice.'

**Incapacidad Temporal: ¿cuántos días puedo estar de baja laboral por una gripe?**
The change of seasons can lead to a weakened immune system, making people more susceptible to illnesses like the flu. According to the Clínica Universidad de Navarra, the treatment for the flu includes good hydration and paracetamol to reduce fever and alleviate pain. The months of November and December are the most critical for contracting the flu, and the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. The Sistema de Vigilancia de Infección Respiratoria Aguda del Instituto de Salud Carlos III reported a 46% positivity rate for flu in the last week of 2023, compared to 5.38% in the previous month. Doctors recommend not going to work during a period of illness, especially for high-risk groups such as children, the elderly, and pregnant women. A justified reason for not going to work for up to 3 days is a mild illness like the flu, without the need to present any documentation for Incapacidad Temporal (IT). If the illness persists, it is recommended to contact the doctor and request a medical leave. In cases of severe illness, it is best to seek specialized medical attention and obtain a diagnosis from a healthcare provider. Once the diagnosis is made, it is advisable to inform the employer of the expected duration of the leave.

**CDC reports rising levels of Mycoplasma pneumonia and RSV in young kids**
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported rising levels of Mycoplasma pneumonia and RSV in young kids. According to the CDC, pneumonia and acute bronchitis related to M pneumoniae bacteria have increased since late spring and have remained high, peaking in late August. The CDC noted that the increase in children ages 2-4 years is notable because M. pneumoniae historically hasn't been recognized as a leading cause of pneumonia in this age group. Additionally, RSV activity is still low overall, but there are signs of increased activity in the southeastern United States, especially in young children. Emergency department visits for COVID-19 and test positivity continued to decline last week, with test positivity currently at 6.3%. The CDC also reported that deaths from the virus were down last week, with 327 reported. CDC wastewater tracking shows that viral levels remain low, with levels currently highest in the northeast. Regarding flu, the CDC said that seasonal flu activity remains low nationally, with no new pediatric flu deaths reported, keeping the total at zero for the 2024-2025 flu season.

**Get Your Flu Vaccine Before End of October**
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends getting the influenza vaccine by the end of October to provide solid protection during the cold and flu season. The ideal time to get the flu vaccine is before flu activity starts, which typically peaks between December and February. The vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate and cause illness in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. The FDA emphasizes that the flu vaccine will not make you sick with the flu, but rather trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The FDA notes that anyone can get sick with flu, but children, people age 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with certain chronic medical conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses, 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits, 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 6 million influenza-related illnesses, 2.9 million influenza-associated medical visits, 65,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 3,700 influenza-associated deaths.

**The Right Time is Now to Get Your Flu Vaccine**
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends getting the influenza vaccine by the end of October to provide solid protection during the cold and flu season. 'Flu viruses typically spread in fall and winter, with activity peaking between December and February,' the agency said. The flu vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. 'It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body, which is an important reason to get your flu vaccine early, before flu activity starts,' the FDA added. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 140 million cases of the flu, 12,000 hospitalizations, and 6,000 deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 3.5 million cases of the flu, 40,000 hospitalizations, and 2,000 deaths. 'Anyone can get sick with flu,' the FDA said. 'Typically, children and people age 65 and older are most at risk of developing serious complications from influenza.'

**Respiratory diseases peak expected in December, experts say**
According to experts, the peak of respiratory diseases is likely to occur in December. The unusually warm September may have helped to delay the flu season. 'We had a prolonged summer, and therefore the epidemic season is likely to be delayed to later dates', said Pshenichnaya. As of October 15, 807,000 people have contracted respiratory viruses (ORVI) in the last week, while 30,000 have contracted COVID-19. The curve of infections has not grown, but has even decreased by 5% over the past two weeks. Although neither ORVI nor the flu will disappear, experts do not expect any unpleasant surprises this year. The few cases of flu reported in recent weeks show that the country is circulating old, well-known strains that are familiar to our immune system. These strains are also included in the vaccines being administered this fall. 'The viruses causing the disease are still dominated by rhinovirus, adenovirus, and other 'seasonal' pathogens. COVID-19 cases remain at 30,000 per week, which is an order of magnitude lower than in previous waves linked to omicron', said Alexander Gorелов, deputy director of the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology. Respiratory viruses are easily transmitted in crowded areas. In half of the cases, children are the first to be infected in a family, and then their parents and grandparents. Therefore, doctors recommend taking advantage of the delay in the flu season and getting vaccinated. Additionally, seniors are also vaccinated for free against pneumococcus, a bacterium that often follows respiratory infections and 'attaches' to a weakened body, causing pneumonia. 'This vaccination is performed once every five years, which is sufficient to maintain stable immunity', emphasized Gorелов.

**The Flu Vaccine Might Be Less Effective This Year**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the influenza vaccine being used this flu season may be less effective than last year's vaccine, based on data from five South American countries. The vaccine reduced hospitalization risk by 35% in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, compared to 51.9% effectiveness last year. The CDC notes that the vaccine's effectiveness 'might be similar in the Northern Hemisphere' if similar flu viruses circulate. This year's flu vaccines in the US will target the H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B (Victoria) strains, and health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccination. According to the CDC, an estimated 75 million people in the US got the flu between October 2023 and April 2024, resulting in 900,000 hospitalizations and between 17,000 and 100,000 deaths.

**CDC: 35% flu vaccine efficacy in South America may predict similar for US season**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the flu vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization among high-risk groups in five Southern Hemisphere countries was low (35%) during the 2024 flu season. This may predict similar efficacy during the upcoming Northern Hemisphere flu season if similar A(H3N2) viruses predominate. According to lead author Erica Zeno, 'While Southern Hemisphere data cannot predict exactly what will happen in the Northern Hemisphere, what we can say is that if we see similar influenza viruses (strains or clades) circulating this season in the Northern Hemisphere, we can expect similar vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalizations.' The CDC has forecasted that the upcoming flu season will be similar to or lower than that of the 2023-2024 season rate of 8.9 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000, with moderate confidence.

**Get Vaccinated Now: Experts Warn of Influenza Peak in December 2024**
The peak of the influenza season is expected to occur in December 2024, but doctors recommend getting vaccinated immediately. 'It's generally between the end of December and the first few days of January that we see the peak,' explains Elisabetta Alti, director of general medicine at the Asl Toscana Centro. 'So, it's best to get vaccinated now, giving our immune system time to build defenses, so we're protected when the flu and Covid viruses spread widely.' The double vaccination against flu and Covid is recommended for people over 60, those with chronic illnesses, pregnant women, and those in high-risk professions such as healthcare workers and teachers. 'The double vaccination is really beneficial, as we receive safe and effective protection against two viruses that can cause significant problems in the coming months,' says Dr. Alti. The Tuscany Region has purchased over 900,000 doses of flu vaccine, including specific vaccines for the elderly, children, and adults. Vaccination against flu and Covid-19 is currently underway in Tuscany, with elderly residents in care homes starting on October 1 and the general public able to get vaccinated at their family doctor's office or pediatrician's office starting on October 7.

**AstraZeneca's FluMist approval for self-administration could increase flu vaccine uptake**
The US FDA has approved AstraZeneca's FluMist for self-administration, increasing the accessibility of seasonal influenza vaccines. According to GlobalData, the influenza virus caused 2.1 million illnesses, 21,000 hospitalizations, and 4,700 deaths during the 2023-2024 US influenza season. Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData, said, 'FluMist is approved for use in the US in children and adults ages 2 through 49 years. It is the only seasonal influenza vaccine to be delivered intranasally, which makes it a great option for those who may be needle-phobic.' The US CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older receives a vaccination each influenza season. AstraZeneca plans to utilize a third-party online pharmacy to provide FluMist for self-administration, which is expected to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season. GlobalData's survey reveals that the percentage of patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza who were administered FluMist during the 2022-2023 season were 2.2% of children 2-4 years of age, 13.4% of children 5-17 years of age, and 3.4% of adults 18-49 years of age. Kurdach concludes, 'By increasing access to FluMist, there is potential for these percentages to increase. It is possible that we will see an increase in US patient shares of FluMist, given the convenient route of administration and ease of access, as well as an overall increase in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake.'

**Influenza 2024: Expert Warns of Intense Season, Offers Key Advice**
According to virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco, the upcoming influenza season is expected to be intense, with possibly more than 14.5 million cases. The new Covid variant, XEC, is also expected to play a significant role. Pregliasco advises to continue protecting vulnerable individuals and to follow five key rules: get vaccinated, use common sense when wearing masks, wash hands frequently, avoid antibiotics, and practice responsible self-medication. He also emphasizes the importance of getting tested for Covid, especially for vulnerable individuals, and using antiviral medication, such as Paxlovid, if necessary.

**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Worst Season in 10 Years**
The influenza season for 2024 is expected to be the worst in the last 10 years, according to virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco. The new variant of Covid, XEC, is expected to contribute to the high number of cases, which could reach 14.5 to 15 million. Pregliasco warns that it's essential to continue protecting vulnerable individuals. The viruses expected to be prevalent during the autumn-winter season of 2024-2025 include A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and the XEC variant of Covid, as well as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Pregliasco notes that the season of respiratory infections has not ended, and the levels of contagion have not decreased below the critical threshold, even during the summer. He emphasizes the importance of following the 'golden rules' to prevent the spread of the virus: getting vaccinated, using common sense when wearing masks, washing hands frequently, not using antibiotics unnecessarily, and adopting responsible self-medication practices.

**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Severe Season Ahead**
The upcoming influenza season is expected to be severe, with 150 million cases per week predicted. Experts warn that the sudden change in temperature has favored the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza. 'Today we have many children who have never been in contact with the influenza virus, which can circulate more quickly. The problem is that if more people become infected, the number of deaths and severe cases could be high among the elderly and vulnerable,' says epidemiologist Gianni Rezza. To mitigate this, Rezza suggests increasing the vaccination rate against influenza. In Australia, the previous season was the second worst in the past 10 years due to the A/H3N2 variant. In Italy, 14.5 million cases of influenza-like illnesses were reported last year, and this year's numbers are expected to be similar or higher. The US FDA has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine, a nasal spray, for people aged 2-49. The vaccine is available online and can be administered at home after completing a questionnaire to assess suitability for self-administration.

**CDC Continues to Respond to Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Outbreak**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in multiple states in the United States. Since April 2024, 14 human cases of infection with the avian influenza A(H5) virus have been reported in the US. Four of these cases were associated with exposure to infected dairy cows, and nine with exposure to infected poultry. The risk of contracting avian influenza H5 for the general public remains low. The USDA reports that 213 dairy herds in 14 US states have confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows. The CDC is working with the USDA, FDA, ASPR, state and local health officials, and other partners to monitor the situation and prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is also conducting serosurveys to assess past exposure to H5 viruses among veterinarians and other veterinary professionals. The CDC is posting a new webpage describing influenza surveillance activities for the 2024-2025 flu season, which include monitoring of wastewater for influenza A virus and avian influenza A(H5) in the US. The CDC recommends that people avoid contact with sick or dead animals, including wild and domestic birds, and avoid exposure to animal waste, unpasteurized milk, and materials that have been in contact with infected animals. The CDC also recommends that people who have contact with animals during their work should know the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and take the necessary precautions. 'It is essential to reduce the risk of people and contain the risk for public health in general,' said the CDC.

**Influenza Season 2024: What You Need to Know**
The influenza season 2024 is approaching, and it's essential to know the facts about this contagious disease. According to the SSa, the influenza season starts in the fall and winter months in regions with temperate climates, while in tropical climates, the virus circulates throughout the year. Globally, the influenza has an estimated attack rate of 5-10% in adults and 20-30% in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that there are 1 billion cases of seasonal influenza worldwide, with 3 out of 5 cases being severe and causing between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths. In Mexico, the influenza season typically occurs in the fall and winter months, with cases appearing as early as October and peaking in December, January, and February. The symptoms of influenza include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Some people may also experience vomiting and diarrhea, more commonly in children than adults. The influenza is most contagious during the first 3 days of the illness, but it can be transmitted to others from 1 day before symptoms appear to 5-7 days after becoming sick. People with weakened immune systems or young children may be contagious for longer periods. The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, which can then be inhaled by others. 'It's essential to take precautions and get vaccinated to protect yourself and others from the flu,' said Dr. [no doctor mentioned in the article].

**As Flu Season Approaches, American Lung Association Urges Annual Vaccination to Prevent Severe Illness**
The American Lung Association is urging the public to get an annual flu vaccination to prevent severe illness as flu season approaches. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the 2023-2024 flu season saw between 35 and 65 million flu cases, up to 830,000 hospitalizations, and as many as 72,000 deaths. The CDC recommends that everyone aged six months and older receive their flu shot in September or October, before the flu starts widely circulating. Vaccination remains the best method to protect against the flu and severe complications, especially for those with chronic conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

**Influenza Peak Expected in Late November, Says Rospotrebnadzor Head**
According to Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor, the peak of influenza cases is expected to occur in late November. She noted that there were no group cases of illness during the summer, so the epidemic season in the cold season should occur later than in 2023. It is likely that this increase will occur in late November to December. Popova also emphasized that by September 30, the readiness of medical institutions to work during the increase in cases will be checked. This includes ensuring that hospitals do not run out of antiviral medications, personal protective equipment, and disinfectants. This also applies to pharmacies, reports RIA Novosti. Meanwhile, over 300,000 people in the Samara region have been vaccinated against the flu.

**Flu Deaths in Children Last Season Reach 199, Matching Record**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported two new flu-related deaths in children last week, bringing the total for the 2023-2024 season to 199. This number matches the previous high of 199 reported during the 2019-2020 season. Of the 158 children who were eligible for a flu vaccine and for whom vaccination status is known, 131 (83%) were not fully vaccinated. Flu vaccination can be lifesaving for children and has been shown to reduce the severity of illness in people. According to the CDC, flu vaccination last season reduced the risk of flu medical visits by about two-thirds and flu-related hospitalization by about half for vaccinated children. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine, especially children at higher risk for serious flu-related complications. Among the reported deaths, 73 were younger than 5 years old, and 126 were between 5 and 17 years. About half of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A virus infections, while 46% were associated with influenza B viruses. Flu vaccine uptake among children was lagging compared to previous seasons, with coverage for the 2023-2024 season being 2.2 percentage points lower than the previous season and 8.5 percentage points lower compared with pre-pandemic coverage.

**Everybody you know coming down sick at the moment? Here's why**
The US is experiencing a surge in illnesses, with COVID-19 cases on the rise, particularly in the West. According to Dr. Eve Elizabeth Pennie, a general practitioner, the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 disrupted seasonal cold and flu patterns, making people's immune systems weaker when they returned to their normal lives. This, combined with low vaccination rates and the evolution of the virus, is causing more severe illnesses. Dr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist, said, 'Late summer, early fall, is a really interesting time for the spread of infectious disease... There's all sorts of intermixing.' The CDC reported that 16.3% of people who took a COVID test were positive for the virus, up from 7.5% in July 2020. Vaccination rates for flu have been consistently lower in 2024 than in the three years previous, with 158 million vaccines distributed in the 2023-2024 season, compared to 176 million in the 2021-2022 season. Dr. Gupta said, 'I'm concerned that we've entered a space where we have a series of threats that seem like they're rapidly evolving.'
