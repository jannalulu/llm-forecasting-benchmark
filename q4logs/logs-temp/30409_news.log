**NASA warns of potential 'catastrophic failure' on leaking ISS  --  but Russia doesn't want to fix it**
The International Space Station (ISS) has been leaking since 2019, but NASA and Russian space agency Roscosmos disagree on the severity of the issue. According to NASA, the leak poses a risk to the ISS's goal of operating until 2030 and could lead to 'a catastrophic failure' of the station, as stated by Bob Cabana, chair of the agency's ISS Advisory Committee. However, Russian space officials have downplayed the severity of the leak, insisting it will not jeopardize future ISS operations. NASA and Roscosmos have agreed to seal off the leaky segment if the rate of air loss becomes 'untenable,' but they have not yet reached a consensus on what qualifies as an untenable rate. Currently, air is escaping at a rate of around 2 to 2.5 pounds per day above the space station's equilibrium. NASA plans to add an extra seat aboard future SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft in case any astronauts need to evacuate.

**Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore Rescue Mission: NASA to Ensure Safe Return of Stranded Astronauts by February 2025**
Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore have been stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) since June 5, 2024, due to technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. NASA has launched an uncrewed spacecraft to deliver 3 tons of food, fuel, and essential supplies to the astronauts. Despite growing concerns about their health, NASA has reassured the public that the astronauts are in good condition, undergoing regular medical check-ups and monitored closely by flight surgeons. To counter the health risks of long-term space travel, astronauts on the ISS follow a strict exercise regimen. NASA has opted to use a SpaceX mission, led by Elon Musk's company, to bring them back to Earth in February 2025 for safety reasons.

**SpaceX likely to get FAA approval for 25 Starship launches in 2025**
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released a draft environmental assessment (EA) that approves SpaceX's request to increase the number of annual Starship launches from five to 25 in 2025. The draft EA also approves 25 landings for both the Super Heavy booster and the 'Ship' upper stage at Starbase in South Texas. According to the FAA, the increased launch frequency will not have a significant impact on the environment. SpaceX has been developing the Starship, a 400-foot-tall stainless-steel megarocket, to help humanity settle the moon and Mars. The company plans to conduct multiple Starship launches per day. The FAA will hold public meetings in January to discuss the EA and gather feedback from the public.

**Biden Muses That He Could Be Sent To Space To Rescue Stranded Astronauts**
President Joe Biden playfully joked about being sent to space to rescue two stranded NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been on the International Space Station (ISS) since June. Biden referenced his wife's quips about his antics, saying, 'I'm going to call [Bill Nelson] and have him send you to space.' The astronauts are awaiting their return after a technical failure with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Their rescue will involve SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, not a presidential space expedition. Biden's humor reflects a lighter tone amid ongoing international collaboration in space exploration.

**Boeing May Ditch the Space Race — And Starliner**
Boeing officials are reportedly considering offloading Starliner, the company's commercial spacecraft, and its space division due to the project's years-long delays and cost overruns. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg is said to be considering selling the project, which has burned through over $1.8 billion in cost overruns, according to the Wall Street Journal. Ortberg stated, 'We're better off doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well.' NASA officials are still working to understand the issues that caused Starliner's multiple problems, and the federal space agency has made it clear that Starliner's future is currently unclear. Richard Jones, deputy program manager of NASA's commercial crew program, stated, 'We're just starting that, just trying to understand how to correct and rectify the issues that are on the table.'

**NASA Continues to Address Issues with Boeing's Starliner Spacecraft**
The NASA continues to try to resolve the problems observed in the Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The spacecraft took astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station (ISS), but returned empty to Earth after the space agency concluded that it was too dangerous to bring them back in the capsule. Now, the duo remains on the ISS until 2025. According to Richard Jones, NASA's Commercial Crew Program Manager, 'We're just starting - trying to understand how to correct and rectify the problems that are on the table.' The teams will continue to work on the schedules and requirements needed to meet them. The Starliner was launched on June 5 in the CFT mission and docked with the orbital laboratory the next day, despite failures in its propulsion systems. NASA and Boeing spent several months investigating the incident, while delaying the spacecraft's return. As the CFT was an experimental mission with an untested spacecraft for crewed flights, it was natural that failures occurred and schedules changed. The Starliner-1, the first operational mission of the vehicle, is scheduled to be launched in 2025, but it is unclear if the launch will happen as originally planned.

**NASA still working to 'correct and rectify' Boeing Starliner issues after 1st test flight with astronauts**
NASA is still working to resolve the issues that caused Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to return to Earth without its astronauts after the first crewed test flight. The agency is trying to understand and correct the propulsion issues that made a crewed return too risky. 'We're just starting that -- just trying to understand how to correct and rectify the issues that are on the table,' said Richard Jones, deputy program manager of the NASA's Commercial Crew Program. NASA officials said it could be a while before Starliner's path is established, and the agency is working hard to determine the schedules and requirements for future missions. Boeing is supposed to fly half a dozen future astronaut missions to the International Space Station before 2030, but the timeline is uncertain due to the unresolved issues.

**Boeing is still bleeding money on the Starliner commercial crew program**
Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, did not mention the Starliner program during his first quarterly conference call with investment analysts, despite the program's significant financial losses. Boeing has reported a total loss of $1.85 billion on the program, with the latest quarterly report adding $250 million to the tally. The company is running the program under a fixed-price contract with NASA, which means they are responsible for any cost overruns. Boeing has not released any updates on the program's future plans since the last test flight ended in a disappointing fashion, with the company only stating that they will review data and 'determine the next steps for the program.'

**NASA is done with the Boeing Starliner — for now**
NASA has announced that it will exclusively use SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft for its 2025 Commercial Crew Program missions due to the unavailability of the Boeing Starliner. The Starliner's crewed test flight was plagued by thruster problems, and it still isn't certified to fly. NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy stated, 'It's under data review. We need to have a decision: do we need another test flight?' The agency has not completely shut the door on the Starliner, but it won't be used for any operational missions to the International Space Station next year. NASA has spent $5 billion on the Starliner's development and is keeping options open for its certification, including potential flights in 2025.

**NASA Cancels Starliner Flight, Gives Mission to SpaceX**
The NASA has canceled the fifth flight of the Starliner spacecraft, which was scheduled to carry astronauts to the International Space Station, and has given the mission to SpaceX. The Starliner, built by Boeing, had a troubled past, including a previous flight that was aborted due to helium leaks and propulsion system issues. The two astronauts on board, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, were 'stuck' on the spacecraft, but will now return to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft in February 2025. The Starliner is now uncertain about its future, as NASA has announced that it will not be ready to transport astronauts in the summer of 2025. 'The timing and configuration of the next Starliner flight will be determined once Boeing's path towards certification of the system is better understood', said NASA. Meanwhile, SpaceX has been given the mission Crew-10, which was originally scheduled for the Starliner, and will now carry two American astronauts, an Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS in February 2025.

**Will Starliner, the Boeing spacecraft that took Sunita Williams to space, fly again?**
Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which carried Sunita Williams to space, has raised concerns about its viability in NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The recent Crew Flight Test was cut short due to technical issues, and NASA has confirmed that it will continue to use SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft through 2025. Boeing's financial and reputational costs are mounting, and the company will need to conduct a thorough review of the mission data and address the technical issues to determine whether Starliner will fly again with a crew. NASA officials have expressed confidence in Starliner's safety, but the decision to err on the side of caution points to the complexities and risks inherent in human spaceflight. Boeing will need to demonstrate significant improvements and reliability in Starliner's performance to secure its place in future missions. 'It marks another delay in Starliner's certification process, potentially widening the gap with SpaceX's already operational Dragon capsule,' said Steve Stich, manager of the Commercial Crew Program. 'However, NASA has consistently expressed its desire for multiple crew transport options to ensure reliable access to the ISS,' he added. 'The coming months will be critical in determining whether Starliner can overcome its troubled history and emerge as a viable option for crewed spaceflight, or if it will join the ranks of spacecraft that never fully realised their potential.'

**NASA Freezes Starliner Missions Indefinitely**
NASA has announced that the next Crew-10 mission with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft will not take place until at least February 2025, followed by the Crew-11 mission in July 2025. This means that there are no new missions with the Starliner planned for the foreseeable future. The original plan was for the Starliner to have its first operational mission by early 2025, but the first crewed test flight was a failure, leaving astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunni Williams stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) since then. According to NASA, the astronauts will return to Earth in February 2025 with the SpaceX Crew-9 on board the Crew Dragon. Boeing is still holding onto the certification of the Starliner, but the timeline for the next flight is uncertain. As NASA stated, 'The timing and configuration of the next Starliner flight will be determined once a better understanding of Boeing's path to system certification exists.' The Starliner experienced issues during its flight to the ISS, including 5 malfunctioning engines and helium leaks, and the crew has been waiting for their return since September.

**NASA Puts Starliner Mission to ISS on Hold Until Boeing Finds Better Path to Certification**
NASA has put the Starliner mission to the ISS on hold until Boeing finds a better path to certification of its space system. The agency plans to use SpaceX's Crew Dragon for future manned missions to the ISS while the Starliner issue is resolved. NASA has announced that the Crew-10 mission will not launch before February 2025, and the Crew-11 mission will not launch until July 2025. Boeing had planned to conduct the first operational mission to the ISS in early 2025, but the first crewed flight of the Starliner ended in failure. Now, Boeing is further away from certifying its space transportation system. NASA will determine the schedule and configuration of the next Starliner flight after establishing a better understanding of Boeing's path to certification, which will include lessons learned from the Crew Flight Test, final certification products, and operational readiness. The agency is considering various certification options, including a potential Starliner flight in 2025, but it is unclear whether the flight will include a crew on board or if the spacecraft will fly to the ISS alone. 'We will determine the best path forward for Starliner after we have a better understanding of the certification process,' said NASA. Boeing has not yet fulfilled its $4.3 billion contract with NASA under the Commercial Crew Program. During the first uncrewed test flight of the Starliner in 2019, a software automation glitch caused the spacecraft to burn excess fuel and fail to reach the ISS. In May 2022, Boeing completed the second uncrewed flight of the Starliner, Orbital Flight Test-2, but several issues arose, including a malfunctioning engine used for orbital maneuvering. In the first half of October 2024, Boeing's leadership announced plans to lay off 10% of its employees, or 17,000 people, over the next few months, affecting managers, executives, and regular employees.

**Boeing's Starliner Spacecraft Delayed Until Further Notice**
NASA has announced that the Boeing Starliner spacecraft will not be included in the 2025 ISS crew rotation program. The decision comes after the spacecraft experienced issues during its uncrewed test flight this year. The agency is still deciding whether to require Boeing to conduct another test flight before certifying the spacecraft for regular missions. The next crew rotation mission in February 2025 will be performed by SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which will be its 10th regular mission to the ISS. Boeing's Starliner may still conduct another test flight if NASA deems it necessary to confirm the 'workarounds' implemented after the initial test flight issues. The spacecraft's first crewed test flight in August experienced problems with its small maneuvering engines, but was still able to dock with the ISS. However, the mission was extended to three months as NASA and Boeing engineers worked to determine the safety of returning the crew on the spacecraft. The Starliner was eventually returned to Earth in an uncrewed mode, but NASA is still analyzing the results of the mission and the causes of the engine failure. Boeing claims that the crew was never in danger and that the spacecraft is ready for operation.

**NASA Suspends Starliner Flights, Turns to SpaceX's Dragon Spacecraft**
The Boeing Starliner spacecraft has suffered a catastrophic test flight with crew, leaving several astronauts stranded on the ISS. In response, NASA has suspended Starliner flights and opted for SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to send astronauts to the ISS. The Starliner had previously attempted a crewed flight, successfully transporting astronauts to the ISS but experiencing numerous leaks, preventing its return and stranding two NASA astronauts on the ISS. The Starliner was subsequently grounded for safety reasons. NASA has announced that it will use SpaceX's Crew Dragon for its Crew-10 mission in February 2025 and Crew-11 mission in July 2025, dealing a blow to Boeing's plans for the Starliner's first operational mission next year. According to NASA, 'The schedule and configuration of the next Starliner flight will be determined once we have a better understanding of the path Boeing will take to obtain certification of the system.' This setback for Boeing is a victory for SpaceX, which is increasingly collaborating with NASA. SpaceX will be responsible for retrieving the stranded astronauts and has been chosen to de-orbit the ISS. The company will also participate in NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon in the near future.

**Boeing Starliner: Issues Persist for the Space Capsule**
The Boeing Starliner CST-100 capsule has encountered issues during its Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission, which aimed to validate the spacecraft and pave the way for commercial missions. Although the June flight successfully transported two astronauts to the ISS, incidents prevented their return to Earth as planned. The NASA has decided to bring the astronauts back in February 2025 using a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, instead of the same Starliner capsule. The Starliner-1 commercial mission, initially scheduled for February 2025, has been delayed to August 2025 at the earliest. The NASA is still evaluating the CFT mission and considering whether to conduct a second test flight, CFT-2, to ensure the issues, such as overheating thrusters, are resolved before proceeding with the first commercial mission. 'The evaluation of the entire CFT mission, from the chaotic docking at the ISS to the return to Earth, is not yet complete,' said the NASA. 'This issue is still pending and could still impact the schedule for Starliner-1.'

**NASA is planning to give the beleaguered Boeing Starliner another shot at space  --  in late 2025**
NASA has released its 2025 commercial launch schedule, which includes a third attempt for the Boeing Starliner to reach space. The agency plans to release the Starliner's next flight dates after incorporating lessons from the Crew Flight Test and approving its operational readiness. NASA is keeping options open for system certification, including potential windows for a Starliner flight in 2025. The first planned launch of 2025 is the SpaceX Crew-10 mission, targeting a launch 'no earlier than February 2025.' Meanwhile, NASA is working with SpaceX to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth via the SpaceX Crew Dragon in February 2025, after the Starliner's recent issues with thrusters and helium leaks. The commercial space exploration race between Boeing and SpaceX continues, with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk accusing the Federal Aviation Administration of playing favorites with Boeing.

**Sunita Williams' spacecraft set for redemption? NASA plans Starliner's next lift-off in 2025, but conditions apply | Mint**
NASA plans to launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft again in 2025, after it faced a major setback during its crewed flight test in June this year. The spacecraft carried astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore to space but returned to Earth without its crew in September. NASA is preparing for the next launch, considering lessons learned from the previous test and operational readiness. The US space agency is keeping options open for how to achieve system certification, including a potential flight in 2025. Williams and Wilmore will continue their work aboard the space station as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew. NASA looks forward to working with the Boeing team to certify Starliner for crew rotation missions to the space station, as stated by NASA. 'This determination will include considerations for incorporating Crew Flight Test lessons learned, approvals of final certification products, and operational readiness,' NASA said. The goal of NASA's Commercial Crew Program is 'safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station and low Earth orbit.'

**NASA orders up more SpaceX flights, tables Boeing’s Starliner until at least late 2025**
NASA has awarded SpaceX with the next two missions to the International Space Station, Crew-10 and Crew-11, with the latter targeting a July launch. Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which has been plagued by delays and issues, may still have a chance to fly a mission to the ISS in late 2025 if it achieves certification. NASA's Commercial Crew Program has given Boeing a path forward to correct issues with its spacecraft, but certification is still uncertain. SpaceX has already flown 15 missions to the ISS, including nine operational flights, and has earned more money from NASA with additional flights ordered. Boeing, on the other hand, has reported over $1.6 billion in losses while only getting a portion of its original contract for development costs. 'The timing and configuration of Starliner's next flight will be determined once a better understanding of Boeing's path to system certification is established,' NASA posted on its website. 'This determination will include considerations for incorporating Crew Flight Test lessons learned, approvals of final certification products, and operational readiness.'

**NASA's Last-Minute Decision: How a Contract Change Saved the Day for Astronauts**
According to Eric Berger's book Reentry, NASA was close to signing a contract with only one company, Boeing, for the Commercial Crew Program in 2014. However, a last-minute change in the contract allowed both Boeing and SpaceX to participate. The decision was influenced by Boeing's refusal to perform a critical test of the Starliner's abort system, which led to concerns about the company's offer. SpaceX's lower price and better performance in the evaluation process also played a role in the decision. As a result, NASA was able to award contracts to both companies, which ultimately led to the successful rescue of astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunni Williams, who were stranded on the ISS due to a problem with the Starliner. The Crew-9 Dragon is scheduled to return to Earth in February 2025, after an eight-month stay in space.

**How to watch SpaceX, NASA launch that will bring Starliner astronauts home in 2025**
NASA and SpaceX are targeting a Saturday launch for the Crew-9 mission, which will bring Starliner astronauts home in 2025. The mission was initially set for August 18, but was delayed due to issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. The Crew-9 astronauts, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, will spend about five months on the International Space Station conducting experiments and research. The Dragon spacecraft will separate from the Falcon 9 rocket and power on to the space station, where the crew will be welcomed aboard. NASA will provide coverage of the launch and subsequent docking, and FLORIDA TODAY will also provide live coverage. The Crew-9 mission represents the ninth crew rotation mission to the station under NASA's commercial crew program.

**Astronauts left behind by Starliner set for press conference from ISS: Timeline of space saga**
NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are set to participate in a news conference aboard the International Space Station on Friday, roughly a week after their original vessel, the Boeing Starliner, returned to Earth without them. The Starliner was deemed unreliable for transporting the astronauts back to Earth, and they will now return on a SpaceX rocket in February 2025. The Starliner's inaugural crewed mission was plagued by delays and issues, including helium leaks and misfiring thrusters. Despite the challenges, Wilmore and Williams have been working at the space station and assisting with other operations. NASA Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich says, 'We're making great progress,' but a return date for the astronauts has not yet been set.
