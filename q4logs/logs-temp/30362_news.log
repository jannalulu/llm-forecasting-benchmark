**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt Suggests Replacing Tanks with AI-Powered Drones**
Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, suggests that the US should replace outdated tanks with AI-powered drones. He made this statement at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia, citing the effectiveness of drones in the war between Russia and Ukraine. 'Give them away, buy drones instead,' Schmidt said, referring to the thousands of tanks stored in the US. He noted that a drone costing $5,000 can destroy a tank worth $5 million. Schmidt, who is also the founder of a startup creating autonomous kamikaze drones for Ukraine, emphasized that the cost of autonomy is decreasing rapidly, and that the future of war lies in drones. He expressed concern that Western military institutions are not keeping pace with the progress, but need to change their approach to corresponding technologies and defense. Schmidt believes that governments and military forces are adapting slowly, despite radical changes on the battlefield. He emphasized that the current system is 'completely unsuitable for this kind of scenario.' Ukraine is using cheap drones to counter Russia's military superiority, but other types of weapons are also needed. For example, the war between Israel and Hamas has shown a different tactic that is more suitable for a specific 'scenario' of combat operations. Schmidt left his position on the board of directors of Alphabet Inc. in 2019. He was a mediator between Silicon Valley and the US government for many years. He became the first chairman of the US Defense Innovation Advisory Board, advising top defense officials on new technologies from 2016 to 2020.

**Ex-Google boss Eric Schmidt to attend UK international investment summit**
Former Google boss Eric Schmidt will attend the Labour government's first international investment summit in London on 14 October. The summit aims to encourage a fresh injection of private money to drive the government's growth agenda. Other confirmed speakers include Ruth Porat, president of Alphabet, and Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield Asset Management. Technology is expected to be a key focus of the summit, but Tesla boss Elon Musk has not been invited due to his controversial social media posts. Schmidt said, 'When the UK hosted the first global summit on AI safety, the country displayed its commitment to being a leader in responsible innovation. Now, it has the opportunity to go even further and articulate a vision for the future where the UK is a hub for world-class talent.' Labour hopes the event will be a boost for investment in the UK two weeks before the budget on 30 October.
