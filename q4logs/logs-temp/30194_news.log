**Will Nvidia soar after Nov. 20? Evidence is piling up and it says this.**
Nvidia is expected to report its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings on Nov. 20, and the evidence suggests that the stock may soar after the report. The company has a track record of surpassing expectations and has spoken of 'insane' demand for its products. Nvidia's top GPUs are considered the best around, and the company has a broad range of products and services that make it easy for customers to access its offerings. The upcoming report represents a transition for the company as it prepares to launch its new Blackwell architecture. While some investors may see a lower growth figure as a disappointment, comments from Jensen Huang, Larry Ellison, and Elon Musk suggest that Nvidia may have a good deal of positive news to report. As a result, it's possible that the stock will rise after Nov. 20. However, it's impossible to predict short-term stock performance with 100% accuracy.

**Morning Bid: Bruised Wall Street keeps wary eye on Nvidia**
Wall Street is cautious after its worst week in 10, with concerns about interest rates, earnings, and a potential global trade war. Nvidia, the world's largest company by market value, is expected to post net income of $18.4 billion and revenue of $33 billion, but its shares took a 2% hit after reports of problems with its new Blackwell AI chips. Despite this, stock index futures are trying to recover from last week's losses, and the broader earnings season has beaten estimates with 9% aggregate annual profit growth. However, next year's growth estimates are being pared back, with full-year S&P500 profit growth forecasts dropping to 14%. The Treasury market has steadied, with 10-year yields remaining below 4.5%, and futures pricing shows a 60% chance of further easing in December. President-elect Donald Trump has not proposed names for the top economic posts, but has added former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and billionaire Marc Rowan to the list of candidates to become his Treasury secretary.

**Will Nvidia Soar After Nov. 20? The Evidence is Piling up and it Says This.**
Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to report its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings on Nov. 20. The company has a track record of surpassing expectations and has spoken of 'insane' demand for its products. Nvidia's top GPUs are considered the best around, and the company sells a broad range of products and services for AI needs. The upcoming report represents a transition for the company as it prepares to launch its new Blackwell architecture. Despite some investors' concerns about lower growth figures, evidence points to positive stock performance following the earnings report. Comments from Jensen Huang, Larry Ellison, and Elon Musk support the idea of high demand for Nvidia's products. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the company that manufactures Nvidia's chips, reported double-digit revenue growth for this latest quarter. As a result, it's possible the stock will rise after Nov. 20, but even if it doesn't, Nvidia stock still has plenty of room to run over time due to its market leadership, financial strength, and ongoing innovation.

**Will Nvidia Be a $5 Trillion Stock by 2028? | The Motley Fool**
Nvidia, the world's largest company by market cap, is expected to continue its impressive growth, with earnings expected to grow at an annual rate of 57% over the next five years. The company's profit margin has increased significantly since 2023, and it enjoys a dominant market share of 95% in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market. Nvidia's pricing power is due to its ability to charge a premium for its H100 AI GPUs, which are in high demand. The company is expected to launch its Blackwell series of AI GPUs, which will be 4 times faster than its current Hopper chips and will likely be priced between $50,000 and $70,000. Assuming Nvidia's earnings grow at a conservative rate of 20% in fiscal years 2028 and 2029, its stock price could jump to $214, sending its market cap to $5 trillion.

**Will Nvidia Be a $5 Trillion Stock by 2028?**
Nvidia has recently become the world's largest company by market cap, overtaking Apple. The chipmaker's impressive growth is driven by the robust demand for its AI chip systems.

The company's pricing power is a key factor in its success, with a dominant market share of 95% in AI graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia's profit margin is significantly higher than its rivals, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, and the company is expected to maintain its pricing power with the launch of its Blackwell series of AI GPUs, which will reportedly be 4 times faster than its current Hopper chips. Assuming a conservative earnings growth rate of 20% in fiscal years 2028 and 2029, Nvidia's stock price could jump to $214 by then, sending its market cap to $5 trillion.

**Nvidia Surpasses Apple in Market Capitalization, Awaits Quarterly Results**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization, becoming the largest listed company in the world. The company is expected to announce its quarterly results on November 20, which will determine the continuation of the market's upward trend. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia's performance, with some predicting a net profit of $17.495 million, which would be the company's highest quarterly profit ever. This would represent an 89% improvement over the same period last year. Nvidia's strong performance in the gaming segment, driven by the demand for PC games, is expected to be a major driver of revenue, offsetting the decline in OEM sales. The company's solid performance in the automotive and commercial segments is also expected to continue. For the full year 2024, Nvidia's net profit is expected to reach $68.616 million, a 144% increase over the historic figure of 2023. Analysts also predict that the company's net profit will exceed $100 billion in just two years, making it one of the five companies in the world to achieve this milestone by 2026. As one analyst from JP Morgan noted, 'We expect Nvidia to continue to perform well across all segments, with strong demand for PC games driving revenue, offsetting the decline in OEM sales. We are also encouraged by the solid performance in the automotive and commercial segments. We expect a significant increase in the stock price, leading to our overweight rating.'

This could potentially put Nvidia back in the top spot as the world's largest capitalized company, surpassing Apple. The US has not yet switched to winter time, unlike Europe, so Wall Street will open at 2:30 PM and close at 9:00 PM French time this week. This week's economic calendar includes the release of the Dallas Fed's October manufacturing index, the balance of international trade in goods for September, and the Case-Shiller and FHFA housing price indices for August.

**Nvidia market cap closing in on $3.5 trillion: Will it surpass Apple soon?**
Nvidia's market capitalization is closing in on $3.5 trillion, with the company adding over $3 trillion since the AI boom began in late 2022. Nvidia's dominance in the AI market is due to its superior technology, with its chips being 25 times more profitable than its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. The company is committed to updating its chips every year, and its new Blackwell chips are already in high demand, with analysts projecting $10 billion in added revenue before the end of the year. Meanwhile, Apple is experiencing growing pains, with reports of less-than-stellar sales of its latest iPhone model. As a result, Nvidia is expected to pull ahead and take the lead position in the race for the world's largest market cap.

**Will Nvidia Be a $10 Trillion Stock by 2029?**
Nvidia's market capitalization has tripled three times in the past six years, and the company is on the verge of tripling its market cap again. With a current market cap of $3.2 trillion, Nvidia is one of the largest companies in the world. The company's end markets are growing rapidly, with AI chip demand expected to rise 33% in 2024 and 20% annually over the next five years. Nvidia has a stranglehold on the market with an estimated 88% share of GPU spending. Wall Street analysts are forecasting 52.5% annual sales growth for Nvidia over the next five years. While Nvidia's premium valuation is high, the company's rapid growth may justify it. If Nvidia lives up to analysts' expectations, the company could report $794 billion in revenue by 2029 and approach a $10 trillion market cap.
