With its confirmed opening date, Jackson Hole is shaping up to be a top destination for snow enthusiasts.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 07:49 PM\nSource:[diariouno.com.ar](https://www.diariouno.com.ar/nieve/estados-unidos-jackson-hole-calienta-motores-y-arranca-el-29-noviembre-n1363219)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Biden has promised a peaceful transition and has been working tirelessly to achieve his goals, taking advantage of the media attention focused on Trump. However, his power is limited, and he has become a 'lame duck' president with reduced influence due to the proximity of Trump's arrival. Biden's team is working on several measures to strengthen Ukraine's position before Trump takes over, including sending $9 billion in approved but undelivered military aid to Ukraine and authorizing the use of ATACMS missiles against Russian targets. The goal is to fortify Ukraine's position in any future negotiations with Russia. Biden also wants to use his remaining time to broker a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and secure the release of Israeli hostages. He is maintaining intense diplomatic efforts with Egypt and Qatar, key mediators, and has met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the White House. Additionally, Biden wants to consolidate his legacy on climate change, saying 'History is watching us.' His team is working to finalize a 'clean fuel credit' regulation, which would provide tax incentives for companies producing low-emission fuels for aviation and other transportation. The Biden administration also plans to publish a study on the environmental and economic impact of liquefied natural gas. Furthermore, Biden wants to finalize a regulation to cancel student loans for people with economic difficulties. However, the Department of Education has a limited timeframe to complete this process, which normally takes months, but now must be completed in weeks and may face legal challenges. Finally, the White House is accelerating efforts to confirm as many judges as possible before the Senate, currently controlled by Democrats, passes to Republican hands on January 3. Trump has urged Republicans to block these efforts, saying 'They shouldn't approve judges during this period.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 06:32 PM\nSource:[El Nuevo Día](https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/estados-unidos/notas/joe-biden-en-contra-del-reloj-que-quiere-conseguir-en-sus-ultimos-60-dias-en-la-casa-blanca/)\n\n**Biden has become notably quiet after the 2024 election and Democrats’ loss**\nPresident Joe Biden has been notably quiet since the Democrats' loss in the 2024 election, with his only public discussion of the outcome being a six-minute speech in the Rose Garden two days after the election. Biden's silence has been met with a new reality: America and the rest of the world is already moving on. 'His race is over. His day is done,' said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser in the Obama-Biden White House. Biden's allies say the president is privately processing the election defeat, but Biden hasn't been vocally introspective about his role in the loss. Biden's insistence on following electoral traditions, such as ensuring an orderly transition and inviting Trump to the White House, is seen as important, but his public silence has left a vacuum. 'The last time a president left office so irrelevant or rejected by the populace was Jimmy Carter,' said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis. 'History has allowed for the great rehabilitation of Carter, in part, because of all he did in his post-presidency. At 82, I'm not sure Biden has the luxury of time.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 11:51 PM\nSource:[fourstateshomepage.com](https://www.fourstateshomepage.com/news/politics/ap-biden-has-become-notably-quiet-after-the-2024-election-and-democrats-loss/)\n\n**Looking back at the life and presidency of Joe Biden**\nAs Joe Biden prepares to leave the White House, his long career has been marked by numerous ups and downs. Biden was first named president on January 20, 2021, after one of the most publicized and nerve-racking presidential elections in US history. His presidency has been controversial, particularly due to his unyielding support of Israel and the war on Gaza. However, Biden's trials and tribulations did not begin in 2021. As he marks his 82nd birthday, here's a glimpse into his career, family history, and his life before the White House.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 09:30 AM\nSource:[starsinsider.com](https://www.starsinsider.com/celebrity/452409/looking-back-at-the-life-and-presidency-of-joe-biden)\n\n**Trump may review Biden's decision on strikes inside Russia with US missiles**\nA member of Donald Trump's transition team stated that Trump may review Joe Biden's decision to authorize the use of US-supplied long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. 'I suspect most everything will be under review,' the team member said. Trump's inauguration is set for January 20, 2025, and until then, Biden remains the president.

The character of the military aid, particularly the provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine, will not change. Ayzenberg is confident that the Biden administration will not allow Ukraine to strike targets deep in Russia with American weapons, as this could lead to a nuclear attack by Russia. The expert expects that the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump will have a different policy towards Europe and Ukraine, which may lead to a decrease in support for Ukraine. Ayzenberg also notes that the position of the European Union on Ukraine will be influenced by the upcoming elections in European countries, which may lead to a shift to the right and a decrease in support for Ukraine. However, he also mentions that there are some exceptions among European politicians, such as the President of Poland Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni, who support Ukraine despite being from right-wing parties.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 10:51 AM\nSource:[uatv.ua](https://uatv.ua/uspeet-li-administratsiya-ssha-do-kontsa-kadentsii-predostavit-ukraine-ranee-vydelennuyu-pomoshh-mnenie-ajzenberga/)\n\n**Biden Meets with Trump to Discuss Transfer of Power**\nUS President Joe Biden is meeting with his successor, Donald Trump, at the White House to discuss the transfer of power. This is a tradition in the US for a peaceful transfer of power, which Trump himself refused four years ago. Trump still refuses to acknowledge his loss to Biden in the 2020 election. The meeting is also expected to include a discussion with top Republicans in Congress, as Trump's party has secured a majority in the Senate and is likely to dominate the House of Representatives in the next two years. According to Congressman Tom Emmer, 'I expect him to make a big statement today, something like a cabinet address, to prepare everyone for what's coming in January.' Trump's inauguration is scheduled for January 20, 2025. He will be accompanied by billionaire Elon Musk, who will also serve as an advisor to a new government efficiency agency. This is seen as unusual by observers, as Trump announced Musk's planned appointment just two days ago.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 04:04 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Jetzt-live-Biden-empfaengt-Trump-im-Weissen-Haus-article25359727.html)\n\n**Joe Biden to Welcome Donald Trump to the White House for Transition Meeting**\nUS President Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House to initiate the transition of power. Despite Trump's team not signing the necessary documents, the meeting is designed to show a smooth transition between the two governments. Trump won the presidential election on November 5, 2024, with over 270 electoral votes, and will become the 47th President of the US on January 20, 2025. According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, 'He believes in the norms, believes in our institution, believes in the peaceful transfer of power. That's what it's supposed to be.' This is a traditional courtesy that outgoing presidents extend to their successors, which Trump did not do to Biden in 2020 when he won.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[mdzol.com](https://www.mdzol.com/mundo/2024/11/13/joe-biden-recibe-donald-trump-en-la-casa-blanca-para-iniciar-la-transicion-1166092.html)\n\n**'Joe Biden Charged To Resign, Hand Over To Harris As First Female President'**\nSimmons suggested that President Joe Biden should resign and hand over the presidency to Kamala Harris, citing Biden's promise to be a transitional figure. This proposal comes after the recent U.S. presidential election, in which Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris. Trump is set to be inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States in January 2025. Simmons's suggestion reflects ongoing discussions within the Democratic Party about leadership transitions and the party's future direction. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has denied a report that President-elect Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine conflict, with Putin's Press Secretary calling the report 'completely false information'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 10:45 AM\nSource:[Naija News](https://www.naijanews.com/2024/11/11/joe-biden-charged-to-resign-hand-over-to-harris-as-first-female-president/)\n\n**Kamala's ex-aide suggests Biden step down, making her first female US Prez**\nJamal Simmons, a former aide to Kamala Harris, has suggested that President Joe Biden should step down and allow Harris to assume the presidency until January 20, 2025, when Donald Trump takes office. Simmons argued that this move would disrupt Trump's momentum and spare Harris the responsibility of overseeing the certification of Trump's victory in Congress on January 6. According to Simmons, 'Joe Biden has been a remarkable president, fulfilling many of his promises. However, there's one final promise he could still keep: serving as a transitional figure.' This proposal comes amid internal criticism of Biden from Democratic figures, who claim his leadership may have contributed to Harris's loss in the election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 06:15 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/biden-should-resign-says-kamala-s-ex-aide-so-she-can-be-1st-woman-us-prez-124111100403_1.html)\n\n**Former Harris Communications Director Calls on Biden to Resign and Make Harris President**\nJamal Simmons, the former communications director for Kamala Harris, has called on President Joe Biden to resign and be replaced by Harris as the 47th President of the United States. Simmons praised Biden as 'exceptional' but noted that there is one promise left to fulfill, which is for Biden to step down and make Harris the President. This would allow Harris to avoid overseeing the transition of power on January 6, 2025, after their expected loss in the 2024 US elections. Simmons said that this move would dominate the headlines at a time when Democrats need to learn about transparency and doing things that the public wants to see. He added that this is the right moment for Democrats to change their perspective on how they operate. Simmons also emphasized that Democrats need to understand that the old rules no longer apply, and that Americans respond to drama and excitement.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 12:33 AM\nSource:[elwatannews.com](https://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/7673112)\n\n**Biden's 'Lame Duck' Session: Will the US Cause Problems for Russia Before Leaving Office?**\nUS President Joe Biden's administration may try to cause problems for Russia before he leaves office, according to political analyst Malik Dudakov. Maria Zakharova, the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, previously stated that the outgoing administration may 'goad' Russia before leaving the White House. Zakharova noted that the outgoing administration has a few months left and can 'goad' Russia during this time. Dudakov explained that the period when the outgoing president is transitioning power is called the 'session of the lame duck,' but the US has deviated from this tradition due to the current division in the country and the Democrats' rejection of it. Therefore, Dudakov believes that the administration may try to create some problems for Russia. The administration is also trying to quickly spend the remaining funds allocated for Ukraine. 'In the near future, the Congress will try to 'drag' some new aid packages for Ukraine for 2025, while the old Congress is still in place until the beginning of January 2025. They will also try to make some diplomatic gestures regarding Ukraine, such as long-range missiles, so that the next president would have less space for maneuver,' said Dudakov. However, political analyst Konstantin Blyukher believes that there is no need to expect serious problems from the Biden administration. 'If something serious is to be done, it needs to have a time buffer. In two months, it is impossible to do something of such scale. It is only possible to make some small provocations. Moreover, all world elites, American and European, are waiting for Trump. Even though he has not arrived, he is already putting pressure on them,' said Blyukher.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 03:55 PM\nSource:[Новости России, СНГ и мира - ИА REGNUM](https://regnum.ru/news/3928545)\n\n**US Election: Biden, Trump Set To Meet At White House On Wednesday**\nPresident Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday to facilitate a smooth transition of power.

Trump won the election on Tuesday. According to a statement by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, 'By invitation of President Biden, President Biden and President-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. (5:00 p.m. in the Spanish Peninsula)'. The meeting will be the first time the two have been in the same room since the presidential debate on June 29, 2024. Biden has invited Trump to the White House to discuss the transition of power and to 'lower the temperature' of the US political climate. Trump has accepted the invitation and has already begun to assemble his transition team, which includes allies, friends, and family members. The transition of power in the US is a well-established procedure that begins a year before the presidential election, but takes shape when a president-elect is declared. The goal is to have the new administration up and running smoothly when the new president takes office on January 20, 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 05:55 PM\nSource:[elpais.com](https://elpais.com/internacional/elecciones-usa/2024-11-09/biden-recibira-a-trump-el-miercoles-en-la-casa-blanca-para-el-traspaso-de-poder.html)\n\n**What's in Store for Donald Trump Before Inauguration: A Potential Storm in the Capitol**\nAs the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution dictates, Joe Biden will remain in office until January 20, 2025, when Donald Trump will be inaugurated. During this transition period, Biden will continue to make key decisions, including appointing ambassadors, judges, and ministers, and issuing executive orders. However, these decisions can be blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress after January 3, when the new Congress is sworn in. According to Valerie Boyd, director of the Center for Presidential Transition, each government agency has prepared materials for Trump's team, outlining existing problems and potential priorities. Trump, meanwhile, is forming his future team and has already begun consulting with advisors. He has promised to appoint loyalists to key positions, including those on the second tier. The real test of Trump's intentions will come after January 20. In the past, Trump has made promises and proposals, but it was only after taking office that his true actions became clear. This time, Trump may avoid repeating the mistakes of his previous presidency, including the scandal surrounding Michael Flynn's unauthorized contact with the Russian ambassador in 2016. The coming weeks will show whether the transfer of power in the US will proceed smoothly or if the losing side has planned a surprise for the 47th president. A 'People's March on Washington' is planned for January 18, 2025, with over 50,000 participants expected to express their dissatisfaction with the election results. The storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters in 2021 may seem like a minor incident compared to what may come next.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 01:10 PM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27658.5/5008651/)\n\n**Joe Biden's Presidency to End in 2025**\nJoe Biden's presidency is coming to an end as he will transfer power to the newly elected president in a few months. Although Biden initially announced his re-election as a Democratic president, he has since withdrawn his candidacy and Kamala Harris has taken his place. However, the US electorate favored Donald Trump in the elections, who received 295 electoral votes. Biden's term will end on January 20, 2025, and Trump will take office, along with J.D.

He joined Sun Microsystems in 1983 as Chief Technical Officer and CEO, where he contributed to the development and dissemination of the Java programming language. In 1997, he became President and CEO of Novell. In 2001, he joined Google as President and CEO, where he played a key role in management, strategy, and technological expertise. He also shared responsibility for Google's daily operations with co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. In 2006, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for his work on Google's Internet strategies. He also joined Apple's Board of Directors in 2006, where he served alongside Steve Jobs and Al Gore. However, in August 2009, he was forced to resign from Apple's Board of Directors due to potential conflicts of interest between Apple and Google, particularly in the mobile phone sector. Schmidt was an informal advisor to Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign and later became a member of the President's Council on Science and Technology.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 11:15 AM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/ALPHABET-INC-24203373/actualite/L-ex-PDG-d-Alphabet-et-le-president-participeront-a-un-sommet-sur-l-investissement-au-Royaume-Uni-48014045/)\n\n**Billionaire Who Claimed Global Warming Would Kill Us All Discovers Something More Important**\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who previously warned that climate change would 'kill us all' in 2022, now believes that climate goals are 'too lofty to reach' and that investing in AI infrastructure is a more pressing concern. Schmidt, who has founded a defense company that develops AI-powered drones, stated that 'we're not going to hit the climate goals anyway because we're not organized to do it.' This shift in focus from climate change to AI has raised questions about Schmidt's motivations and priorities, with some suggesting that his interests in AI-powered drones and mega-yachts may be taking precedence over environmental concerns. As Schmidt himself said in 2022, 'If we don't address climate change, we really will be toast,' but it seems that his priorities have changed since then. 'We really are putting the jeopardy of our grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren at risk,' he warned, but now it appears that he is more focused on the potential profits of AI technology. 'AI is pretty cool and profitable,' he seems to be saying, and it's clear that his priorities have shifted from saving the planet to making a profit.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 04:58 AM\nSource:[FrontPage Magazine](https://www.frontpagemag.com/billionaire-who-claimed-global-warming-would-kill-us-all-discovers-something-more-important)\n\n**Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt: AI's Growing Needs Will Outpace Climate Goals**\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt has called for increased investment in AI infrastructure, despite ambitious climate goals. According to Schmidt, these goals will never be achieved due to the rapid development of AI, which requires massive computational power and energy consumption. McKinsey estimates that data center energy consumption will increase to 35 gigawatts by 2030, compared to 17 gigawatts in 2022. The Biden administration aims to make the energy sector carbon-neutral by 2035 and the US economy by 2050. At the Washington AI summit, Schmidt stated that even with more efficient batteries and energy grids, AI's growing needs will surpass possible measures to reduce its environmental impact. He believes that AI's challenges require prioritization, even if it means compromising on environmental goals, saying, 'Своих климатических целей компания все равно никогда не добьется' ('The company will never achieve its climate goals'). \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 04:45 AM\nSource:[Рамблер/финансы](https://finance.rambler.ru/business/53534793-svoih-klimaticheskih-tseley-kompaniya-vse-ravno-nikogda-ne-dobetsya-eks-glava-google-prizval-uvelichit-chislo-ii-data-tsentrov/)\n\n**Ex-Google boss Eric Schmidt to attend UK international investment summit**\nFormer Google boss Eric Schmidt will attend the Labour government's first international investment summit in London on 14 October.

According to historical Bankrate data, the average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate was 6.96% on January 3, 2024. It dropped to 6.84% by the end of the month, but then ticked up to 7.13% in February. Rates fluctuated throughout the year, with a notable drop to 6.15% on September 18, a 2-year low, ahead of the official Fed rate cut. However, since then, rates have been on an upward trend, hitting 7% on November 6. As of November 20, the rate was 6.91%, just five basis points lower than January's rate. The potential for rates to increase again in 2025 is strong, with factors like inflation, unemployment, and the 10-year Treasury yield all playing a role. It's essential to check mortgage interest rates daily for opportunities to capitalize on a lower rate when it's available.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 07:03 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-far-have-mortgage-interest-rates-fallen-in-2024/)\n\n**US yields rise, Fed policy in focus**\nUS Treasury yields rose on Wednesday, with benchmark 10-year yields consolidating near a five-month high. Investors are waiting for clarity on President-elect Donald Trump's policies and upcoming jobs and inflation data to inform Federal Reserve policy. A strong November jobs report could add to bets that the Fed is nearing a rate cutting pause. Traders are pricing in a 59% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December and a 15% chance of another cut in January. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes steepened by 1 basis point to 12 basis points. The Treasury Department will sell $16 billion in 20-year bonds and $17 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities this week.

The 30-year-fixed rate has increased from 6.86% a week earlier, and overall mortgage loan application volume has ticked up by 1.7% on a weekly basis. Andrew Krei, co-chief investment officer for Crescent Grove Advisors, attributes the rise in mortgage rates to the increase in 10-year Treasury yields since the Federal Reserve began slashing interest rates. He notes that the bond market is signaling risks around growth and inflation, which filters into the mortgage market. Despite the Federal Open Market Committee's interest rate cuts, mortgage rates have reversed their decline and are expected to remain high due to a lack of housing supply and sticky inflation in the shelter sector.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 02:09 PM\nSource:[Quartz](https://qz.com/mortgage-rates-inflation-fed-interest-cuts-treasury-1851702621)\n\n**Daily Spotlight: Yield Curve Returns to Normal Slope**\nThe yield curve has returned to its normal upward-sloping shape after almost two years of inversion, according to recent data. This change has significant implications for bond investors and the economic outlook. The yield curve's shift is attributed to positive U.S. economic trends, a decrease in deflation fears, and the Federal Reserve's ability to lower short-term rates. As a result, rates at the long end of the yield curve have increased, and the curve is expected to continue steepening in the next few quarters. As one might expect, this change has led to a decrease in the gap between fed funds and core PCE, allowing the Fed to focus on pushing inflation back toward 2.0%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/research/reports/ARGUS_41880_MarketOutlook_1732103909000)\n\n**Russian Government Bond Index (RGBI) Falls Below 100 Points**\nThe Russian Government Bond Index (RGBI) has fallen below 100 points for the first time since November 13, 2024, after four trading sessions above 100 points. The index has decreased by 0,77% and is currently trading at 99,92 points, according to data from 10:20 Moscow time. Igor Galaktionov, an analyst at Alfa-Investments, believes that the correction in long-term OFZs is logical in light of new data on inflation expectations. 'Expectations remain at the level of October: 13.4% is the maximum since the beginning of the year. The Central Bank representative once again mentioned that for the resumption of disinflation, additional tightening of monetary conditions is required. This means that the probability of another key rate hike at the December meeting is growing,' he added. The inverted yield curve of OFZs continues to show higher yields for short-term and medium-term bonds compared to longer-term bonds. The highest yield on the market (21.52-21.55% per annum) is offered by the shortest issues - up to six months. Longer issues with maturity up to two years offer a yield of 20.62-21.44%, while the longest OFZs with a 30-year maturity offer a yield of 14.13% per annum.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 07:35 AM\nSource:[rbc.ru](https://www.rbc.ru/quote/news/article/673c3b9f9a7947cba9700ac9?from=short_news)\n\n**US long-dated yields dip as investors consolidate positions ahead...**\nUS Treasury yields fell on the long end of the curve on Friday as investors consolidated positions ahead of a long weekend, following Republican Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The 10-year yield dropped 2.7 basis points to 4.316%, while the 30-year yield fell 5.7 basis points to 4.486%. This was the largest weekly drop for both yields since early September. Analysts attribute the decline to 'buy the rumor, sell the fact' event, where investors sold Treasuries before the election and then bought them back after the outcome was known. Additionally, the cooler-than-expected one-year inflation print and the Fed's decision to lower the fed funds target rate also contributed to the decline. Rate futures have priced in one rate cut in December and two in 2025. 'The market has done a very good job of anticipating the outcome and pricing them in,' said Brendan Murphy, head of fixed income at Insight Investment.

Two recession indicators, the inverted yield curve and the Sahm Rule, have been proven wrong. The inverted yield curve, which typically signals a slowing economy, has been inverted since 2022 but has not led to a recession. The Sahm Rule, which suggests that a recession is imminent if the unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point, also failed to predict a recession. Instead, the US economy has continued to grow, driven by productivity gains and central bank and government stimulus. Economists credit the stimulus, including near-zero interest rates and massive bond-purchase programs, with helping the countries bounce back from downturns.

This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve or negative yield curve, is often considered a main indicator of an impending recession. According to experts, this situation reflects an underlying belief among investors that short-term interest rates are about to fall, driving down the yield on long-term debt. In the United States, an inverted yield curve has preceded almost all recent recessions, with the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic. The onset of the pandemic saw stock markets crash, leading to a surge in government debt purchases, resulting in negative yields for many countries. However, investors calculated that the small loss on stable bonds was less than the losses likely to occur on the market, and that the bonds may be sold at an even higher price if conditions continue to deteriorate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 05:40 PM\nSource:[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255573/inverted-government-bonds-yields-curves-worldwide/)\n\n**Laufzeiten-ETFs: How to Secure High Yields**\nThe normalcy returned to the German bond market on a Monday in September.

A fundamentals-based explanation**\nProf. Menzie Chinn at Econbrowser proposed supplementing the yield curve with the private nonfinancial debt service ratio to improve recession forecasting. However, the author of this post is concerned about the 'just so' nature of this indicator and instead offers a fundamentals-based explanation for why the inverted yield curve has failed to predict a recession. The author suggests that the traditional explanation for the inverted yield curve, which is based on banks tightening lending conditions, may not be accurate in today's economy. Instead, the author points to supply chain tightness and the interest earned by banks on their Fed reserve deposits as key factors. The author notes that the supply chain index has returned to normal, leading to a sharp shift in the supply curve and a decline in commodity prices. Additionally, the interest earned by banks on their Fed reserve deposits has been higher than their CD rates, making it less likely for banks to tighten lending conditions. The author concludes that the inverted yield curve has failed to predict a recession because of these economic fundamentals and provides testable predictions for the future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2024 05:07 PM\nSource:[angrybearblog.com](https://angrybearblog.com/2024/10/why-has-the-inverted-yield-curve-failed-a-fundamentals-based-explanation)\n\n**Investing in Turbulent Times**\nAs the European Central Bank (BCE) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) begin to lower interest rates, the second half of 2024 is expected to bring a return to normalcy in the yield curve. After years of flat or inverted yield curves, it's essential to remember that a positive-sloping curve is the norm. The recent decline in interest rates and contained inflation have led to the US 10-year debt paying more than the 2-year debt, a phenomenon not seen since July 2022. This means that lending money for longer periods should offer higher returns, which is the norm, but not what we're accustomed to. The journey from negative interest rates to a positive-sloping curve has not been easy for asset managers, but it has also presented many opportunities for investment. The recent market fluctuations have affected not only fixed-income assets but also equities, particularly in sectors dependent on long-term growth expectations, such as technology. As the year comes to a close, volatility is expected, which will create opportunities that must be seized. To maximize these opportunities, it's essential to stay close to the market. The rotation in our portfolios, whether by increasing the percentage allocated to fixed income or variable income, or by moving within these categories, has added extra points of return to our portfolios. However, for a traditional investor, it's challenging to dedicate the time and resources needed to navigate the complex market landscape, especially considering the behavioral biases we all face. To address this, it's essential to know when to enter and exit the market, as well as the optimal allocation to different sectors and asset types, without forgetting the return of mixed portfolios to take advantage of the bond-bond disconnection, which will allow us to assume exposure to variable income while mitigating volatility.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 12:19 AM\nSource:[elespanol.com](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/opinion/20241022/invertir-tiempos-revueltos/895280472_12.html)\n\n**USA:  leading indicators in September**\nThe Conference Board's composite index of leading indicators for the US economy fell by 0.5% in September, exceeding expectations.

Historically, this has been a reliable indicator of a recession in the US. However, some economists argue that this time may be different, citing the strong stock market and the Fed's efforts to maintain a 'good' economy. Gary Shilling, a well-known economist, believes in the predictive power of the yield curve, but warns that the recent inversion does not necessarily mean a severe recession. Others, like David Rosenberg, think that a recession is likely and that the yield curve is a reliable indicator. The disagreement among economists is reflected in the different yield curves that are being watched, with some focusing on the 2-year vs 10-year bond yield and others on the 3-month vs 10-year bond yield. The Goldman Sachs investment strategy team is watching four different yield curves, but does not consider a recession to be the base scenario. 'The question is whether the inversion is due to the Fed's plan for a soft landing or is the Fed just behind the curve?' asks Brett Nelson of Goldman Sachs. The reasons for this time being different include the severity of the inflation caused by the pandemic, the tech bubble in 2000, and the Chinese and Japanese markets in 2006. 'The history casts a long shadow. Ironically, the problem is that people continue to think about the historical shadow of the inverted yield curve rather than paying attention to the short-term dynamics,' says Fred Carstensen, an economic historian at the University of Connecticut. While economists debate, investors must put their money to work hoping that their failure will not be too severe, whichever side is right. 'The recession has been delayed, but no, we don't think it will be avoided,' says Bryan Whalen, chief investment officer of the asset management company TCW. 'If we make a mistake and we have a soft landing, there is not much room for upside – credit spreads are 'tight'. If we are right, it will be a big gain for us. These are good odds'.\nOriginal language: el\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 06:11 AM\nSource:[euro2day.gr](https://www.euro2day.gr/ftcom/ftcom_gr/article-ft-gr/2264333/omologa-shma-gia-yfesh-stelnei-h-kampylh-ton-apodo.html)\n\n**The yield curve dilemma: Inflation, investor caution and the prospect of rate cuts**\nIndia's yield curve has experienced significant shifts in recent years, driven by factors such as rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), geopolitical tensions, and global investor sentiment.

However, with inflation moderating, speculation is growing around potential rate cuts to ease investor caution and restore a more typical yield curve. Mansi Kariya, co-fund manager at PPFAS AMC, notes that if inflation continues to stabilize below 4%, it would pave the way for the RBI to consider reducing interest rates, potentially leading to a return to an upward-sloping yield curve and stronger economic conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 05:59 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/yield-curve-bonds-maturities-jp-morgan-global-bond-index-reserve-bank-of-india-rbi-rate-hikes-inflation-investor-caution-11728040874615.html)\n\n**Market Risk Is Building Despite the Yield Curve Un-Inverting**\nThe market risk is building despite the yield curve un-inverting, which some may see as a sign that a recession is unlikely. However, history suggests that it's not the inversion that kills the boom, but the subsequent steepener. The author notes that the setup projects an epic heartbreak for those who have been FOMO-ing (fear of missing out) and MOMO-ing (momentum following momentum) the market, thinking that the yield curve un-inversion eliminates the recession signal. The author emphasizes the importance of being aware of the risk signals and accepting that risk, as the clock is ticking and past facts of history may extrapolate to a coming fact of realized risk. The author also mentions that they are watching events closely and have been compelled to lean bullish all year long, but are now expecting rotations to include commodity and resources related areas.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2024 07:35 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-risk-is-building-despite-the-yield-curve-uninverting-200652413)\n\n**'Phenomenal' receptivity: Canada's high-yield bond market is suddenly the hottest in years**\nCanada's high-yield debt market is experiencing a surge in activity, with companies raising around $9.8 billion through non-investment-grade debt sales so far this year, the second-fastest pace of issuance in Bloomberg records. This trend is driven by relatively cheap funding and investors looking to lock in coupons before central bank monetary policy easing takes hold. Sean St. John, executive vice-president and managing director at National Bank Financial, stated, 'Investor receptivity has been phenomenal.' Companies are taking advantage of the low funding costs and inverted yield curve to term out short-dated bank debt into the high-yield market. High-yield coupons have compressed so much that they've become relatively competitive with bank loan pricing, making it an attractive option for issuers. For buyers, the enthusiasm comes from expectations that interest rates have peaked and the time to lock in yield is now.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 07:38 PM\nSource:[EIN News](https://world.einnews.com/article_detail/747347403/_8ueACCAprc78TuT)\n\n**A Recession Might Be Closer Than You Think**\nThe S&P 500 Index has been making new highs, but a recession might be closer than you think. The yield curve, a reliable gauge of recessions, inverted back in 2022, but we haven't seen a recession yet. The author's twist on this metric is to look at the yield curve's un-inversion, which has preceded past recessions. The curve has officially un-inverted, and long-term yields have remained higher than short-term yields over the past couple of weeks. Historically, stocks don't necessarily plummet right away after a yield un-inversion, but returns are not great five to 10 months later. The author advises having an exit plan in place for when the tide inevitably turns and holding cash to buy great companies on the cheap when the markets do plunge. A Wall Street veteran, Marc Chaikin, also sees warning signs in the market and has created a tool to help everyday investors figure out which sectors will outperform and which ones will be crushed once this shift in the market begins.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[Stansberry Research](https://stansberryresearch.com/articles/a-recession-might-be-closer-than-you-think)\n\n**Janus Henderson Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF Q2 2024 Commentary**\nThe Janus Henderson Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (JMBS) experienced a volatile quarter due to changing expectations for future rate cuts. Despite this, the ETF's performance was positive, with a 0.23% return at NAV and 0.32% return at market price. The Bloomberg U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index returned 0.07%. The manager believes that the overall level of rate volatility is likely to decrease once the Fed starts cutting rates, which should be positive for the MBS market. They also expect the inverted yield curve to normalize, which has historically been positive for agency MBS. The manager's strategic overweight to higher-coupon bonds and allocation to non-agency mortgages with strong fundamentals contributed to the ETF's performance. They anticipate origination to remain muted in the near term due to high mortgage rates, but believe the supply outlook for MBS is positive and should provide support to spread levels. The manager also expects lower prepayment rates due to the Federal Housing Finance Agency's approval of Freddie Mac's second-lien program. As the economy gradually slows, the manager believes that the Fed will start cutting rates, which will be positive for fixed income markets. They recommend adding duration to MBS to provide defensive characteristics for portfolios if economic growth slows more than expected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 01:30 PM\nSource:[Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722968-janus-henderson-mortgage-backed-securities-etf-q2-2024-commentary)\n\n**Will the ECB be forced to follow the Fed?**\nThe Eurozone economy is faltering, with weak PMI data for France and Germany, increasing the chance of a recession in Germany. The German yield curve dis-inverted, indicating investors are concerned about the European economy and expect the ECB to cut interest rates faster than initially thought. The market now sees a 40% chance of an October rate cut from the ECB, up from 25% on Friday. French bond yields are also showing signs of strain, with the spread vs. Germany widening. The ECB may be forced to follow the Fed's lead and cut interest rates more aggressively to protect the European economy from a harsh downturn. The euro is the second worst performing currency in the G10 FX space, and EUR/GBP has plunged to its lowest level since 2022, with a break below £0.8350 potentially leading to a deeper decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 01:43 PM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/will-the-ecb-be-forced-to-follow-the-fed-202409231343)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The production disruption led to a slump in deliveries and a wider-than-expected adjusted EBITDA loss of $760 million. Despite this, management reaffirmed its forecast of 47,000 to 49,000 production units and deliveries between 50,500 and 52,000. However, management revised its 2024 EBITDA loss to a range between $2.825 billion and $2.875 billion. Two reasons to believe Rivian can still achieve gross profit margins in the fourth quarter are improvements in variable costs and regulatory credits, which will boost results by $275 million in Q4 alone. Investors should temper their expectations, as progress may not be in a straight line, and 2025 may be a mix of quarterly gross profits and losses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 10:30 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

If Rivian confidently states it has enough capital to get to 2027 while still investing for future growth, it will likely boost the stock.

However, it's too early to do so, as the company has several projects and programs that are just getting started, which will help move the needle for the company's top and bottom line. These include a pre-owned sales program, expansion of the RCV line, a joint venture deal with Volkswagen, and a product pipeline that includes the highly anticipated R2 crossover, R3, and R3X. The company's stock will continue to be high risk and speculative for the foreseeable future, but investors should be patient and willing to accept the swings in stock price.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2024 10:30 PM\nSource:[fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/26/tempted-to-give-up-on-rivian-heres-why-its-way-too/)\n\n**A Little Good News for Rivian Investors | The Motley Fool**\nRivian Automotive has launched a pre-owned vehicle sales program for its R1T and R1S models, which could be a significant revenue stream for the company. This move follows in the footsteps of Tesla, which started a pre-owned program in 2015. According to Edmunds senior analyst Ivan Drury, 'It's almost mandatory if you want to be taken seriously... For consumers testing the waters on brands they've never had experience with, you want as many things as possible that inspire confidence, and these programs speak to that.' The demand for used EVs is up 32% year over year, and Rivian's pre-owned program could help boost profits by allowing retailers to price vehicles above market value. While the program is still in its early stages, it gives Rivian another lever to pull in 2025 as investors look for consistent gross profits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 11:41 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/25/a-little-good-news-for-rivian-investors/)\n\n**Rivian: I Was Early And Wrong (Rating Downgrade)**\nThe author initially rated Rivian as 'Sell' in 2021 and upgraded to 'Buy' in July 2024, but now admits to being 'early and wrong'.

This has significant implications for the industry internationally. The local prices of lithium carbonate in China have increased both on the spot market and in futures, but the global lithium market remains in surplus. \nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 06:13 AM\nSource:[Money.it](https://www.money.it/sul-prezzo-globale-del-litio-nessuna-speranza-di-rilancio-nel-2025-ecco-perche)\n\n**Lithium Carbonate Demand Disagreement Remains**\nThe demand for lithium carbonate in December has been relatively stable, with prices rising. However, the market's visibility for future demand is low, leaving room for lithium prices to fluctuate. In the current environment of a non-dormant demand season, it is recommended to hold long positions cautiously. The current spot price of battery-grade lithium carbonate has risen to 7.54 yuan/ton. The production volume of lithium carbonate in China last week increased by 742 tons to 14,507 tons. The CIF prices of lithium spodumene concentrate from Australia and Brazil have risen by $45 and $65 per ton, respectively, to $845 and $840 per ton. The prices of domestic lithium spodumene concentrate with 5-5.5% Li2O content have increased by 300 yuan/ton, while the prices of domestic lithium mica concentrate with 2.0-2.5% Li2O content have increased by 85 yuan/ton. The profit margins of smelting (purchasing spodumene) and smelting (purchasing mica) have remained neutral, increasing by 694 yuan/ton and 1622 yuan/ton, respectively. The profit margins of 523-type ternary materials and 811-type ternary materials have decreased by 1800 yuan/ton and 225 yuan/ton, respectively. The production rates of ternary materials have decreased to 47.37%. The inventory of smelting plants has decreased by 1598 tons to 34,152 tons, and the total inventory (including warehouse receipts) has decreased by 1670 tons to 1,090,530 tons.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 10:25 AM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411213246858786.html)\n\n**Have lithium prices bottomed yet?**\nThe price of lithium carbonate has fallen by 88% from its peak in November 2022, from CNY 597,500 to CNY 72,500. The top 5 lithium-producing countries are Australia, Chile, China, Argentina, and Brazil. In 2024, production levels in Canada are estimated to be 3,400 metric tons, which is just under 2% of global supply. The demand for lithium is expected to increase due to the growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) sales, from 10 million units in 2022 to a projected 17 million units this year. The International Energy Agency sees sales of 30 million units in 2025 and 70 million units in 2030. Research into alternative battery technologies, such as sodium-ion and solid-state batteries, could reduce lithium demand. The pricing outlook for 2025 and 2026 is between US$11,000 and US$20,000, and for 2030, it is between US$10,000 and US$15,000. Recent lower prices have caused issues, with Arcadium Lithium pausing investment in two of its expansion projects. Lithium stock prices have risen off their lows but are still down 70% or more since all-time highs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 05:28 PM\nSource:[The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/investment-ideas/article-have-lithium-prices-bottomed-yet/)\n\n**Lithium Carbonate Long-Term Contract Price May Increase Amid Market Rumors and Overseas Mining Reductions**\nMarket rumors suggest that Sichuan has held a meeting to discuss increasing the price of lithium carbonate long-term contracts. According to a report by Green Futures, major manufacturers are planning to renegotiate their long-term contracts, aiming to reduce the proportion of long-term contracts and increase the proportion of spot and warehouse deals. A representative from Salt Lake Shares stated that there was indeed a meeting, but it was 'more like an annual conference' organized by the industry association. The representative also stated that the price of lithium carbonate is influenced by multiple market factors, and other factors have little impact. Regarding long-term contract prices, the representative stated that they do not sign long-term contracts, and currently, few lithium carbonate producers sign long-term contracts, resulting in large price fluctuations. Representatives from Yaxing Group and Shengxin Lithium Industry stated that they were not aware of the meeting and did not receive any information about the potential price increase. Overseas mining companies have announced plans to reduce production, with Australian mines reducing their lithium spodumene production expectations for 2025. In addition, the price of battery-grade lithium carbonate has risen by 6.6% from November 1 to November 15, driven by strong demand and supply. The price of lithium carbonate futures has also risen, with the main contract closing at 82,500 yuan/ton on November 20, up 0.67% from the previous day. According to SMM statistics, the current inventory of lithium carbonate is 109,100 tons, with 34,200 tons in refining factories, 29,500 tons in downstream companies, and 45,400 tons in other storage. The inventory pressure on lithium salt factories is not significant, and there is a possibility of small-scale stockpiling or purchasing in the downstream market, which may lead to a short-term price increase. On the supply side, some overseas mining companies have announced plans to reduce production, which has raised concerns about the potential reduction in mineral resources. The domestic cloud mica lithium industry is facing challenges due to a lack of raw materials and the shutdown of major enterprises, resulting in a low operating rate. The production of salt lake lithium has been weakened due to winter-related issues with brine and freshwater usage. On the cost side, the downstream production situation has been good, and the upstream lithium salt factories have been price-competitive, with overseas mines also showing a strong price-competitive trend. The demand side has been driven by the implementation of the 'old-for-new' policy, the car manufacturers' year-end rush, and the increased demand for positive materials from battery manufacturers. The main energy storage field has also entered a peak delivery period, and the demand for next year has been pre-positioned, resulting in a 'slow season' phenomenon. However, the demand has exceeded expectations, with some manufacturers stockpiling materials due to the upcoming subsidy reduction, some due to the Spring Festival holiday, and some due to the year-end surge and the implementation of the new policy before it takes effect. This may lead to a depletion of next year's demand.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 03:59 AM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411203245305150.html)\n\n**Morning Paper's Debt Crisis and Lithium Carbonate Price Surge**\nMorning Paper, a leading paper company, has announced that its debt has reached 18.2 billion yuan, accounting for 10.91% of its net assets. The company's main products, such as white cardboard, have seen a significant decline in prices, leading to severe losses. To reduce losses, the company has implemented production cuts and shutdowns, with 71.7% of its production capacity suspended. The company's chairman, Chen Hongguo, has resigned after 37 years of service, and his wife, Li Xueqin, has also resigned as vice president. The company's stock price has fallen to 3.78 yuan per share, with a total market value of 110.58 billion yuan. In contrast, the price of lithium carbonate has continued to rise, with the futures price increasing by 3.96% to 82650 yuan. Industry insiders attribute the rapid rebound in lithium carbonate prices to the fact that social inventory has entered a destocking cycle, and lithium salt factories and material factories have low inventory levels, with a demand for replenishment. According to a report by Zhongjin Securities, the lithium battery industry is expected to experience a supply-demand reversal in the second quarter of 2025, with domestic demand exceeding expectations, with 1.3 million new energy vehicles expected to be sold in 2024, a 36% increase from the previous year. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 01:03 AM\nSource:[凤凰网（凤凰新媒体）](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8eeq9DtMMa2)\n\n**Lithium Carbonate Prices Surge Amidst Shortage and Growing Demand**\nThe lithium carbonate market has seen a surge in prices, with a 10% increase in the past month. The price of lithium carbonate has risen from 72,000 yuan/ton to 79,200 yuan/ton. The increase is attributed to the shutdown of a lithium mine in Australia, which has led to a shortage of lithium carbonate. Additionally, the development of new energy vehicles has increased demand for lithium carbonate, leading to a surge in prices. According to Ningde Times, the company has successfully completed a trial run of lithium battery transportation by rail, which is expected to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The company believes that this development will further promote the growth of the lithium battery industry and contribute to the development of new energy vehicles. 'This is a significant milestone for the development of the lithium battery industry in China,' said an analyst. 'It will further drive the growth of the industry and promote the development of new energy vehicles.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 01:32 PM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411193244482562.html)\n\n**Chinese Commodity Market Rises on November 19, Led by Lithium Carbonate**\nThe Chinese commodity market rose on November 19, with most varieties closing up, led by a 4% increase in lithium carbonate prices. Other commodities such as oil, urea, silver, asphalt, SC crude oil, low-sulfur fuel oil, and gold also rose by over 2%. However, a few varieties fell, including soda ash, which fell by over 1%. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 16.85 points, or 1.21%, to 1408.34.57. The China Securities Index rose 23.01 points, or 1.21%, to 1923.85. According to Shanghai Nonferrous Network (SMM), the upcoming materials procurement will drive the lithium price to continue its rebound. However, the market still expects a long-term oversupply of lithium, which will limit its price rebound. The international oil price rebounded overnight, boosting the domestic oil and gas sector. SC crude oil rose by over 2% to end its five consecutive days of decline. The demand for lithium is expected to be strong in the short term, but the market still expects a long-term oversupply of lithium. The gold and silver prices rose by over 2% to close above 610 yuan/ct and 7800 yuan/ct, respectively. The soda ash price fell by over 1% due to weak demand and oversupply in the market.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 10:55 AM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411193244355651.html)\n\n**Electric Device Industry: Australian Mine Shutdowns and Exceeding Lithium Battery Production in December**\nThe electric device industry is experiencing a surge in demand due to the combination of Australian mine shutdowns and exceeding lithium battery production in December. The price of lithium carbonate has risen. In November, Australian mines frequently reported shutdowns, including Pilbara's decision to close the Nungaju mining and processing plant, which reduced FY25 production guidance from 820,000 tons to 720,000 tons, and BaldHill's 150,000 tons of lithium concentrate production capacity shutdown. Additionally, lithium battery materials exceeded production expectations in December, with supply and demand both favorable, resulting in a 6.6% increase in battery-grade lithium carbonate prices from November 1 to November 15. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 10:01 AM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://data.eastmoney.com/report/zw_industry.jshtml?infocode=AP202411191640963488)\n\n**Lithium Carbonate Prices Surge 5% as Demand and Supply Dynamics Shift**\nOn November 19, the main contract of lithium carbonate opened high by about 2%, and then surged by over 5% during the day, closing at a 3.96% gain. Lithium mining stocks also followed the trend, with Tianqi Lithium, Rongke Shares, and Ganfeng Lithium among others hitting the daily limit. According to Shanghai Nonferrous Metals Network, the SMM battery-grade lithium carbonate price reached 78,513 yuan/ton, up 301 yuan/ton from the previous working day. The battery-grade lithium carbonate price range was 77,200-80,300 yuan/ton, with an average price of 78,750 yuan/ton, up 300 yuan/ton from the previous working day. The industrial-grade lithium carbonate price range was 74,750-75,500 yuan/ton, with an average price of 75,250 yuan/ton, up 400 yuan/ton from the previous working day. Shanghai Nonferrous Metals Network attributed the price increase to the current demand-driven stimulus and the overseas news of a mine reduction in production. A research report by East Money Futures on November 17 stated that the Australian Bald Hill lithium mine's planned maintenance and reduced 2025 shipment volume drove the lithium price surge, but domestic supply remains in surplus, with high inventory levels making it difficult for prices to maintain a strong upward trend. In terms of fundamentals, the lithium carbonate weekly production rate rebounded slightly, remaining at an absolute high level, while salt lake production continued to decline. Phosphate iron lithium production may continue to rise in November, while ternary materials may decline slightly. Overall, demand remains resilient, although inventory continues to decline, remaining at an absolute high level. However, the overall supply elasticity remains good, with no factors driving prices to continue rising. Downstream consumption is good, but not enough to drive prices to continue rising. It is expected that prices will remain within the range and continue to fluctuate. An industry insider also stated, 'Lithium carbonate is unlikely to break through the previous high point, unless a new supply disruption occurs. However, the overall price center will shift upward.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 09:47 AM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411193244287254.html)\n\n**Lithium Carbonate Prices Soar as Industry Sees Supply-Demand Reversal**\nThe lithium carbonate main contract surged by 4% intraday, closing at 82,700 yuan/ton. According to a report by CITIC Securities, the lithium battery industry is expected to experience a supply-demand reversal for the first time in three years in the second quarter of 2025. Domestic demand for electric vehicles is better than expected, with a predicted 13 million units sold in 2024, a 36% increase year-over-year. With the 'trade-in for new' subsidy driving sales, the forecast for 2025 is 15.6 million units, a 20% increase year-over-year. Additionally, driven by a 50% increase in energy storage, the predicted demand for lithium battery installations in 2025 is 1.814 GWh, a 22% increase year-over-year. With supply-side prices having bottomed out after two years of decline, it is expected that the industry will see a supply-demand reversal by the end of the year and in the second quarter of 2025, entering a price stabilization phase.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 06:40 AM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411193244145026.html)\n\n**Lithium Price Begins to Recover, but Surplus Looms in 2025**\nThe price of lithium has started to recover due to the increase in demand for Chinese electric vehicles and cuts in supply. However, analysts warn that it is still likely that there will be a surplus of the metal for batteries in 2025. The spot prices of Chinese lithium carbonate have risen by around 8% since the end of October and are now at a three-month high. The futures prices on the Guangzhou exchange have risen by 13% so far this week. 'The expansion of Chinese subsidies to encourage people to change their old cars has helped the initial rebound of the metal, which is crucial for the energy transition. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are on track to meet ambitious annual sales targets, while inventory replenishment activity is picking up,' said Bloomberg. It is also speculated that the electoral victory of Donald Trump may encourage Chinese battery manufacturers to buy lithium before a possible trade war. 'The demand for lithium carbonate in November has been stronger than market expectations for a typically slow year-end season,' said China Futures Co analyst Zhang Weixin. The Chinese subsidies have served as an incentive and battery manufacturers are rushing to export before trade barriers are imposed, he explained. China's recent stimulus measures seem to have boosted consumer confidence, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights battery metals team director Leah Chen. 'Several cathode manufacturers have returned to the market to replenish inventories that have gradually decreased over the past few months,' she noted. On the supply side, a prolonged decline in the lithium market this year has led to mine closures or cost reductions in Australia, China, and other countries. It's worth noting that prices remain stagnant at levels that are less than a fifth of the peak at the end of 2022. According to CRU Group, 190,000 tonnes of lithium mine capacity have been reduced since the end of 2023, and 50,000 tonnes of projects have been delayed. As a result, the consultant reduced its supply forecast by 14% for next year, explained battery markets analyst Cameron Hughes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 03:15 AM\nSource:[rionegro.com.ar](https://www.rionegro.com.ar/energia/el-precio-del-litio-inicia-un-sendero-de-recuperacion-pero-preocupa-la-demanda-3886718/)\n\n**Lithium Prices Remain Low, Battery Cell Prices Continue to Fall**\nLithium prices remain low, while battery cell prices continue to fall. The spot price of battery-grade lithium carbonate was 72,000-75,000 RMB/TM as of October 31, with an average price of 73,000 RMB/TM, a 4.8% decrease from the previous month. The CIF price of Chinese lithium spodumene concentrate (SC6) was 735-790 USD/TM, averaging 763 USD/TM, a 4.1% decrease from the previous month. The price of battery-grade lithium carbonate failed to surpass the 80,000 RMB/TM threshold, hitting a low in early October. The price began to recover slightly as it approached 70,000 RMB/TM by the end of the month, with the monthly price range remaining at 70,000-79,000 RMB/TM. Influenced by the price of lithium carbonate, the average price of lithium spodumene concentrate (SC6) continued to fall, and upstream miners offered price concessions in the midst of market sentiment for low prices. Lithium prices fell below the early October threshold of USD 800 / TM and continued a slight decline. Lithium producers are trying to maintain prices, with a minimum cost of RMB 70,000 / TM for battery-grade lithium carbonate, limiting the decrease in the short term. As the high season for cathode material production and battery cell manufacturing comes to an end, downstream inventory accumulation intentions may weaken gradually. Given that it is unlikely that demand will sustain growth by the end of the year, the short-term increase in lithium prices does not see sufficient momentum. Although lepidolite producers have reduced production, lithium extraction from spodumene and brine continues to grow, limiting the overall impact on battery-grade lithium carbonate production. The supply of battery-grade lithium carbonate continues to increase, and the total supply remains higher than the current downstream demand. If the price of battery-grade lithium carbonate stabilizes at 70,000 RMB/TM, lower-grade mines may see more cuts or production interruptions due to cost considerations. However, as capacity elimination takes time, lithium carbonate prices will continue to hover around the minimum. By early November, the pressure of excess supply may hinder the rebound of battery-grade lithium carbonate prices. The downward trend of lithium spodumene concentrate prices will also affect lithium carbonate prices. Lithium carbonate prices will continue to face pressure with the subsequent commissioning of low-cost brine pool projects and may experience new declines. The average price of LFP cells in China has fallen to 0.03 RMB/Wh. LFP cell prices in China are still at a minimum in October. As of October 31, the price range after taxes for 280 Ah LFP cells was 0.25-0.35 RMB/Wh, with an average price of 0.30 RMB/Wh, a 3.2% decrease from the previous month. The price range for 314 Ah LFP cells was 0.26-0.35 RMB/Wh, with an average price of 0.31 RMB/Wh, a 6.2% decrease from the previous month. Most level 2 and level 3 cell manufacturers have seen their lowest prices for cells fall below 0.03 RMB/Wh. The price range after taxes for 100 Ah LFP cells was 0.31-0.37 RMB/Wh, with an average price of 0.34 RMB/Wh, a 1.4% decrease from the previous month, a decreasing gap. 314 Ah cells have been adopted in multiple energy storage projects. As production increases and demand grows, 314 Ah and 280 Ah cells do not see a price gap from the fourth quarter. By the end of January 2024, the average prices after taxes for 280 Ah and 100 Ah LFP cells were 0.42 RMB/Wh and 0.44 RMB/Wh, respectively, a decrease of nearly 29% compared to October, reflecting the fierce price war for LFP cells this year. Despite the lower costs of energy storage cells due to the decline in material costs and the improvement in production processes, some manufacturers' lower prices are approaching or below the current production costs of cells. Even without making a profit, they continue to try to secure orders for key projects that must be installed and connected to the grid by the end of the year. In the midst of price competition, downstream customers also pose increasingly stringent demands on delivery schedules, project performance, and product quality. In addition to seeking the lowest possible costs, cell manufacturers have begun to seek multifaceted developments, as reducing prices to secure orders may no longer be sustainable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 11:43 AM\nSource:[evwind.com](https://www.evwind.com/2024/11/17/los-precios-del-litio-se-mantienen-bajos-mientras-que-los-precios-de-las-celdas-caen-aun-mas/)\n\n**Lithium Carbonate Price Falls 7.12% Amid High Inventory**\nThe price of lithium carbonate (LC2501) fell by 7.12% on November 15, closing at 78,300 yuan/ton. The current high inventory continues to suppress the upward space of the price. According to Mysteel data, the average price of battery-grade lithium carbonate on November 15 was 80,000 yuan/ton, down 2,000 yuan/ton from the previous trading day. Zhang Weixin, an analyst at Zhongsheng Jintou Futures, believes that the price of lithium carbonate has returned to its basic level, and the current high inventory continues to suppress the upward space of the price. Wu Jiang, an analyst at Guotai Anshin Futures, believes that the price of lithium carbonate has risen in line with the macro direction, but the current situation is not conducive to the continuation of the price rise. He believes that the price of lithium carbonate will still lack a sustained upward basis, and the price will likely be weak and volatile around 75,000 yuan/ton. Zhang Weixin also believes that the price of lithium carbonate will still lack a sustained upward basis, and the price will likely be weak and volatile around 75,000 yuan/ton. 'The price of lithium carbonate has risen to 85,000 yuan/ton, and the original cost support and supply out-clear logic no longer applies. If the price wants to maintain a high level, it must have demand growth as support, and the supply and demand relationship will only be slightly imbalanced or balanced.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 11:56 PM\nSource:[东方财富网](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202411173241712037.html)\n\n**Lithium in Nascent Rebound, But Long-Term Outlook Is Bleak – by Annie Lee (Bloomberg News – November 14, 2024)**\nLithium prices have seen a mini-revival due to increased demand from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and supply cuts. Chinese lithium carbonate spot prices have risen 8% since late October, reaching a three-month high. Analysts caution that despite the uptick, there is still likely to be a surplus of lithium in 2025.

The company's lithium business is expected to remain its largest, with prices expected to rise in 2025 after falling to cyclically low levels in 2024. Albemarle has a cost advantage in lithium carbonate production due to its brine assets in Chile and in bromine production due to its assets in the Dead Sea and Arkansas. The company is in good financial health, with a net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.1 times, but faces risks including volatile lithium prices, execution risk in ramping up lithium production, and political risk in Chile.

Chinese lithium carbonate prices ranged between Yuan 70,500/mt and Yuan 90,000/mt throughout Q3, with consumers adopting a wait-and-see approach due to fluctuating lithium futures contract prices. Term contract negotiations for the new year are expected to take place in Q4, but the demand outlook for 2025 remains unclear. According to Alice Yu, lead analyst at Commodity Insights, 'The outlook for China's PEV industry remains uncertain, with lithium demand and PEV sales unlikely to sustain growth momentum in the near term, given consumer affordability challenges and a slowdown in rolling out more affordable vehicle models.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 11:01 AM\nSource:[spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/102124-trade-review-asian-lithium-demand-to-slow-in-q4-on-seasonal-lull-prices-to-be-rangebound)\n\n**Lithium Market Update: Q3 2024 in Review**\nLithium carbonate prices declined in Q3 2024, starting at $12,999 per metric ton and shedding 22% by September 10, hitting a three-year low of $10,019. Despite this, market watchers view Q3 as a price stabilization period, with prices trending upwards in the first weeks of Q4. Lithium producers scaled back output and expenditures due to slower demand growth, particularly from the EV sector. Chemical prices remained stable, while spodumene prices fell due to delayed response to chemical price declines. EV sales climbed in September, with global sales topping 1.7 million units, a new monthly record. The US and Canada saw steady growth, while Europe's numbers shrunk. Tariffs on Chinese EVs and lithium-ion batteries are set to increase, but domestic automakers are more interested in EV import tariffs.

The market for lithium is expected to grow at a 12% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2021 and 2028, driven by countries with ambitious net-zero targets. However, lithium prices have been volatile, surging by over 400% in 2021 and stabilizing in 2022. In January 2024, lithium carbonate prices hovered around $30,000 per tonne, down from a peak of $85,000 in 2022. Investors must consider the risks of supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and environmental concerns surrounding lithium mining. Despite these challenges, the future outlook for lithium investments looks bright, with a 500% increase in lithium demand expected by 2030. As with any commodity, a diversified approach and a long-term perspective will be essential in capitalising on the lithium boom, according to experts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 11:57 AM\nSource:[abcmoney.co.uk](https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/2024/10/investing-in-lithium-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n**Argentina's Lithium Exports Double, but Revenue Decreases**\nArgentina's lithium exports have doubled, but the revenue from these exports has decreased. According to the Bolsa de Comercio de Rosario (BCR), the prices of lithium carbonate have recovered 'scarcely' to below $10,000 per ton. The BCR report stated, 'The current situation in the lithium industry brings its challenges.' Despite the decline in prices, the local lithium chain continues to grow in production. In 2023, the chain's exports grew by almost 30% year-over-year, and in the first eight months of 2024, the export volume increased by over 53% compared to the same period last year. However, when measured in dollars, the exports decreased by 35% compared to the same period in 2023. The total exports of lithium carbonate from January to August 2024 amount to around $358 million, which is far from the $550 million of the previous year. The BCR calculated that the volume exported in the first eight months of 2024, valued at the average export prices of 2023, would have represented $763 million. China has become the main destination for Argentine lithium, with its participation increasing from 43% in 2023 to 69% in the first eight months of 2024. The BCR anticipates that the dynamic automotive industry in China will lead to a greater exchange and investments between Argentina and China in the future.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 04:55 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/empresas/duplican-envios-litio-argentino-cae-ingreso-divisas-20241016-730371.html)\n\n**Exporting Lithium Generates Fewer Dollars**\nThe current state of the lithium industry presents its challenges.

According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, the price of lithium carbonate in Asia fell to $12,500 per metric ton in mid-July 2024, the lowest level since the company began publishing weekly prices in early 2023. The decrease represents a 3.8% drop compared to the previous week and a drastic reduction from the $43,000 per ton recorded a year ago. The increase in lithium production, driven by the transition to clean energy, has disrupted the balance between supply and demand in this expanding sector. The overproduction has resulted in a surplus of inventories, particularly in China, which leads both in lithium refining and battery cell production. Analysts at Citi predict a 14.0% increase in global lithium demand this year, but the supply will rise by 18.0%, exacerbating the mismatch. Tony Ottaviano, CEO of Liontown Resources, described the market conditions as 'very, very tough'. However, the company has secured supply contracts with Tesla, Ford, and LG Energy Solution, which could provide some stability in the midst of market volatility. The excess supply is intensified by seasonal factors. In Qinghai Province, China, producers extracting lithium from salt lakes are increasing production due to better evaporation rates during the hot months. This seasonal increase in production puts even more pressure on prices, which are already at historically low levels. At a global level, lithium prices have fallen to their lowest levels in three years, following a two-year period of growth that drove prices to record highs and motivated new investments in mining. Despite its adverse effect on producers, some analysts consider the price drop as an opportunity to rebalance the market. Experts at Citi predict that lithium futures could decline by an additional 15% to 20% before starting to recover, possibly from next year if confidence in electric vehicles increases. Additionally, the Biden administration has set an ambitious goal to achieve commercial fusion energy in a decade, which could affect future demand for lithium and other battery materials.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 02:00 AM\nSource:[Sectorial](https://sectorial.co/articulos-especiales/caida-del-precio-del-litio-es-un-anticipo-de-saturacion-en-mercado-de-renovables)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Florida Atlantic University associate professor of supply chain management, Steven Carnovale, attributes the higher number of recalls to the complex and globally interconnected nature of the food supply chain. However, he notes that the added assurance of safety guardrails and regulations working is a positive outcome. Carnovale also points out that new advancements, such as savvier bar codes, are being fine-tuned to better pinpoint and track the source of contaminations. Additionally, grocery stores seem to be more proactive in reaching out to customers about recalls, allowing for faster public alerting. As Carnovale said, 'The nature of food supplies is so globally interconnected and it's so globally dispersed.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 01:00 PM\nSource:[wptv.com](https://www.wptv.com/money/consumer/dont-eat-that-why-food-recalls-are-up-this-year)\n\n**DMK Recalls Three Milram Yogurt Products Due to Potential Metal Pieces**\nThe Deutsches Milchkontor (DMK) has recalled three products from Milram due to the potential presence of metal pieces in the yogurt.

In severe cases, people can go into anaphylactic shock, which is treated with epinephrine, supplemental oxygen, antihistamines, and steroids.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 04:01 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13882459/Lactaid-milk-recalled-almond-life-threatening-reaction.html)\n\n**HP Hood LLC Recalls Lactaid Milk Due to Undeclared Almond Traces**\nHP Hood LLC has voluntarily recalled five varieties of Lactaid milk due to the possible presence of undeclared almond traces in the labeling.
