**Expired COVID-19 Tests: US Experts Say They Can Still Be Effective Up to 1 Year**
As COVID-19 cases rise, experts expect a peak between January and March. Many people still have unused rapid COVID-19 tests at home. However, the effectiveness of these tests after expiration is unclear. German medical professionals are divided on the matter, with some saying the test results are worthless after expiration, while others claim they can still be used for up to three months after the expiration date if stored properly. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, disagrees, stating, 'With proper storage, some COVID-19 tests can still function properly up to one year after the expiration date listed on the packaging.' According to Schaffner, the FDA regularly checks the expiration dates and effectiveness of COVID-19 tests on the market. The FDA advises citizens to consider tips on their website for using expired tests.

**Covid News from the Week Ending October 26th**
US Covid metrics continued to decline, but the CDC expects a higher winter peak than the summer peak. The test positivity rate fell to 5.6% from 7.6% in the previous week. Covid cases accounted for 0.6% of hospital emergency room patients, down from 0.8% in the previous week. The CDC also reported that Covid accounted for 1.4% of all US deaths, down from 1.8% in the previous week. The national viral activity level in wastewater continued to be low and falling, but not as rapidly as in previous weeks. The dominant Covid variant in the US is Omicron KP.3.1.1, which accounted for 57% of virus samples sequenced during the October 12th through October 26th period. The CDC expects the updated vaccines to provide reasonable protection against KP.3.1.1, with early studies indicating that they are effective in reducing severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by the variant.

**COVID-19 in Italy: New Cases and Deaths Decrease**
According to the Italian Ministry of Health, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Italy has decreased to 5,799 in the week of October 24-30, down from 8,860 in the previous week. The number of deaths has also decreased to 108, down from 116 in the previous week. The regions with the highest number of new cases are Lombardy (1,705), Veneto (737), Piedmont (623), and Lazio (598). The positivity rate has decreased to 7.3%, down from 9.6% in the previous week. The variant Xec of Sars-CoV-2 continues to grow, accounting for 25% of COVID-19 cases in October, according to the ISS-Cabina di regia's weekly monitoring data. 'Preliminary data for October show the co-circulation of different sub-variants of JN.1, with a predominance of KP.3.1.1, and an increase in the proportion of sequences attributable to the recombinant lineage Xec, which reaches 25% of the total,' the data show.

**COVID-19 Variant XEC Is Highly Transmissible: Should We Be Worried?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has emerged in the United States and is rapidly spreading, potentially becoming the dominant strain this winter. According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.

**New COVID-19 Variants: KP.3 and XEC**
There has been a rise in COVID-19 infections in Europe, with a test positivity rate of over 20% in some countries. In the US, hospitalizations have increased, likely due to a wave of COVID-19 infections in Singapore. As we move into autumn and winter in the Northern Hemisphere, concerns are growing about two new variants: KP.3 and XEC. KP.3 has been designated as a global concerning variant (VOC) by the US CDC, but only in the US. The CDC recommends that people get an updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025. KP.3 is a subvariant of the Omicron variant, and XEC is a recombinant variant related to KP.3. According to Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology, XEC is likely a recombination between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. XEC was first detected in Germany in June, but it is not yet listed on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. The focus in Germany remains on KP.3.1.1, which is dominant and considered more contagious than previous variants. According to Sandra Ciesek, a virologist, it is not surprising that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious, as the virus constantly mutates to find new ways to infect people. However, this does not mean that the variant causes more severe illness. The FLiRT variants, including KP.3 and XEC, are considered potentially more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2 due to mutations in key areas of the spike protein. Paul Hunter, a medical professor at the University of East Anglia, said that FLiRT is a serious concern, as it allows the virus to evade immunity and reproduce more effectively. The CDC has stated that KP.3.1.1 was likely responsible for 30-40% of clinical COVID-19 cases in the US in mid-August, and that the risks associated with this variant are particularly acute for people over 65 and children under 2.

**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**
The XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the United States, with 'high' levels reported in most New England states, the Pacific Northwest, and several mountain region states.

**The Emergence of the New XEC Variant: A Concern for Public Health**
The emergence of the new XEC variant of the coronavirus has raised concerns about its high transmissibility and potential impact on public health. The variant is believed to have originated from the combination of KP.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants. According to Dr. François Balloux, a computer scientist and director of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at University College London, 'the XEC gene is likely the result of a genetic recombination between the KP.3.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants.' The XEC variant was first detected in Germany in June, but it has not been reported on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. Dr. Sandra Ciesek, a virologist at the German Center for Infection Research, stated that 'the emergence of KP.3.1.1 is not surprising, given its higher transmissibility.' She added that 'the virus continues to evolve in search of new ways to spread, but this does not mean that the variant causes a more severe disease.' Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, noted that 'the term FLiRT seems like an odd abbreviation, but it remains stuck in my mind due to its serious implications.' FLiRT plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to grow and bind to living cells, making it easier for it to infect and spread. A study published in July 2024 found that the KP.2 subvariant has 'a greater ability to evade the immunity induced by the vaccine,' reflecting its evolution and adaptation to the immune response. Additionally, the KP.2 subvariant has been shown to replicate more efficiently compared to the original JN.1 variant. The KP.3.1.1 subvariant has been responsible for 30-40% of COVID-19 clinical samples in the United States in mid-August 2024, indicating a significant increase from the previous week's rate of 20-26%, which suggests its rapid spread over a short period.

**COVID genomic surveillance details rise, evolution of JN.1 in US this year**
New genomic surveillance data published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report shows that JN.1 and its descendants have been the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants in 2024, and are still evolving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program analyzed 208,357 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 56 US jurisdictions from May 2023 through September 2024. The data shows that JN.1 emerged in the US and rapidly became the dominant variant, causing surges in COVID-19 cases in winter 2024. Further surges were seen in summer 2024 due to the emergence of JN.1 descendant lineages with immune escape and increased transmissibility. The authors conclude that continued monitoring is necessary to update COVID-19 vaccines and anticipate future surges in COVID-19 activity, as 'the pattern of divergent variant emergence followed by subsequent stepwise evolutionary changes continues.'

**New COVID XEC variant: What you need to know**
The COVID-19 pandemic is seeing a rise in infections, particularly in the US, where the number of hospitalizations has increased. Two new variants, KP.3 and XEC, have been identified, with XEC being a 'recombinant' variant related to KP.3. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that people get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine. Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology, stated that XEC is a 'likely recombinant between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.' The Robert Koch Institute's COVID Dashboard has not yet reported XEC, but it has been detected in Germany in June. Sandra Ciesek, a virologist, said that the virus keeps mutating in search of new ways to infect people, but that doesn't mean that the variant causes a more severe illness. The FLiRT variants, including KP.3, appear to have a potential to be more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2. A paper published in July 2024 suggested that KP.2 had 'a greater ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity,' and that it reproduced more effectively than its 'parent' variant JN.1.

**This Weeks Covid spiel includes current details on variant proportions**
The latest Covid-19 data from the CDC shows a continued decline in cases and hospitalizations. The test positivity rate fell to 7.7% during the week ending October 5th, down from 9.5% the previous week. Covid cases accounted for 0.8% of hospital emergency room patients, down from 1.1% the previous week. The CDC's national reading for viral activity in wastewater has fallen to 'LOW', with all four major CDC regions also showing a decline. The Omicron KP.3.1.1 variant continues to dominate, accounting for 57.2% of the virus samples sequenced during the September 29th to October 12th period. The new recombinant XEC variant is now the 2nd most common Covid mutant circulating in the US, accounting for 10.7% of US Covid infections during the same period. The updated vaccines are expected to provide reasonable protection against the KP.3.1.1 variant, but it's unclear if they will prevent infection altogether.

**COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US. Here's what you should know about it.**
The COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US, according to the CDC. The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.

**XEC Variant: Experts Warn of Potential Increase in COVID-19 Cases this Fall**
According to Dr. Peter Chin Hong, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of California in San Francisco, the XEC variant is a recombinant of two other variants, KS 1.1. and KP 3.3. 'It has a mutation that we don't know much about,' he said, warning that the reason people are paying attention is that it seemed to rise particularly in Germany, where it represents around 15% of cases, and in the UK, 17%. 'In the US, it hasn't reached that level yet, but it could come in the winter and be a bit more transmissible,' Dr. Hong noted. He considered the situation 'not to cause serious problems, because immunity is generally high' and emphasized that 'the most important thing is to get vaccinated, to protect yourself from serious illness, hospitalization, and death.' The dominant subvariant in the US at the moment is KP 3.1, responsible for around 50% of cases. 'It's part of the Omicron family, and somehow it figured out how to stay in the population, spread very successfully, and keep mutating,' Dr. Hong said.

**Free COVID tests return as CDC says this one variant now accounts for nearly 60% of cases**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 now accounts for nearly 60% of positive infections in the United States, according to the agency's Nowcast data tracker. This variant first became the leading variant in the two-week period starting on July 21 and ending on August 3. Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, stated, 'The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023.' The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced that households across the nation can obtain four free at-home COVID-19 tests while supplies last. Dawn O'Connell, HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said, 'Before you visit with your family and friends this holiday season, take a quick test and help keep them safe from COVID-19.' The tests will be able to detect the dominant COVID-19 variants now circulating, according to the CDC.

**XEC COVID-19 Variant Emerges: Here's What We Know**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has emerged in multiple regions worldwide, including the US, according to the CDC. However, the CDC has stated that no specific symptoms are associated with the variant. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokeswoman, said, 'Please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we're seeing in the US.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants, including XEC, but Norman stated that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' GAVI, a global health organization, also stated that XEC is likely to have similar symptoms to other COVID variants, such as a high temperature, sore throat, and body aches. Norman also noted that XEC is a recombinant variant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and that recombinants are not new, as seen with the XBB recombinant variant in 2023. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which are expected to work against all circulating variants.

**Is the hybrid COVID variant XEC in the US? What to know about the new strain that's more contagious**
The hybrid COVID-19 strain XEC, a recombinant of the Omicron variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been reported in at least 25 US states, according to RTI International epidemiologist Joëlla W. Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. The dominant COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for over 50% of cases in the US, according to recent CDC projections.

**XEC Variant of COVID-19 Gaining Traction, But KP.3.1.1 Remains Dominant in US**
The XEC variant of COVID-19 is gaining traction, with some experts predicting it will become the dominant strain this fall. According to Raj Rajnarayanan, a professor at Nyitcom-Arkansas State University, XEC has the potential to become the most circulating lineage by November, currently circulating at around 5-7% globally. Eric Topol, a scientist at Scripps Research, also believes XEC is the most likely to take hold. However, the CDC reports that KP.3.1.1 is currently the dominant strain in the US, representing over 50% of cases. The CDC also notes that there are no specific symptoms associated with XEC or other co-circulating strains. Experts recommend getting vaccinated with updated vaccines, which are expected to provide good protection in the upcoming winter. Some experts are cautious about XEC's evolution, noting that it is a recombinant of KP.3.3 and KS.1.1, and that its success may be due to a mutation inherited from KP.3.3. However, one expert notes that XEC's 'spike' protein is almost identical to that of KP.3.1.1, and that the differences in other viral regions may be insignificant.

**More free COVID-19 tests are coming. Here's how to order yours in NC**
The US government is offering a seventh round of free COVID-19 tests, with up to four tests available per household. The tests will be able to detect the dominant variants of the virus, including subvariant KP.3.1.1, which makes up 37% of cases in the US. According to the CDC, the new tests will also be able to detect subvariant KP.3, which makes up over 16% of cases. In North Carolina, wastewater treatment plants are still measuring COVID-19 levels through viral particles present in wastewater. The NC Department of Health and Human Services is tracking levels of the virus, with recent measurements showing high levels in several areas, including Boone and Spruce Pine. The CDC warns that symptoms of COVID-19 can be different based on the variant, and advises checking the CDC website for more information.

**Scientists Warn of Rapid Spread of New Mutated Coronavirus XEC**
Scientists are warning that the new mutated coronavirus, 'the most contagious', known as XEC, is spreading rapidly across Europe and may become the dominant strain soon. According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute's Translational Research Institute in La Jolla, 'At this stage, it appears that the XEC variant is the most likely to spread.' Researchers had predicted in August that this variant would spread faster in a few weeks to a month. XEC, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, was first reported in Berlin, Germany in June and is now spreading 'very quickly' across Europe, North America, and Asia, according to COVID-19 data analyst Mike Hoenig. Slovenia reported high infection rates in August, with over 10% of COVID-19 cases in the country containing XEC. Experts say the new strain, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, has some new mutations that may help it spread this fall. They explain that XEC is a hybrid of previously discovered Omicron sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. KS.1.1 is a type of the FLiRT family of sub-variants, while KP.3.3 belongs to the FLuQE category. So far, more than 500 samples from 27 countries, including Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Portugal, and China, have been found to contain XEC. Analysts point to strong growth of the variant in Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. As the virus continues to evolve, data shows that XEC is growing steadily every day with an advantage over previously known sub-variants. Its symptoms are similar to those of previous COVID-19 variants, including fever, sore throat, cough, loss of smell, loss of appetite, and body aches. However, since it is still just a sub-lineage of the same Omicron variant, experts say that following vaccination and booster shots will provide sufficient protection against severe illness and hospitalization. They also advise practicing good hygiene and taking steps to improve air quality. Researchers are calling for close monitoring of the XEC variant to better understand its symptoms.

**New COVID variant XEC now in half of states. Here's what to know.**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has been spotted in half of the states across the United States, according to preliminary data from the global virus database GISAID. Health officials are not raising concern about this variant, unlike some previous, more highly mutated strains. The variant's emergence comes as COVID-19 trends remain 'high' but are now largely slowing after a summer wave of infections. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modelers estimate that the virus will likely climb again over the winter, peaking in mid-January. Carla Finkielstein, head of the molecular diagnostics lab at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, said, 'We do not see a particular trend. We should keep an eye on the samples coming and continue genomic screening more broadly.' The CDC is not aware of any specific symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Americans are still recommended to get this fall and winter's round of updated COVID-19 vaccines, which target the KP.2 strain of the virus.

According to Forbes, the summer of 2024 has been dubbed the 'Covid summer' due to the significant increase in coronavirus cases in July 2022, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through wastewater monitoring. However, there is a lack of data on the current situation, as many people have stopped taking Covid-19 tests, and those who do take them often do not report the results. As a result, the number of Covid-19 cases is likely significantly underestimated. The summer surge, which likely began in early June, was caused by sub-variants KP.3.1.1 and KP.3.3 in the FLiRT sub-lineage. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute, stated that the spread of the new variant XEC 'is just beginning' and will take a few months to establish itself and cause its own wave. Topol added that XEC is likely to become the dominant variant, but it will take several months for its spread to reach high levels. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2022, with 775 million confirmed cases and over 7 million deaths reported from the start of the pandemic to the end of June 2024.

**New Corona Variant 'Even More Infectious': A Potential Wave of Infections Looms**
A new study suggests that the latest Corona variant, KP. 3.1.1, is even more infectious than its predecessor. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), this variant is responsible for 72% of all infections in Germany. The number of Corona infections is already on the rise, as shown by the RKI's wastewater monitoring and the Health Ministry's infection radar. Timo Ulrichs, a virologist, said, 'The studies on this new subvariant of JN.1 show that the mutations have given the virus a higher reproduction number and thus a higher fitness for spreading.' A severe infection wave may be looming. However, the symptoms of a Covid-19 infection caused by KP. 3.1.1 are largely similar to those of previous variants, including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and loss of taste or smell. There is currently no evidence that this variant leads to more severe disease courses. The Standing Vaccination Commission recommends that people over 60 continue to get vaccinated, as they are at a particularly high risk of severe Covid-19.

**New Coronavirus Variants May Be Evading Immunity**
According to the Rospotrebnadzor molecular-genetic monitoring data, the proportion of circulating variants of the new coronavirus KP.3 and LB.1, which are part of the FLiRT subline, has increased by 2.5 times in the Russian Federation over the past two to three weeks. 'These variants have special mutations in the spike protein, which allows the virus to evade the immune response while maintaining its ability to effectively infect cells,' the Rospotrebnadzor statement said. The agency noted that the sharp increase in the variants led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Russia at the beginning of September 2024. The operational headquarters for combating COVID-19 previously reported a 17.3% increase in COVID-19 cases in Russia over the past week.

**Russia Sees Rise in COVID-19 Variants Evading Immune System**
According to Rospotrebnadzor, there is a significant increase in COVID-19 variants that can evade the immune system, leading to a rise in COVID-19 cases in Russia in early September. The variants LB.1 and KP.3 'demonstrate increased infectivity compared to their predecessor' and 'a mutation in LB.1 significantly enhances its ability to evade the immune response.' The press service of Rospotrebnadzor stated, 'The sharp increase in the proportion of these variants, combined with seasonal factors, has led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Russia in early September 2024.' The agency also noted that, according to molecular-genetic monitoring, the proportion of circulating variants of the new coronavirus KP.3 and LB.1, belonging to the FLiRT subline, has increased by 2.5 times in the last two to three weeks. 'These variants have special mutations in the spike protein, allowing the virus to evade the immune response while maintaining its ability to effectively infect cells,' Rospotrebnadzor said.

**Corona-Herbstwelle: Dominant KP.3.1.1 variant makes people more susceptible to infection**
According to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately 1% of the population in Germany has been newly infected with COVID-19 in the past week, with about 1,000 people per 100,000 inhabitants infected. The data is based on the Grippeweb survey system, which has around 8,500 volunteers providing anonymous health information to the RKI once a week. The results are generally reliable and consistent with the data obtained through wastewater monitoring. The number of severe cases remains low, with about two people per million inhabitants requiring intensive care for COVID-19, mainly affecting people over 60 years old. Since October 2023, around 400,000 COVID-19 infections have been confirmed through PCR tests, with about a third (133,000) requiring hospitalization. The dominant variant of the virus is KP.3.1.1, which accounts for 72% of all infections and is part of the FLIRT variants. Japanese scientists have found that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious than its predecessors XBB.1.5 and JN.1, and that antibodies formed against these variants are less effective against the current variant. US media have reported that patients with KP.3.1.1 infections are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. The overall situation regarding respiratory infections remains stable, with around 4.4 million people in Germany newly infected in the past week, a typical value for this time of year. However, there have been changes in the age groups, with a decrease in new infections among children and an increase among adults.

**COVID-19 remained at 'very high' activity levels across the US: See latest data**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half of the United States reported 'very high' levels of COVID-19 activity last month. The CDC relies on wastewater data to track the virus, which often lags several weeks behind current case counts. As of Aug. 31, 23 states have reported 'very high' levels of wastewater viral activity nationwide. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker projected the KP.3.1.1 variant accounting for 42.2% of positive infections, followed by KP.2.3 at 14.6% in the two-week stretch starting Aug.18 and ending Aug. 31. Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, stated, 'The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023.' The CDC data shows a decrease in positive COVID-19 cases in six Southern states, with a COVID-19 test positivity rate of 16.3% for the week of Aug. 25 to Aug. 31, a decrease of -0.4% from the prior week.

**New COVID-19 Wave Hits US and Europe: FLiRT and XEC Variants Cause Concern**
A new wave of COVID-19 is spreading in the US and Europe, with the FLiRT variant being the most dominant strain in the US. According to the Economic Times, FLiRT is a sub-variant of Omicron, and its sub-variants KP.3, KP.2, and KP.1.1 have been detected in 36.9%, 24.4%, and 9.1% of infections respectively. The CDC reports that the number of COVID-19 cases in 7 US states is increasing, with 17% of tests coming back positive. This has led to an increase in hospitalizations, although the rate of increase is slowing in some states. The FLiRT variant is highly contagious but has mild symptoms. In Europe, the XEC sub-variant is causing concern, with cases reported in several countries. Scientists are monitoring the situation closely, and a California physician predicts that XEC will become the dominant variant in the coming time. Currently, there is no vaccine available that provides protection against the new variants. A new vaccine that targets Omicron is expected to be available in the US in September, but its effectiveness against the new strain is unclear. 'It is a matter of concern that the new variants are spreading rapidly, and we need to be prepared to face the challenge,' said a health expert.

**Expired COVID-19 Tests: US Experts Say They Can Still Be Effective Up to 1 Year**
As COVID-19 cases rise, experts expect a peak between January and March. Many people still have unused rapid COVID-19 tests at home. However, the effectiveness of these tests after expiration is unclear. German medical professionals are divided on the matter, with some saying the test results are worthless after expiration, while others claim they can still be used for up to three months after the expiration date if stored properly. Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, disagrees, stating, 'With proper storage, some COVID-19 tests can still function properly up to one year after the expiration date listed on the packaging.' According to Schaffner, the FDA regularly checks the expiration dates and effectiveness of COVID-19 tests on the market. The FDA advises citizens to consider tips on their website for using expired tests.

**Covid News from the Week Ending October 26th**
US Covid metrics continued to decline, but the CDC expects a higher winter peak than the summer peak. The test positivity rate fell to 5.6% from 7.6% in the previous week. Covid cases accounted for 0.6% of hospital emergency room patients, down from 0.8% in the previous week. The CDC also reported that Covid accounted for 1.4% of all US deaths, down from 1.8% in the previous week. The national viral activity level in wastewater continued to be low and falling, but not as rapidly as in previous weeks. The dominant Covid variant in the US is Omicron KP.3.1.1, which accounted for 57% of virus samples sequenced during the October 12th through October 26th period. The CDC expects the updated vaccines to provide reasonable protection against KP.3.1.1, with early studies indicating that they are effective in reducing severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by the variant.

**COVID-19 in Italy: New Cases and Deaths Decrease**
According to the Italian Ministry of Health, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Italy has decreased to 5,799 in the week of October 24-30, down from 8,860 in the previous week. The number of deaths has also decreased to 108, down from 116 in the previous week. The regions with the highest number of new cases are Lombardy (1,705), Veneto (737), Piedmont (623), and Lazio (598). The positivity rate has decreased to 7.3%, down from 9.6% in the previous week. The variant Xec of Sars-CoV-2 continues to grow, accounting for 25% of COVID-19 cases in October, according to the ISS-Cabina di regia's weekly monitoring data. 'Preliminary data for October show the co-circulation of different sub-variants of JN.1, with a predominance of KP.3.1.1, and an increase in the proportion of sequences attributable to the recombinant lineage Xec, which reaches 25% of the total,' the data show.

**COVID-19 Variant XEC Is Highly Transmissible: Should We Be Worried?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has emerged in the United States and is rapidly spreading, potentially becoming the dominant strain this winter. According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.

**New COVID-19 Variants: KP.3 and XEC**
There has been a rise in COVID-19 infections in Europe, with a test positivity rate of over 20% in some countries. In the US, hospitalizations have increased, likely due to a wave of COVID-19 infections in Singapore. As we move into autumn and winter in the Northern Hemisphere, concerns are growing about two new variants: KP.3 and XEC. KP.3 has been designated as a global concerning variant (VOC) by the US CDC, but only in the US. The CDC recommends that people get an updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025. KP.3 is a subvariant of the Omicron variant, and XEC is a recombinant variant related to KP.3. According to Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology, XEC is likely a recombination between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. XEC was first detected in Germany in June, but it is not yet listed on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. The focus in Germany remains on KP.3.1.1, which is dominant and considered more contagious than previous variants. According to Sandra Ciesek, a virologist, it is not surprising that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious, as the virus constantly mutates to find new ways to infect people. However, this does not mean that the variant causes more severe illness. The FLiRT variants, including KP.3 and XEC, are considered potentially more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2 due to mutations in key areas of the spike protein. Paul Hunter, a medical professor at the University of East Anglia, said that FLiRT is a serious concern, as it allows the virus to evade immunity and reproduce more effectively. The CDC has stated that KP.3.1.1 was likely responsible for 30-40% of clinical COVID-19 cases in the US in mid-August, and that the risks associated with this variant are particularly acute for people over 65 and children under 2.

**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**
The XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the United States, with 'high' levels reported in most New England states, the Pacific Northwest, and several mountain region states.

**The Emergence of the New XEC Variant: A Concern for Public Health**
The emergence of the new XEC variant of the coronavirus has raised concerns about its high transmissibility and potential impact on public health. The variant is believed to have originated from the combination of KP.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants. According to Dr. François Balloux, a computer scientist and director of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at University College London, 'the XEC gene is likely the result of a genetic recombination between the KP.3.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants.' The XEC variant was first detected in Germany in June, but it has not been reported on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. Dr. Sandra Ciesek, a virologist at the German Center for Infection Research, stated that 'the emergence of KP.3.1.1 is not surprising, given its higher transmissibility.' She added that 'the virus continues to evolve in search of new ways to spread, but this does not mean that the variant causes a more severe disease.' Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, noted that 'the term FLiRT seems like an odd abbreviation, but it remains stuck in my mind due to its serious implications.' FLiRT plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to grow and bind to living cells, making it easier for it to infect and spread. A study published in July 2024 found that the KP.2 subvariant has 'a greater ability to evade the immunity induced by the vaccine,' reflecting its evolution and adaptation to the immune response. Additionally, the KP.2 subvariant has been shown to replicate more efficiently compared to the original JN.1 variant. The KP.3.1.1 subvariant has been responsible for 30-40% of COVID-19 clinical samples in the United States in mid-August 2024, indicating a significant increase from the previous week's rate of 20-26%, which suggests its rapid spread over a short period.

**COVID genomic surveillance details rise, evolution of JN.1 in US this year**
New genomic surveillance data published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report shows that JN.1 and its descendants have been the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants in 2024, and are still evolving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program analyzed 208,357 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 56 US jurisdictions from May 2023 through September 2024. The data shows that JN.1 emerged in the US and rapidly became the dominant variant, causing surges in COVID-19 cases in winter 2024. Further surges were seen in summer 2024 due to the emergence of JN.1 descendant lineages with immune escape and increased transmissibility. The authors conclude that continued monitoring is necessary to update COVID-19 vaccines and anticipate future surges in COVID-19 activity, as 'the pattern of divergent variant emergence followed by subsequent stepwise evolutionary changes continues.'

**New COVID XEC variant: What you need to know**
The COVID-19 pandemic is seeing a rise in infections, particularly in the US, where the number of hospitalizations has increased. Two new variants, KP.3 and XEC, have been identified, with XEC being a 'recombinant' variant related to KP.3. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that people get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine. Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology, stated that XEC is a 'likely recombinant between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.' The Robert Koch Institute's COVID Dashboard has not yet reported XEC, but it has been detected in Germany in June. Sandra Ciesek, a virologist, said that the virus keeps mutating in search of new ways to infect people, but that doesn't mean that the variant causes a more severe illness. The FLiRT variants, including KP.3, appear to have a potential to be more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2. A paper published in July 2024 suggested that KP.2 had 'a greater ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity,' and that it reproduced more effectively than its 'parent' variant JN.1.

**This Weeks Covid spiel includes current details on variant proportions**
The latest Covid-19 data from the CDC shows a continued decline in cases and hospitalizations. The test positivity rate fell to 7.7% during the week ending October 5th, down from 9.5% the previous week. Covid cases accounted for 0.8% of hospital emergency room patients, down from 1.1% the previous week. The CDC's national reading for viral activity in wastewater has fallen to 'LOW', with all four major CDC regions also showing a decline. The Omicron KP.3.1.1 variant continues to dominate, accounting for 57.2% of the virus samples sequenced during the September 29th to October 12th period. The new recombinant XEC variant is now the 2nd most common Covid mutant circulating in the US, accounting for 10.7% of US Covid infections during the same period. The updated vaccines are expected to provide reasonable protection against the KP.3.1.1 variant, but it's unclear if they will prevent infection altogether.

**COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US. Here's what you should know about it.**
The COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US, according to the CDC. The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.

**XEC Variant: Experts Warn of Potential Increase in COVID-19 Cases this Fall**
According to Dr. Peter Chin Hong, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of California in San Francisco, the XEC variant is a recombinant of two other variants, KS 1.1. and KP 3.3. 'It has a mutation that we don't know much about,' he said, warning that the reason people are paying attention is that it seemed to rise particularly in Germany, where it represents around 15% of cases, and in the UK, 17%. 'In the US, it hasn't reached that level yet, but it could come in the winter and be a bit more transmissible,' Dr. Hong noted. He considered the situation 'not to cause serious problems, because immunity is generally high' and emphasized that 'the most important thing is to get vaccinated, to protect yourself from serious illness, hospitalization, and death.' The dominant subvariant in the US at the moment is KP 3.1, responsible for around 50% of cases. 'It's part of the Omicron family, and somehow it figured out how to stay in the population, spread very successfully, and keep mutating,' Dr. Hong said.

**Free COVID tests return as CDC says this one variant now accounts for nearly 60% of cases**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 now accounts for nearly 60% of positive infections in the United States, according to the agency's Nowcast data tracker. This variant first became the leading variant in the two-week period starting on July 21 and ending on August 3. Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, stated, 'The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023.' The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced that households across the nation can obtain four free at-home COVID-19 tests while supplies last. Dawn O'Connell, HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said, 'Before you visit with your family and friends this holiday season, take a quick test and help keep them safe from COVID-19.' The tests will be able to detect the dominant COVID-19 variants now circulating, according to the CDC.

**XEC COVID-19 Variant Emerges: Here's What We Know**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has emerged in multiple regions worldwide, including the US, according to the CDC. However, the CDC has stated that no specific symptoms are associated with the variant. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokeswoman, said, 'Please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we're seeing in the US.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants, including XEC, but Norman stated that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' GAVI, a global health organization, also stated that XEC is likely to have similar symptoms to other COVID variants, such as a high temperature, sore throat, and body aches. Norman also noted that XEC is a recombinant variant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and that recombinants are not new, as seen with the XBB recombinant variant in 2023. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which are expected to work against all circulating variants.

**Is the hybrid COVID variant XEC in the US? What to know about the new strain that's more contagious**
The hybrid COVID-19 strain XEC, a recombinant of the Omicron variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been reported in at least 25 US states, according to RTI International epidemiologist Joëlla W. Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. The dominant COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for over 50% of cases in the US, according to recent CDC projections.

**XEC Variant of COVID-19 Gaining Traction, But KP.3.1.1 Remains Dominant in US**
The XEC variant of COVID-19 is gaining traction, with some experts predicting it will become the dominant strain this fall. According to Raj Rajnarayanan, a professor at Nyitcom-Arkansas State University, XEC has the potential to become the most circulating lineage by November, currently circulating at around 5-7% globally. Eric Topol, a scientist at Scripps Research, also believes XEC is the most likely to take hold. However, the CDC reports that KP.3.1.1 is currently the dominant strain in the US, representing over 50% of cases. The CDC also notes that there are no specific symptoms associated with XEC or other co-circulating strains. Experts recommend getting vaccinated with updated vaccines, which are expected to provide good protection in the upcoming winter. Some experts are cautious about XEC's evolution, noting that it is a recombinant of KP.3.3 and KS.1.1, and that its success may be due to a mutation inherited from KP.3.3. However, one expert notes that XEC's 'spike' protein is almost identical to that of KP.3.1.1, and that the differences in other viral regions may be insignificant.

**More free COVID-19 tests are coming. Here's how to order yours in NC**
The US government is offering a seventh round of free COVID-19 tests, with up to four tests available per household. The tests will be able to detect the dominant variants of the virus, including subvariant KP.3.1.1, which makes up 37% of cases in the US. According to the CDC, the new tests will also be able to detect subvariant KP.3, which makes up over 16% of cases. In North Carolina, wastewater treatment plants are still measuring COVID-19 levels through viral particles present in wastewater. The NC Department of Health and Human Services is tracking levels of the virus, with recent measurements showing high levels in several areas, including Boone and Spruce Pine. The CDC warns that symptoms of COVID-19 can be different based on the variant, and advises checking the CDC website for more information.

**This dominant COVID-19 variant accounts for over 50% of cases, new CDC data shows**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for 52.7% of positive infections in the United States, followed by KP.2.3 at 12.2%. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that KP.3.1.1 first became the leading variant in the two-week period starting on July 21st and ending on August 3rd. Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, stated, 'The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023.' The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months old and older get the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, and Norman advises the elderly and those who are immunocompromised to get vaccinated to protect themselves from COVID-19. Norman also stated, 'At this time, we anticipate that COVID-19 treatments and vaccines will continue to work against all circulating variants.' The federal government will provide free test kits to people across the U.S., with orders available on the site COVIDtest.gov starting in late September.

**Scientists Warn of Rapid Spread of New Mutated Coronavirus XEC**
Scientists are warning that the new mutated coronavirus, 'the most contagious', known as XEC, is spreading rapidly across Europe and may become the dominant strain soon. According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute's Translational Research Institute in La Jolla, 'At this stage, it appears that the XEC variant is the most likely to spread.' Researchers had predicted in August that this variant would spread faster in a few weeks to a month. XEC, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, was first reported in Berlin, Germany in June and is now spreading 'very quickly' across Europe, North America, and Asia, according to COVID-19 data analyst Mike Hoenig. Slovenia reported high infection rates in August, with over 10% of COVID-19 cases in the country containing XEC. Experts say the new strain, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, has some new mutations that may help it spread this fall. They explain that XEC is a hybrid of previously discovered Omicron sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. KS.1.1 is a type of the FLiRT family of sub-variants, while KP.3.3 belongs to the FLuQE category. So far, more than 500 samples from 27 countries, including Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Portugal, and China, have been found to contain XEC. Analysts point to strong growth of the variant in Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. As the virus continues to evolve, data shows that XEC is growing steadily every day with an advantage over previously known sub-variants. Its symptoms are similar to those of previous COVID-19 variants, including fever, sore throat, cough, loss of smell, loss of appetite, and body aches. However, since it is still just a sub-lineage of the same Omicron variant, experts say that following vaccination and booster shots will provide sufficient protection against severe illness and hospitalization. They also advise practicing good hygiene and taking steps to improve air quality. Researchers are calling for close monitoring of the XEC variant to better understand its symptoms.

**New COVID variant XEC now in half of states. Here's what to know.**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has been spotted in half of the states across the United States, according to preliminary data from the global virus database GISAID. Health officials are not raising concern about this variant, unlike some previous, more highly mutated strains. The variant's emergence comes as COVID-19 trends remain 'high' but are now largely slowing after a summer wave of infections. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modelers estimate that the virus will likely climb again over the winter, peaking in mid-January. Carla Finkielstein, head of the molecular diagnostics lab at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, said, 'We do not see a particular trend. We should keep an eye on the samples coming and continue genomic screening more broadly.' The CDC is not aware of any specific symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Americans are still recommended to get this fall and winter's round of updated COVID-19 vaccines, which target the KP.2 strain of the virus.

**New Covid-19 Variant XEC: Will it Cause a Surge in Cases this Fall?**
According to Forbes, the summer of 2024 has been dubbed the 'Covid summer' due to the significant increase in coronavirus cases in July 2022, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through wastewater monitoring. However, there is a lack of data on the current situation, as many people have stopped taking Covid-19 tests, and those who do take them often do not report the results. As a result, the number of Covid-19 cases is likely significantly underestimated. The summer surge, which likely began in early June, was caused by sub-variants KP.3.1.1 and KP.3.3 in the FLiRT sub-lineage. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute, stated that the spread of the new variant XEC 'is just beginning' and will take a few months to establish itself and cause its own wave. Topol added that XEC is likely to become the dominant variant, but it will take several months for its spread to reach high levels. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2022, with 775 million confirmed cases and over 7 million deaths reported from the start of the pandemic to the end of June 2024.

**New Corona Variant 'Even More Infectious': A Potential Wave of Infections Looms**
A new study suggests that the latest Corona variant, KP. 3.1.1, is even more infectious than its predecessor. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), this variant is responsible for 72% of all infections in Germany. The number of Corona infections is already on the rise, as shown by the RKI's wastewater monitoring and the Health Ministry's infection radar. Timo Ulrichs, a virologist, said, 'The studies on this new subvariant of JN.1 show that the mutations have given the virus a higher reproduction number and thus a higher fitness for spreading.' A severe infection wave may be looming. However, the symptoms of a Covid-19 infection caused by KP. 3.1.1 are largely similar to those of previous variants, including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and loss of taste or smell. There is currently no evidence that this variant leads to more severe disease courses. The Standing Vaccination Commission recommends that people over 60 continue to get vaccinated, as they are at a particularly high risk of severe Covid-19.

**New Coronavirus Variants May Be Evading Immunity**
According to the Rospotrebnadzor molecular-genetic monitoring data, the proportion of circulating variants of the new coronavirus KP.3 and LB.1, which are part of the FLiRT subline, has increased by 2.5 times in the Russian Federation over the past two to three weeks. 'These variants have special mutations in the spike protein, which allows the virus to evade the immune response while maintaining its ability to effectively infect cells,' the Rospotrebnadzor statement said. The agency noted that the sharp increase in the variants led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Russia at the beginning of September 2024. The operational headquarters for combating COVID-19 previously reported a 17.3% increase in COVID-19 cases in Russia over the past week.

**Russia Sees Rise in COVID-19 Variants Evading Immune System**
According to Rospotrebnadzor, there is a significant increase in COVID-19 variants that can evade the immune system, leading to a rise in COVID-19 cases in Russia in early September. The variants LB.1 and KP.3 'demonstrate increased infectivity compared to their predecessor' and 'a mutation in LB.1 significantly enhances its ability to evade the immune response.' The press service of Rospotrebnadzor stated, 'The sharp increase in the proportion of these variants, combined with seasonal factors, has led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Russia in early September 2024.' The agency also noted that, according to molecular-genetic monitoring, the proportion of circulating variants of the new coronavirus KP.3 and LB.1, belonging to the FLiRT subline, has increased by 2.5 times in the last two to three weeks. 'These variants have special mutations in the spike protein, allowing the virus to evade the immune response while maintaining its ability to effectively infect cells,' Rospotrebnadzor said.

**Corona-Herbstwelle: Dominant KP.3.1.1 variant makes people more susceptible to infection**
According to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately 1% of the population in Germany has been newly infected with COVID-19 in the past week, with about 1,000 people per 100,000 inhabitants infected. The data is based on the Grippeweb survey system, which has around 8,500 volunteers providing anonymous health information to the RKI once a week. The results are generally reliable and consistent with the data obtained through wastewater monitoring. The number of severe cases remains low, with about two people per million inhabitants requiring intensive care for COVID-19, mainly affecting people over 60 years old. Since October 2023, around 400,000 COVID-19 infections have been confirmed through PCR tests, with about a third (133,000) requiring hospitalization. The dominant variant of the virus is KP.3.1.1, which accounts for 72% of all infections and is part of the FLIRT variants. Japanese scientists have found that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious than its predecessors XBB.1.5 and JN.1, and that antibodies formed against these variants are less effective against the current variant. US media have reported that patients with KP.3.1.1 infections are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. The overall situation regarding respiratory infections remains stable, with around 4.4 million people in Germany newly infected in the past week, a typical value for this time of year. However, there have been changes in the age groups, with a decrease in new infections among children and an increase among adults.

**COVID-19 remained at 'very high' activity levels across the US: See latest data**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half of the United States reported 'very high' levels of COVID-19 activity last month. The CDC relies on wastewater data to track the virus, which often lags several weeks behind current case counts. As of Aug. 31, 23 states have reported 'very high' levels of wastewater viral activity nationwide. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker projected the KP.3.1.1 variant accounting for 42.2% of positive infections, followed by KP.2.3 at 14.6% in the two-week stretch starting Aug.18 and ending Aug. 31. Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, stated, 'The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023.' The CDC data shows a decrease in positive COVID-19 cases in six Southern states, with a COVID-19 test positivity rate of 16.3% for the week of Aug. 25 to Aug. 31, a decrease of -0.4% from the prior week.

**New COVID-19 Wave Hits US and Europe: FLiRT and XEC Variants Cause Concern**
A new wave of COVID-19 is spreading in the US and Europe, with the FLiRT variant being the most dominant strain in the US. According to the Economic Times, FLiRT is a sub-variant of Omicron, and its sub-variants KP.3, KP.2, and KP.1.1 have been detected in 36.9%, 24.4%, and 9.1% of infections respectively. The CDC reports that the number of COVID-19 cases in 7 US states is increasing, with 17% of tests coming back positive. This has led to an increase in hospitalizations, although the rate of increase is slowing in some states. The FLiRT variant is highly contagious but has mild symptoms. In Europe, the XEC sub-variant is causing concern, with cases reported in several countries. Scientists are monitoring the situation closely, and a California physician predicts that XEC will become the dominant variant in the coming time. Currently, there is no vaccine available that provides protection against the new variants. A new vaccine that targets Omicron is expected to be available in the US in September, but its effectiveness against the new strain is unclear. 'It is a matter of concern that the new variants are spreading rapidly, and we need to be prepared to face the challenge,' said a health expert.

The Africa CDC is monitoring the COVID-19 sub-variant XEC, a recombinant of the JN.1 and KP.3 variants, which has been detected in 43 countries across Europe, Asia, and North America. In Africa, Botswana reported one XEC case from a hospitalized European traveler. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated XEC as a variant under monitoring (VUMs). Preliminary data suggests that XEC may have increased transmissibility and immune evasion, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe illness than previous Omicron variants. Africa CDC advises Member States to strengthen sentinel and genomic surveillance and be cautious in their approach to XEC, as additional evidence is needed to determine its impact.

**Why You Might Need Two COVID-19 Shots This Season**
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that seniors and people who are immunocompromised get two COVID-19 shots this season, six months apart, to stay protected against the disease. This decision follows a summer COVID-19 surge that led to more hospitalizations among vulnerable Americans. Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of global health and infectious diseases at Stanford University, says that the additional dose will help to keep older people protected throughout the year, reducing the risk of hospitalization from the disease. The current mRNA vaccines target the KP.2 variant, but the dominant version causing infections in the U.S. right now is the KP.3.1.1 variant. Dr. Steven Furr, board chair of the American Academy of Family Physicians, says that the vaccine still provides sufficient protection from severe disease, and that it decreases hospitalizations and risk of death. However, vaccination rates are still relatively low, and family physicians are struggling to get enough doses to meet demand. 'The point of [vaccination] has never been to stop all infections,' says Maldonado. 'We’ve never had the aim of stopping transmission and all infections. The idea was to stop hospitalizations and stop deaths.'

**COVID-19 Variant XEC Is Highly Transmissible: Should We Be Worried?**
A new COVID-19 variant, XEC, has emerged in the United States and is rapidly spreading, potentially becoming the dominant strain this winter. According to health experts, XEC is a subvariant of Omicron, first detected in Germany in June 2024, and is not currently believed to cause more severe symptoms than other recent strains. However, COVID-19 infections still pose a greater risk for certain people, like older adults and those with weakened immune systems. Dr. Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that XEC's rapid spread in some European countries indicates its potential to become the dominant strain in the coming months. Current COVID-19 vaccines, updated for the 2024-2025 season, are expected to provide some level of protection against XEC, and vaccination is recommended for everyone aged six months and older to help minimize the spread of the virus. Dr. Roberts advises following standard precautions, such as staying away from sick individuals, wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, and considering antivirals like Paxlovid if you test positive for COVID-19.

**New COVID-19 Variants: KP.3 and XEC**
There has been a rise in COVID-19 infections in Europe, with a test positivity rate of over 20% in some countries. In the US, hospitalizations have increased, likely due to a wave of COVID-19 infections in Singapore. As we move into autumn and winter in the Northern Hemisphere, concerns are growing about two new variants: KP.3 and XEC. KP.3 has been designated as a global concerning variant (VOC) by the US CDC, but only in the US. The CDC recommends that people get an updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025. KP.3 is a subvariant of the Omicron variant, and XEC is a recombinant variant related to KP.3. According to Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology, XEC is likely a recombination between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1. XEC was first detected in Germany in June, but it is not yet listed on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. The focus in Germany remains on KP.3.1.1, which is dominant and considered more contagious than previous variants. According to Sandra Ciesek, a virologist, it is not surprising that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious, as the virus constantly mutates to find new ways to infect people. However, this does not mean that the variant causes more severe illness. The FLiRT variants, including KP.3 and XEC, are considered potentially more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2 due to mutations in key areas of the spike protein. Paul Hunter, a medical professor at the University of East Anglia, said that FLiRT is a serious concern, as it allows the virus to evade immunity and reproduce more effectively. The CDC has stated that KP.3.1.1 was likely responsible for 30-40% of clinical COVID-19 cases in the US in mid-August, and that the risks associated with this variant are particularly acute for people over 65 and children under 2.

**CDC: XEC COVID-19 variant circulating in the US**
The XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the United States, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases reported in the country as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. The variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has spread across Germany, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom come from the XEC lineage, but 'current information doesn't suggest we should be more concerned about this variant.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' The CDC spokesperson recommended that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the United States, with 'high' levels reported in most New England states, the Pacific Northwest, and several mountain region states.

**The Emergence of the New XEC Variant: A Concern for Public Health**
The emergence of the new XEC variant of the coronavirus has raised concerns about its high transmissibility and potential impact on public health. The variant is believed to have originated from the combination of KP.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants. According to Dr. François Balloux, a computer scientist and director of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at University College London, 'the XEC gene is likely the result of a genetic recombination between the KP.3.3 and KS.1.1 subvariants.' The XEC variant was first detected in Germany in June, but it has not been reported on the COVID-19 dashboard of the Robert Koch Institute. Dr. Sandra Ciesek, a virologist at the German Center for Infection Research, stated that 'the emergence of KP.3.1.1 is not surprising, given its higher transmissibility.' She added that 'the virus continues to evolve in search of new ways to spread, but this does not mean that the variant causes a more severe disease.' Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, noted that 'the term FLiRT seems like an odd abbreviation, but it remains stuck in my mind due to its serious implications.' FLiRT plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to grow and bind to living cells, making it easier for it to infect and spread. A study published in July 2024 found that the KP.2 subvariant has 'a greater ability to evade the immunity induced by the vaccine,' reflecting its evolution and adaptation to the immune response. Additionally, the KP.2 subvariant has been shown to replicate more efficiently compared to the original JN.1 variant. The KP.3.1.1 subvariant has been responsible for 30-40% of COVID-19 clinical samples in the United States in mid-August 2024, indicating a significant increase from the previous week's rate of 20-26%, which suggests its rapid spread over a short period.

**COVID genomic surveillance details rise, evolution of JN.1 in US this year**
New genomic surveillance data published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report shows that JN.1 and its descendants have been the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants in 2024, and are still evolving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program analyzed 208,357 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 56 US jurisdictions from May 2023 through September 2024. The data shows that JN.1 emerged in the US and rapidly became the dominant variant, causing surges in COVID-19 cases in winter 2024. Further surges were seen in summer 2024 due to the emergence of JN.1 descendant lineages with immune escape and increased transmissibility. The authors conclude that continued monitoring is necessary to update COVID-19 vaccines and anticipate future surges in COVID-19 activity, as 'the pattern of divergent variant emergence followed by subsequent stepwise evolutionary changes continues.'

**New COVID XEC variant: What you need to know**
The COVID-19 pandemic is seeing a rise in infections, particularly in the US, where the number of hospitalizations has increased. Two new variants, KP.3 and XEC, have been identified, with XEC being a 'recombinant' variant related to KP.3. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that people get an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine. Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology, stated that XEC is a 'likely recombinant between the subvariants KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.' The Robert Koch Institute's COVID Dashboard has not yet reported XEC, but it has been detected in Germany in June. Sandra Ciesek, a virologist, said that the virus keeps mutating in search of new ways to infect people, but that doesn't mean that the variant causes a more severe illness. The FLiRT variants, including KP.3, appear to have a potential to be more dangerous than previous versions of SARS-CoV-2. A paper published in July 2024 suggested that KP.2 had 'a greater ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity,' and that it reproduced more effectively than its 'parent' variant JN.1.

**This Weeks Covid spiel includes current details on variant proportions**
The latest Covid-19 data from the CDC shows a continued decline in cases and hospitalizations. The test positivity rate fell to 7.7% during the week ending October 5th, down from 9.5% the previous week. Covid cases accounted for 0.8% of hospital emergency room patients, down from 1.1% the previous week. The CDC's national reading for viral activity in wastewater has fallen to 'LOW', with all four major CDC regions also showing a decline. The Omicron KP.3.1.1 variant continues to dominate, accounting for 57.2% of the virus samples sequenced during the September 29th to October 12th period. The new recombinant XEC variant is now the 2nd most common Covid mutant circulating in the US, accounting for 10.7% of US Covid infections during the same period. The updated vaccines are expected to provide reasonable protection against the KP.3.1.1 variant, but it's unclear if they will prevent infection altogether.

**XEC COVID-19 Variant Now Circulating in the US: CDC Data**
The XEC COVID-19 variant is now circulating in the US, making up about 10% of all COVID-19 cases as of October 13, according to the CDC's Nowcast tracking tool. It is now the second most common COVID-19 strain in the country, behind the K.P.3.1.1 variant. The XEC variant is a recombinant of the Omicron strain and has been spreading across Europe. A CDC official described XEC as a 'recombinant, or hybrid, of the closely related Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3.' UK Health Security Agency epidemiologist Jamie Lopez Bernal said that their surveillance has shown that about 1 in 10 COVID-19 cases in the UK come from the XEC lineage, but current information doesn't suggest that XEC is more severe. The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants in the population, including XEC, but stressed that specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get one of the updated COVID-19 vaccines that were signed off by the FDA over the summer. COVID-19 levels are currently at 'low' levels across the US, with the exception of a few states in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the mountain region.

**COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US. Here's what you should know about it.**
The COVID-19 XEC variant is now circulating in the US, according to the CDC. The variant, a recombinant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been seen in hundreds of cases in Germany, France, Denmark, and Netherlands. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker shows that the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for 57.2% of positive infections, followed by XEC at 10.7% in the two-week stretch starting on Sept. 29 and ending on Oct. 12. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokesperson, said, 'CDC is monitoring the XEC variant.' The CDC has not reported any new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2. The basic symptoms of COVID-19 can appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. The CDC advises seeking medical attention if you have the following symptoms: 'CDC is not aware of new or unusual symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2,' Norman said.

**XEC Variant: Experts Warn of Potential Increase in COVID-19 Cases this Fall**
According to Dr. Peter Chin Hong, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of California in San Francisco, the XEC variant is a recombinant of two other variants, KS 1.1. and KP 3.3. 'It has a mutation that we don't know much about,' he said, warning that the reason people are paying attention is that it seemed to rise particularly in Germany, where it represents around 15% of cases, and in the UK, 17%. 'In the US, it hasn't reached that level yet, but it could come in the winter and be a bit more transmissible,' Dr. Hong noted. He considered the situation 'not to cause serious problems, because immunity is generally high' and emphasized that 'the most important thing is to get vaccinated, to protect yourself from serious illness, hospitalization, and death.' The dominant subvariant in the US at the moment is KP 3.1, responsible for around 50% of cases. 'It's part of the Omicron family, and somehow it figured out how to stay in the population, spread very successfully, and keep mutating,' Dr. Hong said.

**Free COVID tests return as CDC says this one variant now accounts for nearly 60% of cases**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 now accounts for nearly 60% of positive infections in the United States, according to the agency's Nowcast data tracker. This variant first became the leading variant in the two-week period starting on July 21 and ending on August 3. Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, stated, 'The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023.' The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced that households across the nation can obtain four free at-home COVID-19 tests while supplies last. Dawn O'Connell, HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said, 'Before you visit with your family and friends this holiday season, take a quick test and help keep them safe from COVID-19.' The tests will be able to detect the dominant COVID-19 variants now circulating, according to the CDC.

**XEC COVID-19 Variant Emerges: Here's What We Know**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has emerged in multiple regions worldwide, including the US, according to the CDC. However, the CDC has stated that no specific symptoms are associated with the variant. Rosa Norman, a CDC spokeswoman, said, 'Please continue to check the COVID Data Tracker for updated information on the common variants we're seeing in the US.' The CDC is monitoring the emergence of variants, including XEC, but Norman stated that 'specific cases cannot be associated with specific variants.' GAVI, a global health organization, also stated that XEC is likely to have similar symptoms to other COVID variants, such as a high temperature, sore throat, and body aches. Norman also noted that XEC is a recombinant variant of the Omicron lineages KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, and that recombinants are not new, as seen with the XBB recombinant variant in 2023. The CDC recommends that people aged 6 months and older get a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which are expected to work against all circulating variants.

**Is the hybrid COVID variant XEC in the US? What to know about the new strain that's more contagious**
The hybrid COVID-19 strain XEC, a recombinant of the Omicron variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, has been reported in at least 25 US states, according to RTI International epidemiologist Joëlla W. Adams. While there's no indication that XEC will increase the severity of the virus, it could potentially become a dominant strain due to its increased contagiousness. However, current COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots are effective against XEC as it is a hybrid of two Omicron strains. Adams said, 'We often use what happens in Europe as a good indication of what might happen here.' The CDC continues to monitor the emergence of variants in the population and recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the virus. The dominant COVID-19 variant KP.3.1.1 accounts for over 50% of cases in the US, according to recent CDC projections.

**XEC Variant of COVID-19 Gaining Traction, But KP.3.1.1 Remains Dominant in US**
The XEC variant of COVID-19 is gaining traction, with some experts predicting it will become the dominant strain this fall. According to Raj Rajnarayanan, a professor at Nyitcom-Arkansas State University, XEC has the potential to become the most circulating lineage by November, currently circulating at around 5-7% globally. Eric Topol, a scientist at Scripps Research, also believes XEC is the most likely to take hold. However, the CDC reports that KP.3.1.1 is currently the dominant strain in the US, representing over 50% of cases. The CDC also notes that there are no specific symptoms associated with XEC or other co-circulating strains. Experts recommend getting vaccinated with updated vaccines, which are expected to provide good protection in the upcoming winter. Some experts are cautious about XEC's evolution, noting that it is a recombinant of KP.3.3 and KS.1.1, and that its success may be due to a mutation inherited from KP.3.3. However, one expert notes that XEC's 'spike' protein is almost identical to that of KP.3.1.1, and that the differences in other viral regions may be insignificant.

**More free COVID-19 tests are coming. Here's how to order yours in NC**
The US government is offering a seventh round of free COVID-19 tests, with up to four tests available per household. The tests will be able to detect the dominant variants of the virus, including subvariant KP.3.1.1, which makes up 37% of cases in the US. According to the CDC, the new tests will also be able to detect subvariant KP.3, which makes up over 16% of cases. In North Carolina, wastewater treatment plants are still measuring COVID-19 levels through viral particles present in wastewater. The NC Department of Health and Human Services is tracking levels of the virus, with recent measurements showing high levels in several areas, including Boone and Spruce Pine. The CDC warns that symptoms of COVID-19 can be different based on the variant, and advises checking the CDC website for more information.

**Scientists Warn of Rapid Spread of New Mutated Coronavirus XEC**
Scientists are warning that the new mutated coronavirus, 'the most contagious', known as XEC, is spreading rapidly across Europe and may become the dominant strain soon. According to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute's Translational Research Institute in La Jolla, 'At this stage, it appears that the XEC variant is the most likely to spread.' Researchers had predicted in August that this variant would spread faster in a few weeks to a month. XEC, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, was first reported in Berlin, Germany in June and is now spreading 'very quickly' across Europe, North America, and Asia, according to COVID-19 data analyst Mike Hoenig. Slovenia reported high infection rates in August, with over 10% of COVID-19 cases in the country containing XEC. Experts say the new strain, a sub-lineage of the 'Omicron' variant, has some new mutations that may help it spread this fall. They explain that XEC is a hybrid of previously discovered Omicron sub-variants KS.1.1 and KP.3.3. KS.1.1 is a type of the FLiRT family of sub-variants, while KP.3.3 belongs to the FLuQE category. So far, more than 500 samples from 27 countries, including Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, Ukraine, Portugal, and China, have been found to contain XEC. Analysts point to strong growth of the variant in Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. As the virus continues to evolve, data shows that XEC is growing steadily every day with an advantage over previously known sub-variants. Its symptoms are similar to those of previous COVID-19 variants, including fever, sore throat, cough, loss of smell, loss of appetite, and body aches. However, since it is still just a sub-lineage of the same Omicron variant, experts say that following vaccination and booster shots will provide sufficient protection against severe illness and hospitalization. They also advise practicing good hygiene and taking steps to improve air quality. Researchers are calling for close monitoring of the XEC variant to better understand its symptoms.

**New COVID variant XEC now in half of states. Here's what to know.**
A new COVID-19 variant called XEC has been spotted in half of the states across the United States, according to preliminary data from the global virus database GISAID. Health officials are not raising concern about this variant, unlike some previous, more highly mutated strains. The variant's emergence comes as COVID-19 trends remain 'high' but are now largely slowing after a summer wave of infections. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention modelers estimate that the virus will likely climb again over the winter, peaking in mid-January. Carla Finkielstein, head of the molecular diagnostics lab at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, said, 'We do not see a particular trend. We should keep an eye on the samples coming and continue genomic screening more broadly.' The CDC is not aware of any specific symptoms associated with XEC or any other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Americans are still recommended to get this fall and winter's round of updated COVID-19 vaccines, which target the KP.2 strain of the virus.

**New Covid-19 Variant XEC: Will it Cause a Surge in Cases this Fall?**
According to Forbes, the summer of 2024 has been dubbed the 'Covid summer' due to the significant increase in coronavirus cases in July 2022, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through wastewater monitoring. However, there is a lack of data on the current situation, as many people have stopped taking Covid-19 tests, and those who do take them often do not report the results. As a result, the number of Covid-19 cases is likely significantly underestimated. The summer surge, which likely began in early June, was caused by sub-variants KP.3.1.1 and KP.3.3 in the FLiRT sub-lineage. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Institute, stated that the spread of the new variant XEC 'is just beginning' and will take a few months to establish itself and cause its own wave. Topol added that XEC is likely to become the dominant variant, but it will take several months for its spread to reach high levels. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2022, with 775 million confirmed cases and over 7 million deaths reported from the start of the pandemic to the end of June 2024.

**New Corona Variant 'Even More Infectious': A Potential Wave of Infections Looms**
A new study suggests that the latest Corona variant, KP. 3.1.1, is even more infectious than its predecessor. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), this variant is responsible for 72% of all infections in Germany. The number of Corona infections is already on the rise, as shown by the RKI's wastewater monitoring and the Health Ministry's infection radar. Timo Ulrichs, a virologist, said, 'The studies on this new subvariant of JN.1 show that the mutations have given the virus a higher reproduction number and thus a higher fitness for spreading.' A severe infection wave may be looming. However, the symptoms of a Covid-19 infection caused by KP. 3.1.1 are largely similar to those of previous variants, including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and loss of taste or smell. There is currently no evidence that this variant leads to more severe disease courses. The Standing Vaccination Commission recommends that people over 60 continue to get vaccinated, as they are at a particularly high risk of severe Covid-19.

**New Coronavirus Variants May Be Evading Immunity**
According to the Rospotrebnadzor molecular-genetic monitoring data, the proportion of circulating variants of the new coronavirus KP.3 and LB.1, which are part of the FLiRT subline, has increased by 2.5 times in the Russian Federation over the past two to three weeks. 'These variants have special mutations in the spike protein, which allows the virus to evade the immune response while maintaining its ability to effectively infect cells,' the Rospotrebnadzor statement said. The agency noted that the sharp increase in the variants led to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Russia at the beginning of September 2024. The operational headquarters for combating COVID-19 previously reported a 17.3% increase in COVID-19 cases in Russia over the past week.

According to Rospotrebnadzor, there is a significant increase in COVID-19 variants that can evade the immune system, leading to a rise in COVID-19 cases in Russia in early September. The variants LB.1 and KP.3 'demonstrate increased infectivity compared to their predecessor' and 'a mutation in LB.1 significantly enhances its ability to evade the immune response.' The press service of Rospotrebnadzor stated, 'The sharp increase in the proportion of these variants, combined with seasonal factors, has led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Russia in early September 2024.' The agency also noted that, according to molecular-genetic monitoring, the proportion of circulating variants of the new coronavirus KP.3 and LB.1, belonging to the FLiRT subline, has increased by 2.5 times in the last two to three weeks. 'These variants have special mutations in the spike protein, allowing the virus to evade the immune response while maintaining its ability to effectively infect cells,' Rospotrebnadzor said.

**Corona-Herbstwelle: Dominant KP.3.1.1 variant makes people more susceptible to infection**
According to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately 1% of the population in Germany has been newly infected with COVID-19 in the past week, with about 1,000 people per 100,000 inhabitants infected. The data is based on the Grippeweb survey system, which has around 8,500 volunteers providing anonymous health information to the RKI once a week. The results are generally reliable and consistent with the data obtained through wastewater monitoring. The number of severe cases remains low, with about two people per million inhabitants requiring intensive care for COVID-19, mainly affecting people over 60 years old. Since October 2023, around 400,000 COVID-19 infections have been confirmed through PCR tests, with about a third (133,000) requiring hospitalization. The dominant variant of the virus is KP.3.1.1, which accounts for 72% of all infections and is part of the FLIRT variants. Japanese scientists have found that KP.3.1.1 is more contagious than its predecessors XBB.1.5 and JN.1, and that antibodies formed against these variants are less effective against the current variant. US media have reported that patients with KP.3.1.1 infections are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. The overall situation regarding respiratory infections remains stable, with around 4.4 million people in Germany newly infected in the past week, a typical value for this time of year. However, there have been changes in the age groups, with a decrease in new infections among children and an increase among adults.

**COVID-19 remained at 'very high' activity levels across the US: See latest data**
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half of the United States reported 'very high' levels of COVID-19 activity last month. The CDC relies on wastewater data to track the virus, which often lags several weeks behind current case counts. As of Aug. 31, 23 states have reported 'very high' levels of wastewater viral activity nationwide. The CDC's Nowcast data tracker projected the KP.3.1.1 variant accounting for 42.2% of positive infections, followed by KP.2.3 at 14.6% in the two-week stretch starting Aug.18 and ending Aug. 31. Rosa Norman, a spokesperson at the CDC, stated, 'The KP.3.1.1 variant is very similar to other circulating variants in the United States. All current lineages are descendants of JN.1, which emerged in late 2023.' The CDC data shows a decrease in positive COVID-19 cases in six Southern states, with a COVID-19 test positivity rate of 16.3% for the week of Aug. 25 to Aug. 31, a decrease of -0.4% from the prior week.

**New COVID-19 Wave Hits US and Europe: FLiRT and XEC Variants Cause Concern**
A new wave of COVID-19 is spreading in the US and Europe, with the FLiRT variant being the most dominant strain in the US. According to the Economic Times, FLiRT is a sub-variant of Omicron, and its sub-variants KP.3, KP.2, and KP.1.1 have been detected in 36.9%, 24.4%, and 9.1% of infections respectively. The CDC reports that the number of COVID-19 cases in 7 US states is increasing, with 17% of tests coming back positive. This has led to an increase in hospitalizations, although the rate of increase is slowing in some states. The FLiRT variant is highly contagious but has mild symptoms. In Europe, the XEC sub-variant is causing concern, with cases reported in several countries. Scientists are monitoring the situation closely, and a California physician predicts that XEC will become the dominant variant in the coming time. Currently, there is no vaccine available that provides protection against the new variants. A new vaccine that targets Omicron is expected to be available in the US in September, but its effectiveness against the new strain is unclear. 'It is a matter of concern that the new variants are spreading rapidly, and we need to be prepared to face the challenge,' said a health expert.
