**Bluesky might be having its Justin Bieber moment**
Bluesky, a previously irrelevant social platform, is experiencing a rapid rise in users, nearly doubling its user base since late October. According to the New York Times, the small team of 20 employees has been working long hours to keep up with the demand. Despite having fewer accounts (21+ million) compared to Threads (275 million), Bluesky has more active web users in the US and UK, according to Similarweb. The sudden surge in users is attributed to several factors, including X's decision to allow third-party use of its user data to train AI models, which led to 5 million users joining Bluesky in just five days, as reported by Morning Brew.

**Threads to Show More Posts from Subscribed Users and Fewer Recommendations**
Threads, a Meta alternative, will start showing users more posts from people they are subscribed to and fewer recommendations, according to the platform's head, Adam Mosseri, as reported by The Verge. Mosseri stated that users should receive more interactions from people they are subscribed to than from random social media users. He also mentioned that the company is still working to balance the number of recommendations in the feed. This change was prompted by a large number of users switching to BlueSky, where all posts from people they are subscribed to are shown in chronological order. BlueSky's user base has grown from 15 million in September 2024 to 21 million in November 2024. Despite BlueSky's popularity, Threads still leads with a significant margin, with 15 million new users registering in November alone. However, the popularity of competitors has forced the company to make changes.

**Bluesky Shows More Major Growth - The Race Is On With X And Threads**
Bluesky, a social network competing with X, has reached 20 million users, a significant milestone that indicates it is closing the gap with X and Instagram Threads in terms of daily active users and website visits. According to analytics firm App Figures, Bluesky has been the top non-gaming app on Google Play for four days and the top app in Apple's App Store for six days straight. While Threads has 275 million monthly active users, Bluesky's growth rate suggests it may not stay behind for long. Similarweb notes that the gap between Bluesky and Threads' daily active users has shrunk from five times to 1.5 times, and X's dominance may be shifting. Bluesky's rapid rise shows there's still demand for an alternative to X that values privacy and transparency, potentially reshaping the social media landscape.

**Bluesky Surpasses 20 Million Users, Continuing Recent Growth**
Bluesky has surpassed 20 million users, continuing its recent growth. The decentralized service, which had 15 million users just a week ago, has tripled its user base in the past three months. Bluesky's current momentum is notable, despite being smaller than its competitors Threads and X. The app added 1 million new users in just 24 hours last week, similar to Threads' daily growth rate of 1 million new users for 'three months', according to Adam Mosseri's update last week. Threads has reached 275 million monthly users this month and added at least 15 million since November. Bluesky's recent growth is partly due to increasing frustration among some X users. There was a significant increase in traffic to Bluesky on November 7, the day after the presidential election, according to a report from SimilarWeb. This increase coincided with an increase in the number of users trying to deactivate their X accounts. Bluesky has also differentiated itself from its larger competitors. Last week, the company promised not to use user content to train AI models, unlike X's new privacy policy, which allows it to work with third parties to train AI models on users' past tweets. Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, said she doesn't want to 'add excitement to the network through ads', while Threads is reportedly planning to start its first ad experiment in January.

**Bluesky hits 20 Million users, rapidly closing gap with threads**
Bluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached 20 million users, closing the gap with Instagram Threads. According to Similarweb, Bluesky's daily active users (DAU) in the U.S. are now just 1.5 times behind Threads, a significant decrease from earlier. Bluesky has also surpassed Threads in daily website visits in the U.S. and the UK. The platform's mobile app usage has surged, with a 519% increase in usage following the U.S. mid-November elections. Several factors contributing to this growth include X's controversial decisions, such as selling user data and altering blocking features. Bluesky's growth momentum began in February 2023, with its user base growing from 9 million to 20 million in November. Since the U.S. elections, Bluesky has been gaining 100,000 new users daily. The platform's unique features, such as custom algorithms and personalized domain names, are helping it attract users seeking 'real' human connections and a more intimate experience.

**Bluesky Reaches 20 Million Users, Closes Gap with Instagram Threads**
Bluesky, despite having a user base of 20 million, still lags behind Instagram Threads' 275 million active monthly users. However, Bluesky's growth rate is noteworthy. According to Similarweb, Bluesky's daily active users (DAU) in the US have largely closed the gap with Threads. On November 15, during one of Bluesky's busiest days, Threads' leadership in the US was reduced to a 1.5 times difference. Additionally, Bluesky has surpassed Threads in daily website visits in the US and UK. Although Threads still maintains a small lead globally, Bluesky is rapidly closing the gap. Bluesky's mobile app has also seen a significant surge. Similarweb's data shows that its usage rate increased by 519% in the US after the November mid-term elections. The app reached the top spot on the US App Store on November 13, surpassing Threads and X. Android usage rates have also seen a year-over-year increase of over 360%. The reasons behind this growth include X's decision to sell user data to a AI company and change its blocking feature, as well as Elon Musk's use of X to support Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which has driven away many users. Bluesky has seen a significant surge in growth since its public launch in February 2023, with its user base increasing from 9 million in September to 20 million in November. Since the US elections, the platform has been gaining 100,000 new users per day. Bluesky is showing itself to be a serious competitor to social media giants X and Threads. The platform is attracting users who are looking for a more authentic experience, claiming to offer 'real' human connections. Bluesky's users can create their own algorithms, design their own starter packs, and have personalized domain names, which sets it apart from its competitors.

**8 Bluesky tips every new user should know**
Bluesky, an alternative social network to Twitter, has seen a significant surge in user growth, reaching over 20 million users in November 2024. The platform offers several benefits, including the ability to easily manage and block offensive posts and accounts, and a promise not to use user data to train AI chatbots. To make the most of Bluesky, users can use starter packs to find accounts, lists to discover new accounts, and customize their feed. They can also control their feed, use a custom domain, combat trolls, filter content, and avoid AI training. As Bluesky continues to grow, it is becoming a more popular platform for users looking for a friendlier and less toxic environment.

**Bluesky Reaches 20 Million Users, a 5 Million Increase in Just One Week**
Bluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached 20 million users, a 5 million increase in just one week. The app has tripled its user base in the last three months, with a recent growth rate similar to that of its competitor *Threads, which adds 1 million new users daily. Despite being smaller than *Threads and X, Bluesky's growth is notable. The app has topped the App Store for the last six days and was the top non-game app in Google Play for four consecutive days, according to App Figures. One reason for Bluesky's growth is user dissatisfaction with X, which led to a surge in traffic on November 7, the day after the presidential election. Bluesky stands out from its competitors with its app usage policies, such as a commitment not to use user content for training generative AI, unlike X's new privacy policy, which allows third parties to train AI models on user tweets, as stated by 'We are not going to use user content for training generative AI, unlike some other platforms.'

**Bluesky Surpasses 20 Million Users, Releases Version 1.94**
Bluesky has surpassed 20 million users, with a growth rate of over 1 million users per day in the past few days. To celebrate, CEO Jay Grayer has posted '20 fun facts about Bluesky'. The platform's user base has been rapidly increasing since the US presidential election and Elon Musk's increased influence. As of November 19, 2024, the user base had reached 19 million. On November 20, 2024, Grayer announced that Bluesky had surpassed 20 million users. The platform's data servers are named after mushrooms, including 'enoki', 'shiitake', and 'puffball'. The three largest countries on Bluesky are the United States, Japan, and Brazil. To commemorate the 20 million user milestone, Bluesky has released version 1.94, which includes a simplified settings menu and the display of both the post date on Bluesky and the original post date on other social media platforms when importing posts.

**Bluesky Has 20M+ Users After Hitting 15M On November 13**
Bluesky, a social media network and X competitor, has reached 20 million users, a significant milestone after hitting 15 million on November 13. According to TechCrunch, the app's rapid growth is closing the gap with Instagram Threads, with Bluesky overtaking Threads in daily website visits in the U.S. and U.K. Bluesky's user base is still smaller than Threads, but market intelligence firm Similarweb believes it could catch up if its current growth rate holds. The Musk-owned app X remains dominant, but Bluesky's momentum is notable, with several days of adding a million new users in a single 24-hour period. Bluesky has been the top app in Apple's App Store for six days and the top non-gaming app in Google Play for four days, according to analytics firm App Figure. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, 'a trickle is becoming a flood' for Bluesky, with many users leaving Elon Musk's X due to its issues with bots, extreme content, and misinformation.

**Bluesky hits 20 million users**
Bluesky, a decentralized social media service, has reached 20 million users, nearly tripling its user base in the last three months. The app has seen significant growth, with several days of adding over a million new users in a 24-hour period. Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, has stated that the company does not want to 'enshittify the network with ads.' In contrast, Bluesky's rival, Threads, plans to start experimenting with ads in January. Bluesky's growth is also attributed to mounting frustration from some X users, with a significant spike in traffic to Bluesky on November 7, the day after the presidential election. According to analytics firm App Figures, Bluesky has been the top app in Apple's App Store for the last six days and the top non-gaming app in Google Play for four days.

**Bluesky celebrates 19M users as it’s projected to hit 20M today**
Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, has reached 19 million users and is projected to hit 20 million today (November 19). The platform's user growth has accelerated, with a current growth rate of 6.49 users per second. According to social media researcher Axel Bruns, Bluesky has become a refuge for people who want to escape the far-right activism, misinformation, and hate speech on Elon Musk's X. Bruns stated, 'It's become a refuge for people who want to have the kind of social media experience that Twitter used to provide, but without all the far-right activism, the misinformation, the hate speech, the bots and everything else.' The influx of users has been attributed to the results of the 2024 US Election, with a more liberal community migrating from X to Bluesky. This is not the first time Bluesky has seen success due to changes on X, as around half a million people switched to Bluesky in mid-October after X announced plans to eliminate blocking.

**Why Bluesky Is the Social Media Platform to Watch in 2024**
Bluesky Social is a decentralized social network that allows users to publish short posts, photos, videos, and links to web pages. It was founded in October 2021 and went live in October 2023 with its iOS app. Users can follow other users, topics, and share posts. New features are regularly added to Bluesky. To join Bluesky, users can download the app or visit the website and create an account without an invite code, as of February 2024. The platform has 4.4 million users, with 2.1 million having made posts. While content can be viewed without an account, browsing the entire platform while logged out can be difficult.

**Bluesky Surges to 1 Million Users in 24 Hours, While X Loses Users**
Bluesky, an alternative to X, gained 1 million users in 24 hours, while X, owned by Elon Musk, lost users. According to Bluesky, '1,000,000 people have joined us in just the last day! Welcome and thank you for being here!'. This comes after Musk was appointed by the incoming US President, Donald Trump, to lead a new department. Since buying Twitter in 2022, Musk has relaxed moderation rules, allowing accounts linked to far-right movements to return to the platform. Despite this, X has 16 million users, a significant increase from 10 million in mid-September.

**Bluesky Surges to 1 Million New Users in 24 Hours, a Blow to X**
Bluesky, a social network presented as an alternative to X, announced on Friday that it has reached 1 million new users in 24 hours, a record number that coincides with the growing dissatisfaction with the platform owned by Elon Musk. 'It's official - 1,000,000 people have joined Bluesky in the last 24 hours! Welcome and thank you for being here,' the platform said in a message posted on both Bluesky and X. This surge in popularity comes as The Guardian and La Vanguardia announced that they will no longer publish content on X, which they consider a 'toxic media platform' that spreads 'disinformation.' Bluesky, initially created and funded by Twitter, has seen significant growth since its public launch in February 2023, with 16 million users, up from 10 million in mid-September. The platform is now led by Jay Grabber, its CEO.

**Bluesky Reaches 1 Million New Users in 24 Hours Amid X Exodus**
Bluesky, an alternative to X (formerly Twitter), has announced that it has reached 1 million new users in 24 hours. This comes after Elon Musk's appointment to a 'Commission on Government Efficiency' by Donald Trump, causing many users to flee X and join Bluesky. The platform stated, 'It's official - 1,000,000 people have joined Bluesky in the last 24 hours! Welcome and thank you for being here.' This record number coincides with Musk's nomination to the commission, which has been seen as a move to further polarize X. Bluesky, which has 16 million users, has seen a significant increase in growth since its launch in February 2023. The platform was initially created and funded by Twitter, but has since become a competitor to X, which has been criticized for its relaxed moderation policies and spread of misinformation.

**Bluesky Reaches 16 Million Users, 1 Million in 24 Hours, Despite Technical Issue**
Bluesky, a social media platform competing with X, has reached 16 million users, with 1 million new users in just 24 hours. This milestone was achieved despite a technical issue on Thursday, November 14, which was caused by a combination of factors, including a fiber cut, network problems at the datacenter, and DNS issues at Cloudflare. According to Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, the platform has higher engagement rates than X, with 'the number of subscribers being misleading.' Graber shared a post by scientist Andrew Dessler, who compared the engagement rates on X and Bluesky by posting the same message on both platforms. Bluesky's user base has been growing rapidly, with 10 million users in mid-September, 13 million in late October, and now over 16 million. This growth is partly due to X's controversies, such as its ban in Brazil and Elon Musk's support for Donald Trump, which led to a surge in Bluesky's user base.

While the platform still lags behind its main competitors, X (formerly Twitter) and Threads, it is gaining traction as a third option for those dissatisfied with the other two. Bluesky's unique features, such as its 'antitoxicidade' tool and user-customizable feed, are attracting users who are looking for an alternative to X. The platform is also experiencing growth in the US, particularly among Democrats who are dissatisfied with Elon Musk's leadership and the spread of misinformation on X. The Guardian, a prominent British newspaper, has also left X due to its toxic environment and Musk's influence on the platform's discourse.

**Bluesky Reaches 16 Million Users, Surpasses Threads in iOS Downloads**
Bluesky has added another million users in 24 hours, bringing its total to 16 million. This growth is largely due to the alliance between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Additionally, over 13,000 people have created accounts using the swifties.social domain, indicating they are fans of Taylor Swift. Bluesky has become the most downloaded free app on the iOS store in the US, surpassing ChatGPT and Threads. However, the company has faced two issues: a software problem causing the 'Invalide Handle' error and slow post loading, and three technical issues: a Cogent Communications fiber optic cut, a networking problem with a provider, and a Cloudflare DNS issue. Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, announced that Threads gained 15 million new users in November, to which Bluesky responded with irony, saying 'everyone is talking about Bluesky' and that it will not show ads, unlike Threads which will start showing ads in January 2025.

**Bluesky Reaches 1 Million Users in Just One Week, a Decentralized Alternative to X**
Bluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached one million users in just one week, topping the App Store charts. This surge in registrations follows the 2024 US elections, during which many users, primarily from the liberal side, left X (formerly Twitter) to migrate to Bluesky. According to Axel Bruns, a social network researcher, Bluesky represents an attractive alternative to Musk's X: 'It's become a refuge for those seeking a social experience similar to the old Twitter, but without the rise of far-right activism, disinformation, hate speech, bots, and other disturbing elements.' The liberal Twitter community has largely left X for Bluesky, with around half a million users switching after X announced plans to modify its blocking feature. The situation is also influenced by Elon Musk's close ties to the future US president, who supported the Republican candidate throughout the campaign. Bluesky's growth is part of its constant expansion, with 13 million users as of late October and a recent funding round of $15 million. The platform plans to use these funds to support and expand its community, strengthen trust and security measures, and promote its development ecosystem.

**Bluesky hits 15 million users, tops US App Store in Social Networking**
Bluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached 15.1 million registered users, making it the most downloaded app in the US App Store in the Social Networking category. This growth is attributed to people seeking alternatives to X (formerly Twitter) and Threads, with Bluesky experiencing rapid expansion, especially after a temporary ban on X in Brazil. According to a stats tracking website, Bluesky had only 2 million users in November 2023. The platform is planning to offer a paid subscription with extra features, similar to X Premium. Despite having fewer users than competitors, Bluesky is attracting those dissatisfied with X and Threads, with some users signing up at a rate of over a million per day.

Emily Liu, Bluesky's spokesperson, said, 'We're thrilled to welcome all these new people, from Swifties to urban planners.' Axel Bruns, a media and social network expert, explained, 'Bluesky has become a refuge for people who want to experience the same type of experience as Twitter, but without the extreme right activism, misinformation, hateful speech, bots, and all the rest.' Bluesky's ability to block or suspend problematic accounts and monitor harmful behavior makes it a more effective alternative to X, according to Bruns.

However, Bluesky emphasizes that the platform will remain free to use, unlike X, which charges users for posting and tries to encourage them to buy a premium subscription with controversial methods. Unlike X, Bluesky's paid subscribers will not receive special treatment, such as upranking or blue checks, and the platform will not sell user data or hyperfinancialize the social experience. Bluesky is also planning to introduce payment plans to support creators on the platform, with details to follow. Meanwhile, X is moving closer to LinkedIn by introducing a jobs tab in the app, allowing users to search and find jobs.

**Bluesky Reveals Plans for Subscription Model and Criticizes X**
Bluesky, a social media platform, announced that it has raised $15 million in a funding round. The company also revealed its plans, which include a subscription model. According to Rose Wang, the head of operations, the paid plan will offer features such as higher-quality video uploads and new customization options for profiles, such as colors and photo frame options. Bluesky also took a jab at X (formerly Twitter), stating that subscribers will not have increased reach for their posts. X Premium, on the other hand, gives more visibility to paid users' posts. 'Bluesky will always be free to use - we believe that information and debate should be easily accessible, not locked behind a paywall,' Wang wrote. Bluesky also rejected the use of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, stating that it will not 'hyperfinance' the social experience with tokens, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or similar. The platform has 13 million users, up from 1 million in July 2023, largely due to the migration of users from X, which has faced several controversies, including changes to its blocking feature and AI training policies.

**Bluesky Reaches 13 Million Users, Announces New Funding**
Bluesky, a potential challenger to Twitter, has reached 13 million users, with 2 million added in the last week due to changes at X. The platform has secured $15 million in Series A financing, led by Blockchain Capital, to continue its development. Bluesky is working on a subscription model and voluntary monetization path for creators, which could provide a more reliable path forward. However, it still lags behind Meta's Threads, which has 200 million active users. Bluesky's success depends on content and getting influential users to post exclusively on the platform, which could expand its audience and make it a more significant consideration.

**Bluesky Prepares to Launch Premium Subscription, a Different Approach to X**
Bluesky, a decentralized alternative to X (Twitter), has announced plans to launch a premium subscription with special features. The subscription will offer access to special features, but users will not receive a verified badge or increased visibility. According to Rose Wang, head of operations, 'The paid subscribers will not receive a special treatment in any other part of the application, such as increased visibility for premium accounts or blue badges next to their names.' The subscription is aimed at helping Bluesky cover its costs, including personnel and infrastructure expenses. The platform has raised $15 million in funding and plans to use the money to develop its premium subscription, improve the app, and invest in its Trust and Security department. Bluesky has over 13 million users, a small number compared to X (Twitter), Threads, or Instagram, but it has grown exponentially since opening up to the public in January 2024.

**Bluesky Sees Surge in Users Following X's Changes**
Bluesky has seen a significant increase in users, from 500,000 to over 1.2 million, following changes made by X. The changes, which were announced by Elon Musk in September 2024, include a modification to the block feature, stating that 'if your posts are public, accounts you've blocked can see them, but not interact with them.' This has been met with criticism from some X users, who argue that this change allows stalkers to continue viewing blocked users' posts. As one commentator noted, 'it's typical of the way you treat people when you disregard people's genuine security concerns.'
