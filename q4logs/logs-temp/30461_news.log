**US Housing Market Sees Slowing Growth, Experts Expect Continued Trend**
According to FactSet's analysis of analysts' estimates, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released by S&P Dow Jones Indices on November 26, is expected to show a 4.8% year-over-year increase in September, down from 5.2% in August, marking the sixth consecutive month of slowing growth. Experts believe that the increasing supply of housing will continue to support buyers' purchasing intentions and provide more room for negotiation, maintaining the overall housing price growth trend. The National Association of Realtors reported that as of September 2024, there were 1.36 million unsold homes in the US, a 20% increase from the same period last year. The August S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index showed a 4.2% year-over-year increase, lower than the 4.8% in July, but still a record high for 15 consecutive months. The current housing price surge in the US is mainly due to the sharp rise in mortgage interest rates, causing homeowners with low-interest mortgages to abandon their plans to switch homes, leading to a severe imbalance between supply and demand, and ultimately driving up housing prices. In October 2023, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate in the US reached 7.9%.

**Here's what the housing market will look like in 2025**
Zillow predicts a more active housing market in 2025 with more inventory and modest home value growth. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.

**This housing market map shows Zillow's revised 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, predicting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. According to Zillow economists, opposing forces are working to keep home values climbing, but only at a modest pace. They expect a gradual increase in existing home sales in the coming year, with an estimated 4.3 million sales in 2025, up slightly from 4.1 million transactions recorded in 2023 and 4 million projected for 2024. Zillow economists wrote, 'This is an upward revision to our outlook from last month. Opposing forces are working to keep home values climbing, but only at a modest pace.'

**This housing market map shows Zillow’s revised 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. They attribute this growth to low inventory, declining mortgage rates, and modest improvements in home sales indicators. However, they also note that modest increases in new listings and high mortgage rates will limit price growth. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to occur in 10 areas, including Atlantic City, NJ (+6.5%), and the weakest in 10 areas, including Lake Charles, LA (-7.8%). Some housing analysts remain skeptical about Florida's housing market, citing increased inventory and declining condo prices.

**British home prices to rise faster than inflation, rents even more**
According to a Reuters poll of 21 housing market experts, British home prices are expected to rise faster than inflation, while rental costs will increase even more. The average value of a British home is predicted to rise 3.1% next year and 4.0% in 2026, outpacing general inflation of 2.3% and 2.1% respectively. Urban rental costs are expected to increase 4-5% next year, squeezing the budgets of prospective homebuyers. Tony Williams at Building Value said, 'The restriction in supply of rental properties is rising quickly and it is outpacing the shortage of supply in the housing market - and thus rents will outpace house prices axiomatically.' However, British homebuilders have witnessed signs of improvement in recent months, and 13 of 15 respondents believe affordability will improve over the coming year, thanks to more competitive mortgage rates. Marcus Dixon at JLL said, 'More competitive mortgage rates, albeit not quite as low as some hoped, will help with affordability despite the forecast for modest price rises.'

**Will mortgage rates and home prices go down -2-**
Homeowners may see reduced insurance price hikes in 2025, according to Rick McCathron, president and CEO of Hippo, a home-insurance company. 'Consumers may still see rate increases in 2025, but not to the extent they saw over the last two years,' McCathron said. On the other hand, rent prices are expected to stay stable next year, with wage growth potentially outpacing rent growth, according to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. Renters in the Sun Belt may see more deals on rentals, while renters in other areas may see higher rent increases. Additionally, high interest rates are causing people to delay buying a home, with the median age of a renter increasing from 33 in 2021 to 42 in 2024.

**US Existing Home Sales Show Signs of Recovery**
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that the median home price in the US increased by 4.0% in October 2024, reaching $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of year-over-year growth. The percentage of first-time homebuyers in October 2024 was 27%, up from 26% in September but lower than 28% in October 2023. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate decreased to 6.78% as of November 14, 2024, down from 7.44% a year ago. The percentage of cash transactions in October 2024 was 27%, down from 29% in October 2023 and 30% in September 2024. The inventory of unsold homes increased by 19.1% year-over-year to 1.37 million, with a current sales pace indicating a 4.2-month supply, down from 3.6 months in October 2023 and 4.3 months in September 2024. The average days on market for sold homes in October 2024 was 29 days, up from 28 days in September and 23 days in October 2023. NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun stated that the worst of the housing market downturn may be behind us, with inventory increases and sales growth expected to follow. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB.US) rose 1.17% on Thursday, reaching a new high since November 11, with a year-to-date gain of 23.26%.

**Home sales jumped in October, and housing demand is set to pick up from here, NAR says**
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported a 3.4% increase in existing home sales in October, marking the first annual rise since July 2021. The group attributed the increase to more inventory of existing homes coming to market, giving prospective buyers more opportunities to purchase. However, buyers are still challenged by affordability issues, with the median existing home price climbing 4% to $407,200 in October, marking the 16th-straight month of price increases. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, stated, 'The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions.' Despite elevated mortgage rates, Yun expects them to stabilize. Real estate forecasters anticipate the housing market to remain tight in 2025, with Zillow predicting a 2.8% increase in home prices over the next 12 months and Bank of America analysts anticipating a 5% rise next year.

**US Housing Market Continues to Show Upward Trend**
The US housing market continues to show an upward trend, with prices increasing 0.5% in October, according to a report by Redfin. The report states that the low inventory of houses and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates are driving the price increase. Redfin's senior economist Sheharyar Bokhari said, 'Many people, especially first-time homebuyers, have been waiting for the election to end before making a decision to buy a house. Now that the election is over, we're seeing a rebound in homebuying demand, and in the next few months, we expect to see even more competition for homes, unless the number of available homes increases significantly, in which case, home prices may continue to rise.' Zillow's recent report predicts that home prices will increase by 2.6% this year and 2.8% in the next 12 months. The report attributes the price increase to low inventory and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates. However, if mortgage interest rates rise and inventory increases slightly, it may limit the price increase.

**Cities with highest share of affordable home listings: How Denver compares**
A recent analysis by Zillow found that the share of affordable homes in the US has increased to 28% in September, the highest level since February 2023. However, this relief may be short-lived as mortgage rates have ticked up again, with the average 30-year mortgage rate at 6.78% last week. According to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist for Zillow, 'Buyers should expect more ups and downs ahead for mortgage rates.' The share of affordable homes varies from market to market, with Austin, Texas seeing the biggest rise in affordable listings, increasing from 13% in October 2023 to 26% in October 2024. In Denver, 22.9% of home listings in October 2024 were considered affordable, slightly down from September 2024's 23%. Meanwhile, large markets in California and the Northeast are among the least affordable in the country.

**UK House Prices Rise for First Time in 7 Months, Exacerbating Housing Crisis**
According to the UK's Office for National Statistics, the rate of house price inflation in the UK has risen for the first time in 7 months, reaching over 10% in the capital city, exacerbating the housing crisis for renters. The data shows that house prices increased by 7.8% annually in the UK last month, ending a 7-month decline in the rate of increase. Additionally, house prices rose by 9.0% monthly, the highest monthly increase since February last year. In London, house prices increased by 4.10% annually, the highest increase in the UK, and by 2.1% monthly. This increase in house prices is a new setback for renters, who are already struggling with a housing crisis, despite the UK's consumer price inflation rate approaching the 2% target set by the Bank of England. The UK's housing market is still experiencing a shortage of available properties, with a 24% decrease in available rentals in September compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to Zillow UK. The new Labour government in the UK has promised to do a lot to alleviate the suffering of renters, who are mostly forced to rent due to their inability to afford the cost of owning a home. However, critics say that the government's proposals, which include a ban on evicting tenants without a court order and stricter environmental regulations, have exacerbated the problem by causing property owners to sell their units rather than rent them out. The average monthly rent in London has increased by 26% compared to early 2022, reaching £2172 ( $7,275) per month, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.

**Mortgage Rates Level Off After Short-Lived Relief, Zillow Analysis Shows**
A recent Zillow analysis shows that affordable home listings reached a 19-month high in September due to 'short-lived mortgage rate relief'. Mortgage rates averaged 6.18 percent in September, allowing a median-income household to afford 75,000 more homes on the market. However, rates have since risen to 6.78 percent, potentially causing some prospective buyers to retreat from the home-buying process. According to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist for Zillow Home Loans, 'affordability remains the top challenge for first-time home buyers especially, and buying power can change quickly with the unpredictable nature of mortgage rates.' Zillow expects rates to move lower into next year, but the path will be 'bumpy' and buyers should 'stay ready to move forward when the time is right for them.'

**St. Louis among cities with the highest share of affordable home listings**
A recent analysis by Zillow found that a typical U.S. household could afford nearly 28% of homes for sale in September, the highest share since February 2023. However, this relief may be short-lived as mortgage rates have ticked up again, with the average 30-year mortgage at 6.78% last week. Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist for Zillow, warned that buyers should expect more ups and downs ahead for mortgage rates. The share of affordable listings varies from market to market, with Austin, Texas, seeing the biggest rise in affordable listings, increasing from 13% in October 2023 to 26% in October 2024. In some major cities, the majority of home listings are affordable, including Pittsburgh, St. Louis, MO, Buffalo, NY, and Detroit, MI. However, large markets in California and the Northeast are among the least affordable in the country.

**Today’s Mortgage Rates Increase: November 19, 2024 Analysis**
Mortgage rates have increased recently, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate reaching 6.60% as of November 19, 2024. This rise is attributed to the strengthening economy, particularly in the labor market, which has placed upward pressure on interest rates. Despite expectations that rates might ease in 2025, many experts are cautious, citing the robust job market and high consumer spending. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should consider their unique financial situations and weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing, as current rates are higher than previous months. According to Zillow, average rates for various mortgage types include: 30-year fixed: 6.63%, 15-year fixed: 6.06%, 30-year FHA: 5.73%, 30-year VA: 6.03%, and 7/1 ARM: 7.20%.

**Seattle Housing Market Predictions for the Next 5 Years**
The Seattle housing market is expected to experience a slowdown in price growth over the next 5 years, with moderate price growth in the short-term, stabilization in the medium-term, and gradual price appreciation in the long-term. According to Redfin and Zillow, the median sale price of a home in Seattle has increased by 9.4% to $874,950 in September 2024, but the number of homes sold has decreased by 10.5%. The market is expected to be influenced by factors such as inventory levels, interest rates, economic conditions, migration patterns, and population growth. The forecast is based on current data and trends, but several factors could disrupt the predictions, including major shifts in interest rates, significant economic downturns, and unexpected changes to city regulations and policies impacting housing supply.

**Asking prices for UK homes show big November dip but 2025 set for gains, Rightmove says**
According to Rightmove, asking prices for UK homes fell by 1.4% over the last month, which is higher than the typical drop of 0.8% for the period. However, the online property portal forecasts a new upswing in the market for 2025, predicting a 4% increase in house prices. This is the highest prediction since 2021. Rightmove's director of property science, Tim Bannister, said, 'There's been a lot of news to digest for home-movers over the last few weeks and it appears that the market may still be chewing it over.' Despite the recent dip, the market remains positive compared to last year, setting it up for a stronger 2025.

**The Real CPI May Already Be at 2% | Investing.com UK**
The official inflation rate, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is reported to be around 2%, but this may be inaccurate due to the lagging nature of CPI data. The shelter component of CPI, which accounts for 40% of CPI, has been running at around 5% annually. However, rental prices, as reported by Zillow and Redfin, have not increased for the last year and a half, with the nationwide median asking rent down $53 from its all-time high in 2022. The author suggests that rent prices may start falling as existing home sale listings rise, and if mortgage rates head lower, the number of existing homes for sale will increase, further pressuring rent prices. When the CPI data catches up with reality, the author expects that CPI will run at 2% or even lower.

**Housing market pauses for election**
The housing market experienced a pause due to the election, with inventory, new listings, sales, and prices all dipping this week. However, this is a common trend for the first week of November, and the market is expected to rebound before the end of the month. The current trends suggest that inventory and new listings will continue to grow, with a 28% increase in homes on the market compared to last year. New listings declined by 20% this week, but this is likely a one-week dip due to the election. The median price of single-family homes dropped by a couple of percent this week, but is still 4% above last year at $380,000. The data suggests that the market is shifting back into low sales mode, and a reversal of the sales growth trend is not off the table. However, the forecast for 2025 suggests continued growth in seller volume and home prices, with a trend of more sellers and greater inventory. The HousingWire 2025 Forecast paper will be released soon, which will lay out expectations, scenarios, and data to track for the real estate market in the coming year.

**Best Neighborhoods to Move to in the San Francisco Bay Area**
The housing market in the San Francisco Bay Area has seen rapid growth in 2024, driven by the wealth generated by the artificial intelligence boom, according to Bloomberg. Cities like San José, Fremont, and Santa Clara are experiencing significant price increases, with some homes selling for tens of thousands of dollars more than their original asking price. The East Bay and Silicon Valley areas are seeing the largest increases in home values, with Fremont's housing prices estimated to have risen from under $1.3 million in January to nearly $1.4 million in August, according to Zillow. Santa Clara, home to NVIDIA's headquarters and a Korean neighborhood, has seen a 7% increase in home values, with prices rising over $100,000 this year. The San Francisco Chronicle notes that the market has been moving quickly since the pandemic, driven by the shift to remote work and the desire for larger living spaces.

**Amid housing affordability troubles, nearly 60% of young adults are 'rent burdened'**
According to a new Zillow report, nearly 60% of young adults are 'rent burdened,' meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing expenses. This is a slight improvement for Gen Z renters compared to millennials who were the same age a decade earlier. The housing shortage has grown to 4.5 million homes in 2022, and Jeff Ostrowski, a housing market expert with Bankrate, expects rental rates to continue rising as demand catches up with the increased supply. The typical rent nationwide is $2,050, up 3.3% from last year, and home prices in the for-sale market continue to rise, with the typical existing-home price now at $404,500. Many buyers remain priced out of the market, and Ostrowski notes that it's 'so hard for first-time buyers to get into the market that they're just remaining renters for longer,' with the median age of first-time buyers now at 36.

**Higher mortgage rates keep the market subdued even as more sellers list their homes**
Higher mortgage rates are continuing to impact the housing market, with the average 30-year conforming rate reaching 6.61% on Tuesday, a 15 basis point increase from the previous week. Despite this, more sellers are listing their homes, with single-family home inventory up 33% from last year. However, new pending sales are also on the rise, with a 9% increase from the same week last year and an 11% increase from the same week in 2022. Mike Simonsen, founder of Altos Research, notes that the market is 'slowly adjusting to this new normal of higher mortgage rates.' Homebuilders are also facing challenges due to the cost of borrowing, with HousingWire Lead Analyst Logan Mohtashami stating that the current policy rate range is 'recessionary levels for housing permits.' Zillow data shows that housing starts were down for a second straight year in 2023, but builders have pivoted toward condominiums and townhomes to create more starter-home supply at lower price points. Home-price appreciation continues to hamper affordability, with prices rising 0.5% from August to September and 6% on a yearly basis.

**Falling mortgage rates bring out more buyers in MD, report shows**
A report by Bright MLS shows that falling mortgage rates and increased inventory are expected to create a better homebuying market in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic this fall. In the Baltimore market, sales are expected to pick up in the 4th quarter, with a 10.6% increase in new pending sales in September compared to last year. Inventory has increased for eight months in a row, with 4,978 homes available for sale at the end of September, up 18.5% from last year. Home prices continue to rise, with a 4.7% year-over-year increase in the median sold price in September. In Montgomery County and the suburban Washington area, home sales are picking up, with a 15.7% increase in new pending sales in September compared to last year. The biggest constraint in the Washington metro area is high home prices, which will keep some buyers out of the market, particularly first-time homebuyers. However, more inventory will bring more options and should ease price growth. Overall, the mid-Atlantic market is expected to be busy for the last few months of the year, with 2024 wrapping up stronger than 2023.
