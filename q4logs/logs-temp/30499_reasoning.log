To forecast whether the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees F for the entire month of December 2024, I need to consider several factors and historical trends:

1. **Historical Data**: Historically, Phoenix experiences high temperatures in December ranging from the mid-60s to the low 80s. December 2022 had a highest high temperature of 74 F, while December 2023 saw it reach 84 F. These variances show that it's within the realm of possibility for temperatures to exceed 80 F.

2. **Current Forecasts and Trends**: The news articles and forecasts leading into late November 2024 suggest that Phoenix remains warm. However, there are predictions of cooldowns as cold fronts move in, with Phoenix reported to be experiencing a mix of highs in the 70s and low 80s.

3. **La Niña Influence**: The presence of La Niña conditions, which can bring cooler and drier weather to the Southwest, is a factor to consider. 

4. **Climate Change Impact**: Climate change trends have made extreme weather patterns, such as warmer winters, more common. The unprecedented heat events earlier in the year highlight this.

5. **Base Rates and Frequency of Past Events**: Historically, having temperatures exceed 80 degrees in December in Phoenix is rare, though not impossible given the high in December 2023. Nonetheless, the historical trend leans towards keeping December temperatures below 80 degrees.

After weighing these factors, the likelihood of every single day in December 2024 staying below 80 degrees is somewhat uncertain but historically more probable than not. However, given the warming trends and La Niña's potential influence, there's room for caution.

My Prediction: Between 55.00% and 75.00%, but 65.00% being the most likely. Probability: 65.00%.

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Historical Base Rates:
- December 2022: Highest temp was 74°F
- December 2023: Highest temp was 84°F
This shows that exceeding 80°F in December is possible, as demonstrated by 2023.

2. Recent Trends:
- Articles indicate Phoenix has experienced record-breaking heat in 2024
- La Niña is developing with 60% probability, which typically brings drier and cooler conditions to Phoenix in winter
- Climate change is causing more extreme temperatures in Phoenix

3. Breaking down the problem:
- Need ALL days in December 2024 to stay below 80°F
- Even one day above 80°F would make this false
- More challenging given recent temperature trends

4. Current trends and forecasts:
- Recent articles show temperatures dropping into the 70s
- November 2024 forecasts show cooling trends
- La Niña influence suggests cooler winter temperatures

5. Risk factors:
- Climate change pushing temperatures higher
- 2024 has already broken numerous heat records
- Only need one day above 80°F to fail

6. Supporting factors:
- December is traditionally one of the coolest months
- La Niña typically brings cooler winters
- Historical data shows December temperatures usually stay below 80°F

Weighing these factors:
- Historical precedent suggests December typically stays below 80°F
- However, 2023 broke this pattern with an 84°F day
- 2024's record heat and climate trends increase risk
- La Niña influence provides some counterbalance

My Prediction: Between 35.20% and 45.80%, with 40.50% being the most likely. Probability: 40.50%.

To forecast whether the temperature in Phoenix, AZ, will remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire month of December 2024, we need to examine historical data, current trends, climatic patterns, and the specific conditions influencing this year's weather forecast.

1. **Base Rates and Historical Reference**: Historically, Phoenix experiences temperatures below 80 degrees in December. In December 2022, the highest recorded temperature was 74°F, but in December 2023, there was an 84°F day. This variability indicates that while cooler temperatures are typical, outlier warm days have become more common in recent years.

2. **Recent Climate Trends and Predictions**: Recent reports underscore the persisting effects of climate change, such as higher temperatures and prolonged heat waves. The 2024 summer was exceptionally hot, breaking numerous records. However, forecasts suggest a weak La Niña pattern could bring cooler and drier than average conditions to Phoenix in the winter of 2024, which typically involves temperatures below the 80-degree mark.

3. **Current Weather Predictions**: News articles and forecasts for November 2024 indicate temperatures will remain in the upper 70s, supporting the likelihood of sub-80-degree days in early December. Any forecast predicting 80-degree days around Thanksgiving gives little indication of persisting into December due to expected cooler trends following the holiday.

4. **Balancing Uncertainty and Evidence**: With an embedded cooling trend expected as per historical norms and the current weather patterns alongside the variability contributed by climate change, it is important to balance these competing influences. While it is possible to have isolated 80-degree days, they are not frequent in December.

Given these considerations, my forecast leans towards sub-80-degree highs for most, if not all, days in December but cautiously accounts for potential warm anomalies due to ongoing climate impacts.

My Prediction: Between 85.00% and 95.00%, but 90.00% being the most likely. Probability: 90.00%.

To forecast whether the temperature in Phoenix, AZ, will remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the entirety of December 2024, let's break down the situation using the principles of superforecasting:

1. **Reference Class and Base Rates**: Historically, December is typically not a month for 80-degree days in Phoenix. However, in December 2023, there was an instance where the temperature reached 84 degrees. Generally, December sees cooler temperatures due to the seasonal transition into winter.

2. **Current Trends and Climate Considerations**: The news mentions persistent warmth leading up to the last days of November, with a pattern of warmer than average conditions due to climate factors like La Niña. However, cooler temperatures are usually expected as December progresses.

3. **Recent Weather Patterns**: There have been recent instances of temperatures nearing 80 degrees in late November, but typical temperature trends consistently cool down into December. None of the sources suggest an expectation for multiple 80-degree days in December.

4. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**: The inside view (current forecasts and recent weather patterns) points to some warmth in late November. The outside view (historical data and typical December weather) suggests cooler conditions with much fewer chances of hitting 80 degrees.

5. **Considering Causal Forces**: While climate change has introduced more variability, high-pressure systems should bring cooler, drier air that fits seasonal expectations. On the flip side, La Niña might bring variability and warmth, but this has not historically been strong enough to make December hot.

6. **Evidence and Error Balancing**: Given the occasional hot Decembers in the past and recent forecasts, there's a non-trivial chance for a warm day. However, the climatic setup and historical norms pull the other way.

Taking all these into account, while the likelihood of a day reaching 80 degrees in Phoenix in December is not zero, it remains low given historical trends and typical weather patterns for this time of year. Considering the need for every day to stay below 80 for a "Yes" resolution, the probability of such an occurrence is reduced further.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

3. **Recent Weather Patterns**: There have been recent instances of temperatures nearing 80 degrees in late November, but typical temperature trends consistently cool down into December. None of the sources suggest an expectation for multiple 80-degree days in December.

4. **Balancing Inside and Outside Views**: The inside view (current forecasts and recent weather patterns) points to some warmth in late November. The outside view (historical data and typical December weather) suggests cooler conditions with much fewer chances of hitting 80 degrees.

5. **Considering Causal Forces**: While climate change has introduced more variability, high-pressure systems should bring cooler, drier air that fits seasonal expectations. On the flip side, La Niña might bring variability and warmth, but this has not historically been strong enough to make December hot.

6. **Evidence and Error Balancing**: Given the occasional hot Decembers in the past and recent forecasts, there's a non-trivial chance for a warm day. However, the climatic setup and historical norms pull the other way.

Taking all these into account, while the likelihood of a day reaching 80 degrees in Phoenix in December is not zero, it remains low given historical trends and typical weather patterns for this time of year. Considering the need for every day to stay below 80 for a "Yes" resolution, the probability of such an occurrence is reduced further.

My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 85.00%, but 80.00% being the most likely. Probability: 80.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood that the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the entirety of December 2024, I will follow a structured forecasting approach.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rate**: Historically, Phoenix's December temperatures have shown some variation. In December 2022, the highest recorded temperature was 74 F, while in December 2023, it reached 84 F. This gives us a mixed historical reference suggesting both the possibility of staying below 80 F and exceeding it.

2. **Current Climate Trends**: The recent articles emphasize an extreme heat condition affecting Arizona, linked to climate change. The late summer and early fall months have been exceptionally hot, yet forecasts mention expected cooling. Therefore, while climate change might suggest increasing temperatures, specific forecasts for December highlight potential cooling trends.

3. **Weather Prediction Models and Particular Forecasts**: Several forecasts mention Phoenix's temperatures dropping into the 70s in November before cooling further. There are mentions of trends bringing cooler air in time for December, which aligns with the seasonal expectation of dropping temperatures in the winter month.

4. **Recent and Historical Weather Events**: The articles mention record-breaking heatwaves, which could imply that exceeding 80 degrees is possible later than historical norms. However, by December, these heatwaves typically subside, pointing towards a cooling off to more historical seasonal temperatures.

5. **Resolution Criteria and Risks**: The forecast hinges on no day in December exceeding 80 F at the Phoenix Sky Harbor weather station. While past Decembers have varied, the trailing end of years with unusual heat has cool fronts compensating to some extent, bringing temperatures in alignment with seasonal norms.

6. **Extrapolating Trends and Balancing Evidence**: Forecasting models indicate a cooler phase for the start of December. With recent articles emphasizing already notable November cool-downs and anticipated continued cooling, the inside view corroborates the base rate's likelihood of remaining below 80 degrees in December.

7. **Error Balancing and Confidence Level**: Bearing in mind the uncertainty involved in longer-term weather forecasting, particularly in the face of variable climate influences, we must account for a non-zero probability of a temporary heat spike, yet balance this with prevailing predictions around cooler December conditions.

Given these elements and recognizing the potential for variability, the forecasting indicates it is more likely that temperatures will remain below 80 F throughout December. However, there is still room for unforeseen deviations which justifies a cautious probability range near 70-80%.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 80.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To evaluate the likelihood that the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the entirety of December 2024, I will follow a structured forecasting approach.

1. **Reference Classes and Base Rate**: Historically, Phoenix's December temperatures have shown some variation. In December 2022, the highest recorded temperature was 74 F, while in December 2023, it reached 84 F. This gives us a mixed historical reference suggesting both the possibility of staying below 80 F and exceeding it.

2. **Current Climate Trends**: The recent articles emphasize an extreme heat condition affecting Arizona, linked to climate change. The late summer and early fall months have been exceptionally hot, yet forecasts mention expected cooling. Therefore, while climate change might suggest increasing temperatures, specific forecasts for December highlight potential cooling trends.

3. **Weather Prediction Models and Particular Forecasts**: Several forecasts mention Phoenix's temperatures dropping into the 70s in November before cooling further. There are mentions of trends bringing cooler air in time for December, which aligns with the seasonal expectation of dropping temperatures in the winter month.

4. **Recent and Historical Weather Events**: The articles mention record-breaking heatwaves, which could imply that exceeding 80 degrees is possible later than historical norms. However, by December, these heatwaves typically subside, pointing towards a cooling off to more historical seasonal temperatures.

5. **Resolution Criteria and Risks**: The forecast hinges on no day in December exceeding 80 F at the Phoenix Sky Harbor weather station. While past Decembers have varied, the trailing end of years with unusual heat has cool fronts compensating to some extent, bringing temperatures in alignment with seasonal norms.

6. **Extrapolating Trends and Balancing Evidence**: Forecasting models indicate a cooler phase for the start of December. With recent articles emphasizing already notable November cool-downs and anticipated continued cooling, the inside view corroborates the base rate's likelihood of remaining below 80 degrees in December.

7. **Error Balancing and Confidence Level**: Bearing in mind the uncertainty involved in longer-term weather forecasting, particularly in the face of variable climate influences, we must account for a non-zero probability of a temporary heat spike, yet balance this with prevailing predictions around cooler December conditions.

Given these elements and recognizing the potential for variability, the forecasting indicates it is more likely that temperatures will remain below 80 F throughout December. However, there is still room for unforeseen deviations which justifies a cautious probability range near 70-80%.

My Prediction: Between 70.00% and 80.00%, but 75.00% being the most likely. Probability: 75.00%.

To forecast whether the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire month of December 2024, I will apply the principles of superforecasting.

1. **Reference Class Forecasting:** Historically, Phoenix does experience cooler temperatures in December compared to the rest of the year. In December 2022, the highest recorded temperature was 74°F, while in December 2023 it was 84°F. The historical pattern suggests that it is more likely than not for temperatures to stay below 80°F during December.

2. **Current Trends and Evidence:** The recent weather reports indicate that Phoenix has been experiencing a warm November with temperatures occasionally reaching 80°F. However, there are predictions of cooler weather systems moving in, which should stabilize temperatures below the 80°F mark in December.

3. **Climatic Influences:** A weak La Niña is expected to bring cooler and drier conditions which may contribute to sustaining lower temperatures.

4. **Balancing Evidence:** While the warmth experienced in late November increases the uncertainty, the upcoming cooling trend, typical for the month of December, and historical data suggesting cooler Decembers in Phoenix weigh more heavily.

5. **Calibration and Resolution:** I should aim for a conservative forecast that considers the variances of weather but leans towards historical patterns and current weather system predictions.

6. **Superforecasting Techniques:** Balancing the risks of over-relying on past trends and underestimating new data, the probability should reflect a high likelihood of staying below 80°F while remaining open to the possibility of a rare warm spike similar to the past year.

Based on these analyses, the forecast concludes:

2024-11-27 13:03:37,258 - INFO - Reasoning for question 30499:
To forecast whether the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire month of December 2024, I will apply the principles of superforecasting.

1. **Reference Class Forecasting:** Historically, Phoenix does experience cooler temperatures in December compared to the rest of the year. In December 2022, the highest recorded temperature was 74°F, while in December 2023 it was 84°F. The historical pattern suggests that it is more likely than not for temperatures to stay below 80°F during December.

2. **Current Trends and Evidence:** The recent weather reports indicate that Phoenix has been experiencing a warm November with temperatures occasionally reaching 80°F. However, there are predictions of cooler weather systems moving in, which should stabilize temperatures below the 80°F mark in December.

3. **Climatic Influences:** A weak La Niña is expected to bring cooler and drier conditions which may contribute to sustaining lower temperatures.

4. **Balancing Evidence:** While the warmth experienced in late November increases the uncertainty, the upcoming cooling trend, typical for the month of December, and historical data suggesting cooler Decembers in Phoenix weigh more heavily.

5. **Calibration and Resolution:** I should aim for a conservative forecast that considers the variances of weather but leans towards historical patterns and current weather system predictions.

6. **Superforecasting Techniques:** Balancing the risks of over-relying on past trends and underestimating new data, the probability should reflect a high likelihood of staying below 80°F while remaining open to the possibility of a rare warm spike similar to the past year.

Based on these analyses, the forecast concludes:

"My Prediction: Between 75.00% and 90.00%, but 85.00% being the most likely. Probability: 85.00%."

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Historical Base Rates:
- December 2022: Highest temperature was 74°F
- December 2023: Highest temperature was 84°F
This shows it's possible to exceed 80°F in December in Phoenix.

2. Recent Trends:
- Multiple articles mention a La Niña pattern developing with 60% probability
- La Niña typically brings drier and cooler conditions to Phoenix in winter months
- The articles suggest temperatures are gradually cooling as expected for the season

3. Climate Factors:
- 2024 has been an exceptionally hot year with record-breaking temperatures
- Climate change is causing more extreme temperatures
- Articles mention Phoenix experiencing unprecedented heat waves

4. Breaking down the problem:
- Need ALL days in December 2024 to stay below 80°F
- Just one day above 80°F would make this false
- December 2023 had at least one day above 80°F
- La Niña influence suggests cooler temperatures

5. Key Considerations:
Positive factors (for staying below 80°F):
- La Niña development
- Normal seasonal cooling
- Historical precedent of mostly sub-80°F December days

Negative factors (for exceeding 80°F):
- Recent record-breaking heat trends
- Climate change influence
- Previous December (2023) exceeded 80°F
- Only need one day above 80°F to fail

Given that:
1. Recent history shows it's possible to exceed 80°F in December
