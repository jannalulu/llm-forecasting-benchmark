**Ski season has officially started: First US ski resort is now open**
The 2024-2025 ski season has officially started with the opening of Ski Ward in Massachusetts on October 19, but it's not the first resort to offer a full mountain experience. Wolf Creek Ski Area in Colorado is the first larger resort to open with chairlift service seven days a week, on October 22, after receiving 26 inches of total snow. The early season is not beginner-friendly due to limited terrain, but many other resorts in the west are expected to open soon, with Keystone and Arapahoe Basin aiming to open sooner rather than later. Breckenridge, Brian Head, and Copper Mountain have announced an opening date of November 8, while Vail, Mammoth, Winter Park, and others plan to open by mid-November. On the East Coast, ski resorts are expected to open in mid-November or December.
