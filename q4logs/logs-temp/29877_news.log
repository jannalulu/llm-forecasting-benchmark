**Framing the Future: Who Will Be Iceland's Next Prime Minister?**
Icelanders, we need to think about our next step! Who will be the next prime minister after the elections? Which individual and party is likely to lead a three-party coalition, rather than a four-party coalition? Let's examine the leading candidates of each party and ask ourselves who is most likely to succeed. I'm not sure, but Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson is likely to be at the forefront. He showed this in 2016 when Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned, and everything fell into place quickly, allowing the people to assess Sigurður Ingi's work. With him, we can expect ministers who have earned a good reputation. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, the party's deputy leader, has made significant contributions to culture and the arts. Lilja has been a spokesperson for the Icelandic language and has '...'

**Bjarni Benediktsson Rules Out Participation in EU-Advocating Government**
Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the Independence Party, stated in a debate on Stöð 2 that he would not participate in a government that would advocate for Iceland's entry into the European Union. He said, 'I see no reason for entry into the EU.' Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, asked Bjarni if he would consider giving something in exchange for the EU's entry, but Bjarni replied that he would not take part in a government that would fight for entry into the EU. This statement suggests that Bjarni is not opposed to taking part in a government that aligns with the Independence Party's stance on the EU.

**Progress Party Abandons Plan to Ban Gasoline and Diesel Car Registration**
The Progress Party (Viðreisn) has stated that they no longer support banning the registration of gasoline and diesel cars next year, citing changes in the party's policy on environmental and energy issues. The party's chairman, Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, said, 'This ambitious decision was made in 2023 and was to be reviewed before the next parliamentary elections in February 2025. We see that the tax on hybrid cars was very high until this year, when the value-added tax on these cars was reinstated. At the same time, a kilometer tax was introduced on electric cars. Both of these have reduced the willingness of the public and car owners to invest in new hybrid cars.' She added, 'We need to use this stimulus better to get people on our side and reduce the use and importation of oil and gasoline. Since this is not being done, it has become unrealistic to impose a ban next year.'

**Iceland's Political Turmoil Sparks New Elections Amid Natural Disasters | Politics**
Iceland is gearing up for a parliamentary election on November 30, following the collapse of its three-party coalition government. The dissolution was announced by Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, who cited policy disagreements among the Independence Party, Progressive Party, and Left Greens. The coalition's collapse comes amid Iceland's struggles with volcanic eruptions, high inflation, and interest rates. Benediktsson took over as Prime Minister in April, succeeding Katrin Jakobsdottir, who resigned to pursue the presidency. Halla Tomasdottir was ultimately elected as President in August. According to Benediktsson, the political shift is a result of the 'fracturing' of the coalition, which he described as a 'great challenge' for the country.

**Iceland to elect new parliament on Nov. 30, president says**
Iceland will hold a parliamentary election on November 30, according to the president, after the three-party coalition government collapsed due to disagreements over asylum policies, energy efficiency, and other issues. The coalition, led by Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, had been in place since April, but ultimately fell apart. Iceland has been facing uncertainty due to recent volcanic eruptions, high inflation, and interest rates. As the country prepares for the election, it remains to be seen how the new government will address these challenges. 'The coalition of the right-wing, pro-business Independence Party, the centre-right Progressive Party and the Left Greens, fell apart over disagreements ranging from asylum policies to energy efficiency,' said Prime Minister Benediktsson. The presidency was won by Halla Tomasdottir in August, who took office after Katrin Jakobsdottir announced her resignation and run for president.

**Sigurður Ingi: 'It would have no purpose to bring in new people. This is primarily a government that is working until the elections'**
Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, the leader of the Progressive Party, believes that it would be best for the party to continue in the government of Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson until the elections. Ideally, the Progressive Party and the Independence Party would share the tasks of the Green Party's ministers. Svandís Svavarsdóttir, the leader of the Green Party, announced that the party's ministers would not continue in the government shortly after the President of Iceland, Halla Tómasdóttir, dissolved the parliament. Sigurður said in an interview with the news team earlier today that it would be most reasonable for the two other parties, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party, to share the tasks if the Green Party were not part of the government. 'It would have no purpose to bring in new people. This is primarily a government that is working until the elections,' Sigurður said. Svandís previously stated that she was willing to sit in a minority government under the leadership of Sigurður Ingi until the elections. 'No, not personally. But what we found in the Progressive Party and what we find now is that we need to look at these tasks that we consider important to be completed. Of course, everyone knows that we need to finish the budget and that is important in this economic environment we are in,' Sigurður said. There are also other matters that would be good to complete, such as various transportation issues. 'We need to consider whether it is possible. She has not come forward, it would be a possibility to nominate her, but it can also be considered whether it is possible to do that through the budget in a one-year period. I think it would help with the political discussion to have a transportation plan come forward,' Sigurður said.

**Iceland's Three-Party Coalition Government Collapses Ahead of Elections**
Icelandic Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson announced that the government has been dissolved due to disagreements within the three-party coalition. Benediktsson stated that if President Halla Tómasdóttir accepts the proposal to dissolve the parliament, new parliamentary elections are expected to be held on November 30. The government, consisting of the conservative Independence Party, the center-right Progressive Party, and the Greens, has been struggling with uncertainty since the volcanic eruptions in Iceland last month left many people homeless. The country's economy, already facing high inflation and rising interest rates, has further deteriorated after the disaster.

**Össur Skarphéðinsson: Sigurður Ingi will end his term as Prime Minister**
Össur Skarphéðinsson, former chairman of the Social Democratic Alliance, believes that Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, chairman of the Progressive Party, will end his term as Prime Minister. Össur compares the current situation to the 2016 parliamentary proposal by Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, chairman of the Centre Party, and the current proposal by Bjarni Benediktsson, Prime Minister. Össur quotes Bjarni as saying that it would be best if the current government remained in power until the next elections, but if the coalition parties did not want that, he would submit a resignation to the President. Svandís Svavarsdóttir, chairman of the Left-Green Movement, said that it would be most important for Bjarni to submit a resignation and that she could imagine a caretaker government with Sigurður Ingi as Prime Minister. Össur says that according to his own statement, Bjarni was supposed to meet with the President to submit a resignation for his government. Össur believes that Sigurður Ingi will end his term as Prime Minister. 'So the story repeats itself. When men set up a play, they must think of the end. It did not happen in 2016, and it will not happen in 2024,' Össur says in the end.

**Icelandic Government Coalition Collapses, Early Elections Called**
Icelandic Prime Minister Bjarne Benediktsson announced the collapse of the governing coalition and called for early elections on November 30. According to RUV, Benediktsson blamed the growing disagreements between the three leading parties on various issues, including foreign policy and refugee problems. Benediktsson will meet with President Halldora Thorisdottir on Monday to discuss the decision to dissolve the parliament. Elections must take place no later than 45 days after the announcement of the parliament's dissolution. Benediktsson, the head of the right-wing business party Independence Party, was elected prime minister in April, replacing Katrin Jakobsdottir. The coalition government, consisting of the Independence Party, the right-wing Progressive Party, and the Green Party, has faced uncertainty since recent volcanic eruptions forced thousands of people to leave their homes and put pressure on the economy, which is already struggling with high inflation and rising interest rates. To hold early elections, President Halldora Thorisdottir must accept the proposal to dissolve the parliament, as Benediktsson said, 'It is time for a new government to take responsibility for the country's future.'

**Iceland's Prime Minister Dissolves Ruling Coalition**
Iceland's Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson announced the dissolution of the ruling coalition on an unexpected press conference in the capital Reykjavik. The reason for the breakup, according to Benediktsson, is the growing disagreements between the three political parties in the coalition. 'There are disagreements over asylum seeker policy, which have become public, and long-standing disagreements over the vision for energy efficiency,' he said. Benediktsson stated that new parliamentary elections should take place on November 30 if President Halla Tomasdottir accepts his proposal to dissolve the parliament. The National Broadcasting Service RUV reported that elections should take place no later than 45 days after the parliament's dissolution. Benediktsson is set to meet with Tomasdottir on Monday. The coalition government consists of Benediktsson's conservative Independence Party, the centrist Progressive Party, and the left-wing 'green' party. Svandis Svavarsson, Minister of Infrastructure and leader of the 'green' party, said that the decision to dissolve the parliament was unexpected and not discussed during her meeting with Benediktsson on Saturday. 'I thought we were meeting honestly, discussing the situation, and possibly returning to look at specific issues. I thought we understood that the most important issues were the economy, housing, and the problems faced by ordinary people who are struggling to make ends meet. I thought this was our most pressing issue, but now we see that for the Prime Minister, other issues are more important,' she said.

**Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson Faces Questions in Samtalið**
Bjarni Benediktsson, the Prime Minister of Iceland and leader of the Independence Party, will be interviewed in the new national language program 'Samtalið' on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today. The program will also be broadcast on Stöð 2 at 19:10 tonight. The program is a new national language program that will be on the schedule every Friday in the winter. Many questions are being asked of Bjarni Benediktsson, who has been the leader of the Independence Party for the longest period of time, 15 years. He leads a government that has been controversial since the start of the previous government of the Left-Green Party, Independence Party, and Progressive Party. Growing dissatisfaction has been felt in the government coalition since it was renewed after the 2021 elections, with some saying that the government cannot maintain its position with the dissatisfaction that reigns within it. Support for the government has decreased significantly, and according to polls, it is on the verge of collapse. The support for the Independence Party has also decreased, with the party's support now at 14%. Many controversial issues are waiting to be addressed in the Althing this last parliamentary session before the elections, with 217 government bills on the agenda. It appears that within the government, there will be a discussion about energy and power issues, foreigner issues, and issues related to the constitution in the country. According to the electoral law, the next parliamentary elections should take place in September next year. Elections were held in the autumn of 2016 after Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson resigned as Prime Minister before the end of the term and the elections, and in the autumn of 2017 after the government of Bjarni Benediktsson collapsed after only ten months. The current coalition parties, which formed a government after the 2017 elections, decided to serve out the term, so that for the third time in a row, elections were held in the autumn of 2021. Now, many are wondering whether the coalition parties will call for elections next spring, as it has been a tradition for parliamentary elections to take place in the spring. This question and many others will be discussed in the live broadcast of Samtalið on Vísir and Stöð 2/Vísir at 14:00 today.
