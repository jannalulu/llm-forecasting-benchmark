**SpaceX's Starship Flight 7 Launch May Take Place on January 11, 2025 | 🔬 LatestLY**
SpaceX is planning to launch the Starship Flight 7 test flight as early as January 11, 2025, according to DogeDesigner and Sawyer Merritt. This test flight marks another step in SpaceX's mission, following the successful completion of the sixth Starship test flight on November 20, 2024. However, the sixth test flight did not replicate the 'booster catch' achieved in the fifth test flight, where SpaceX used special 'chopstick arms' to catch the booster as it returned to Earth. Elon Musk's SpaceX is continuing to push the boundaries of space exploration.

**SpaceX Receives FAA Approval for 25 Starship Launches in 2025**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released a draft environmental assessment (EA) that proposes increasing the annual launch operations of SpaceX's Starship from five to 25 by 2025. The assessment, published on November 20, also includes approvals for 25 landings of the Super Heavy booster for the spacecraft and the upper stage at the same site, using the 'food tray' capture mechanism in the launch tower. According to a report by Space, SpaceX may receive FAA approval to launch 25 Starship spacecraft in 2025. The Starship spacecraft, which is recognized as the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, is central to the company's vision for human exploration of the moon and Mars. The spacecraft is 400 feet tall and is designed for full reusability, and has been launched six times so far, all from the Starbase facility. During its last mission on November 19, 2024, the mission was successful, although a communication failure forced the booster to make a controlled landing in the Gulf of Mexico instead of returning to the launch tower. The FAA's draft assessment, which defines these expanded operational capabilities, is still in its initial stage. Public consultations will take place in January, with four in-person meetings in southern Texas on January 7 and 9, as well as a virtual session on January 13. Reactions from these discussions will shape the final environmental assessment.

**US Regulator Grants SpaceX Permission for 25 Starship Super Heavy Flights in 2025**
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted permission for 25 flights of the Starship Super Heavy rocket in 2025. The launches will take place from the Starbase launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The FAA has also approved 25 landings of the two Starship elements - the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft - back at Starbase. SpaceX will use a special launch crane to 'catch' the booster, as it did successfully in mid-October. Although the next attempt was unsuccessful, the booster was landed on water. SpaceX is developing the largest rocket with a spacecraft to transport people to the Moon and Mars in the future. The 122-meter-long Starship is designed for reuse. In the future, SpaceX plans to conduct multiple Starship launches per day. All six test flights of Starship have taken place from Starbase, with the last one occurring in late November. The FAA has scheduled four in-person public hearings on January 7 and 9, 2025, and one virtual meeting on January 13. In March 2025, SpaceX plans to begin orbital testing of fuel transfer between two Starships. The company aims to use the Starship to launch Starlink V3 satellites into orbit. Additionally, in 2025, SpaceX is expected to launch the Starship with the Raptor 3 engine.

**SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch, as Trump watches on**
SpaceX's latest test flight of its Starship megarocket was unsuccessful in catching the descending first stage, despite President-elect Donald Trump's presence at the event. The Super Heavy booster made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, with company representatives citing unmet technical criteria. This failure comes after a previous successful demonstration of the 'chopstick' arms, which Trump personally lauded during his election victory speech. SpaceX founder Elon Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since his election victory, raising questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with NASA and the Pentagon. Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to Mars as early as 2026, coinciding with the next 'Mars transfer window'.

**SpaceX Explains Why Starship's First Stage Was Intentionally Crashed**
SpaceX explained why the Starship rocket's first stage was intentionally crashed into the ocean during its last test flight, rather than being caught by the launch pad's recovery mechanism. According to Elon Musk, the head of SpaceX, a malfunction occurred on the ground infrastructure, not on the rocket itself, during the November 20, 2024 launch. The launch pad's tower lost contact with the mission control center shortly after the Starship spacecraft separated from the Super Heavy first stage, as Musk wrote on X. As a result, the command was given to steer the first stage towards the Gulf of Mexico for a controlled splashdown. It's possible that the stage could have been caught by the tower in autonomous mode, but SpaceX decided not to take the risk. The recovery of the first stage of Super Heavy has already been successful, during the fifth test flight. However, the attempt was almost a failure, but it was successful in the end. The incident led to a software update for the first stage's equipment, which was intended to be tested during the sixth test flight. However, the ground infrastructure failed this time. The sixth test flight was still successful in its mission, providing valuable data on the dynamics of the Starship spacecraft's descent at subsonic speeds during the final stage of the flight before splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This data will help later to organize the capture of the Starship spacecraft by the launch pad's tower. However, at least one more test flight, the seventh, will take place before that. In this flight, the spacecraft will be larger and have a slightly different layout of the flaps. If the new version of the spacecraft shows a successful splashdown on the same side of the Earth as all previous flights, SpaceX may attempt to recover the Starship spacecraft and catch it in the air during the eighth flight, which is expected to take place in early 2025.

**SpaceX's Starship Test Fails to Meet Expectations, Despite Presence of Elon Musk and Donald Trump**
The SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever built by the company, conducted a new test on November 19, 2023, in Boca Chica, Texas. The test, which was attended by Elon Musk and US President-elect Donald Trump, did not achieve the same success as the previous launch. The rocket, weighing 5,000 tons, carried a novel feature: a banana-shaped cushion used for gravity-related tests. According to Musk, 'I want someone who looks at me the way Trump looks at Elons Starship.' The test was the sixth conducted by the company in 2023. The Heavy Booster separated from the rocket at an altitude of 68 kilometers and landed in the Gulf of Mexico, but failed to return to the launch base. The Starship landed in the Indian Ocean after an hour of flight, but the company still needs to refine the reusability of the propulsor. SpaceX has already successfully completed a flight with the recovery of the propulsor, but the first attempts only returned to Earth without using the recovery platform. Reusability is essential for reducing costs and making future missions, including those to Mars, feasible.

**Starship Test Ends in Failure, But Successful Water Landing**
SpaceX, the space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, conducted a new test for its Starship spacecraft on November 19. The test, which was the sixth launch, aimed to demonstrate the capabilities of the Starship and Super Heavy rocket combination. However, the test ended in failure, with the booster Super Heavy failing to reattach to the Starship. Despite this, the Starship was able to successfully land in the Indian Ocean after a water landing, a feat it had also accomplished on October 14. According to Elon Musk, the Starship will play a crucial role in the plan to land on Mars, and the technologies developed for the spacecraft will be used in the near future, including the NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon by 2026.

**Starship's Sixth Flight Test: A Step Towards Reusability**
SpaceX's sixth Starship flight test was successfully completed on November 20, 2024. The test aimed to repeat the 'chopstick-grabbing-rocket' maneuver, but it was not successful. However, the Starship did successfully relight its Raptor engines in space, a feat that was first attempted in March but failed due to high roll rates. The test also carried a banana as a payload, which was a nod to the internet meme 'banana scale'. The Starship is expected to undergo a major upgrade for its seventh flight test, which will include a new propulsion system, improved heat shields, and a redesigned nose fairing. SpaceX aims to conduct 25 Starship launches in 2025, a goal that some consider overly ambitious. However, with the potential for relaxed regulatory environment under the new US administration, SpaceX may be able to achieve this goal.

**SpaceX's Starship Fails to Recover First Stage in Latest Test Flight**
SpaceX's Starship failed to recover its first stage with mechanical arms during its sixth test flight, despite the encouragement of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The launch, which took place on November 20, 2024, from the Starbase base in Boca Chica, Texas, was attended by the president-elect, who was 'honored' to be there, according to Musk. The goal of the mission was to recover the first stage, Super Heavy, using mechanical arms, but the criteria were not met, and the stage crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. However, the Starship vessel continued its flight and landed in the Indian Ocean, allowing for the first time to film valuable images. The failure is a setback for SpaceX's plans to make Starship fully reusable, which would enable the launch of more engines quickly and at a lower cost. As Musk said, 'It's a great day, but we have a lot of work to do.'

**Elon Musk's SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch, as Trump watches on**
SpaceX's Starship megarocket launched on Tuesday, but failed to repeat its previous 'chopstick' catch, instead splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico. The launch, attended by former President Donald Trump, marked a quick turnaround for the rocket and a deepening relationship between Musk and Trump, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk, has been a constant presence at Trump's side since his election victory, and has been tapped to co-lead a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE). The flight was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on luck, and included key milestones such as reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialing new heat shield materials. Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to Mars as early as 2026, and has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be '3X more powerful' and could take flight in about a year.

**SpaceX's Starship Fails to Capture First Stage, But Makes Progress in Reusability**
SpaceX conducted the sixth integrated flight of the Starship vehicle on Tuesday (19th), but was unable to repeat the capture of the first stage with the robotic arm. The largest rocket in history took off at 19h (Brasília time) from Starbase, the company's installation in Boca Chica, Texas, USA. The first stage, the Super Heavy propellant, separated from the second, the Starship spacecraft, about three minutes after launch and then began maneuvers to return to the platform. However, unlike last month, telemetry data sent by the first stage led the company to decide not to bring the Super Heavy to the mechazilla, a structure developed to catch the propellant in the air. Instead, the rocket descended, as planned in case of contingency, in a controlled manner into the ocean. The second stage continued its suborbital trajectory, passing about an hour in space and making more than half a turn around the Earth, in an effort to push the envelope and establish higher limits for its operations. The spacecraft activated one of its Raptor engines in space, a first for the program. The landing, which was successful, was recorded by cameras on board and in nearby buoys, producing beautiful live images transmitted by SpaceX on its X social network account. This was the last flight with the original Starship model, which has undergone hundreds of mission improvements mission by mission. From the seventh flight, the updates will be more notable, including redesigned front flaps, larger propellant tanks, the new generation of thermal protection tiles, and secondary thermal protection layers. The goal is to develop a fully reusable thermal protection system that will enable rapid recovery and preparation of the Starship for new flights. The program still needs to demonstrate several technologies before the rocket can be used for human transportation to the lunar surface, as the NASA wants for the Artemis 3 mission, scheduled for the end of 2026 (with possible delay to 2027 or 2028).

**SpaceX запланувала шостий випробувальний політ Starship на листопад: відома точна дата**
SpaceX has planned its sixth Starship test flight for November 18 at 16:00 local time, aiming for a daytime landing in the Indian Ocean to improve visual analysis of the descent and landing process. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted SpaceX simultaneous permits for the fifth and sixth test flights, possibly in response to recent regulatory disputes between the agency and the space company. The sixth mission will include a soft landing of the first stage of the heavy-lift rocket using SpaceX's Starship servicing tower. A new feature of this flight will be the attempt to restart one of the Starship's engines in a vacuum and adjust the angle of descent for testing the heat shields. These adjustments will allow for the evaluation and refinement of Starship's entry into the atmosphere scenarios. The spacecraft will also feature a modernized heat shield and reserve systems, while the heavy-lift rocket has received an updated software patch to address a programming glitch that nearly led to a failure during the previous test. If the rocket's landing is successful, SpaceX will move on to the seventh launch with an even more advanced Starship configuration, including an improved heat shield, larger fuel tanks, and redesigned aerodynamic flaps. The November test will play a crucial role in completing the Starship design, paving the way for a fully modernized system.

**Space Force’s effort to bring in new launch providers hasn’t worked yet. Officials aren’t surprised.**
The Space Force's effort to bring in new launch providers has not yet yielded results, with SpaceX winning the first contract in the National Space Security Launch Phase 3 program. Officials, including Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space, are not surprised by this outcome. Panzenhagen said, 'I don't look at it as a failure at all. We fully anticipated it. I mean, everybody knows who's launching right now. We knew it was going to be a very limited set, but we knew we had to start somewhere.' The service is looking to bring in new companies, such as Relativity Space, Firefly Aerospace, Rocket Lab, and ABL Space Systems, but it's unclear when they will be ready to compete for Lane 1 launches. The Pentagon has picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance to compete for $5.6 billion worth of contracts in Lane 1, which includes at least 30 missions from fiscal 2025 to 2029.

**Samsung Galaxy Users Will Have to Wait Until 2025 for Android 15 Update**
Android 15 has been available since October 15, 2024, but Samsung Galaxy users will have to wait until 2025 to receive the update. The update, which includes features such as protection against theft, private space, and app archiving, will be implemented through One UI 7, but it has been delayed. According to Samsung, the update will be available for approximately 50 Samsung phones, but the exact date is still unknown. However, it is expected to coincide with the launch of the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series, which is expected to be released in January 2025. The delay is due to the postponement of One UI 7's beta release, which was initially scheduled for August 2024. Samsung has confirmed that One UI 7 will not be available before January 2025. Despite the delay, Samsung's long-term support for updates, which can last up to six years, may be a consolation for users.

**SpaceX Successfully Tests Mechazilla System for Reusable Rockets**
SpaceX has successfully tested its 'Mechazilla' system, which allows the company to catch and reuse its Starship rockets. The test, which took place on October 13, 2024, saw the Starship rocket reach an altitude of 71 kilometers and then return to Earth, where it was caught by the Mechazilla system. This achievement marks a significant milestone for SpaceX, as it aims to make its Starship rockets reusable and reduce the cost of space travel. According to Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, the Mechazilla system will allow the company to reuse its rockets in as little as 30 minutes, compared to the current 20-day wait time for Falcon 9 rockets. The successful test also paves the way for future missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as the development of a reusable Starship. However, the test was not without its challenges, as the rocket experienced an engine failure and a fire during the test. SpaceX is working to resolve these issues and plans to conduct another test in early 2025. 'When you think about the Moon, Mars, and other regions, you don't necessarily have flat surfaces everywhere,' said AndrÃ  Chanin, CEO of ProcureAM, which manages the Procure Space ETF. 'With its 9-meter diameter, the Super Heavy rocket will require more infrastructure than the Falcon 9, which is currently used for missions to the Moon and Mars.' The successful test of the Mechazilla system is a significant step forward for SpaceX and its goal of making space travel more accessible and affordable.

**Light Start: The return of Starship, Eskom gets a grip, Tomb Raider’s HD drip, and Internet Archive makes a flip**
SpaceX successfully caught the Starship booster on its fifth attempt, a feat that has never been achieved before. The booster, which is 71 meters tall and has 33 Raptor engines, was able to return to Earth and was caught by Mechazilla, the launch platform. This is a significant breakthrough for SpaceX, as it has always been a challenge to catch a rocket of this size. Meanwhile, Eskom has achieved a milestone of 200 consecutive days of uninterrupted power supply, a result of its 'Generation Operational Recovery Plan'. The utility is on track to reach 206 days without load shedding by October 18, 2024. Additionally, Crystal Dynamics is releasing a remastered version of Tomb Raider IV to VI, featuring updated visuals and new features such as photo mode and boss health bars. The Internet Archive has recovered from a cyberattack and is back online in a provisional, read-only manner, but new pages cannot be captured and added to the catalogue until further maintenance is completed.

**At Long Last, Europe Has an Answer to SpaceX (or Does It?)**
Arianespace, a subsidiary of ArianeGroup, is finally announcing a reusable rocket design, dubbed by its new subsidiary MaiaSpace, after years of failed attempts. The new rocket, details of which are scarce, is expected to be smaller than SpaceX's Falcon 9, with a payload capacity of 1.5 tons. It will be designed to launch from land and land on a barge at sea. MaiaSpace's CEO, Yohann Leroy, claims to have 10 potential clients interested in launching on the new rocket, with a goal of having it ready for a first launch by 2025. However, given Arianespace's spotty record of announcing reusable rocket plans only to cancel them later, investors should be cautious and wait for more details before investing. As the article's author notes, 'the future for this rocket looks even hazier to me than did those for previous reusable rocket designs.'

**SpaceX will try to 'catch' giant Starship rocket shortly before landing**
SpaceX is set to attempt a world first on its next test flight of the Starship megarocket: catching the returning first-stage booster using the launch tower's 'chopstick' arms. The launch window opens at 7:00 am (1200 GMT) from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas. If successful, the returning booster will decelerate from supersonic speeds, generating audible sonic booms around the landing site, and the powerful 'chopstick arms' will embrace it as it descends about seven minutes after launch. SpaceX's 'fail fast, learn fast' strategy has accelerated development and contributed to the company's success, but its founding vision of making humanity a multiplanetary species is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by Elon Musk's alignment with right-wing politics.

**US FAA grounds SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket after second-stage malfunction**
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket after it malfunctioned during a NASA astronaut mission on Saturday. The rocket's second stage failed to properly re-light its engine for its 'deorbit burn,' causing it to fall outside of the designated safety zone in the Pacific Ocean. The astronaut crew safely docked at the International Space Station on Sunday. SpaceX said the malfunction was 'off-nominal' and that they will resume launching after a thorough investigation. This is the third time in three months that the FAA has grounded the Falcon 9 rocket, citing concerns over public safety. SpaceX has launched an average of two to three rockets a week since the beginning of 2024, but the FAA has been slow to approve new launch licenses, leading to a feud between the two. 'We will resume launching after we better understand root cause,' SpaceX wrote in a post on X.

**PS5's Latest UI Update Is Annoying Users With Constant Adverts**
The latest UI update for the PS5 has replaced the background for Game Hubs with full-screen advertisements. Games like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Elden Ring, and Space Marine 2 are now displaying the latest post from the PS5's news system, often showing adverts for the very game that users are trying to play. This change has been met with frustration from PS5 users, with some calling it an 'objectively terrible change.' The update appears to be permanent, and users are unable to turn off the advertisements. The change is believed to be due to the Game Hubs pulling their backgrounds from the News tab on PlayStation, which is why older and smaller games are unaffected. 'It's a mystery why PlayStation has decided to change this all of a sudden,' said one user, 'but the scale of the backlash may make it a temporary change.'

**SpaceX to Launch Crew-9 Mission to Rescue Stranded Astronauts**
SpaceX is set to launch the Crew-9 mission on September 28, 2024, at 09:00 a.m. (Bolivia time), with the goal of rescuing astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) since June. The mission will carry two astronauts, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, and will have two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams. This launch marks a significant milestone for SpaceX, as it demonstrates the company's ability to provide reliable transportation to the ISS. In contrast, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has faced numerous technical issues, including a failed propellant system and helium leaks, which have led to the postponement of the mission. According to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, the decision to use SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft was based on safety concerns. 'We found some things that we just couldn't feel comfortable putting ourselves back in the Starliner when we had other options,' said Wilmore. 'We wanted to take the Starliner to the end and land back home, but you know, there's a time to move on and look to the next opportunity,' added Williams. The two astronauts will remain in space for over 8 months and will not return until February 2025. This incident highlights the challenges faced by Boeing in developing its Starliner spacecraft, which has been plagued by technical issues since 2014. 'It was a successful landing,' said Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, but acknowledged that new problems had arisen, including a failed new propulsor and temporary loss of the guidance system. 'It's too early to say if the next Starliner flight, scheduled for August 2025, will carry a crew,' Stich added. 'We need time to analyze the data and evaluate the changes needed, both in the spacecraft design and its environment.'
