**Trump's Transition Period: What Will He Do Until He Takes Office?**
The Biden administration, which belongs to the Democratic Party, is preparing to transfer power to the Republican administration led by Donald Trump in a transition period known as 'the lame duck'. According to CBS News, the current administration will leave the White House finally and hand over to the new administration on January 20, 2025, for the new President and his administration. The US Constitution sets a maximum period of 4 months for the transfer of power between successive American administrations, while Biden will have full presidential powers until 12:00 PM on January 20, 2025. Meanwhile, the elected President Donald Trump will not have any executive powers until he takes office, and he cannot make any foreign visits during the transition period, but he can meet with foreign representatives to outline his foreign policy. During this period until January 20, Trump will receive daily or almost daily intelligence briefings and mandatory protection from the US Secret Service, as well as the necessary funds for the transfer of power, and will receive briefings from the outgoing administration. The US Congress will approve the result of the presidential election before January 6, 2025, and all election-related lawsuits must be resolved by December 8, 2024.

**Biden Vows to Peacefully Transfer Power to Trump**
US President Joe Biden expressed confidence in the US electoral system after the recent presidential elections and promised to peacefully transfer power to the new head of state. He stated that he will instruct his entire administration to work with Trump's team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transfer of power. 'I assured him that I will instruct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,' Biden said, adding that the American people deserve it. Biden also told his Democratic colleague Kamala Harris, who lost the election, that she should be 'proud' of her campaign. The US presidential election took place on November 5. Fox News reported that Trump received at least 295 electoral votes. Harris has already conceded. The inauguration of the 47th US President will take place on January 20, 2025.

**The Lame Duck Period: A Transitional Period in the US Presidential Election**
After Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election, the new administration is preparing to take over from the current administration, a process that takes around 11 weeks in a transitional period called 'the lame duck'. The new administration will take over on January 20, 2025, and during this period, there will be a transitional period of 11 weeks during which power will be transferred from the current administration led by Joe Biden to the new leadership of Trump. This period, which may seem long to some, is less than 4 months, which is the maximum period specified by the constitution for the transfer of power. This transitional period is called 'the lame duck' period, which begins on the day the election results are announced and ends on the day of the inauguration. According to American law, Biden will retain all presidential powers until January 20, 2025, while the elected president will not have any executive powers until he takes office, and he will not be able to make any foreign visits during the transitional period. The new administration's task during this period is to focus on domestic issues only, despite the president's right to meet with foreign representatives to outline his foreign policy. The incoming president will receive the necessary funds for the transition process and will receive briefings from the outgoing administration, as well as daily or almost daily intelligence briefings during the transitional period, and mandatory protection from the American intelligence service. Legally, all election-related lawsuits must be resolved by December 8, and before January 6, 2025, the date of the official certification of the election results by Congress.

**The Biden Administration Touts Its Big Year in AI**
The White House has announced that it has met all its year-one goals for the Biden administration's executive order on artificial intelligence. The order aimed to modernize the government's internal practices and regulate AI systems. The Department of Commerce has signed agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic, granting access to test their new models before release and requiring other developers to report safety test results quarterly. Other agencies have created new rules and guidance documents for AI users. The federal government has also hired over 250 AI practitioners and created a Chief AI Officers' Council. However, long-term goals, such as implementing strict policies for AI tools, require continued efforts and may be affected by the outcome of the presidential election.

**US Presidential Election: Flaws in the Electoral System that Favor the Risk of Contestation**
The United States will hold 51 simultaneous presidential elections on November 5. In each state, electors will be elected and will be responsible for designating the future president on December 17. According to Professor of Public Law Julien Boudon, this 'complex' and 'archaic' system multiplies the risks of contesting the election. Boudon notes that the US Constitution, written in 1787 and amended only 27 times in 237 years, leaves many things to the federal states, which increases the number of possible disputes. 'We saw this in 2020 and we will inevitably see it again in 2024,' he warns.

**US Presidential Election 2024: Latest Polls Show Tight Race Between Trump and Harris**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, where voters will not only choose the next president but also elect new members of the US Congress. In the US, citizens do not directly vote for the president and vice president, but for the electors. There are a total of 538 electors, distributed based on the population of each state, plus three representatives from the District of Columbia, which will officially elect the president. The candidate who receives at least 270 votes wins the election. According to the Electoral Count Act of 1877, states have a five-week period after the election (until December 11) to resolve any disputes related to the election before the Electoral College meets on December 17. Then, on January 6, 2025, the electoral votes will be officially counted during a joint session of Congress, and the Senate President will announce the election results. The winner will take office at the White House on January 20, 2025. The latest polls show that the race between the two candidates is closer than ever, with Kamala Harris's lead over Donald Trump narrowing to less than one percentage point, according to the New York Times. The challenges in key states (Swing States) remain tight, with no candidate holding a significant advantage in the seven most likely states to decide the presidency, writes the NYT. As the NYT notes, when the national vote is tied, it is not a good omen for Democrats, as Trump did better in key states than nationally in the two previous elections, allowing him to win in 2016 without winning the national popular vote and narrowly losing to Joe Biden in 2020.

**The pragmatist's guide to the 2024 presidential election**
The 2024 presidential election will have a significant impact on various areas, including antitrust, broadband, and climate change. The president appoints executive branch personnel, such as heads of independent agencies, who set and enforce policy. For example, Joe Biden's appointment of a tough consumer protection advocate led to the Federal Trade Commission forcing gyms to allow membership cancellations. In contrast, Republican control of the Federal Communications Commission under Donald Trump resulted in the end of federal net neutrality rules, while Democratic control under Biden revived them.

**2024 US Presidential Election: Key Facts and Figures**
The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, with over 244 million eligible voters. The election will determine key positions, including the President, Vice President, Senators, Representatives, and Governors. Additionally, local elections will be held for mayors, councilors, prosecutors, judges, and other public offices. The Democratic and Republican parties are competing for the presidency, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. The election will also determine 34 Senators and 435 Representatives, with 11 states holding gubernatorial elections. As of October 25, over 33 million people have already voted by mail or absentee ballot, with the top three states being Texas, Florida, and California. The Pew Research Center estimates that over 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote, with nine states being crucial for their vote. Seven 'swing' states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, will be key in determining the outcome. However, it's worth noting that the popular vote does not determine the winner, but rather the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. A candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. The election results will be projected on November 5, but the final decision will be made by the Electoral College in December. Some states require identification to vote, while others allow provisional ballots. Voters can check their registration and find their polling station on the Department of State's website or by contacting their local election office.

**None of the Polls so far has shown a runoff- Executive Director of Global InfoAnalytics**
According to Musah Dankwah, Executive Director and Head of Global Research at Global InfoAnalytics, recent polls indicate that there will be no runoff in the December 7th elections. Dankwah stated, 'None of the polls so far has shown a runoff, whether in the field survey or the telephone survey.' He noted that first-time voters are unlikely to play a significant role in the elections, and that those who voted for President Akufo-Addo in 2020 have a higher percentage of voting for Mr. Mahama in 2024. Dankwah added that Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia would need to break even to win 25% of votes from voters who have changed their minds and are now voting for the NPP.

**US Presidential Election 2024: A Guide to the Process and Candidates**
The US presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The two main candidates are Donald Trump from the Republican Party and Kamala Harris from the Democratic Party. The election process in the US is complex, with each state having a certain number of electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, which is 270 or more, is declared the winner. However, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but not the electoral vote. The US presidential election is an indirect process, where citizens of the states and Washington D.C. vote for electors who then cast their electoral votes. The candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes is declared the winner. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives chooses the president. In the US, most citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. However, each state has its own voter registration process and deadlines. Citizens living abroad can register to vote using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) and request an absentee ballot. In addition to the presidential election, voters will also be choosing new members of Congress. The results of the election will be announced on election night, but in some cases, it may take several days to count all the votes. If the president changes, there will be a transition period before the new administration takes office. The new president will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, in a ceremony at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C.

**Lawmakers face jam-packed agenda after Election Day; government funding, debt limit on the horizon**
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill face a jam-packed agenda after the November elections, including averting a federal government shutdown before the end of 2024 and addressing the debt limit in the new year. The elections will create uncertainty over how lawmakers will tackle the challenges ahead, and the fate of future Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate will factor heavily into legislative fights. Funding the government will take center stage in the immediate aftermath of the elections, with a Dec. 20 funding deadline during a lame-duck session. There are also growing calls for Congress to pass additional disaster relief in the wake of hurricanes Milton and Helene. A new Congress will convene in the opening days of 2025, and lawmakers will have to confront the federal debt limit, which will be reinstated on Jan. 2. Shai Akabas, the executive director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said, 'Congress thrives on deadlines and operating at the last minute. When it comes to the debt limit, there is no definitive last minute because we don’t know exactly when that point will arrive, unlike a government shutdown.' Lawmakers will also have to pass a final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025, renew key agriculture policy, and negotiate a tax package, including more than $3.4 trillion in individual income and estate tax cuts.

The US has never defaulted on its obligations, but fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks may try to force spending and budget cuts in exchange for addressing the debt limit. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2025 and the farm bill will also be major agenda items during the lame duck session.

**RFEF Announces New Election Date for Presidency**
The Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) has announced that the elections for the presidency will take place on December 16, 2024. This new date comes after the Tribunal Administrativo del Deporte (TAD) annulled the original election process scheduled for October 7. The RFEF aims to 'conclude' this process before the end of 2024. According to María Ángeles García Chaves, vice president of the RFEF, the process for the election of the Assembly, Delegated Commission, and President for the 2024-2028 Olympic period has been initiated. The elections for the presidency and the delegated commission will be held on December 16, 2024, as per the approved electoral calendar. The RFEF is responding to the TAD's decision to annul the original election process, which was scheduled for October 7. The decision was made in response to a complaint filed by the president of CENAFE, Miguel Ángel Galán. The RFEF is also seeking to comply with the law and the FIFA's request for stability in the organization, as Spain is set to host the 2030 World Cup alongside Portugal and Morocco.

**US election 2024: When is the US presidential election? Who is in the race?**
The 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5, with former President Donald Trump running against US Vice President Kamala Harris. The election will also determine the members of the US Congress, with all 435 spots in the House of Representatives and 34 Senate seats up for grabs. The electoral college system governs presidential elections, with each state having a different number of electors. To win the presidency, a candidate must win 270 electoral votes. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, 224 million Americans will be eligible to vote in 2024. The Pew Research Centre notes that the 2020 presidential election had a record turnout of 66% of the voting-eligible population, with nearly 155 million voters. The US does not have a federal counting process, and it can take weeks for the official tally to be released. However, US media often estimates the winner on election night, and the transition process begins after the election, with the new administration appointing Cabinet ministers and planning for the term.

In the lead-up to the US presidential election on November 5, former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to appoint Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the head of a new government department, dubbed the 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE). Musk has responded to the news, retweeting a user's suggestion for the department's name. While the possibility of Musk taking on a government position with oversight commitments is real, it remains to be seen whether Trump's vision for a department focused on interdepartmental culling will become a reality.

**Biden Signs Bill to Continue US Government Funding Until December 20**
US President Joe Biden signed a bill to continue funding the US government until December 20. According to the White House press release, 'on Thursday, September 26, 2024, the President signed the bill' which provides 'appropriations for projects and activities of executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government through December 20, 2024'. The Senate and House of Representatives previously approved the document on Wednesday. The Biden administration had previously stated that it is necessary to extend the funding of the US government until December 20 and urges both chambers of Congress to pass the corresponding bill as soon as possible. This would prevent a costly and unnecessary shutdown of government funding and give time to pass the 2025 budget later this year, as stated in the administration's statement.

**Opinion: Focus on the administration, not the candidate**
As the 2024 U.S. presidential election approaches, many Americans are unsure about which candidate to vote for. Dr. Jason Giersch, an associate political science professor at UNC Charlotte, suggests that voters focus on the administration, not just the candidate. According to Giersch, the administration, including the vice president and 15 executive department heads, has a significant impact on policy decisions. He notes that 'members of the administration have a voice and have influence, but they can't do much on their own.' Giersch emphasizes the importance of researching the roles of cabinet members and the success of previous administrations in areas such as national security, education, and healthcare. He also highlights the significance of cabinet positions, such as the Secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and State, in shaping the president's policies. By examining the achievements and setbacks of past administrative departments, voters can gain a better understanding of which candidate is more likely to appoint qualified and resilient individuals to key positions. As Giersch notes, 'sometimes, candidates pledge to add or remove cabinet positions or entire departments. Such a pledge is a pretty good signal as to what the federal government's role in that area will be if they are elected.'

**US Congress Leaders Reach Agreement to Avoid Government Shutdown**
The leaders of the US Congress announced an agreement on Sunday to extend federal government funding until mid-December, avoiding a contentious shutdown just weeks before the elections. The government funding was set to expire at the end of September, and a temporary measure, known as a 'continuing resolution' (CR), was expected. However, Republicans had been demanding that any extension of funds be tied to new requirements for voters to prove their US citizenship, a pressure motivated by Donald Trump's unfounded claims of widespread election fraud. The Wednesday vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed, and the agreement announced on Sunday excludes the voting provisions and extends funding only until December 20. This delays the debate on funding until well after the November 5 elections, where control of the House of Representatives, Senate, and Presidency is expected to be decided by narrow margins. The next Congress will convene shortly after New Year's, while the inauguration of the next president - either Republican Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris - will take place on January 20.

**Understanding the Organization of the 2024 US Presidential Election**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, with 244 million Americans eligible to vote. The election will be a complex process, with four candidates competing for the presidency: Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, Jill Stein, and Chase Oliver. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with 538 electors choosing the president. Each state has its own system for selecting electors, with some states using a winner-takes-all approach and others using a proportional system. The election will also feature a decentralized process, with each state and local government responsible for managing the election. The certification of the vote will take place at the state level, with the secretary of state or governor certifying the results. The Electoral Count Act of 1877 provides a five-week period for states to resolve any disputes and allow electors to meet on December 17. The votes will be officially counted on January 6, 2025, during a joint session of Congress. The winner of the election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Additionally, the election will also feature the election of 468 members of Congress, including 34 senators and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as various local elections and referendums.

**Understanding the US Presidential Election Process**
The 2024 US presidential election will take place on November 5, with 244 million Americans eligible to vote. The election will be between four candidates: Kamala Harris, the incumbent vice president, and Donald Trump, the former president. The election will be decided by the Electoral College, with 538 electors choosing the president. Each state has its own system for selecting electors, with some states using a 'winner-take-all' system and others using a proportional system. The election will also include votes for members of Congress and local officials. The certification of the election results will be done by the state secretaries or governors, with a 'safe harbor period' of five weeks after the election to resolve any disputes. The electors will meet on December 17 to formally vote for the president and vice president. The final count of the electoral votes will take place on January 6, 2025, and the winner will be announced by the president of the Senate. 'The election is a complex process, but it is essential for the functioning of democracy,' said a spokesperson for the National Conference of State Legislatures. 'It is crucial to ensure that all eligible voters can cast their ballots and that the results are accurate and reliable.'

**2024 US Presidential Election: Everything You Need to Know**
The 2024 US presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 5, 2024. The election will determine the next President of the United States, with the winner requiring at least 270 electoral votes. The election process is indirect, with voters selecting electors who will then choose the President. The electors will cast their votes on December 16, 2024. The election is crucial, as the President has significant power, including the ability to make executive orders and influence foreign policy. The election will also determine the composition of the US Congress, with all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and approximately one-third of the 100 seats in the Senate up for election. The election is expected to be closely contested, with several key states, including Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, playing a crucial role in determining the outcome. The election process has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many voters opting for mail-in ballots. The Associated Press will provide reliable election results, which will be announced on November 5, 2024. The inauguration of the new President will take place on January 20, 2025.

**Reoneração da folha é 'solução muito favorável para os setores da economia', diz Pacheco**
The President of the National Congress, Senator Rodrigo Pacheco, celebrated the sanctioning of the law that gradually renews the payroll for the 17 economic sectors and municipalities with up to 156,000 inhabitants. According to Pacheco, the sanction 'closes a long path of maturation of discussions between the government and the National Congress on the theme'. President Lula sanctioned the law with four vetoes. The law, approved by the National Congress last week, is the result of many negotiations between the federal government and the Legislature. Pacheco highlighted that 'the consensus achieved represents a very favorable solution for the economic sectors and, above all, for the Brazilian municipalities, which will now have a very relevant measure to balance public accounts.' The text sanctioned by Lula maintains the total desoneration until December 2024, starting the gradual reoneration process from 2025 until 2027. In 2028, the reoneration will return totally. The points vetoed by the head of the Executive were pointed out by the AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) and the Ministry of Finance. One of the points vetoed was the deadline for claiming forgotten resources in financial institutions. According to the text that left the Congress, the values could be claimed until December 31, 2027. But, with the veto, the value can be claimed in up to 30 days from this Monday. Then, the National Treasury will start collecting the values.
