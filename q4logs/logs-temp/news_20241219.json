Analysts attribute the surge to fears that the government's proposed spending cuts will be watered down in Congress, as well as the reduction of interest rates in the US by the Federal Reserve. Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad attempted to downplay the situation, stating that the dollar will stabilize in the coming months due to a temporary economic uncertainty. However, his words were not heeded by the market. Haddad explained, 'We have a floating exchange rate that, in this moment of uncertainty, reflects a climate of uncertainty. This makes the exchange rate fluctuate.' Despite the positive economic indicators, such as a 2.9% growth in GDP in 2023 and a predicted 3.39% growth in 2024, the high dollar is a concern, as it will impact the purchasing power of Brazilian citizens. The government is facing criticism from economists and market operators, with only 4% of financial agents approving of the Ministry of Finance's management, according to a recent survey.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 07:04 AM\nSource:[Correio Braziliense](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/politica/2024/12/7015519-analise-dolar-bate-novo-recorde-e-assusta-o-governo.html)\n\n**The Lone Star State is soaring America's future will be made in Texas**\nTexas is experiencing a surge in population and economic growth, with the potential to become the most populous state in the US. The state's young and diverse population, with a strong focus on high-tech industry and multiculturalism, could be a model for rebuilding America. However, this success is ironic given Texas's history as a bastion of conservatism and slavery. As former governor and senator Wilbert 'Pappy' O'Daniel once said, 'Texas had become New York's most valuable foreign possession'. Despite its past, Texas is now a hub of progress and innovation, with many people fleeing California to settle there. If Texas can overcome its conservative tendencies, it could be a beacon for a brighter future for the US.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 12:02 AM\nSource:[upstract.com](https://unherd.com/2024/12/the-lone-star-state-is-soaring/?ref=upstract.com)\n\n**Near-Term GDP Projections Get a Lift**\nFed officials have revised their projections upward for U.S. economic growth in 2025, anticipating a 2.1% increase in gross domestic product (GDP), according to the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections.

In 2025, the growth is expected to slow down, but still reach 2.4% by the end of the year. According to Mário Sergio Telles, superintendente of Economy at CNI, 'This is the third consecutive year of growth above 3%, which is surprising.' The main reason for this positive outcome is the labor market, which has seen an increase in employment and real income since 2022.

The policies, including tariffs on Mexico and Canada, mass deportations, and tax cuts, will raise prices and create labor shortages, leading to lower GDP growth. The California economy is also expected to grow more slowly than previously forecast, with the state's economy expected to grow at about the same rate as the country's in 2025 and 2026. The forecast anticipates a rise in wages due to labor shortages, and a recovery in the housing sector, but notes that the private sector's prospect of building out of the housing affordability problem over the next three years is nil.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 11, 2024 09:00 AM\nSource:[prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-uncertainties-underlie-near-future-economy-as-new-administration-implements-policies-302328272.html)\n\n**FORECLOSURE FILINGS EASE NATIONWIDE IN NOVEMBER 2024 AMID SEASONAL INFLUENCES**\nAccording to ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property data, and real estate analytics, foreclosure filings in the US decreased by 9% from last year and 5% from the prior month, with a total of 29,390 properties with foreclosure filings in November 2024.

This growth rate is solid, but lower than the 9.6% increase in 2022. Alan McKnight, chief investment officer for Regions Bank, called the growth rate 'very solid' and noted that it's well above the country's real GDP growth rate for 2023. However, uncertainty surrounding national economic policies, particularly under the incoming Trump Administration, may impact the economy in 2025. McKnight declined to make a 2025 prediction, citing the need for clarity on policy decisions and their effects on the economy. He noted that any new tariffs or immigration policies could have an inflationary impact, potentially affecting companies and consumers. Despite this uncertainty, McKnight expects Austin to continue to boast a stronger than average economy, driven by companies and people relocating to the area.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2024 06:41 AM\nSource:[bizjournals.com](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2024/12/05/austin-2024-economic-outlook-gdp.html)\n\n**Dickies To Relocate To Orange County, California**\nDickies, a Texas-based apparel company, will relocate its headquarters from Fort Worth, Texas to Orange County, California in early 2025.

This figure represents a strong desire by many Texans to remain in Texas. The state's population surged over the past few years, with a 1.6 percent annual growth rate, the third highest in the U.S. In 2023, around 612,000 people moved to Texas from other states, while 479,000 people moved out, resulting in a net inflow of about 133,000 people. California was the top state for people moving to Texas, with 94,000 people, while California also had the most people leaving Texas, with 39,000. Texas Realtors chair Jef Conn said, 'Texas is a great place to live, with our wide variety of locations, quality of life, and thriving economy.'

The reasons behind this trend include job opportunities, cost of living, tax policies, and personal preferences related to climate or lifestyle. California's high migration rate can be attributed to its high cost of living, particularly in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco, where housing prices exceed the national average. Additionally, the state's strict tax policies have motivated many to seek more accessible alternatives. However, California is not only losing residents but also attracting thousands from other states, demonstrating a constant migratory exchange. Florida remains an attractive destination due to its warm climate and lack of state income tax, but some residents have noted challenges related to housing accessibility and the increase in natural disasters like hurricanes. Texas's diverse economy and favorable tax policy have traditionally been attractive factors, but the rapid growth of cities like Austin and Dallas has increased the cost of living, prompting some to seek less densely populated states. New York and Illinois are seeking a better quality of life, with New York losing 483,523 people in 2023, with the most popular destinations being Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The COVID-19 pandemic intensified this trend, allowing many New Yorkers to move to more affordable places without losing their jobs. According to Voronoi, Florida's popularity is due to its warm climate, but others have chosen to stay close by moving to neighboring states like New Jersey.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 02, 2024 07:39 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/de-california-a-florida-por-que-cada-vez-mas-residentes-abandonan-estos-estados-y-a-cuales-se-mudan-nid02122024/)\n\n**Year Ender 2024: Here's Top 10 Richest States In The USA By GDP Rate**\nThe United States' economic prosperity is reflected in its states' GDP, with California leading the way with a staggering $3.987 trillion, followed by Texas with $2.664 trillion, and New York with $2.226 trillion.

However, most regions' real wages are still lower than before the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the ongoing erosion of people's purchasing power due to rising living costs. ILO Secretary-General Gilbert Houngbo said, 'If this trend is confirmed, it would be the largest increase in over 15 years...However, this positive trend is not shared equally by all regions.' The report found that emerging economies grew faster than advanced economies in 2023, with a 6% increase in real wages in G20 emerging economies, compared to a 0.5% decline in G20 advanced economies. The growth rate of real wages varies significantly across regions, with Central Asia and the Middle East experiencing the highest growth rate of 17.9%, followed by Eastern Europe at 9.3%, and the Asia-Pacific region at 2.9%. However, the Asia-Pacific region's growth rate is heavily influenced by China, and excluding China, the growth rate is expected to be only 1.5%. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbean region is expected to grow by 1.5%, North America by 0.3%, Africa by 0%, and the Arab States by -0.1%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 04:16 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/8392781)\n\n**Q3 GDP Second Estimate: Real GDP At 2.8%, In Line With Forecast**\nThe U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8% in Q3 2024, according to the second estimate.

This is because they receive 44.5% of Mexico's exports, with Texas receiving 30% and Michigan receiving 14.5%. José Ramón de la Rosa, subdirector of analysis at Actinver, stated, 'If there are additional taxes, American companies will pay more for products.' De la Rosa also mentioned that other states receiving a large number of Mexican goods include California, Illinois, and Tennessee. He also noted that migrants arriving in the US are not taking jobs from citizens, but rather filling labor gaps. 'Migrants are helping the US labor market to be adequately staffed for various tasks,' he said.

Outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion for the U.S. economy last year, with California, Florida, and Texas being the top states. The growth in bike riding can be attributed to environmental awareness, health and fitness, urban congestion, improved bike paths, cost efficiency, and the proliferation of e-bikes. Jessica Turner, president of the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, said, 'Millions are flocking to the outdoors.' The number of participants increased across demographics and activities, with a record 175.8 million Americans participating in outdoor recreation in 2023, up 4.1% over the year before. Boating/fishing saw the largest increase with $36.8 billion in value added in 2023, followed by RVing, hunting/shooting/trapping, motorcycling/ATVing, and winter activities.

Experts warn that this trend, which has been ongoing for several years, is here to stay. Ana Bozovic of Miami Analytics stated, 'I do not see a reversal: there will be no mass reverse migration back to high-tax states.' Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute attributed the decline to 'higher tax burdens and unfriendly business climates.' He described red states like Florida as 'more economically vibrant, dynamic and business friendly.' The data showed that New York lost 179,000 more people than it gained in 2023, with the largest number of leavers choosing Florida as their destination. California lost a quarter million-plus people, with over 50,000 moving to Texas, including billionaire Elon Musk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 10:57 PM\nSource:[nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2024/11/09/lifestyle/new-york-california-losing-population-to-sun-belt-census-data/)\n\n**Economic Slowdown in Mexico: BBVA Report Predicts 1.2% Growth Rate in 2024**\nAccording to the BBVA report, the economic slowdown in Mexico is reflected in all 32 states, with a predicted growth rate of 1.2% in 2024, down from 1.3% in 2023. The report attributes this slowdown to a weak domestic demand, reduced job creation, decreased public spending, and a decline in demand for durable goods in the US. BBVA Research predicts that Mexico's GDP will grow by 1.2% in 2024 and 1.0% in 2025. The report notes that the states with the highest growth rates in 2024 will be Nayarit and Hidalgo, with 1.9% each, followed by Baja California Sur with 1.8%. However, these states had much higher growth rates in 2023, with 5.3%, 4.5%, and 5.2% respectively. On the other hand, Campeche is expected to experience a 0.2% decline in its state GDP in 2024, compared to a 2.5% growth rate in 2023. The states with the lowest growth rates in 2024 are Durango, Oaxaca, and Tlaxcala, with 0.6%, 0.7%, and 0.7% respectively. The report also notes that the growth in some states in 2023 was driven by large infrastructure projects such as the Dos Bocas refinery and the Tren Maya. However, these projects are expected to slow down in 2024, leading to a decline in investment and employment in states such as Tabasco, Yucatán, Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Oaxaca. 'The reduction in growth in 2024 is significant in all states,' the report states. 'By the end of 2024, the state-level outlook is more gloomy, given the weakness of domestic demand, moderate investment, and the decline in public spending, as well as the high interest rates that persisted in the first half of the year,' it adds.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 11:22 PM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/sectorfinanciero/desaceleracion-economica-refleja-todos-estados-pais-bbva-mexico-20241104-732797.html)\n\n**US Election 2024: Understanding the United States in 20 maps**\nThe United States is preparing for the 2024 election, with key issues including the economy, immigration, and border control.

Missouri led the indicator, but its value was not disclosed due to confidentiality requirements. California came in second with $12,800 million, followed by New Jersey with $12,100 million and Texas with $10,100 million. The total FDI inflow for 2023 was $148,800 million, according to preliminary statistics published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. California's economy, the largest in the U.S., accounted for 14% of the country's GDP in 2023 and was ranked as the fifth-largest economy in the world at the end of 2023. The state's economy is diversified, with sectors such as technology, commerce, entertainment, manufacturing, government, tourism, construction, and services. Texas, on the other hand, relies heavily on key industries, including oil and gas, chemical production, and technology equipment manufacturing. California's Silicon Valley and access to venture capital and a large pool of tech workers make it an attractive destination for technology investment. Texas's infrastructure, including its ports and extensive network of roads, highways, and railroads, adds to its appeal. Additionally, the state's strong business ecosystem and proximity to Mexico make it an attractive location for multinational companies looking to expand into the North American market.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 09:41 PM\nSource:[opportimes.com](https://www.opportimes.com/atraccion-de-ied-en-estados-unidos-california-y-texas/)\n\n**Coahuila Leads States with Highest Economic Growth in Second Quarter of 2024**\nAccording to data released by the Inegi, Coahuila led the states with the highest economic growth in the second quarter of 2024, with a 3.5% growth rate, tied with Baja California. Coahuila surpassed Oaxaca (5.1%), Durango (3.8%), and Guerrero (2.8%) in terms of economic expansion.

These states were Oaxaca, with a 5.1% increase; Durango, with a 3.8% increase; Coahuila and Baja California, with a 3.5% increase each; and Guerrero, with a 2.8% increase. In contrast, the states that recorded the largest declines in economic activity were Tabasco, with a 3.3% decrease; Campeche, with a 3.2% decrease; Hidalgo, with a 2.5% decrease; Sinaloa, with a 1.4% decrease; and the Mexico City, with a 0.7% decrease. At an annual rate, the states with the most growth were Durango, with a 7.7% growth; Colima, with a 6.8% growth; Oaxaca, with a 6.0% growth; Quintana Roo, with a 5.9% growth; Yucatán, with a 4.1% growth; and Zacatecas, with a 4.1% growth. However, Tabasco, Campeche, and Hidalgo recorded declines of 9.0%, 7.2%, and 1.5%, respectively. Julio A. Santaella, a economist and former president of the Inegi, explained that based on original data, the national GDP grew 2.1% annually in the second quarter of 2024, due to the contributions of states such as Nuevo León, Estado de México, Ciudad de México, and Guanajuato, which added between 0.21% and 0.30% to the national economy.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 09:39 PM\nSource:[razon.com.mx](https://www.razon.com.mx/negocios/seis-entidades-lideran-actividad-economica-segundo-trimestre-2024-599373)\n\n**California is losing more workers than any other state**\nCalifornia is experiencing a net loss of workers at a faster rate than any other state, according to a new report by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). In the third quarter of 2023, nearly 87,000 professionals left the state for new career opportunities, surpassing job inflows of about 69,000. The most popular states for California workers to move to are Texas, Arizona, Washington, Nevada, and New York. The NAR attributed the exodus to high housing costs, high state income taxes, and a high cost of living. However, experts predict that the trend may shift in 2024 as companies adopt hybrid work arrangements and adjust salaries based on employee location. 'California's once-dominant appeal as the 'land of opportunity' is starting to erode as workers seek more sustainable living and working conditions elsewhere,' said Sam Taylor, a business consultant. California's cost-of-living is among the highest in the country, with rent costs alone exceeding 30 percent of a person's income in many cities. 'In contrast, states like Texas and Florida, which have lower housing costs, better job opportunities, and a more manageable lifestyle, are attracting these same workers, allowing them to stretch their income further while enjoying a lower-stress environment,' Taylor added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2024 08:39 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/california-losing-more-workers-any-other-state-migration-1973442)\n\n**Illinois holds second-worst unemployment rate in the nation**\nIllinois has the second-worst unemployment rate in the nation, tied with California at 5.3% in September 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Illinois saw job growth of 35,400 since September 2023, but this growth rate ranked 47th among all states at 0.58%. The state's slow economic growth and high unemployment are attributed to an unfriendly business environment resulting from high taxes and a constantly mismanaged budget. Illinois has the highest state and local tax burden in the Midwest and levies the second-highest corporate income tax in the nation. To improve its economic situation, Illinois must focus on strengthening its fiscal position, removing regulatory burdens, and providing real tax relief to workers and job creators.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[illinoispolicy.org](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-holds-second-worst-unemployment-rate-in-the-nation/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

This reduction follows previous cuts in September and November. The Fed stated that the risks for employment and inflation are 'more or less balanced' and remains 'attentive' to potential threats from both sides. According to the Fed, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to grow at a solid pace, but the labor market has lost momentum since the beginning of the year, with the unemployment rate rising, although remaining low. The inflation rate has continued to move towards the Fed's 2% target, but remains elevated. The Fed will be attentive to incoming data and will be prepared to adjust interest rates as necessary, analyzing labor market, inflation, and international and financial event effects. As in September, one member of the Fed, Beth Hammack, voted against the interest rate cut, preferring to keep them at 4.50%-4.75%. The Fed will continue to reduce its balance sheet by re-investing principal payments from Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2% in November, and the consumer price index (CPI) increasing to 2.3% in October.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 07:23 PM\nSource:[canarias7.es](https://www.canarias7.es/economia/fed-baja-tipos-interes-tercera-vez-marzo-20241218202339-ntrc.html)\n\n**International markets face an uncertain 2025. Here's what to look out for**\nInternational markets are facing an uncertain 2025, with concerns of slow growth, higher inflation risks, and a stronger dollar from U.S. tariffs weighing on investors. 'Many global multi-asset investors are approaching 2025 with some trepidation, and the growing unease is understandable,' said Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Asset Management. The list of significant concerns is long, including a strong U.S. dollar, which could hurt international markets by hurting other countries' purchasing power. 'A strong U.S. dollar, fueled by protectionist trade policies, is making imports from the U.S. more expensive and reducing returns for U.S. investors with non-U.S. holdings,' said Richard Ratner, senior vice president at Bel Air Investment Advisors. Weak growth worldwide is also a concern, with Europe and China forecast to underperform in 2025. However, not all hope is lost, with some pockets of opportunity emerging, such as Japan and India. 'This could actually boost E.U. competitiveness,' said Ryan Dykmans, chief investment officer at Dunham & Associates Investment Counsel. 'As the economy enters its third year of normalization, we expect Japanese stocks to enter a sustained growth phase, driven by corporate governance reforms that lead to a different pace of corporate behavior,' said JPMorgan strategist Rie Nishihara. India is also expected to be one of the top emerging markets next year, with strong earnings, macro stability, and domestic flows. However, not all of Wall Street is as bullish, with Bank of America saying it's stuck 'between hope and caution' on Indian equities next year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 03:05 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/18/international-markets-face-an-uncertain-2025-heres-what-to-look-out-for.html)\n\n**Trump's Presidency: A Key Investment Focus in 2025**\nAs the US presidential election approaches, market sentiment has become increasingly optimistic about the US stock market. Analysts believe that President Trump's personnel appointments and policy implementations will be the key investment focus in the first quarter of 2025. Given the global economic data divergence, it is recommended to invest in a balanced fund to grasp the financial market's investment rhythm. According to S&P Global, the US service industry expanded at its fastest pace in over three years in December, while manufacturing remained sluggish. This indicates that the US economy is becoming increasingly polarized, with manufacturing stagnating and services performing well, which is expected to continue supporting the US economy's stable growth. Meanwhile, the Eurozone's PMI continued to decline in December, and the Eurozone economy remains in a recession, relying on services to recover, while manufacturing remains sluggish. The European Central Bank has also lowered its economic growth rate and inflation forecast. The global economy is experiencing different trends. The Daiwa Securities target return combination fund research team predicts that with the uncertainty of the 2025 US presidential election eliminated and inflation expected to decrease gradually, the BofA Investment Clock shows that the economy is in the 'recovery' stage in 2024, with low interest rates and high earnings-per-share stocks expected to rise. In 2025, the economy will enter the 'prosperity' stage, where earnings-per-share is high and interest rates are high. At the same time, the 2025 bond yield curve will turn bearish, indicating a shift from a deflationary to an inflationary environment, where bond prices will decline and interest rates will decrease. Equity performance will outperform bonds, but this will be a positive factor for most risk assets, so it is still worth paying attention to stock performance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 03:36 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7238/8433032)\n\n**Saudi Investors Flock to US Stock Market, with $24 Billion Invested in Q3 2024**\nSaudi investors have shown a significant increase in their investments in the US stock market, with a total value of around $24 billion in the third quarter of 2024, representing a growth of 110.5% compared to the same period in 2023.

The FDI in the Americas region decreased by 34.4% to $5.13 billion, while the FDI in Europe, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean decreased by 36%, 29.2%, and 21.3% respectively. The Ministry explained that the decrease in FDI is due to 'global economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and geopolitical risks.' A government official stated, 'Many companies that invested in the US semiconductor industry through IRA support have reduced their investment.' The top industries for FDI were finance and insurance ($6.06 billion), manufacturing ($3.97 billion), mining ($1.29 billion), and information and communication ($853 million). The information and communication industry saw a significant increase in investment, with a 3-fold increase from the same period last year, attributed to the efforts of game companies such as NCSoft and Krafton to strengthen their global competitiveness.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 08:59 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/11194238)\n\n**Mexico's Economy: A Look Ahead to 2025**\nMexico's economy grew 1.1% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, according to the INEGI. This suggests that economic activity in Mexico accelerated in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year. However, there were several unusual events in the first half of the year that created favorable base effects. The labor market is showing signs of weakness, with formal employment growth slowing significantly. The PIB registered a growth rate of 1.6% in the third quarter of 2024, and a cumulative growth of 1.8%, above the consensus of analyst surveys. The balance of risks for Mexico's growth in 2025 is skewed to the upside, due to a better manufacturing outlook in the US and the lack of coordination in public spending between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Additionally, the 'nearshoring' trend is continuing, but in a less visible way, as foreign companies are investing in existing infrastructure and hiring local engineers to manage their operations. 'Nearshoring' will be a key driver of growth in 2025, according to the author. 'The 'nearshoring' is happening, but it's not being seen in the usual indicators,' said the author. 'The model of productive investment in Mexico has changed. Foreign companies no longer want to come to the country to build a factory from scratch. They want to come to a safe place that offers the infrastructure they need, water and electricity mainly, where they can simply arrive, connect their machines and hire some engineers to manage their operation. That's what the industrial parks in Mexico offer and that's not counted as FDI because they are being built by local developers of industrial parks.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 10, 2024 12:19 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/opinion/gabriel-casillas/2024/12/10/mexico-2025/)\n\n**Canada's balance of international payments, third quarter 2024**\nCanada's current account balance posted a $3.2 billion deficit in the third quarter, narrowing $1.5 billion from the previous quarter.

This surge in price reflects a growing appetite for perceived safe-haven assets and positions USAU as a standout performer in the sector. The company has also made significant progress on its CK Gold Project, obtaining the necessary permit for development and conducting advanced engineering and optimization studies to support the transition to the development phase. These studies have focused on areas such as the tailings management facility (TMF), water management, and plant operations. The Tierra Group International of Denver has examined the TMF design to potentially increase its capacity and reduce capital costs without altering the approved footprint. USAU is also refining its water management strategy to strengthen its water collection capabilities, with the goal of reducing its reliance on purchased water. Additionally, the company is exploring alternative flotation technologies that could improve metal recovery rates and reduce operating costs. These recent developments are part of USAU's broader effort to consolidate the economic feasibility of the project before releasing the updated Prefeasibility Study in the third quarter of 2024. InvestingPro data reveals an impressive total price return of 126.33% in the last year, aligning with the 136.87% increase reported in the article, confirming the exceptional performance of the title.

The current account, which records transactions of goods, services, and transfers, showed a slight surplus in the third quarter, similar to the second quarter. Remittances were the driving force behind this surplus. The balance of payments is also the primary source of information for analyzing foreign direct investment. In the third quarter, foreign direct investment net (entries minus exits) was $1,443 million. For the first nine months of the year, the total foreign direct investment was $31,330 million, a 3.3% increase from the same period in 2023. The total entries of resources directed to investment were $35,738 million, slightly higher than the $35,226 million that entered in the same months of last year. Foreign direct investment typically represents around 10% of Mexico's total investment, but it is a fundamental lever for growth, not only because of the resources involved, but also because of the externalities associated with it, such as the transfer of technology, changes in productivity, and the exchange of knowledge. The entry of new investment, considered different from the reinvestment of profits or accounts between companies, was $511 million in the third quarter, lower than the $684 million in the second quarter and the $865 million in the first quarter. According to the data presented yesterday, new investments represent only 6% of the entries, down from 50% in 2022 and 14% in 2023. Foreign direct investment is not a clear sign of the relocalization phenomenon, and it could be a lagging variable. However, there is no evidence of a change in the trend of investments, despite announcements of investment and narratives of historical highs. In the international context, Mexico still presents opportunities, but the reinvestment of profits accounts for 86% of the investments. Investors are waiting to see if the country will provide the necessary conditions for new resource injections. Meanwhile, while Mexico falters in providing what is needed to promote investment, Trump prepares his return to the White House and will not hesitate to seek alternative destinations for those investments.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 26, 2024 09:19 AM\nSource:[eluniversal.com.mx](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/opinion/valeria-moy/esperar-y-ver/)\n\n**Mexico's Foreign Direct Investment Sees Mixed Results in Third Quarter of 2024**\nAccording to Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico captured $2.1 billion in new investments in the third quarter of 2024, exceeding the $900 million of the previous period.

However, experts like Miguel González Ibarra and Rodolfo Ramos pointed out that there are still areas of opportunity that Mexico needs to address, such as implementing policies friendly to the private sector and addressing concerns about institutional deterioration and potential policies of Trump. 'The idea of allowing public-private associations and unblocking investments in energy will be a success,' said González Ibarra. 'The nearshoring is working, something is happening economically,' added Ebrard, referring to the fact that Mexico is attracting investments due to its proximity to the US market.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 08:47 AM\nSource:[elfinanciero.com.mx](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/2024/11/20/crecen-nuevas-inversiones-133-en-3t24-presume-ebrard/)\n\n**Austrian Real Estate Market Shows Signs of Life**\nThe Austrian real estate investment market is showing signs of life in the third quarter of 2024, with a volume of around 1.1 billion euros, about 11% higher than the same period last year. This is according to the current Arnold Immobilien market analysis. Markus Arnold, CEO of Arnold Immobilien, notes that 'private investors are still showing great interest in the high-quality existing products currently on offer. Additional dynamism comes from international early movers.' He also emphasizes that 'a growing deal pipeline and the already confirmed transactions in the fourth quarter indicate a sustainable revival of the domestic investment market.' The focus of investment transactions in 2024 is on office buildings, accounting for around 50% of the volume. In the third quarter of 2024, the residential segment (deal volume from 15 million euros) also showed a significant increase in dynamics. Austrian residential real estate is becoming increasingly attractive to international investors due to the currently very attractive sales prices. 'The majority of completed deals in the residential segment were made with foreign capital, with most cases being purchased with the support of local investment management companies,' reports Martin Ofner, head of market analysis at Arnold Immobilien. Improved framework conditions are expected to influence the investment market in 2025, with macroeconomic experts predicting that the future economic development and interest rate development will be the dominant factors. In terms of Austrian economic growth in 2025, it will be observed whether the autumn forecasts of Austrian economic research institutes, with +0.8% (IHS) and +1.0% (WIFO) GDP growth, are accurate. For investors, an end to the Austrian economic recession would be a much-needed signal to increase confidence in demand on the user markets.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[geld-magazin.at](https://www.geld-magazin.at/immobilien-oesterreich-belebt/)\n\n**Uncertainty Favors Gold: A Look at the Global Debt Situation and Gold Investments**\nThe uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is over, but long-term gold price predictions are still challenging. Factors such as interest rate development, monetary policy of the American central bank, and inflation expectations are crucial. Unpredictable events like the pandemic can occur. However, it is certain that more and more countries want to reduce their dependence on the US dollar. Estimates suggest that the yuan will rise and the US dollar will decline. The global debt is immense, with the International Monetary Fund estimating that it will exceed $100 trillion for the first time. The US and China are the largest debtors, followed by Italy, France, Brazil, and the UK. The increasing debt is driven by factors such as climate change and aging populations. This debt situation speaks in favor of gold. As a result, interest in gold investments in Europe is high. In October, the number of investors who invested in gold for the first time worldwide doubled compared to the previous year. The same applies to the third quarter as a whole. In the third quarter of 2024, it was particularly the ETF inflows that drove up gold demand. Even the lower demand for bars, coins, and jewelry could not change this. With interest rate cuts and high government debt, further inflows into ETFs are expected. Gold remains the preferred means of preserving values, protecting wealth, and not watching wealth decline due to the devaluation of currencies. The values of gold mining companies are also a possibility. Miata Metals has earn-in options for the acquisition of a stake (100%) in the Gold Project Sela Creek in Suriname and also in the Cabin Lake property in British Columbia. Fury Gold Mines is active in Nunavut and Quebec. At the Eau-Claire project, more than 12 grams of gold per ton of rock have already been detected. Fury Gold Mines holds a significant stake in Dolly Varden Silver.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 02:21 PM\nSource:[pressebox.de](https://www.pressebox.de/pressemitteilung/swiss-resource-capital-ag/unsicherheiten-gut-fuer-den-goldpreis/boxid/1223715)\n\n**A Resilient Global Market in 2024**\nThe global market has shown resilience in 2024, providing extraordinary returns in investment portfolios, particularly in relation to global markets, especially in the United States. This has occurred despite the presence of various economic, geopolitical, and political factors that have introduced volatility. The US economy has shown signs of strength and stands out in the global context, despite the uncertainties and expectation of deceleration generated by a restrictive monetary policy after the interest rate hike cycle by the Federal Reserve. According to the IMF projections, the growth for 2024 is expected to be 2.6%, compared to 2.5% in 2023, which represents a growth higher than the developed world average, estimated at 1.7% for this year. Although the labor market has begun to show signs of weakness, data such as the unemployment rate and consumption figures that exceed analysts' expectations are observed. In terms of inflation, a downward trend is appreciated, with some fluctuations throughout the year, but in general, a greater certainty of relaxation in monetary policy is projected. The main stock market indices reported positive returns in double digits at the end of the third quarter, based on various regional factors. In the United States, a less marked divergence in sectoral returns has been seen, with a significant boost in companies benefiting from the advancement of artificial intelligence, as well as in other sectors with attractive growth and undervalued valuations. The expectation for the third quarter is a growth of over 7%, compared to 11.2% in the previous quarter, which is a notable figure. Globally, positive stories are also found, such as Japan's economic strength and its exit from a low-inflation environment, supported by optimistic expectations regarding changes in regulation and corporate governance that benefit the country's companies. In Europe, the situation is more complicated, with a technical recession in Germany and lower growth in corporate profits, with projections of a decline for 2024; however, expectations for 2025 may improve, both in terms of economic growth and profits, given a lower comparative base and a recovery with the relaxation of monetary policy, where it seems that the ECB has more room for cuts. In emerging markets, China's situation is notable. Since the pandemic, the country has faced weaknesses that have affected its growth potential, as well as the lack of government measures to significantly boost consumer confidence and the real estate sector. Recently, signs of greater government intervention have been seen to achieve the 5% growth target, actions that the market has received positively, which has improved the stock market performance and positioned China among the countries with the best performance of the year. In summary, the strength of the stock market in 2024 is based on solid economic growth, business innovation, and a robust labor market. However, factors such as geopolitical risk and electoral uncertainty present challenges that investors must consider. On the one hand, geopolitical instability, particularly in the Middle East, has created an environment of uncertainty that investors observe with attention. As tensions increase, global markets experience volatility, which affects especially energy and raw materials sectors. The price of oil has shown significant fluctuations and any escalation in the conflict can impact production costs, supply chains, and inflation, being a determining factor for monetary policy. Another crucial factor is the electoral cycle in the United States. With the uncertainty of the final results of the presidential elections in sight, political uncertainty can cause market movements. The promises of the candidates on issues such as the economy, fiscal policy, and financial regulation will influence investor confidence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 06:36 AM\nSource:[Milenio.com](https://www.milenio.com/opinion/alfonso-jarquin/columna-alfonso-jarquin/un-mercado-global-resiliente)\n\n**Poll position: US election could rattle global markets, says ASPS**\nAsia Plus Securities (ASPS) is warning investors to be cautious ahead of the US election, predicting it will lead to increased market volatility. ASPS suggests focusing on stocks with low volatility and strong third-quarter performances for 2024. The brokerage also notes that the Thai economy is expected to see a boost from the government's fiscal 2024 and 2025 budgets, which include increased spending and private investment. However, high debt levels and potential credit rating downgrades are concerns. ASPS analysts predict a shortfall in listed companies' earnings for the third quarter, but forecast the SET index to tick upwards due to a low earnings yield gap. The brokerage recommends keeping an eye on stable performers such as WHA Corporation, Plan B Media, and Bangkok Dusit Medical Services. 'It's time to back stocks boasting low volatility and stellar third-quarter performances for 2024,' said ASPS. 'With interest rate cuts potentially taking a rain check and global central banks keeping markets on tenterhooks, bond yields might just shoot up, fuelled further by escalating international tensions,' the brokerage added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 02:28 AM\nSource:[The Thaiger](https://thethaiger.com/news/business/us-election-to-impact-global-stocks-asps-advises-cautious-investing)\n\n**Investments hinge on US election result**\nInvestors are advised to monitor the US election results on November 5, as it may impact global investments and create volatility in stock markets, according to Asia Plus Securities (ASPS). ASPS recommends focusing on stocks with low volatility and those expected to report healthy performances for the third quarter of 2024. The brokerage also notes that the US Federal Reserve's indication of a slower pace of interest rate cuts and rising geopolitical risks may influence investment decisions. ASPS outlines a cautious investment strategy for November, recommending investors steer clear of volatile stocks that may be affected by the US election. The brokerage also forecasts the profits of listed companies for the third quarter to be below expectations, with an earnings yield gap (EYG) of 3.8% consistent with the historical average. ASPS projects the earnings per share for the SET index to be 91.4 baht in 2024, rising slightly to 98.8 baht in 2025. The SET index target is 1,510 points for 2024 and 1,633 points for 2025, assuming the policy rate remains at 2.25% and the EYG at 3.8%. ASPS recommends stocks such as WHA Corporation (WHA), Plan B Media (PLANB), CP Axtra (CPAXT), Bangkok Dusit Medical Services (BDMS), SC Asset Corporation (SC) and Airports of Thailand (AOT) for their potential to post net profit growth in the third quarter while maintaining low volatility.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 10:20 PM\nSource:[Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2895433/investments-hinge-on-us-election-result)\n\n**Innovex International, Inc.

The majority of the growth occurred in the first quarter, with a significant increase in advanced economies, as stated in an OECD report. However, in the second quarter, FDI fell 36% compared to the first quarter, reflecting the persistent volatility in global markets. The OECD countries saw an 80% increase in FDI to $338 billion, although the growth would be 14% if the entries in Luxembourg and the Netherlands are not included. Mexico ranked third in FDI capture. The US was the largest recipient of FDI globally between January and June, followed by Brazil and Mexico. In contrast, FDI fell 19% in non-OCDE G20 countries, mainly due to the impact of China, where the trend of decline continued due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties affecting foreign investors' confidence. Emerging and developing economies saw significant setbacks, and in the second quarter, they reached their lowest level in two years. Despite uncertain prospects in the second half of 2024, the report notes that the technology and renewable energy sectors have captured a significant portion of investments in advanced economies, led by the US and Australia.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 08:58 PM\nSource:[Milenio.com](https://www.milenio.com/negocios/inversion-extranjera-directa-mundial-elevo-junio-ocde)\n\n**US Investors Are Bracing For Big, Big Things**\nThis week is crucial for US investors as five of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, are set to report their earnings. Analysts predict that these companies saw their earnings grow by 18% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The US economy is also expected to show strong growth, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow model projecting a 3.4% annualized rate in the third quarter. However, this could lead to mixed feelings among investors, as strong growth may boost corporate earnings but also force the Federal Reserve to slow its pace of interest rate cuts, potentially weighing on the stock market's high valuations. The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its global growth forecast for 2025, citing rising geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, gold prices have hit a record high, driven by falling interest rates, central banks' demand for the metal, and heightened economic and geopolitical risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2024 11:00 PM\nSource:[finimize.com](https://finimize.com/content/us-investors-are-bracing-for-big-big-things)\n\n**International Business Agenda: Key Earnings Releases**\nThe following are the key items on the international business agenda from October 28 to November 4, 2024: Several major companies, including Adidas, Covestro, Deutsche Lufthansa, HelloFresh, and Novartis, will release their third-quarter earnings on October 29.

The largest contributors to absolute returns included Inditex, Haleon, argenx, HOYA, and London Stock Exchange, while the greatest detractors were Novo Nordisk, ASML, Tokyo Electron, and Rentokil. The Strategy added new positions in Prysmian, Coupang, and repurchased Spotify, and exited positions in Antofagasta, Givaudan, Monday.com, Hexagon, Daifuku, and McDonald's Japan. The team remains confident in the Japan market, citing a continued recovery in domestic demand, rising GDP growth, and a low risk of deflation returning.
