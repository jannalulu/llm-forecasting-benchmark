**US Forces Kill 136 ISIS Fighters, Arrest 30 Leaders in Iraq and Syria**
The US Central Command (CENTCOM) announced that US forces conducted 95 operations against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria over the past two months, resulting in the deaths of 136 ISIS fighters and the arrest of 33 of its members, including at least 30 high- and mid-level leaders. According to CENTCOM, the operations were carried out since August 29, with some targeting individual strikes in Syria. The US and Iraq agreed to end the international coalition's military mission against ISIS in Iraq by September 2025, shifting towards bilateral security partnerships to combat the group's remnants. 'We will continue to work with our partners to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS,' said CENTCOM.

**Russia's 'Shaheds' Become Faster and More Deadly: Expert Explains**
According to Oleg Katkov, the main editor of Defense Express, Russia is making 'shaheds' cheaper, but this does not mean that they have run out of money. Instead, they are using existing resources to produce more drones. Katkov explained that Russia is simplifying the production process by removing unnecessary components, such as starters and flywheels, from the drones' engines. This allows them to produce more drones at a lower cost. Katkov also noted that Russia has changed the material used for the drone's body and has simplified the production technology, which has enabled them to produce a large number of drones. He emphasized that the use of thermobaric warheads is very dangerous, especially when it comes to hitting residential buildings. The warhead can cause widespread damage and is designed to kill people quickly and efficiently. Katkov stated that Russia's goal is to use these drones to terrorize the local population and to make it difficult for Ukrainian defenders to shoot them down.

**Russia Accumulates Rockets and Uses More Drones in Attacks on Ukraine**
In October 2024, Russian occupiers did not carry out massive rocket attacks on Ukraine, as they did in September. However, they regularly carried out individual attacks, mainly using X-59/69 and 9M723 missiles. The number of drones used in attacks also set a record, with 2023 drones used, according to other monitoring sources, this number was 1734. The accuracy of the drones was 79, or 4%. It's worth noting that not all of these drones were Shahed-136, but also drones-prizes 'Herbera', 'Parody' and their analogues, which are cheaper and intended to distract the air defense. The Russians also used more FPV-drones than in September, with over 13,000 used in October. The intensity of the use of 'Lance' ammunition was also low, with some days seeing fewer than five units used per day. The Russians are likely accumulating rockets, including X-101/555 and 'Caliber', for use during the heating season. The use of drones-prizes and FPV-drones by the Russians is a growing problem, making it difficult to identify potentially dangerous targets and decoys that distract attention and cause waste of ammunition. 'We are seeing a significant increase in the use of drones-prizes and FPV-drones by the Russians,' said a spokesperson. 'This is a major concern for us, as it makes it difficult to identify the real target and causes unnecessary waste of ammunition.'

**Save the Children: “How many times must children in Gaza face mass slaughter? What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?” – Day 391**
The Israeli occupation forces have been conducting aerial, ground, and naval bombardment of northern Gaza for 28 consecutive days, resulting in over 1,200 Palestinian deaths. The siege has included blocking supplies of food, water, medicine, and fuel, destroying homes, and attacking hospitals. Save the Children has expressed outrage over the mass slaughter of children in Gaza, with at least 50 children killed in a recent attack. The organization's Regional Director, Jeremy Stoner, said, 'How many times must children in Gaza face mass slaughter? What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?' The international community has been urged to intervene to stop the killing of Palestinian children and civilians. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 44,081, with 69% of the victims being women and children. The UN has warned that Lebanon's cultural heritage is in 'deep peril' due to Israeli attacks. A new Israeli bill seeks to bar Palestinians from running for legislature, and the US has announced new military deployments to the Middle East. A group of lawmakers has sent a letter to President Biden questioning the US role in Israel's regional war.

**'Slaughterer of Beni Hashish': Houthi Official Commits Heinous Crimes, Killing 13 People**
A local official affiliated with the Houthi militia has committed a series of heinous crimes in the Beni Hashish area, east of Sana'a, resulting in the deaths of at least 13 people from various governorates. According to local sources, the official, Ali Abduh Al-Sarafi, would lure his victims to a spot overlooking the village, claiming to have seen a treasure there in a dream. He would then ask them to dig, and after they descended, he would strike them on the back of the head with an axe and bury them. He would then steal their phones, guns, and other belongings. The victims were often lured with the promise of a treasure, and the killer would ask them to bring their guns to protect the area. After killing them, he would send a message to their families, claiming to have left the area to fight on the front lines and would not return for several months. The sources stated that the killer had admitted to killing six people in the first few days, including three from the village and three others from outside the area. The victims were all comrades of the killer and had fought alongside him in the militia. There are currently 13 missing persons reports filed with the local police, which are suspected to be linked to the militia's attempts to conceal the victims' identities.

**Ukrainian Forces Kill Civilians Trying to Flee Chasiv Yar**
At least six civilians in Chasiv Yar were killed by a Ukrainian drone strike while attempting to leave the city and head towards Russia. According to the 'Southern Grouping' military, the civilians were trying to escape through a Russian-controlled area. 'The Ukrainian military first shelled them with artillery and mortars, then sent in FPV drones,' said a military source to TASS. The civilians were trying to escape with the help of a radio dropped by a quadcopter, but were later forced to take shelter. Russian soldiers then dropped water and food to the civilians using drones. However, after a Ukrainian drone strike, only one survivor was able to contact the outside world. The civilians were seen carrying white flags. 'The Ukrainian military started shelling them with artillery. The civilians took shelter in a concrete bunker. The enemy, knowing they were unarmed, continued to shell them. Shells and mines were landing close to the bunker. In moments of calm, our soldiers dropped water and food to the bunker via drones. The civilians were being encouraged by radio,' said Alexander Kot, a war correspondent. This is not the first time such a incident has occurred. In August, a similar incident happened in Volchansk, where two civilians were killed by Ukrainian forces after they were seen trying to escape with a white flag. In 2023, two people were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a civilian evacuation point in the Kherson region. The governor of the region, Vladimir Saldo, reported that a 33-year-old pregnant woman was among the dead. Two others were injured. Ukrainian forces have been accused of shooting at their own soldiers who try to surrender, according to a coordinator of the Nikopol underground, Sergey Lebedev. He cited his colleagues in saying that such incidents are common in the Rabyntino area in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Russian soldier, known by the call sign 'Topol', reported that Ukrainian forces do not allow surrendered soldiers to be evacuated to a safe area, as their former comrades shoot at them from behind.

**War Kills More Than Just Soldiers: UN Reports Alarming Rise in Civilian Deaths**
According to the UN, the number of women killed in conflicts in 2023 doubled compared to the previous year, with 4 out of 10 civilian deaths being women and 3 out of 10 being children. The UN denounces 'patriarchal structures' that make peace 'inaccessible'. The UN reports that out of 33,443 civilian deaths in 2023 (a 72% increase from 2022), 4 out of 10 were women, and 3 out of 10 were children. The UN states that the war is not just a military conflict, but a 'terrible chaos' fueled by 'tyrants thirsty for blood' through ethnic conflagrations. The UN concludes that power can drive leaders to madness and totalitarianism. 'The war does not just kill soldiers, it kills civilians, women, and children,' said no one, but the UN's words echo this sentiment.

**Booby-trapped robots explode in northern Gaza neighborhoods, killing civilians and destroying homes**
A human rights nonprofit, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, has revealed that Israel has been using remotely detonated 'robots' to inflict damage on people and homes in northern Gaza. The Israeli occupation army is using these booby-trapped robots, equipped with tons of explosives, to commit massive acts of destruction and killing, including massacres, willful killing, enforced starvation, and widespread forced displacement. Eyewitnesses have reported that the robots have exploded in residential areas, killing civilians and destroying homes. The use of these robots is prohibited under international law, as they are considered indiscriminate weapons that cannot be directed or limited to military targets. The situation in northern Gaza is dire, with over 400,000 Palestinians trapped and unable to leave, and the Israeli military not allowing food supplies to enter the area. The Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations has described the situation as a 'genocide within the genocide'.

The Israeli occupation army is using booby-trapped robots equipped with tons of explosives to commit massive acts of destruction and killing in northern Gaza, according to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor. The robots have exploded in several neighborhoods, including Al-Qassabi, Tawam, and Zahraa, killing civilians and destroying homes. The use of these robots is prohibited under international law, as they are considered indiscriminate weapons that cannot be directed or limited to military targets. The situation in northern Gaza is dire, with over 400,000 Palestinians trapped and unable to leave, and the Israeli military not allowing anyone to enter or exit the area. Palestinian Ambassador Majed Bamya described the situation as 'a genocide within the genocide,' and Al Jazeera correspondent Hani Mahmoud reported that more than 70 bodies are still on the streets, with civil defense workers unable to retrieve them due to relentless Israeli attacks.

**Israeli Occupation Forces Use Explosive Robots to Destroy Homes and Kill Civilians in Gaza**
The European-Mediterranean Observatory for Human Rights (EMOHR) reported that the Israeli occupation forces are using explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians in the north of the Gaza Strip. The EMOHR stated that the occupation forces have separated the north of Gaza from the city of Gaza, using military vehicles, sandbags, and rubble to block the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have used explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The EMOHR warned that the use of explosive robots is a war crime under international law, as they are indiscriminate and can cause harm to civilians. A resident of the Gaza Strip described the sound of an explosive robot detonating in his neighborhood, saying 'The explosion was so loud that I had never heard anything like it before. The dust covered the entire area.' The EMOHR documented several instances of the occupation forces using explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians. The EMOHR also reported that over 200,000 people are trapped in the north of Gaza, with limited access to food, water, and medical care. The EMOHR warned that those who survive the bombing and shelling will be at risk of dying from hunger or thirst, as the occupation forces have blocked the entry of aid and supplies into the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have destroyed and burned bakeries, and have dug up wells, leaving the population without access to clean water. 'The situation is catastrophic,' said the EMOHR. 'The hospitals are overwhelmed, and the medical staff are struggling to provide care to the wounded.'

**Israel's Use of Exploding Robots in Gaza: A New Form of Mass Killing**
Israel has been using 'exploding robots' to carry out mass killings in northern Gaza, according to a Palestinian security source. The source stated that the Israeli army used these robots during their ongoing ground invasion of Gaza, causing significant damage and loss of life. The robots, which are equipped with explosive charges, are able to move between homes and residential areas, controlled remotely by the Israeli army. The source explained that the use of these robots has resulted in the destruction of entire residential blocks, such as in the al-Faluga neighborhood in Gaza City. The source also stated that the Israeli army has been using these robots since May, and that they have been responsible for numerous civilian casualties. The source said, 'These robots have a huge explosive capacity, they can destroy an entire neighborhood.' The use of these robots is part of Israel's ongoing campaign of genocide against the people of Gaza, which has resulted in over 140,000 Palestinian casualties and 10,000 missing persons, as well as widespread destruction and famine. The Israeli government has been ignoring international calls to stop its aggression and has been supported by the US.

**10/7, One Year Later**
The barbaric attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, shocked the world, resulting in the brutal slaughter, rape, and torture of 1250 Israeli citizens, and the capture of another 300. The attack, backed by Iran, destabilized Israel politically and economically, displacing over 100,000 citizens and causing widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip. Israel's military response has killed over 40,000 Gazans and left tens of thousands maimed. The attack has also created political fissures in the Western democracies and in Israel, and has upended plans for a treaty among Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia. As the world marks the one-year anniversary of the attack, it is clear that peace in the Middle East is more elusive than ever, with a wider war all but certain, and an outcome that will reverberate across the globe for generations to come.

**Quadcopter strikes: 1000 Palestinians killed by Israeli drones in one year**
Since the beginning of its ongoing war in October 2023, Israel has significantly expanded its use of quadcopters for premeditated strikes on Palestinian civilians in Gaza. According to reports, these drones have killed approximately 1,000 Palestinians, including 350 women and 150 children. Silah, a 52-year-old Palestinian woman, was killed by a quadcopter in May 2024, while trying to escape the Jabalia refugee camp. Her brother described the moment of her killing, saying, 'She was falling in front of us and her head was covered in blood.' Israel's use of quadcopters has been criticized for targeting civilians based on suspicion or preemptive assumptions, which is illegal under international humanitarian law. The Israeli military claims that the devastating raid aims to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping in the camp, but reports continue to emerge of drones shooting 'everyone that goes out' in Jabalia and other parts of Gaza.

**Israel pushes deeper into Gaza’s Jabalia, strikes Lebanon, Syria – The New Arab**
Israeli forces have escalated their attacks on Gaza, Jabalia, and Lebanon, causing widespread destruction and casualties. The UN's Chris Gunness condemned Israel's actions, calling it 'slaughter' and a 'stain on the conscience of humanity.' UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that Israeli attacks on Lebanon are 'threatening the entire region,' with over 2,000 people killed and 1 million displaced in the past year. Israeli strikes on Syria's capital killed seven people and wounded 11 others. Since October 2023, Israel has killed at least 41,965 Palestinians in Gaza and 2,119 people in Lebanon, and wounded over 97,590 and 10,019 others respectively.

**Israel Marks Oct. 7 Anniversary Under Shadow of Escalating War**
Israelis marked the first anniversary of the Hamas attack that triggered a war, which has sparked protests worldwide and risks igniting a wider conflict in the Middle East. Ceremonies and protests began at 06:29 a.m., the hour when Hamas-led militants launched rockets into Israel. Yuval Baron, whose father-in-law is a hostage in Gaza, said, 'We're still stuck in October 7th, 2023, in one unending day of terror, of fear, of anger, of despair.' President Isaac Herzog presided over a memorial ceremony in Reim, where over 360 people were killed and dozens taken hostage. He said, 'We will remember always who kidnapped, who murdered, who raped, who slaughtered. At the same time, we have also seen extraordinary fortitude.' Security forces were on high alert across the country, anticipating possible Palestinian attacks. In Gaza, the Israeli military foiled a rocket attack planned by Hamas. Vigils were held outside Israel and demonstrations were expected against its offensive in the Gaza Strip, which has killed almost 42,000 people and displaced most of the 2.3 million population.

**The Guardian view on a year of civilian slaughter in the middle east: a region in flames**
The Middle East has seen a year of escalating violence and civilian slaughter, with Israel's retaliation against Hamas in Gaza and Iran's missile attack leading to a cycle of retaliation and destruction. The region is slipping deeper into war, with civilians paying the price. The article highlights the devastating consequences of the conflict, including the killing of over 1,200 Israelis and 41,500 Palestinians, as well as the displacement and suffering of countless others. The author argues that military victory is a mirage and that a sustainable solution requires diplomacy addressing long-term security needs, including a fair settlement for Palestinians. The article also notes that Israel's actions are increasingly isolated, with the international community recoiling from its occupation of Palestinian territories and its disregard for human rights.

**Russian Occupiers Kill 93 Ukrainian Soldiers on Battlefield, 80% in 2024**
According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russian occupiers have killed 93 Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. 80% of these killings occurred in 2024, indicating a significant increase in such cases. Yuriy Belous, head of the department of war crimes, stated, 'This trend was noticed at the end of last year. 'Somewhere from November, there were changes in the attitude of Russian military personnel towards our prisoners of war in a significantly worse direction,' he said. The Office of the Prosecutor General is investigating the killing of 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces in the Pokrovsky direction. The incident is being considered a war crime. The Russian military has committed a series of atrocities, including the intentional killing of prisoners of war, which is a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a serious international crime.'

**Russian Soldiers Kill 93 Ukrainian Soldiers, Mostly in 2024**
According to Yuriy Belyusov, the head of the Department of Crimes Committed in the Conditions of Armed Conflict at the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russian soldiers have killed 93 Ukrainian soldiers. The majority of these cases occurred in 2024. Belyusov stated, 'We immediately registered another case with the Main Investigation Department of the SBU. And now we already have information about the death of 93 of our fighters who were killed on the battlefield. And what is important to note is that about 80% of all killings took place this year. Which speaks to a very serious increase in these cases in 2024.' Belyusov also mentioned that changes in the attitude of Russian soldiers towards Ukrainian prisoners of war became noticeable in November last year. 'Perhaps the most resonant example is our prisoners of war who died in Olenivka. But such cases are also being recorded in other places of detention,' he said. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also confirmed the fact of the execution of 10 prisoners of war in other places of detention. Belyusov added, 'We also record this. We have large cases on places of detention on the territory of the RF, on the occupied territory. We interrogate all our prisoners of war who return. All of them become victims of such brutal torture. And during these tortures, unfortunately, some of our fighters die at the hands of or representatives of the armed forces of the RF, or at the hands of representatives of the FSB or zealous employees.'

**Biden hands another $8.7B In Aid To Israel As It Continues Slaughter**
The Israeli military has killed 36 Palestinians in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including 15 people in a school in the Jabalia refugee camp. Israel claims the school was being used as a Hamas 'command and control center'. In Lebanon, Israeli air strikes have killed 92 people and wounded 153 others over the past 24 hours, with more than 700 people now dead since Monday. The US has provided Israel with an $8.7 billion aid package, which includes $3.5 billion for wartime procurement and $5.2 billion for air defense systems. The package is expected to be delivered soon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has formed a global alliance to push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The alliance includes Arab and Muslim countries and European partners. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized the US for its double standards on human rights, asking why it continues to provoke or support wars in the Middle East, causing large numbers of innocent Muslim casualties. Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced legislation to block the sale of $20 billion in US arms sales to Israel, saying that sending more weapons to Netanyahu's government is unacceptable and that American weapons are responsible for far too many civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, defending his nation's response to the October 7 2023 Hamas attacks. He stated, 'I didn't intend to come here this year. My country is at war fighting for its life.' Netanyahu blamed Iran for many regional problems and said, 'If you strike us, we will strike you.' Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed over 41,500 Palestinians and wounded over 96,000 others, with more than half of the dead being women and children. The UN has called for a 21-day ceasefire, but Netanyahu maintained that Israel's military operations are justified to defend itself. Other speakers, including Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, criticized Israel's actions, with Golob saying, 'Mr Netanyahu, stop this war now,' and Sharif declaring, 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.'

**Lebanon: Israeli Strikes Kill Hundreds as Hostilities Escalate**
Human Rights Watch has condemned the Israeli military's strikes in Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of people and injured thousands since September 23, 2024. The organization has called for an international investigation into the recent hostilities and for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm. 'The Israeli military killed hundreds of people in Lebanon in just one day; thousands have been injured and forced to flee from their homes, and hundreds of homes, businesses, and farms have been destroyed,' said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. 'It is paramount for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm.' The Israeli military has struck over 1,600 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, killing 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women, and injuring over 1,835. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Human Rights Watch has also criticized the Israeli military's warnings to civilians, which it says are not 'effective' under the law. The organization has called on Israel's key allies to suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel, given the real risk that they will be used to commit grave abuses.

**Jon Stewart Criticizes Israel's 'De-escalation Through Escalation' Strategy**
Jon Stewart criticized Israel's 'de-escalation through escalation' strategy, calling it 'cognitive dissonance and language calisthenics.' He explained that this strategy involves escalating attacks while claiming to work towards a ceasefire. Stewart likened this approach to George Orwell's '1984' and Kurt Vonnegut's 'Slaughterhouse-Five.' He also criticized President Joe Biden for claiming that the US is 'tirelessly working' towards a ceasefire in Gaza, while Israel is launching attacks in Lebanon. Stewart exclaimed, 'Wait! We've been working tirelessly towards a ceasefire in Gaza and they're in fucking Lebanon?' The Israeli military has launched airstrikes in Lebanon, killing over 490 people, including 90 women and children, according to Lebanese authorities.

**Jihadists slaughter 26 Christians during worship service in Burkina Faso**
Islamist extremists in Burkina Faso carried out a two-day killing spree, slaughtering hundreds of civilians, including 26 worshippers at a church service. The attacks took place in the towns of Barsalogho and Sanaba in late August, according to reports. In Barsalogho, militants opened fire on hundreds of villagers outside the town and stormed a Protestant church in Sanaba the following day. The victims in Sanaba were members of a Christian Alliance Evangelical church attending a Sunday service. Armed militants tied the hands of 26 Christian men and cut their throats, according to a pastor from the capital, Ouagadougou. The conflict in Burkina Faso escalated notably in 2023, culminating in about 8,000 fatalities. The military controls about 60% of the country, but Islamist groups have repeatedly targeted Christians and churches. Human Rights Watch noted that Islamist groups in Burkina Faso have 'escalated their attacks on civilians, massacring villagers, displaced people, and Christian worshippers.' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said, 'We are witnessing an incredibly concerning surge in Islamist violence in Burkina Faso. The Islamist armed groups' massacres of villagers, worshipers, and displaced people are not only war crimes, but a cruel affront to human decency.'

**The 'Sloping Plane' of Technological Warfare: A New Era of Conflict?**
A recent attack in Lebanon, which used pagers to deliver explosives, has raised concerns about the ethics of using technology as a weapon. The attack, which killed 37 people and injured 3,000, has sparked a debate about the potential consequences of such actions. Experts believe that the attack was coordinated using digital means, despite the fact that the explosives were delivered through pagers, which have limited energy capacity. The incident has opened up two dimensions of concern: the mass manipulation of wearable communication devices to harm users, and the mass introduction of explosives into consumer goods through global supply chains. This could lead to a 'slippery slope' of further attacks, including the use of nanorobots, atomic, biological, and chemical substances, and the manipulation of mobile phones to turn them into explosives. The article argues that the attack has changed the world and has brought us to a 'sloping plane' where the consequences of such actions are no longer predictable. It calls for a re-evaluation of the ethics of using technology as a weapon and the need for greater regulation of the use of technology in conflict zones.

**The Unprecedented Massacre: A New War in the Making**
The Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, has taken a decision that has led to the killing of 5,000 people, one by one. This is not a new tactic in warfare, but the decision to carry out a mass slaughter is unprecedented. The fact that it is a mass slaughter, not a chemical attack, but more horrific, is what makes it stand out. The decision-maker remains unknown, but the consequences of their actions are clear. In Gaza, hospitals and refugee camps are filled with the dead and the wounded, and the 'Beger' drone, made in Taiwan, is the instrument of this mass murder. Netanyahu started this war with extreme violence, destroying Gaza and forcing its people to live in a small area, surrounded by poverty, rubble, and death. Those who refused to follow his orders were fired or removed. The war started in southern Lebanon, but soon spread to the Bekaa Valley and then to the entire country, in an attempt to kill as many people as possible, in a blind and senseless manner, as in Gaza. The decision-maker knew the consequences of their actions, and made sure to eliminate any chances of a ceasefire or a deal, which would have allowed the 'hostage team' to be released. This decision has led to a new war, with new goals and new consequences, and the 'Beger' drone is just one of the tools used to carry out this mass murder. The 'resistance' cannot withstand a blow of this magnitude, and has already lost many leaders and thousands of its supporters, who have been forced to flee their homes and villages. The question remains, how will they respond, when, and where? This time, there is no room for mediators to ask for more patience.

**Russia's 'Shaheds' Become Faster and More Deadly: Expert Explains**
According to Oleg Katkov, the main editor of Defense Express, Russia is making 'shaheds' cheaper, but this does not mean that they have run out of money. Instead, they are using existing resources to produce more drones. Katkov explained that Russia is simplifying the production process by removing unnecessary components, such as starters and flywheels, from the drones' engines. This allows them to produce more drones at a lower cost. Katkov also noted that Russia has changed the material used for the drone's body and has simplified the production technology, which has enabled them to produce a large number of drones. He emphasized that the use of thermobaric warheads is very dangerous, especially when it comes to hitting residential buildings. The warhead can cause widespread damage and is designed to kill people quickly and efficiently. Katkov stated that Russia's goal is to use these drones to terrorize the local population and to make it difficult for Ukrainian defenders to shoot them down.

**Save the Children: “How many times must children in Gaza face mass slaughter? What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?” – Day 391**
The Israeli occupation forces have been conducting aerial, ground, and naval bombardment of northern Gaza for 28 consecutive days, resulting in over 1,200 Palestinian deaths. The siege has included blocking supplies of food, water, medicine, and fuel, destroying homes, and attacking hospitals. Save the Children has expressed outrage over the mass slaughter of children in Gaza, with at least 50 children killed in a recent attack. The organization's Regional Director, Jeremy Stoner, said, 'How many times must children in Gaza face mass slaughter? What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?' The international community has been urged to intervene to stop the killing of Palestinian children and civilians. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 44,081, with 69% of the victims being women and children. The UN has warned that Lebanon's cultural heritage is in 'deep peril' due to Israeli attacks. A new Israeli bill seeks to bar Palestinians from running for legislature, and the US has announced new military deployments to the Middle East. A group of lawmakers has sent a letter to President Biden questioning the US role in Israel's regional war.

**Why We Can't Intercept Drones with Cheaper Solutions?**
Ukraine can intercept drones with much cheaper solutions, but why aren't we doing it? The article is not about expensive drones from Ukrainian manufacturers, but about more affordable options that could significantly reduce the current imbalance. The imbalance is caused by the fact that Moscow is sleeping peacefully, while Ukraine is constantly hearing the sound of drones flying overhead. No one has made it a priority to make the situation symmetrical. Additionally, the current situation in the fight against drones is hindered by the lack of fast and maneuverable interceptors. These drones should have been ordered for development two years ago, or at least a year ago. These are steps that do not require extraordinary funds. We can intercept drones with much cheaper solutions.

**'Slaughterer of Beni Hashish': Houthi Official Commits Heinous Crimes, Killing 13 People**
A local official affiliated with the Houthi militia has committed a series of heinous crimes in the Beni Hashish area, east of Sana'a, resulting in the deaths of at least 13 people from various governorates. According to local sources, the official, Ali Abduh Al-Sarafi, would lure his victims to a spot overlooking the village, claiming to have seen a treasure there in a dream. He would then ask them to dig, and after they descended, he would strike them on the back of the head with an axe and bury them. He would then steal their phones, guns, and other belongings. The victims were often lured with the promise of a treasure, and the killer would ask them to bring their guns to protect the area. After killing them, he would send a message to their families, claiming to have left the area to fight on the front lines and would not return for several months. The sources stated that the killer had admitted to killing six people in the first few days, including three from the village and three others from outside the area. The victims were all comrades of the killer and had fought alongside him in the militia. There are currently 13 missing persons reports filed with the local police, which are suspected to be linked to the militia's attempts to conceal the victims' identities.

**Ukrainian Forces Kill Civilians Trying to Flee Chasiv Yar**
At least six civilians in Chasiv Yar were killed by a Ukrainian drone strike while attempting to leave the city and head towards Russia. According to the 'Southern Grouping' military, the civilians were trying to escape through a Russian-controlled area. 'The Ukrainian military first shelled them with artillery and mortars, then sent in FPV drones,' said a military source to TASS. The civilians were trying to escape with the help of a radio dropped by a quadcopter, but were later forced to take shelter. Russian soldiers then dropped water and food to the civilians using drones. However, after a Ukrainian drone strike, only one survivor was able to contact the outside world. The civilians were seen carrying white flags. 'The Ukrainian military started shelling them with artillery. The civilians took shelter in a concrete bunker. The enemy, knowing they were unarmed, continued to shell them. Shells and mines were landing close to the bunker. In moments of calm, our soldiers dropped water and food to the bunker via drones. The civilians were being encouraged by radio,' said Alexander Kot, a war correspondent. This is not the first time such a incident has occurred. In August, a similar incident happened in Volchansk, where two civilians were killed by Ukrainian forces after they were seen trying to escape with a white flag. In 2023, two people were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a civilian evacuation point in the Kherson region. The governor of the region, Vladimir Saldo, reported that a 33-year-old pregnant woman was among the dead. Two others were injured. Ukrainian forces have been accused of shooting at their own soldiers who try to surrender, according to a coordinator of the Nikopol underground, Sergey Lebedev. He cited his colleagues in saying that such incidents are common in the Rabyntino area in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Russian soldier, known by the call sign 'Topol', reported that Ukrainian forces do not allow surrendered soldiers to be evacuated to a safe area, as their former comrades shoot at them from behind.

**War Kills More Than Just Soldiers: UN Reports Alarming Rise in Civilian Deaths**
According to the UN, the number of women killed in conflicts in 2023 doubled compared to the previous year, with 4 out of 10 civilian deaths being women and 3 out of 10 being children. The UN denounces 'patriarchal structures' that make peace 'inaccessible'. The UN reports that out of 33,443 civilian deaths in 2023 (a 72% increase from 2022), 4 out of 10 were women, and 3 out of 10 were children. The UN states that the war is not just a military conflict, but a 'terrible chaos' fueled by 'tyrants thirsty for blood' through ethnic conflagrations. The UN concludes that power can drive leaders to madness and totalitarianism. 'The war does not just kill soldiers, it kills civilians, women, and children,' said no one, but the UN's words echo this sentiment.

**Booby-trapped robots explode in northern Gaza neighborhoods, killing civilians and destroying homes**
A human rights nonprofit, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, has revealed that Israel has been using remotely detonated 'robots' to inflict damage on people and homes in northern Gaza. The Israeli occupation army is using these booby-trapped robots, equipped with tons of explosives, to commit massive acts of destruction and killing, including massacres, willful killing, enforced starvation, and widespread forced displacement. Eyewitnesses have reported that the robots have exploded in residential areas, killing civilians and destroying homes. The use of these robots is prohibited under international law, as they are considered indiscriminate weapons that cannot be directed or limited to military targets. The situation in northern Gaza is dire, with over 400,000 Palestinians trapped and unable to leave, and the Israeli military not allowing food supplies to enter the area. The Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations has described the situation as a 'genocide within the genocide'.

**Israeli Occupation Forces Use Explosive Robots to Destroy Homes and Kill Civilians in Gaza**
The European-Mediterranean Observatory for Human Rights (EMOHR) reported that the Israeli occupation forces are using explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians in the north of the Gaza Strip. The EMOHR stated that the occupation forces have separated the north of Gaza from the city of Gaza, using military vehicles, sandbags, and rubble to block the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have used explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The EMOHR warned that the use of explosive robots is a war crime under international law, as they are indiscriminate and can cause harm to civilians. A resident of the Gaza Strip described the sound of an explosive robot detonating in his neighborhood, saying 'The explosion was so loud that I had never heard anything like it before. The dust covered the entire area.' The EMOHR documented several instances of the occupation forces using explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians. The EMOHR also reported that over 200,000 people are trapped in the north of Gaza, with limited access to food, water, and medical care. The EMOHR warned that those who survive the bombing and shelling will be at risk of dying from hunger or thirst, as the occupation forces have blocked the entry of aid and supplies into the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have destroyed and burned bakeries, and have dug up wells, leaving the population without access to clean water. 'The situation is catastrophic,' said the EMOHR. 'The hospitals are overwhelmed, and the medical staff are struggling to provide care to the wounded.'

**Israel's Use of Exploding Robots in Gaza: A New Form of Mass Killing**
Israel has been using 'exploding robots' to carry out mass killings in northern Gaza, according to a Palestinian security source. The source stated that the Israeli army used these robots during their ongoing ground invasion of Gaza, causing significant damage and loss of life. The robots, which are equipped with explosive charges, are able to move between homes and residential areas, controlled remotely by the Israeli army. The source explained that the use of these robots has resulted in the destruction of entire residential blocks, such as in the al-Faluga neighborhood in Gaza City. The source also stated that the Israeli army has been using these robots since May, and that they have been responsible for numerous civilian casualties. The source said, 'These robots have a huge explosive capacity, they can destroy an entire neighborhood.' The use of these robots is part of Israel's ongoing campaign of genocide against the people of Gaza, which has resulted in over 140,000 Palestinian casualties and 10,000 missing persons, as well as widespread destruction and famine. The Israeli government has been ignoring international calls to stop its aggression and has been supported by the US.

**10/7, One Year Later**
The barbaric attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, shocked the world, resulting in the brutal slaughter, rape, and torture of 1250 Israeli citizens, and the capture of another 300. The attack, backed by Iran, destabilized Israel politically and economically, displacing over 100,000 citizens and causing widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip. Israel's military response has killed over 40,000 Gazans and left tens of thousands maimed. The attack has also created political fissures in the Western democracies and in Israel, and has upended plans for a treaty among Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia. As the world marks the one-year anniversary of the attack, it is clear that peace in the Middle East is more elusive than ever, with a wider war all but certain, and an outcome that will reverberate across the globe for generations to come.

Since the beginning of its ongoing war in October 2023, Israel has significantly expanded its use of quadcopters for premeditated strikes on Palestinian civilians in Gaza. According to reports, these drones have killed approximately 1,000 Palestinians, including 350 women and 150 children. Silah, a 52-year-old Palestinian woman, was killed by a quadcopter in May 2024, while trying to escape the Jabalia refugee camp. Her brother described the moment of her killing, saying, 'She was falling in front of us and her head was covered in blood.' Israel's use of quadcopters has been criticized for targeting civilians based on suspicion or preemptive assumptions, which is illegal under international humanitarian law. The Israeli military claims that the devastating raid aims to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping in the camp, but reports continue to emerge of drones shooting 'everyone that goes out' in Jabalia and other parts of Gaza.

**Israel pushes deeper into Gaza’s Jabalia, strikes Lebanon, Syria – The New Arab**
Israeli forces have escalated their attacks on Gaza, Jabalia, and Lebanon, causing widespread destruction and casualties. The UN's Chris Gunness condemned Israel's actions, calling it 'slaughter' and a 'stain on the conscience of humanity.' UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that Israeli attacks on Lebanon are 'threatening the entire region,' with over 2,000 people killed and 1 million displaced in the past year. Israeli strikes on Syria's capital killed seven people and wounded 11 others. Since October 2023, Israel has killed at least 41,965 Palestinians in Gaza and 2,119 people in Lebanon, and wounded over 97,590 and 10,019 others respectively.

**Israel Marks Oct. 7 Anniversary Under Shadow of Escalating War**
Israelis marked the first anniversary of the Hamas attack that triggered a war, which has sparked protests worldwide and risks igniting a wider conflict in the Middle East. Ceremonies and protests began at 06:29 a.m., the hour when Hamas-led militants launched rockets into Israel. Yuval Baron, whose father-in-law is a hostage in Gaza, said, 'We're still stuck in October 7th, 2023, in one unending day of terror, of fear, of anger, of despair.' President Isaac Herzog presided over a memorial ceremony in Reim, where over 360 people were killed and dozens taken hostage. He said, 'We will remember always who kidnapped, who murdered, who raped, who slaughtered. At the same time, we have also seen extraordinary fortitude.' Security forces were on high alert across the country, anticipating possible Palestinian attacks. In Gaza, the Israeli military foiled a rocket attack planned by Hamas. Vigils were held outside Israel and demonstrations were expected against its offensive in the Gaza Strip, which has killed almost 42,000 people and displaced most of the 2.3 million population.

**The Guardian view on a year of civilian slaughter in the middle east: a region in flames**
The Middle East has seen a year of escalating violence and civilian slaughter, with Israel's retaliation against Hamas in Gaza and Iran's missile attack leading to a cycle of retaliation and destruction. The region is slipping deeper into war, with civilians paying the price. The article highlights the devastating consequences of the conflict, including the killing of over 1,200 Israelis and 41,500 Palestinians, as well as the displacement and suffering of countless others. The author argues that military victory is a mirage and that a sustainable solution requires diplomacy addressing long-term security needs, including a fair settlement for Palestinians. The article also notes that Israel's actions are increasingly isolated, with the international community recoiling from its occupation of Palestinian territories and its disregard for human rights.

**Russian Occupiers Kill 93 Ukrainian Soldiers on Battlefield, 80% in 2024**
According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russian occupiers have killed 93 Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. 80% of these killings occurred in 2024, indicating a significant increase in such cases. Yuriy Belous, head of the department of war crimes, stated, 'This trend was noticed at the end of last year. 'Somewhere from November, there were changes in the attitude of Russian military personnel towards our prisoners of war in a significantly worse direction,' he said. The Office of the Prosecutor General is investigating the killing of 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces in the Pokrovsky direction. The incident is being considered a war crime. The Russian military has committed a series of atrocities, including the intentional killing of prisoners of war, which is a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a serious international crime.'

**Russian Soldiers Kill 93 Ukrainian Soldiers, Mostly in 2024**
According to Yuriy Belyusov, the head of the Department of Crimes Committed in the Conditions of Armed Conflict at the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russian soldiers have killed 93 Ukrainian soldiers. The majority of these cases occurred in 2024. Belyusov stated, 'We immediately registered another case with the Main Investigation Department of the SBU. And now we already have information about the death of 93 of our fighters who were killed on the battlefield. And what is important to note is that about 80% of all killings took place this year. Which speaks to a very serious increase in these cases in 2024.' Belyusov also mentioned that changes in the attitude of Russian soldiers towards Ukrainian prisoners of war became noticeable in November last year. 'Perhaps the most resonant example is our prisoners of war who died in Olenivka. But such cases are also being recorded in other places of detention,' he said. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also confirmed the fact of the execution of 10 prisoners of war in other places of detention. Belyusov added, 'We also record this. We have large cases on places of detention on the territory of the RF, on the occupied territory. We interrogate all our prisoners of war who return. All of them become victims of such brutal torture. And during these tortures, unfortunately, some of our fighters die at the hands of or representatives of the armed forces of the RF, or at the hands of representatives of the FSB or zealous employees.'

**Biden hands another $8.7B In Aid To Israel As It Continues Slaughter**
The Israeli military has killed 36 Palestinians in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including 15 people in a school in the Jabalia refugee camp. Israel claims the school was being used as a Hamas 'command and control center'. In Lebanon, Israeli air strikes have killed 92 people and wounded 153 others over the past 24 hours, with more than 700 people now dead since Monday. The US has provided Israel with an $8.7 billion aid package, which includes $3.5 billion for wartime procurement and $5.2 billion for air defense systems. The package is expected to be delivered soon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has formed a global alliance to push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The alliance includes Arab and Muslim countries and European partners. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized the US for its double standards on human rights, asking why it continues to provoke or support wars in the Middle East, causing large numbers of innocent Muslim casualties. Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced legislation to block the sale of $20 billion in US arms sales to Israel, saying that sending more weapons to Netanyahu's government is unacceptable and that American weapons are responsible for far too many civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.

**Israel's Netanyahu tells UN General Assembly he came to ‘set record straight'**
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, defending his nation's response to the October 7 2023 Hamas attacks. He stated, 'I didn't intend to come here this year. My country is at war fighting for its life.' Netanyahu blamed Iran for many regional problems and said, 'If you strike us, we will strike you.' Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed over 41,500 Palestinians and wounded over 96,000 others, with more than half of the dead being women and children. The UN has called for a 21-day ceasefire, but Netanyahu maintained that Israel's military operations are justified to defend itself. Other speakers, including Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, criticized Israel's actions, with Golob saying, 'Mr Netanyahu, stop this war now,' and Sharif declaring, 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.'

**Lebanon: Israeli Strikes Kill Hundreds as Hostilities Escalate**
Human Rights Watch has condemned the Israeli military's strikes in Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of people and injured thousands since September 23, 2024. The organization has called for an international investigation into the recent hostilities and for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm. 'The Israeli military killed hundreds of people in Lebanon in just one day; thousands have been injured and forced to flee from their homes, and hundreds of homes, businesses, and farms have been destroyed,' said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. 'It is paramount for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm.' The Israeli military has struck over 1,600 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, killing 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women, and injuring over 1,835. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Human Rights Watch has also criticized the Israeli military's warnings to civilians, which it says are not 'effective' under the law. The organization has called on Israel's key allies to suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel, given the real risk that they will be used to commit grave abuses.

**Jon Stewart Criticizes Israel's 'De-escalation Through Escalation' Strategy**
Jon Stewart criticized Israel's 'de-escalation through escalation' strategy, calling it 'cognitive dissonance and language calisthenics.' He explained that this strategy involves escalating attacks while claiming to work towards a ceasefire. Stewart likened this approach to George Orwell's '1984' and Kurt Vonnegut's 'Slaughterhouse-Five.' He also criticized President Joe Biden for claiming that the US is 'tirelessly working' towards a ceasefire in Gaza, while Israel is launching attacks in Lebanon. Stewart exclaimed, 'Wait! We've been working tirelessly towards a ceasefire in Gaza and they're in fucking Lebanon?' The Israeli military has launched airstrikes in Lebanon, killing over 490 people, including 90 women and children, according to Lebanese authorities.

**Jihadists slaughter 26 Christians during worship service in Burkina Faso**
Islamist extremists in Burkina Faso carried out a two-day killing spree, slaughtering hundreds of civilians, including 26 worshippers at a church service. The attacks took place in the towns of Barsalogho and Sanaba in late August, according to reports. In Barsalogho, militants opened fire on hundreds of villagers outside the town and stormed a Protestant church in Sanaba the following day. The victims in Sanaba were members of a Christian Alliance Evangelical church attending a Sunday service. Armed militants tied the hands of 26 Christian men and cut their throats, according to a pastor from the capital, Ouagadougou. The conflict in Burkina Faso escalated notably in 2023, culminating in about 8,000 fatalities. The military controls about 60% of the country, but Islamist groups have repeatedly targeted Christians and churches. Human Rights Watch noted that Islamist groups in Burkina Faso have 'escalated their attacks on civilians, massacring villagers, displaced people, and Christian worshippers.' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said, 'We are witnessing an incredibly concerning surge in Islamist violence in Burkina Faso. The Islamist armed groups' massacres of villagers, worshipers, and displaced people are not only war crimes, but a cruel affront to human decency.'

**The 'Sloping Plane' of Technological Warfare: A New Era of Conflict?**
A recent attack in Lebanon, which used pagers to deliver explosives, has raised concerns about the ethics of using technology as a weapon. The attack, which killed 37 people and injured 3,000, has sparked a debate about the potential consequences of such actions. Experts believe that the attack was coordinated using digital means, despite the fact that the explosives were delivered through pagers, which have limited energy capacity. The incident has opened up two dimensions of concern: the mass manipulation of wearable communication devices to harm users, and the mass introduction of explosives into consumer goods through global supply chains. This could lead to a 'slippery slope' of further attacks, including the use of nanorobots, atomic, biological, and chemical substances, and the manipulation of mobile phones to turn them into explosives. The article argues that the attack has changed the world and has brought us to a 'sloping plane' where the consequences of such actions are no longer predictable. It calls for a re-evaluation of the ethics of using technology as a weapon and the need for greater regulation of the use of technology in conflict zones.

**The Unprecedented Massacre: A New War in the Making**
The Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, has taken a decision that has led to the killing of 5,000 people, one by one. This is not a new tactic in warfare, but the decision to carry out a mass slaughter is unprecedented. The fact that it is a mass slaughter, not a chemical attack, but more horrific, is what makes it stand out. The decision-maker remains unknown, but the consequences of their actions are clear. In Gaza, hospitals and refugee camps are filled with the dead and the wounded, and the 'Beger' drone, made in Taiwan, is the instrument of this mass murder. Netanyahu started this war with extreme violence, destroying Gaza and forcing its people to live in a small area, surrounded by poverty, rubble, and death. Those who refused to follow his orders were fired or removed. The war started in southern Lebanon, but soon spread to the Bekaa Valley and then to the entire country, in an attempt to kill as many people as possible, in a blind and senseless manner, as in Gaza. The decision-maker knew the consequences of their actions, and made sure to eliminate any chances of a ceasefire or a deal, which would have allowed the 'hostage team' to be released. This decision has led to a new war, with new goals and new consequences, and the 'Beger' drone is just one of the tools used to carry out this mass murder. The 'resistance' cannot withstand a blow of this magnitude, and has already lost many leaders and thousands of its supporters, who have been forced to flee their homes and villages. The question remains, how will they respond, when, and where? This time, there is no room for mediators to ask for more patience.

**Ukrainian Drone Pilots Prove to be a Deadly Force Against Russian Soldiers**
Ukrainian drone pilots, often with a background in gaming, are proving to be a deadly force against Russian soldiers. They use drones to track and kill Russian troops, and their effectiveness has been a significant factor in the war. According to the Wall Street Journal, these pilots have been responsible for eliminating over 300 Russian soldiers, more than double the number of US soldiers killed by the most successful sniper in the Iraq war. The drones are also used to disrupt Russian supply lines and slow their advance. The pilots, who often have no military experience, are able to operate in a more relaxed environment, with some even joking about their actions. However, they take their job seriously and are willing to kill even those who beg for mercy. As one pilot, Dachno, said, 'I'm sure the mothers of Ukrainian children have also cried.' The Ukrainian government is now producing thousands of drones per month, with some costing as little as $500. Russia, on the other hand, is struggling to keep up with the demand for drones and has fewer experienced pilots. The use of drones has become a key factor in the war, and their effectiveness has been a game-changer for the Ukrainian military.

**Shahed-136 Drone Attacks: A Decreasing Success Rate**
The number of Shahed-136 drones used by Russia has increased significantly, but the success rate of these attacks has decreased. In January 2024, 334 drones were used, with 90 successful hits. In February, 356 drones were used, with 68 successful hits. The trend continued in March (603/87), April (295/34), May (349/10), June (328/17), July (426/44), and August (789/44). The introduction of 'Herbera' and 'Parody' decoy drones in September led to a significant increase in the number of decoy drones used. By October, 1,917 drones were used, with 86 successful hits. Anyone with basic math skills can calculate the trend and answer the question for themselves.

**Save the Children: “How many times must children in Gaza face mass slaughter? What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?” – Day 391**
The Israeli occupation forces have been conducting aerial, ground, and naval bombardment of northern Gaza for 28 consecutive days, resulting in over 1,200 Palestinian deaths. The siege has included blocking supplies of food, water, medicine, and fuel, destroying homes, and attacking hospitals. Save the Children has expressed outrage over the mass slaughter of children in Gaza, with at least 50 children killed in a recent attack. The organization's Regional Director, Jeremy Stoner, said, 'How many times must children in Gaza face mass slaughter? What will it take for world powers to say ‘enough’?' The international community has been urged to intervene to stop the killing of Palestinian children and civilians. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 44,081, with 69% of the victims being women and children. The UN has warned that Lebanon's cultural heritage is in 'deep peril' due to Israeli attacks. A new Israeli bill seeks to bar Palestinians from running for legislature, and the US has announced new military deployments to the Middle East. A group of lawmakers has sent a letter to President Biden questioning the US role in Israel's regional war.

**'Slaughterer of Beni Hashish': Houthi Official Commits Heinous Crimes, Killing 13 People**
A local official affiliated with the Houthi militia has committed a series of heinous crimes in the Beni Hashish area, east of Sana'a, resulting in the deaths of at least 13 people from various governorates. According to local sources, the official, Ali Abduh Al-Sarafi, would lure his victims to a spot overlooking the village, claiming to have seen a treasure there in a dream. He would then ask them to dig, and after they descended, he would strike them on the back of the head with an axe and bury them. He would then steal their phones, guns, and other belongings. The victims were often lured with the promise of a treasure, and the killer would ask them to bring their guns to protect the area. After killing them, he would send a message to their families, claiming to have left the area to fight on the front lines and would not return for several months. The sources stated that the killer had admitted to killing six people in the first few days, including three from the village and three others from outside the area. The victims were all comrades of the killer and had fought alongside him in the militia. There are currently 13 missing persons reports filed with the local police, which are suspected to be linked to the militia's attempts to conceal the victims' identities.

**Ukrainian Forces Kill Civilians Trying to Flee Chasiv Yar**
At least six civilians in Chasiv Yar were killed by a Ukrainian drone strike while attempting to leave the city and head towards Russia. According to the 'Southern Grouping' military, the civilians were trying to escape through a Russian-controlled area. 'The Ukrainian military first shelled them with artillery and mortars, then sent in FPV drones,' said a military source to TASS. The civilians were trying to escape with the help of a radio dropped by a quadcopter, but were later forced to take shelter. Russian soldiers then dropped water and food to the civilians using drones. However, after a Ukrainian drone strike, only one survivor was able to contact the outside world. The civilians were seen carrying white flags. 'The Ukrainian military started shelling them with artillery. The civilians took shelter in a concrete bunker. The enemy, knowing they were unarmed, continued to shell them. Shells and mines were landing close to the bunker. In moments of calm, our soldiers dropped water and food to the bunker via drones. The civilians were being encouraged by radio,' said Alexander Kot, a war correspondent. This is not the first time such a incident has occurred. In August, a similar incident happened in Volchansk, where two civilians were killed by Ukrainian forces after they were seen trying to escape with a white flag. In 2023, two people were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a civilian evacuation point in the Kherson region. The governor of the region, Vladimir Saldo, reported that a 33-year-old pregnant woman was among the dead. Two others were injured. Ukrainian forces have been accused of shooting at their own soldiers who try to surrender, according to a coordinator of the Nikopol underground, Sergey Lebedev. He cited his colleagues in saying that such incidents are common in the Rabyntino area in the Zaporizhzhia region. A Russian soldier, known by the call sign 'Topol', reported that Ukrainian forces do not allow surrendered soldiers to be evacuated to a safe area, as their former comrades shoot at them from behind.

**War Kills More Than Just Soldiers: UN Reports Alarming Rise in Civilian Deaths**
According to the UN, the number of women killed in conflicts in 2023 doubled compared to the previous year, with 4 out of 10 civilian deaths being women and 3 out of 10 being children. The UN denounces 'patriarchal structures' that make peace 'inaccessible'. The UN reports that out of 33,443 civilian deaths in 2023 (a 72% increase from 2022), 4 out of 10 were women, and 3 out of 10 were children. The UN states that the war is not just a military conflict, but a 'terrible chaos' fueled by 'tyrants thirsty for blood' through ethnic conflagrations. The UN concludes that power can drive leaders to madness and totalitarianism. 'The war does not just kill soldiers, it kills civilians, women, and children,' said no one, but the UN's words echo this sentiment.

**Booby-trapped robots explode in northern Gaza neighborhoods, killing civilians and destroying homes**
A human rights nonprofit, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, has revealed that Israel has been using remotely detonated 'robots' to inflict damage on people and homes in northern Gaza. The Israeli occupation army is using these booby-trapped robots, equipped with tons of explosives, to commit massive acts of destruction and killing, including massacres, willful killing, enforced starvation, and widespread forced displacement. Eyewitnesses have reported that the robots have exploded in residential areas, killing civilians and destroying homes. The use of these robots is prohibited under international law, as they are considered indiscriminate weapons that cannot be directed or limited to military targets. The situation in northern Gaza is dire, with over 400,000 Palestinians trapped and unable to leave, and the Israeli military not allowing food supplies to enter the area. The Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations has described the situation as a 'genocide within the genocide'.

The Israeli occupation army is using booby-trapped robots equipped with tons of explosives to commit massive acts of destruction and killing in northern Gaza, according to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor. The robots have exploded in several neighborhoods, including Al-Qassabi, Tawam, and Zahraa, killing civilians and destroying homes. The use of these robots is prohibited under international law, as they are considered indiscriminate weapons that cannot be directed or limited to military targets. The situation in northern Gaza is dire, with over 400,000 Palestinians trapped and unable to leave, and the Israeli military not allowing anyone to enter or exit the area. Palestinian Ambassador Majed Bamya described the situation as 'a genocide within the genocide,' and Al Jazeera correspondent Hani Mahmoud reported that more than 70 bodies are still on the streets, with civil defense workers unable to retrieve them due to relentless Israeli attacks.

**Israeli Occupation Forces Use Explosive Robots to Destroy Homes and Kill Civilians in Gaza**
The European-Mediterranean Observatory for Human Rights (EMOHR) reported that the Israeli occupation forces are using explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians in the north of the Gaza Strip. The EMOHR stated that the occupation forces have separated the north of Gaza from the city of Gaza, using military vehicles, sandbags, and rubble to block the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have used explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The EMOHR warned that the use of explosive robots is a war crime under international law, as they are indiscriminate and can cause harm to civilians. A resident of the Gaza Strip described the sound of an explosive robot detonating in his neighborhood, saying 'The explosion was so loud that I had never heard anything like it before. The dust covered the entire area.' The EMOHR documented several instances of the occupation forces using explosive robots to destroy homes and kill civilians. The EMOHR also reported that over 200,000 people are trapped in the north of Gaza, with limited access to food, water, and medical care. The EMOHR warned that those who survive the bombing and shelling will be at risk of dying from hunger or thirst, as the occupation forces have blocked the entry of aid and supplies into the area. The EMOHR also reported that the occupation forces have destroyed and burned bakeries, and have dug up wells, leaving the population without access to clean water. 'The situation is catastrophic,' said the EMOHR. 'The hospitals are overwhelmed, and the medical staff are struggling to provide care to the wounded.'

**Israel's Use of Exploding Robots in Gaza: A New Form of Mass Killing**
Israel has been using 'exploding robots' to carry out mass killings in northern Gaza, according to a Palestinian security source. The source stated that the Israeli army used these robots during their ongoing ground invasion of Gaza, causing significant damage and loss of life. The robots, which are equipped with explosive charges, are able to move between homes and residential areas, controlled remotely by the Israeli army. The source explained that the use of these robots has resulted in the destruction of entire residential blocks, such as in the al-Faluga neighborhood in Gaza City. The source also stated that the Israeli army has been using these robots since May, and that they have been responsible for numerous civilian casualties. The source said, 'These robots have a huge explosive capacity, they can destroy an entire neighborhood.' The use of these robots is part of Israel's ongoing campaign of genocide against the people of Gaza, which has resulted in over 140,000 Palestinian casualties and 10,000 missing persons, as well as widespread destruction and famine. The Israeli government has been ignoring international calls to stop its aggression and has been supported by the US.

**10/7, One Year Later**
The barbaric attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, shocked the world, resulting in the brutal slaughter, rape, and torture of 1250 Israeli citizens, and the capture of another 300. The attack, backed by Iran, destabilized Israel politically and economically, displacing over 100,000 citizens and causing widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip. Israel's military response has killed over 40,000 Gazans and left tens of thousands maimed. The attack has also created political fissures in the Western democracies and in Israel, and has upended plans for a treaty among Israel, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia. As the world marks the one-year anniversary of the attack, it is clear that peace in the Middle East is more elusive than ever, with a wider war all but certain, and an outcome that will reverberate across the globe for generations to come.

**Quadcopter strikes: 1000 Palestinians killed by Israeli drones in one year**
Since the beginning of its ongoing war in October 2023, Israel has significantly expanded its use of quadcopters for premeditated strikes on Palestinian civilians in Gaza. According to reports, these drones have killed approximately 1,000 Palestinians, including 350 women and 150 children. Silah, a 52-year-old Palestinian woman, was killed by a quadcopter in May 2024, while trying to escape the Jabalia refugee camp. Her brother described the moment of her killing, saying, 'She was falling in front of us and her head was covered in blood.' Israel's use of quadcopters has been criticized for targeting civilians based on suspicion or preemptive assumptions, which is illegal under international humanitarian law. The Israeli military claims that the devastating raid aims to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping in the camp, but reports continue to emerge of drones shooting 'everyone that goes out' in Jabalia and other parts of Gaza.

**Israel pushes deeper into Gaza’s Jabalia, strikes Lebanon, Syria – The New Arab**
Israeli forces have escalated their attacks on Gaza, Jabalia, and Lebanon, causing widespread destruction and casualties. The UN's Chris Gunness condemned Israel's actions, calling it 'slaughter' and a 'stain on the conscience of humanity.' UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that Israeli attacks on Lebanon are 'threatening the entire region,' with over 2,000 people killed and 1 million displaced in the past year. Israeli strikes on Syria's capital killed seven people and wounded 11 others. Since October 2023, Israel has killed at least 41,965 Palestinians in Gaza and 2,119 people in Lebanon, and wounded over 97,590 and 10,019 others respectively.

**Israel Marks Oct. 7 Anniversary Under Shadow of Escalating War**
Israelis marked the first anniversary of the Hamas attack that triggered a war, which has sparked protests worldwide and risks igniting a wider conflict in the Middle East. Ceremonies and protests began at 06:29 a.m., the hour when Hamas-led militants launched rockets into Israel. Yuval Baron, whose father-in-law is a hostage in Gaza, said, 'We're still stuck in October 7th, 2023, in one unending day of terror, of fear, of anger, of despair.' President Isaac Herzog presided over a memorial ceremony in Reim, where over 360 people were killed and dozens taken hostage. He said, 'We will remember always who kidnapped, who murdered, who raped, who slaughtered. At the same time, we have also seen extraordinary fortitude.' Security forces were on high alert across the country, anticipating possible Palestinian attacks. In Gaza, the Israeli military foiled a rocket attack planned by Hamas. Vigils were held outside Israel and demonstrations were expected against its offensive in the Gaza Strip, which has killed almost 42,000 people and displaced most of the 2.3 million population.

**The Guardian view on a year of civilian slaughter in the middle east: a region in flames**
The Middle East has seen a year of escalating violence and civilian slaughter, with Israel's retaliation against Hamas in Gaza and Iran's missile attack leading to a cycle of retaliation and destruction. The region is slipping deeper into war, with civilians paying the price. The article highlights the devastating consequences of the conflict, including the killing of over 1,200 Israelis and 41,500 Palestinians, as well as the displacement and suffering of countless others. The author argues that military victory is a mirage and that a sustainable solution requires diplomacy addressing long-term security needs, including a fair settlement for Palestinians. The article also notes that Israel's actions are increasingly isolated, with the international community recoiling from its occupation of Palestinian territories and its disregard for human rights.

**Russian Occupiers Kill 93 Ukrainian Soldiers on Battlefield, 80% in 2024**
According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russian occupiers have killed 93 Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. 80% of these killings occurred in 2024, indicating a significant increase in such cases. Yuriy Belous, head of the department of war crimes, stated, 'This trend was noticed at the end of last year. 'Somewhere from November, there were changes in the attitude of Russian military personnel towards our prisoners of war in a significantly worse direction,' he said. The Office of the Prosecutor General is investigating the killing of 16 Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian forces in the Pokrovsky direction. The incident is being considered a war crime. The Russian military has committed a series of atrocities, including the intentional killing of prisoners of war, which is a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions and constitutes a serious international crime.'

**Russian Soldiers Kill 93 Ukrainian Soldiers, Mostly in 2024**
According to Yuriy Belyusov, the head of the Department of Crimes Committed in the Conditions of Armed Conflict at the Office of the Prosecutor General, Russian soldiers have killed 93 Ukrainian soldiers. The majority of these cases occurred in 2024. Belyusov stated, 'We immediately registered another case with the Main Investigation Department of the SBU. And now we already have information about the death of 93 of our fighters who were killed on the battlefield. And what is important to note is that about 80% of all killings took place this year. Which speaks to a very serious increase in these cases in 2024.' Belyusov also mentioned that changes in the attitude of Russian soldiers towards Ukrainian prisoners of war became noticeable in November last year. 'Perhaps the most resonant example is our prisoners of war who died in Olenivka. But such cases are also being recorded in other places of detention,' he said. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also confirmed the fact of the execution of 10 prisoners of war in other places of detention. Belyusov added, 'We also record this. We have large cases on places of detention on the territory of the RF, on the occupied territory. We interrogate all our prisoners of war who return. All of them become victims of such brutal torture. And during these tortures, unfortunately, some of our fighters die at the hands of or representatives of the armed forces of the RF, or at the hands of representatives of the FSB or zealous employees.'

**Biden hands another $8.7B In Aid To Israel As It Continues Slaughter**
The Israeli military has killed 36 Palestinians in Gaza in the past 24 hours, including 15 people in a school in the Jabalia refugee camp. Israel claims the school was being used as a Hamas 'command and control center'. In Lebanon, Israeli air strikes have killed 92 people and wounded 153 others over the past 24 hours, with more than 700 people now dead since Monday. The US has provided Israel with an $8.7 billion aid package, which includes $3.5 billion for wartime procurement and $5.2 billion for air defense systems. The package is expected to be delivered soon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has formed a global alliance to push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The alliance includes Arab and Muslim countries and European partners. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has criticized the US for its double standards on human rights, asking why it continues to provoke or support wars in the Middle East, causing large numbers of innocent Muslim casualties. Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced legislation to block the sale of $20 billion in US arms sales to Israel, saying that sending more weapons to Netanyahu's government is unacceptable and that American weapons are responsible for far too many civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, defending his nation's response to the October 7 2023 Hamas attacks. He stated, 'I didn't intend to come here this year. My country is at war fighting for its life.' Netanyahu blamed Iran for many regional problems and said, 'If you strike us, we will strike you.' Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed over 41,500 Palestinians and wounded over 96,000 others, with more than half of the dead being women and children. The UN has called for a 21-day ceasefire, but Netanyahu maintained that Israel's military operations are justified to defend itself. Other speakers, including Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, criticized Israel's actions, with Golob saying, 'Mr Netanyahu, stop this war now,' and Sharif declaring, 'This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine.'

**Lebanon: Israeli Strikes Kill Hundreds as Hostilities Escalate**
Human Rights Watch has condemned the Israeli military's strikes in Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of people and injured thousands since September 23, 2024. The organization has called for an international investigation into the recent hostilities and for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm. 'The Israeli military killed hundreds of people in Lebanon in just one day; thousands have been injured and forced to flee from their homes, and hundreds of homes, businesses, and farms have been destroyed,' said Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. 'It is paramount for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm.' The Israeli military has struck over 1,600 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, killing 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women, and injuring over 1,835. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Human Rights Watch has also criticized the Israeli military's warnings to civilians, which it says are not 'effective' under the law. The organization has called on Israel's key allies to suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel, given the real risk that they will be used to commit grave abuses.

Stewart likened this approach to George Orwell's '1984' and Kurt Vonnegut's 'Slaughterhouse-Five.' He also criticized President Joe Biden for claiming that the US is 'tirelessly working' towards a ceasefire in Gaza, while Israel is launching attacks in Lebanon. Stewart exclaimed, 'Wait! We've been working tirelessly towards a ceasefire in Gaza and they're in fucking Lebanon?' The Israeli military has launched airstrikes in Lebanon, killing over 490 people, including 90 women and children, according to Lebanese authorities.

**Jihadists slaughter 26 Christians during worship service in Burkina Faso**
Islamist extremists in Burkina Faso carried out a two-day killing spree, slaughtering hundreds of civilians, including 26 worshippers at a church service. The attacks took place in the towns of Barsalogho and Sanaba in late August, according to reports. In Barsalogho, militants opened fire on hundreds of villagers outside the town and stormed a Protestant church in Sanaba the following day. The victims in Sanaba were members of a Christian Alliance Evangelical church attending a Sunday service. Armed militants tied the hands of 26 Christian men and cut their throats, according to a pastor from the capital, Ouagadougou. The conflict in Burkina Faso escalated notably in 2023, culminating in about 8,000 fatalities. The military controls about 60% of the country, but Islamist groups have repeatedly targeted Christians and churches. Human Rights Watch noted that Islamist groups in Burkina Faso have 'escalated their attacks on civilians, massacring villagers, displaced people, and Christian worshippers.' Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said, 'We are witnessing an incredibly concerning surge in Islamist violence in Burkina Faso. The Islamist armed groups' massacres of villagers, worshipers, and displaced people are not only war crimes, but a cruel affront to human decency.'

**The 'Sloping Plane' of Technological Warfare: A New Era of Conflict?**
A recent attack in Lebanon, which used pagers to deliver explosives, has raised concerns about the ethics of using technology as a weapon. The attack, which killed 37 people and injured 3,000, has sparked a debate about the potential consequences of such actions. Experts believe that the attack was coordinated using digital means, despite the fact that the explosives were delivered through pagers, which have limited energy capacity. The incident has opened up two dimensions of concern: the mass manipulation of wearable communication devices to harm users, and the mass introduction of explosives into consumer goods through global supply chains. This could lead to a 'slippery slope' of further attacks, including the use of nanorobots, atomic, biological, and chemical substances, and the manipulation of mobile phones to turn them into explosives. The article argues that the attack has changed the world and has brought us to a 'sloping plane' where the consequences of such actions are no longer predictable. It calls for a re-evaluation of the ethics of using technology as a weapon and the need for greater regulation of the use of technology in conflict zones.

**The Unprecedented Massacre: A New War in the Making**
The Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, has taken a decision that has led to the killing of 5,000 people, one by one. This is not a new tactic in warfare, but the decision to carry out a mass slaughter is unprecedented. The fact that it is a mass slaughter, not a chemical attack, but more horrific, is what makes it stand out. The decision-maker remains unknown, but the consequences of their actions are clear. In Gaza, hospitals and refugee camps are filled with the dead and the wounded, and the 'Beger' drone, made in Taiwan, is the instrument of this mass murder. Netanyahu started this war with extreme violence, destroying Gaza and forcing its people to live in a small area, surrounded by poverty, rubble, and death. Those who refused to follow his orders were fired or removed. The war started in southern Lebanon, but soon spread to the Bekaa Valley and then to the entire country, in an attempt to kill as many people as possible, in a blind and senseless manner, as in Gaza. The decision-maker knew the consequences of their actions, and made sure to eliminate any chances of a ceasefire or a deal, which would have allowed the 'hostage team' to be released. This decision has led to a new war, with new goals and new consequences, and the 'Beger' drone is just one of the tools used to carry out this mass murder. The 'resistance' cannot withstand a blow of this magnitude, and has already lost many leaders and thousands of its supporters, who have been forced to flee their homes and villages. The question remains, how will they respond, when, and where? This time, there is no room for mediators to ask for more patience.
