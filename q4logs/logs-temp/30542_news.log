**Is the Party Over for the Russell 2000 Index?**
The Russell 2000 Index has reached its highest point since 2021, with a current value of 2,458 points. If the bulls do not provide a clear signal, a double high could emerge from the chart, potentially affecting the market. The index has been in a bullish trend since October 2023, with a breakout above the trigger mark of 2,100 points. This has triggered a buy signal, leading to a rally towards the 2021 highs. However, the market will now decide the further course of action for the index. A sustained weekly close above 2,470 points would increase the likelihood of a rally to 2,719 points. Conversely, a failure to break through this barrier could lead to a decline to 2,202 points or lower. This development would be within the scope of a normal consolidation and would only lead to a new breakout attempt at a later stage. The author suggests building positions using the Open End Turbo Long Zertifikat WKN MJ4EVR with a leverage of 10.6, which could potentially yield a return of 125%.

**S&P 500 May Not Repeat 20% Gain, But Another Big Year is Possible**
Carson Group's chief market strategist Ryan Detrick believes that while the S&P 500 may not be able to replicate a 20% or higher gain in the coming year, investors may still be in for another big year. According to Detrick's research, there have been 8 instances since 1950 where the S&P 500 has had back-to-back years of 20% or higher gains. In 6 of these 8 cases, the US stock market has seen positive returns in the following year, with an average return of 12% and a median return of 13%.

**After the debate bump, JD Vance's ratings have plunged again; this is what a new poll says**
JD Vance's popularity has been declining sharply after the vice presidential debate, according to a new poll.

Vance had previously expressed skepticism towards public opinion polls, stating that he does not trust them.

**After VP debate, JD Vance cements status as MAGA heir apparent in 2028**
JD Vance cemented his status as the heir apparent to the MAGA movement in 2028 after a strong performance in the vice presidential debate. Vance, 40, showed a genial side of himself as he sparred with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, improving his favorability rating among voters by 9 points, according to a CBS News poll. Republicans, including Vance, are focused on getting former President Donald Trump back to the White House in 2024, but Vance's debate performance has reinforced his position as the natural heir to the movement Trump started. 'He has definitely put himself, in my opinion, not only as the frontrunner for 2028 but the face of the new generation for the Republican Party,' said Mike Hartley, an Ohio-based GOP consultant. Vance's affability surprised many who are accustomed to seeing a more combative, controversial candidate on the campaign trail. 'The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact check,' Vance said, in a moment that showed vestiges of his previous behavior. For the most part, however, Vance gave off Midwest nice and sought to paint himself as relatable, humanizing the issue of reproductive health by invoking a woman he knows who sought an abortion because she was in an abusive relationship. 'As a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us,' he said. Vance's campaign said that he is focused on making sure Trump is re-elected in 2024, and that 2028 is not on his mind. However, many observers believe that Vance has proven himself enough to be a formidable candidate in 2028, even if he doesn't make it to the White House next year.

**‘He's been a drag': JD Vance's unpopularity is unprecedented, polling expert says ahead of debate**
According to polling expert Harry Enten, Senator JD Vance's negative-11 favorability rating is unprecedented and may be actively damaging the Republican 2024 ticket. Enten compared Vance's dismal likability scores to those of his Democratic challenger, Governor Tim Walz, who enjoys a plus-four favorability rating. Enten stated, 'JD Vance has actually, if anything, been a drag on the Republican side of the ticket, while Tim Walz has actually, if anything, helped Kamala Harris up a little bit.' Vance's negative rating is the worst among vice presidential candidates, with only Dan Quayle in 1988 having a similar rating of minus-three points. Enten noted that 'negative-11 points is no good,' and praised Walz's score in the highly-polarized US political landscape.

In contrast, Walz has a +4 percent favorability rating, with 72 percent of polled Americans believing he has the upper hand in the debate. Vance's aggressive rhetoric, baseless conspiracies, and weird comments have rubbed Americans the wrong way, including his claim that childless adults should not hold positions of power and his lie about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, which sparked 33 bomb threats and forced the city to evacuate.

**How JD Vance, Tim Walz Favorability Ratings Compare Ahead of Debate**
Ahead of the vice presidential debate, Ohio Senator JD Vance has lower favorability ratings than Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, with 44% of voters viewing Vance unfavorably and 35% viewing him favorably, according to an Echelon Insights poll. Walz has a more positive favorability rating of +3.7 points, but polls show fewer voters have made up their minds about him. Aaron Kall, director of the University of Michigan's debate program, said Vance needs to address questions about his previous comments on women and social issues, such as abortion, and provide a 'jolt' of energy to his campaign. Meena Bose, executive dean of Hofstra University's Peter S. Kalikow School of Government, Public Policy and International Affairs, said the debate is crucial for Vance to demonstrate executive leadership qualities and deliver a message to expand the campaign's voting coalition. The debate will air on CBS News at 9 p.m. on October 1, and will be moderated by Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.
