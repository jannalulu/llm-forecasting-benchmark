**Romanian Liberals Back Centrist Candidate in Presidential Runoff**
The Romanian Liberal Party has announced its support for the centrist candidate Elena Lasconi in the presidential runoff election on November 25. This decision comes after the surprise victory of the right-wing candidate Călin Georgescu in the first round, who has been critical of the NATO and has expressed admiration for fascist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s. The Liberal Party's leader, Ilie Bolojan, stated, 'We will support the Europeanist direction of Romania and the center-right policy.' The Social Democratic Party, which had been the favorite to win, has not yet announced its support for a candidate. Mihai Tudose, a senior member of the party, said, 'The party will make this decision after the parliamentary elections.' Georgescu has been endorsed by another far-right party, SOS Romania, and his victory is expected to give a boost to other far-right groups in the country.

**Romanian Presidential Election Heads to Runoff Between Georgescu and Lasconi**
The second round of the Romanian presidential election will be a showdown between ultranationalist candidate Călin Georgescu and liberal leader Elena Lasconi. Georgescu, an independent candidate from the far-right populist movement, surprisingly won the first round with 22.94% of the vote, while Lasconi came in second with 19.18% and will face Georgescu in the runoff on December 8. The election has significant consequences for the country, as Georgescu's platform is pro-Kremlin and anti-NATO. Lasconi has the support of the liberal party Usr, while Georgescu has the backing of the far-right party Aur and another party, Sos Romania. Georgescu has expressed sympathy for Romanian leaders from the 1930s and 1940s who collaborated with Nazi forces, calling them 'national heroes' and 'martyrs.' If Georgescu wins, it could put Romania's international position and support for Ukraine at risk.

**Romanian Liberals back centrist presidential candidate after hard-right surge**
Romania's ruling coalition has thrown its weight behind centrist presidential candidate Elena Lasconi, leader of the opposition Save Romania Union (USR), after independent hard-right politician Calin Georgescu stunned observers by winning the first round of the presidential election. The Liberal Party (PNL) will support Lasconi 'without any negotiation', according to new Liberal head Ilie Bolojan, who said 'We will support Romania's pro-European direction and centre-right politics.' The Social Democrats, whose leader Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu had been the election front-runner, have yet to officially endorse a candidate. Analysts warn that hard-right groupings are likely to receive an electoral boost from Georgescu's success, which could help them secure at least a third of parliamentary seats.

**Pro-Russian Candidate Calin Georgescu Wins First Round of Romanian Presidential Elections**
In a surprise turn of events, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu won the first round of the presidential elections in Romania with 22.94% of the votes, followed by right-wing candidate Elena Lasconi with 19.17%. Current Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who is a member of the Social Democratic Party, presented his resignation as party leader after the poor results. Georgescu, who has 3.4 million followers on TikTok, announced that he has 'lit the candle of hope and courage to be Romanian. The Romanian people have chosen to stop kneeling, not to be humiliated.' He also stated that 'the Romanian people shouted 'peace' tonight, and they did it very loudly.' Georgescu will face Lasconi in the second round on December 8. Lasconi, a former journalist and mayor of Campulung, has a strong nationalist, liberal, pro-European, and pro-NATO message. Ciolacu, on the other hand, will not participate in the second round, saying that 'the rules of democracy and the importance of this second round are much greater than our personal interests.' Georgescu's victory comes at a time when there is a growing fear of rupture in NATO and the European Union following Donald Trump's victory in the US. He has previously stated that Ukraine is 'a country invented' and that Vladimir Putin is 'a man who loves his country' and 'someone who understands very well the diplomatic angles, dominates them, and is surrounded by highly qualified professionals.' He also advocates for Romania's withdrawal from NATO, believing that the Alliance would not defend it in case of an invasion. Additionally, Georgescu is an open defender of known Nazi collaborators from World War II, including Ion Antonescu and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, whom he considers 'national heroes.'

For those who have the courage to aim higher, who believe in a dignified, strong, and European Romania, this result is yours.' Lasconi emphasized that she will work tirelessly to win the trust of the Romanian people in the next two weeks.

**Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu Leads in Presidential Election Polls**
According to exit polls, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu from the Social Democratic Party (PSD) is expected to receive the most votes in the first round of the presidential election on Sunday, with 25% of the votes. However, he is not expected to win in the first round. The polls also suggest that Elena Lasconi from the Liberal Conservative Party (USR) will advance to the second round in two weeks, with 18% of the votes. Lasconi says, 'It's too early to celebrate a victory, as the polls show a very close race.' She urges everyone to wait for the results on Monday. Calin Georgescu and George Simion, both right-wing candidates, are expected to receive 16% and 15% of the votes, respectively. The polls do not include the hundreds of thousands of Romanians living abroad, who are popular with both Simion and Lasconi. Analysts believe that Ciolacu will win against Simion in the second round, but will face a tougher challenge against Lasconi.
