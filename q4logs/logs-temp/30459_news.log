**US Housing Market Sees Slowing Growth, Experts Expect Continued Trend**
According to FactSet's analysis of analysts' estimates, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released by S&P Dow Jones Indices on November 26, is expected to show a 4.8% year-over-year increase in September, down from 5.2% in August, marking the sixth consecutive month of slowing growth. Experts believe that the increasing supply of housing will continue to support buyers' purchasing intentions and provide more room for negotiation, maintaining the overall housing price growth trend. The National Association of Realtors reported that as of September 2024, there were 1.36 million unsold homes in the US, a 20% increase from the same period last year. The August S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index showed a 4.2% year-over-year increase, lower than the 4.8% in July, but still a record high for 15 consecutive months. The current housing price surge in the US is mainly due to the sharp rise in mortgage interest rates, causing homeowners with low-interest mortgages to abandon their plans to switch homes, leading to a severe imbalance between supply and demand, and ultimately driving up housing prices. In October 2023, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate in the US reached 7.9%.

**Here's what the housing market will look like in 2025**
Zillow predicts a more active housing market in 2025 with more inventory and modest home value growth. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'Buying a home in 2024 was surprisingly competitive given how high the affordability hurdle became. More inventory should shake loose in 2025, giving buyers a bit more room to breathe.' Zillow forecasts a 2.6% home value growth in 2025, with 4.3 million existing home sales. However, mortgage rates are expected to be volatile, with potential swings throughout the year. Additionally, Americans are shifting towards smaller homes and renting as a long-term lifestyle, with the term 'cozy' appearing in 35% more listing descriptions in 2024 compared to 2023.

**In Less Than 2 Years, You Won't Be Able To Afford a Home in These ZIP Codes**
According to Zillow's forecast, several ZIP codes are expected to become too expensive for homebuyers within the next few years. By 2026, the national median home value is projected to be $372,201.

These ZIP codes include Powell, Home values in this Providence county ZIP code, Groton, a second Providence county ZIP code, Pooler, Springdale, Beaufort, Webster, Bethlehem, and others.

Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, predicting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. According to Zillow economists, opposing forces are working to keep home values climbing, but only at a modest pace. They expect a gradual increase in existing home sales in the coming year, with an estimated 4.3 million sales in 2025, up slightly from 4.1 million transactions recorded in 2023 and 4 million projected for 2024. Zillow economists wrote, 'This is an upward revision to our outlook from last month. Opposing forces are working to keep home values climbing, but only at a modest pace.'

**This housing market map shows Zillow’s revised 2025 home price forecast**
Zillow economists have revised their 2025 home price forecast, expecting a 2.9% increase in U.S. home prices between October 2024 and October 2025. They attribute this growth to low inventory, declining mortgage rates, and modest improvements in home sales indicators. However, they also note that modest increases in new listings and high mortgage rates will limit price growth. Zillow expects the strongest home price appreciation to occur in 10 areas, including Atlantic City, NJ (+6.5%), and the weakest in 10 areas, including Lake Charles, LA (-7.8%). Some housing analysts remain skeptical about Florida's housing market, citing increased inventory and declining condo prices.

**British home prices to rise faster than inflation, rents even more**
According to a Reuters poll of 21 housing market experts, British home prices are expected to rise faster than inflation, while rental costs will increase even more. The average value of a British home is predicted to rise 3.1% next year and 4.0% in 2026, outpacing general inflation of 2.3% and 2.1% respectively. Urban rental costs are expected to increase 4-5% next year, squeezing the budgets of prospective homebuyers. Tony Williams at Building Value said, 'The restriction in supply of rental properties is rising quickly and it is outpacing the shortage of supply in the housing market - and thus rents will outpace house prices axiomatically.' However, British homebuilders have witnessed signs of improvement in recent months, and 13 of 15 respondents believe affordability will improve over the coming year, thanks to more competitive mortgage rates. Marcus Dixon at JLL said, 'More competitive mortgage rates, albeit not quite as low as some hoped, will help with affordability despite the forecast for modest price rises.'

**Home sales jumped in October, and housing demand is set to pick up from here, NAR says**
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported a 3.4% increase in existing home sales in October, marking the first annual rise since July 2021. The group attributed the increase to more inventory of existing homes coming to market, giving prospective buyers more opportunities to purchase. However, buyers are still challenged by affordability issues, with the median existing home price climbing 4% to $407,200 in October, marking the 16th-straight month of price increases. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, stated, 'The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions.' Despite elevated mortgage rates, Yun expects them to stabilize. Real estate forecasters anticipate the housing market to remain tight in 2025, with Zillow predicting a 2.8% increase in home prices over the next 12 months and Bank of America analysts anticipating a 5% rise next year.

**US Housing Market Continues to Show Upward Trend**
The US housing market continues to show an upward trend, with prices increasing 0.5% in October, according to a report by Redfin. The report states that the low inventory of houses and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates are driving the price increase. Redfin's senior economist Sheharyar Bokhari said, 'Many people, especially first-time homebuyers, have been waiting for the election to end before making a decision to buy a house. Now that the election is over, we're seeing a rebound in homebuying demand, and in the next few months, we expect to see even more competition for homes, unless the number of available homes increases significantly, in which case, home prices may continue to rise.' Zillow's recent report predicts that home prices will increase by 2.6% this year and 2.8% in the next 12 months. The report attributes the price increase to low inventory and the expected decrease in mortgage interest rates. However, if mortgage interest rates rise and inventory increases slightly, it may limit the price increase.

**Cities with highest share of affordable home listings: How Denver compares**
A recent analysis by Zillow found that the share of affordable homes in the US has increased to 28% in September, the highest level since February 2023. However, this relief may be short-lived as mortgage rates have ticked up again, with the average 30-year mortgage rate at 6.78% last week. According to Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist for Zillow, 'Buyers should expect more ups and downs ahead for mortgage rates.' The share of affordable homes varies from market to market, with Austin, Texas seeing the biggest rise in affordable listings, increasing from 13% in October 2023 to 26% in October 2024. In Denver, 22.9% of home listings in October 2024 were considered affordable, slightly down from September 2024's 23%. Meanwhile, large markets in California and the Northeast are among the least affordable in the country.

**Today’s Mortgage Rates Increase: November 19, 2024 Analysis**
Mortgage rates have increased recently, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate reaching 6.60% as of November 19, 2024. This rise is attributed to the strengthening economy, particularly in the labor market, which has placed upward pressure on interest rates. Despite expectations that rates might ease in 2025, many experts are cautious, citing the robust job market and high consumer spending. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should consider their unique financial situations and weigh the costs and benefits of refinancing, as current rates are higher than previous months. According to Zillow, average rates for various mortgage types include: 30-year fixed: 6.63%, 15-year fixed: 6.06%, 30-year FHA: 5.73%, 30-year VA: 6.03%, and 7/1 ARM: 7.20%.

**Seattle Housing Market Predictions for the Next 5 Years**
The Seattle housing market is expected to experience a slowdown in price growth over the next 5 years, with moderate price growth in the short-term, stabilization in the medium-term, and gradual price appreciation in the long-term. According to Redfin and Zillow, the median sale price of a home in Seattle has increased by 9.4% to $874,950 in September 2024, but the number of homes sold has decreased by 10.5%. The market is expected to be influenced by factors such as inventory levels, interest rates, economic conditions, migration patterns, and population growth. The forecast is based on current data and trends, but several factors could disrupt the predictions, including major shifts in interest rates, significant economic downturns, and unexpected changes to city regulations and policies impacting housing supply.

**Connecticut home listings surge in last 3 of 4 months as sellers anticipate interest rate cuts**
New home listings in Connecticut have surged in the last three of four months, with a 7% increase in October compared to the same period last year. This follows the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, which are expected to make homes more affordable for buyers. However, many homeowners with existing mortgages with fixed rates below 5% are hesitant to sell due to the more expensive mortgage they would have to line up to buy a replacement home. Despite this, listings are up in several municipalities, including West Hartford and Waterbury, with some seeing increases of over 25%. Dawn Gagliardi, a Serhant broker, said, 'We have definitely seen an uptick in the listings coming on the market over the past few months.' However, buyers are still facing challenges, including intense bidding activity and price decreases. Compass CEO Robert Reffkin noted that purchase mortgage applications have increased every week for the last 10 weeks, despite higher interest rates. The question remains whether listings will continue to rise in the closing weeks of 2024.

**Connecticut home listings surge in last 3 of 4months as sellers anticipate interest rate cuts**
New home listings in Connecticut have surged in the last three out of four months, with a 7% increase in October compared to the same period last year. This comes after the Federal Reserve cut its prime lending rate, which analysts expect to lead to lower mortgage rates. However, existing mortgages with fixed rates below 5% have kept homeowners from selling, resulting in buyers having to pay more for homes. Despite this, listings are up in many municipalities, including West Hartford and Waterbury, which saw increases of over 25%.

**Higher mortgage rates keep the market subdued even as more sellers list their homes**
Higher mortgage rates are continuing to impact the housing market, with the average 30-year conforming rate reaching 6.61% on Tuesday, a 15 basis point increase from the previous week. Despite this, more sellers are listing their homes, with single-family home inventory up 33% from last year. However, new pending sales are also on the rise, with a 9% increase from the same week last year and an 11% increase from the same week in 2022. Mike Simonsen, founder of Altos Research, notes that the market is 'slowly adjusting to this new normal of higher mortgage rates.' Homebuilders are also facing challenges due to the cost of borrowing, with HousingWire Lead Analyst Logan Mohtashami stating that the current policy rate range is 'recessionary levels for housing permits.' Zillow data shows that housing starts were down for a second straight year in 2023, but builders have pivoted toward condominiums and townhomes to create more starter-home supply at lower price points. Home-price appreciation continues to hamper affordability, with prices rising 0.5% from August to September and 6% on a yearly basis.

**Lower Mortgage Rates Barely Budge Hartford Sellers**
The Hartford metro area saw a minimal increase in new listings this fall, with only a 0.1% year-on-year increase in September. Meanwhile, the number of listings that had cut their initial list price was low at 19.7%, indicating that sellers were feeling confident. However, outside of the Northeast, lower mortgage rates since July 1 have brought more sellers onto the market, giving buyers more options. According to Skylar Olsen, Zillow's chief economist, 'September proved the readiness of both buyers and sellers to return when conditions are right.' Despite a recent mortgage rate spike, Olsen advises buyers to be prepared for market fluctuations and to have their finances in order to act quickly when they find the right house.

The U.S. housing market saw a 13.3% decline in home sales in September 2024, with the median sales price dropping 1.4% to $429,000.

**CT real estate listings swing back up after interest rate cut**
New home listings in Connecticut jumped by 5.7% in September, with over 4,000 houses and condominiums listed for sale, according to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices New England Properties. This increase is attributed to the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, making mortgages more affordable and foreshadowing additional cuts to boost the real estate market. Statewide listings were up 1.7% from 2023 totals, with Danbury and West Hartford seeing increased sales this year. However, many buyers are waiting for more properties to hit the market that meet their price points. Paul Breunich, CEO of William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty, said, 'Listing inventory is increasing,' and predicted a 'strong' market for early 2025 if no macroeconomic shocks surface. The median Connecticut property sold for $395,000 in the first nine months of 2024, up $40,000 from the median sale in 2023.

**Hartford Beginning to See Effects of Mortgage Rate Drops**
The recent drop in mortgage rates is expected to drive increased market activity in Greater Hartford, particularly in areas with a high percentage of owner-occupied homes with a mortgage. According to a study by Realtor.com, markets with high mortgage rates stand to see the most changes in their real estate market. While Hartford ranks 29th among metros analyzed in the study (64 percent), Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, notes that 'although mortgage rates have eased, market rates continue to exceed current rates for most homeowners keeping them locked in 'golden handcuffs.' As interest rates drop, it will be beneficial for both buyers and sellers, with buyers returning to house hunting and sellers feeling more confident in finding their next home. Realtor.com expects mortgage rates to hold around 6 percent through the end of the year, a significant difference from their 7.8 percent high in October 2023.
