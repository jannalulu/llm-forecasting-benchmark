Despite receiving a significant investment of 1.2 million euros last year, the company was unable to recover. According to curator Ulrich Kroeze, it is still unclear why the company failed so quickly after the investment. Wholy Greens was founded in 2020 by former consultants Walter Zantinge and Pieter van der Manden, who produced pasta made from over 50% of vegetables such as carrots, beets, pumpkins, and spinach. The company aimed to reduce food waste by using leftover vegetables that were not suitable for sale in stores. Wholy Greens had gained significant traction, with major clients such as Albert Heijn, Jumbo, and the Bijenkorf, as well as delivery services Crisp and Pieter Pot. However, the company's leadership changed after the investment, with Manon Cassee and Maarten Brink taking over in November.

As part of the operations and activities carried out by the units affiliated with the Erzurum Police Department between October 1-31, 2024, the GBT application was made for 171,524 individuals. 29,756 vehicles were inspected. 800 public workplaces were inspected. 687 inspections were carried out in parks and gardens, and 1,336 inspections were carried out in abandoned buildings. Causal procedures were applied to 1,417 vehicles. 341 people were arrested for tax evasion and 210 wanted individuals were apprehended and handed over to the judicial authorities. In 66 narcotics operations, 14,311.64 grams of narcotics were seized. 14 firearms, 20 handguns, 7 hunting rifles, 229 cartridges, and 212 knives were also seized.

The individuals, a 44-year-old woman, a 43-year-old woman, and a 50-year-old man, were released under investigation. The police investigation, part of Operation Target, aims to tackle organized crime, but there is no evidence linking the three to such activities. This raises questions about how they obtained the firearms, given the UK's strict gun control laws. The author argues that this incident highlights the ineffectiveness of gun control laws, as people can still obtain firearms despite regulations. The author concludes that disarming law-abiding citizens will not prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals and will only make the law-abiding vulnerable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 08:29 PM\nSource:[bearingarms.com](https://bearingarms.com/tomknighton/2024/11/05/some-interesting-points-on-recent-gun-arrest-in-uk-n1226797)\n\n**Are October Gun Sales a Bellwether for the 2024 Election?**\nAccording to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, there were 1,302,857 background checks conducted on firearm transfers in October 2024, a 5% decrease from the same month in 2023 but an increase of 200,000 from September 2024. Mark Oliva, NSSF's managing director for public affairs, says this is a sign that lawful gun ownership continues to be an important factor in the elections. He notes that October marks the 63rd straight month of over 1 million background checks. The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions. While the growth in sales checks was modest, October 2024 was the fifth-best October on record, and the trend is similar to that of the 2016 presidential election year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[bearingarms.com](https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2024/11/04/gun-sales-bellwether-election-n1226783)\n\n**How Many Guns In The US: All About America’s Firearms In 2024**\nAccording to estimates, there are between 400 million and 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States. This translates to approximately 1.5 firearms per person and 1.93 firearms per adult. The largest surge in gun purchases occurred between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months. Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023. However, the exact number of firearms in the U.S. is difficult to determine due to factors such as unregistered guns, private sales, and reporting constraints.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 06:35 PM\nSource:[sonsoflibertymedia.com](https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/how-many-guns-in-the-us-all-about-americas-firearms-in-2024/)\n\n**NICS background check rate in the U.S., by state 2023**\nThe National Instant Background Check System (NICS) is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The system checks for a criminal record or ineligibility to purchase. According to Statista, the NICS background check rate in the U.S. varies by state, but this number does not represent the number of firearms sold in the U.S. due to varying state laws and purchase scenarios.

The regulation requires manufacturers to mark such kits with serial numbers and conduct background checks. The administration is appealing a lower court's decision declaring that the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives exceeded its authority in issuing the rule. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the federal government has long required firearms sellers and manufacturers to mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records and conduct background checks. However, conservative justices questioned Prelogar on the limits of language on which the rule was based, focusing on weapons that can fire projectiles or can be readily converted to do so. The Supreme Court in 2023 reinstated the rule pending the administration's appeals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 11:12 PM\nSource:[einnews.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51150677/us-supreme-court-argues-the-legality-of-bidens-ghost-guns-restrictions)\n\n**US Supreme Court to hear 'ghost guns' regulation case**\nThe US Supreme Court is set to hear a case challenging the federal regulation of 'ghost guns', which are firearms sold in easy-to-assemble kits. Gun manufacturers and owners are objecting to a 2022 rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that requires ghost guns to have serial numbers and for purchasers to undergo background checks. According to ATF figures, nearly 20,000 ghost guns were recovered at crime scenes in the United States in 2021, a tenfold increase from 2016. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in her brief that ghost gun manufacturers are seeking to get around the ATF rule using 'trivial evasion', comparing it to IKEA selling furniture parts kits that must be assembled by the purchaser. The Supreme Court is expected to deliver a decision in the case before the end of June 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 05:56 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-supreme-court-hear-ghost-054823494.html)\n\n**Florida Senate Candidate Needs A Second Amendment Lesson**\nFlorida Senate candidate Phillip Carter has expressed support for gun control measures, including universal background checks and red flag laws. However, his arguments have been criticized for being misinformed and infringing on Second Amendment rights. Carter claims that universal background checks would prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining firearms, but licensed dealers at gun shows are already required to conduct NICS checks. He also supports implementing red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others. Critics argue that these laws infringe on people's rights and that there is no balance between gun control and Second Amendment rights. They also point out that gun control advocates have never been satisfied with any law passed and will always push for more restrictions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 10:30 AM\nSource:[bearingarms.com](https://bearingarms.com/tomknighton/2024/10/07/florida-senate-candidate-needs-a-second-amendment-lesson-n1226469)\n\n**Gun Sales Already Up Under Kamala**\nGun sales have increased since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the top of the Democratic ticket, with a 1.3% sales increase in September compared to the same month last year. According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, adjusted background checks showed a significant increase, with 1,156,223 checks in September, the 62nd consecutive month with sales above 1 million. This trend is unusual, as gun sales typically decrease in an election year. However, since July, month-over-month sales have increased by about 125,000, with a total background check count up by 260,000.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 10:40 AM\nSource:[hotair.com](https://hotair.com/headlines/2024/10/04/gun-sales-already-up-under-kamala-n3795376)\n\n**The flood of ghost guns is slowing after regulation. It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**\nA Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal. 'No matter how wise ATF's final rule or how 'weighty' petitioners' policy concerns may be, the final rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority,' said the states in a brief authored by the West Virginia Attorney General's Office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 04:34 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/the-flood-of-ghost-guns-is-slowing-after-regulation-its-also-being-challenged-in-the/article_b73c2ed9-fbbd-524c-be6a-12272c4fcf03.html)\n\n**FBI Report Shows Dramatic Violent Crime Drop as 29 States Went Permitless**\nThe FBI's 2023 national crime report shows a record-breaking decline in murders, with a 11.6% drop, and a 3.0% decrease in national violent crime. This comes as 29 states have adopted 'constitutional carry' laws, allowing citizens to carry firearms without a permit. According to the Brennan Center, the data aligns with predictions from independent experts, who estimated steep drops in murders in 2023 and 2024. The report also notes that the number of active carry permits and licenses declined slightly last year, and that the estimated number of law-abiding citizens carrying defensive sidearms under the 'constitutional carry' laws is unknown. The FBI report highlights the decline in violent crime, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by 11.6%, rape by 9.4%, and aggravated assault by 2.8%. However, the report remains user-unfriendly, making it difficult to determine the types of firearms used in homicides. As noted by the FBI, more than 16,000 agencies submitted data to the UCR Program through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the Summary Reporting System, covering a combined population of 94.3% inhabitants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 12:14 PM\nSource:[AmmoLand](https://www.ammoland.com/2024/10/fbi-report-shows-dramatic-violent-crime-drop-as-29-states-went-permitless)\n\n**Justice Department's Gun Violence Prevention Plan Widens Background Checks, Boosts Red Flag Programs**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced plans to help combat gun violence and save lives. The DOJ developed resources to help small and rural law enforcement agencies deal with mass shootings and plug gaps in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 requires a check of the criminal and mental health history of gun purchasers under 21, but many states and territories restrict the sharing of this information. The DOJ also announced a plan to issue $85 million in grants for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives and over $135 million for red flag programs. However, a firearms industry spokesman expressed some concern over the red flag grants, stating that due process rights must be preserved under the law.

The legislation would allow states to share juvenile criminal history and mental health records with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), while maintaining the confidentiality of juveniles. According to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, NICS must contact state and local law enforcement to determine if a purchaser under 21 is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, some states restrict the sharing of juvenile records. The model legislation creates an exception to these restrictions, allowing law enforcement to access these records during background checks.

This contradicts claims made by Donald Trump that crime has been rampant and out of control without him in power. The data also shows a 3% decrease in violent crime nationwide and declines in rape, property crime, and burglary. However, car theft increased by 12.6% and shoplifting returned to pre-pandemic levels. The FBI notes that its data includes full-year numbers from every city agency covering a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants, undermining Republican claims that the numbers look better than they are because they exclude statistics from many major cities. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said that while it was encouraging to see more law enforcement agencies participating in reporting hate crimes data, 'we still have a long way to go toward ensuring comprehensive data collection that provides a more accurate picture of the lived experience of targeted communities across the country.'

The Gun Violence Archive data showed that mass shootings also fell 20% in 2024 compared to the previous year and are expected to reach their lowest level since 2019.

Mark Oliva, NSSF's managing director for public affairs, says this is a sign that lawful gun ownership continues to be an important factor in the elections. He notes that October marks the 63rd straight month of over 1 million background checks. The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions. While the growth in sales checks was modest, October 2024 was the fifth-best October on record, and the trend is similar to that of the 2016 presidential election year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[bearingarms.com](https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2024/11/04/gun-sales-bellwether-election-n1226783)\n\n**How Many Guns In The US: All About America’s Firearms In 2024**\nAccording to estimates, there are between 400 million and 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States.

The largest surge in gun purchases occurred between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months. Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023.

The regulation requires manufacturers to mark such kits with serial numbers and conduct background checks. The administration is appealing a lower court's decision declaring that the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives exceeded its authority in issuing the rule. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the federal government has long required firearms sellers and manufacturers to mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records and conduct background checks. However, conservative justices questioned Prelogar on the limits of language on which the rule was based, focusing on weapons that can fire projectiles or can be readily converted to do so. The Supreme Court in 2023 reinstated the rule pending the administration's appeals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 11:12 PM\nSource:[einnews.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51150677/us-supreme-court-argues-the-legality-of-bidens-ghost-guns-restrictions)\n\n**US Supreme Court to hear 'ghost guns' regulation case**\nThe US Supreme Court is set to hear a case challenging the federal regulation of 'ghost guns', which are firearms sold in easy-to-assemble kits. Gun manufacturers and owners are objecting to a 2022 rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that requires ghost guns to have serial numbers and for purchasers to undergo background checks. According to ATF figures, nearly 20,000 ghost guns were recovered at crime scenes in the United States in 2021, a tenfold increase from 2016. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in her brief that ghost gun manufacturers are seeking to get around the ATF rule using 'trivial evasion', comparing it to IKEA selling furniture parts kits that must be assembled by the purchaser. The Supreme Court is expected to deliver a decision in the case before the end of June 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 05:56 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-supreme-court-hear-ghost-054823494.html)\n\n**Florida Senate Candidate Needs A Second Amendment Lesson**\nFlorida Senate candidate Phillip Carter has expressed support for gun control measures, including universal background checks and red flag laws. However, his arguments have been criticized for being misinformed and infringing on Second Amendment rights. Carter claims that universal background checks would prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining firearms, but licensed dealers at gun shows are already required to conduct NICS checks. He also supports implementing red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others. Critics argue that these laws infringe on people's rights and that there is no balance between gun control and Second Amendment rights. They also point out that gun control advocates have never been satisfied with any law passed and will always push for more restrictions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 10:30 AM\nSource:[bearingarms.com](https://bearingarms.com/tomknighton/2024/10/07/florida-senate-candidate-needs-a-second-amendment-lesson-n1226469)\n\n**Gun Sales Already Up Under Kamala**\nGun sales have increased since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the top of the Democratic ticket, with a 1.3% sales increase in September compared to the same month last year. According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, adjusted background checks showed a significant increase, with 1,156,223 checks in September, the 62nd consecutive month with sales above 1 million. This trend is unusual, as gun sales typically decrease in an election year.

It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**\nA Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal. 'No matter how wise ATF's final rule or how 'weighty' petitioners' policy concerns may be, the final rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority,' said the states in a brief authored by the West Virginia Attorney General's Office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 04:34 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/the-flood-of-ghost-guns-is-slowing-after-regulation-its-also-being-challenged-in-the/article_b73c2ed9-fbbd-524c-be6a-12272c4fcf03.html)\n\n**FBI Report Shows Dramatic Violent Crime Drop as 29 States Went Permitless**\nThe FBI's 2023 national crime report shows a record-breaking decline in murders, with a 11.6% drop, and a 3.0% decrease in national violent crime. This comes as 29 states have adopted 'constitutional carry' laws, allowing citizens to carry firearms without a permit. According to the Brennan Center, the data aligns with predictions from independent experts, who estimated steep drops in murders in 2023 and 2024. The report also notes that the number of active carry permits and licenses declined slightly last year, and that the estimated number of law-abiding citizens carrying defensive sidearms under the 'constitutional carry' laws is unknown. The FBI report highlights the decline in violent crime, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by 11.6%, rape by 9.4%, and aggravated assault by 2.8%. However, the report remains user-unfriendly, making it difficult to determine the types of firearms used in homicides.

According to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, NICS must contact state and local law enforcement to determine if a purchaser under 21 is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, some states restrict the sharing of juvenile records.

The data also shows a 3% decrease in violent crime nationwide and declines in rape, property crime, and burglary. However, car theft increased by 12.6% and shoplifting returned to pre-pandemic levels. The FBI notes that its data includes full-year numbers from every city agency covering a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants, undermining Republican claims that the numbers look better than they are because they exclude statistics from many major cities. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said that while it was encouraging to see more law enforcement agencies participating in reporting hate crimes data, 'we still have a long way to go toward ensuring comprehensive data collection that provides a more accurate picture of the lived experience of targeted communities across the country.'

This comes after President Joe Biden established a new office last year to speed up efforts to prevent gun violence. According to the White House, the rate of homicide has decreased by 17% during this period, following the largest decline in homicides in 2023. Additionally, data from the Gun Violence Archive showed that random shootings have decreased by 20% so far in 2024 compared to the previous year, and may reach the lowest level since 2019. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted over 300,000 enhanced background checks on individuals under 21 under the Safe Communities Act, which Biden signed into law in June 2022. The White House stated that the FBI rejected over 3,500 gun sales, with enhanced background checks alone responsible for preventing approximately 900 of them. Enhanced background checks on individuals convicted of domestic violence crimes have also prevented over 4,600 gun sales so far this year, according to the White House.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 22, 2024 11:05 AM\nSource:[صحيفة الخليج](https://www.alkhaleej.ae/2024-09-22/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B6-%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%A2%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%84%D9%8A/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85)\n\n**White House says background checks blocked gun sales to youth, domestic abusers**\nThe White House announced that enhanced background checks have blocked thousands of gun sales to people under 21 and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes in the past year.

NCLA client Michael Cargill's 5 ½-year legal battle to overturn the bump-stock rule has ended victoriously, with the District Court declaring that he has the right to own bump stocks under federal law. NCLA's Litigation Counsel, Sheng Li, stated, 'The Government's attempt to limit relief to just Mr. Cargill would have left in place ATF's rule that the Supreme Court said was unlawful, and each person would have had to separately challenge that unlawful rule to get the same relief.' Jonathan Mitchell, former Texas Solicitor General, added, 'We are pleased that the courts have fully repudiated this unlawful agency rule by vacating it across the board.'

Mark Oliva, NSSF's managing director for public affairs, says this is a sign that lawful gun ownership continues to be an important factor in the elections. He notes that October marks the 63rd straight month of over 1 million background checks. The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions.

Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023.

The regulation requires manufacturers to mark such kits with serial numbers and conduct background checks. The administration is appealing a lower court's decision declaring that the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives exceeded its authority in issuing the rule. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the federal government has long required firearms sellers and manufacturers to mark their products with serial numbers, maintain sales records and conduct background checks. However, conservative justices questioned Prelogar on the limits of language on which the rule was based, focusing on weapons that can fire projectiles or can be readily converted to do so.

Gun manufacturers and owners are objecting to a 2022 rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that requires ghost guns to have serial numbers and for purchasers to undergo background checks. According to ATF figures, nearly 20,000 ghost guns were recovered at crime scenes in the United States in 2021, a tenfold increase from 2016. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in her brief that ghost gun manufacturers are seeking to get around the ATF rule using 'trivial evasion', comparing it to IKEA selling furniture parts kits that must be assembled by the purchaser.

However, his arguments have been criticized for being misinformed and infringing on Second Amendment rights. Carter claims that universal background checks would prevent dangerous individuals from obtaining firearms, but licensed dealers at gun shows are already required to conduct NICS checks. He also supports implementing red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed a danger to themselves or others. Critics argue that these laws infringe on people's rights and that there is no balance between gun control and Second Amendment rights.

It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**\nA Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal.

This comes as 29 states have adopted 'constitutional carry' laws, allowing citizens to carry firearms without a permit. According to the Brennan Center, the data aligns with predictions from independent experts, who estimated steep drops in murders in 2023 and 2024. The report also notes that the number of active carry permits and licenses declined slightly last year, and that the estimated number of law-abiding citizens carrying defensive sidearms under the 'constitutional carry' laws is unknown. The FBI report highlights the decline in violent crime, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by 11.6%, rape by 9.4%, and aggravated assault by 2.8%.

The company is expected to announce its fiscal year 2025 third-quarter results on Nov. 20. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran notes that Nvidia has consistently beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates, with one possible reason being the growing demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). CFO Colette Kress said that demand for Hopper GPUs will continue to grow in the second half of the year. Analysts expect Q3 revenue of $32.9 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.74 per share, but Nvidia projects Q3 revenue of $32.5 billion, which is lower than expected. Damodaran thinks that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has accelerated more quickly than Wall Street projected, and that the company may be able to top Wall Street's estimates again. 'The demand for Nvidia's GPUs unequivocally has accelerated more quickly than Wall Street projected in the past because analysts have said so themselves,' Damodaran said. 'I think Damodaran's second scenario is more compelling,' said the article, 'Nvidia might have enough wiggle room with accounting rules to sometimes manage an earnings beat. However, such manipulation wouldn't realistically enable the company to exceed expectations consistently for nearly every quarter over five years.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 08:59 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Analysts expect the stock to regain its mojo, with a median 12-month price target of $150 and a Street-high price target of $200. Constellation Research points out that Nvidia's dominance in AI chips, high barriers to entry, and robust product roadmap make it a leader in the market, with a technology lead of 24 months over its rivals. Nvidia's recent quarterly results show it is the go-to supplier of graphics cards for companies and governments, with revenue up 122% year over year to $30 billion. CEO Jensen Huang noted that demand for the company's graphics cards remains solid, with shipments expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. With its outstanding moat in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market and healthy pricing power, Nvidia is likely to maintain its dominant position in the AI chip market. As a result, the company's adjusted earnings jumped 152% year over year to $0.68 per share, prompting analysts to increase their earnings projections. The stock could exceed $200 in 2025, with earnings potentially hitting $4 per share and the stock price jumping to $220.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 03:37 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/18/prediction-nvidia-stock-could-hit-200-in-2025)\n\n**NVIDIA Is Still Poised for Greatness**\nNVIDIA is a compelling investment opportunity despite its large market capitalization of $2.9 trillion. The company's projected earnings of $4.50 per share in 2025 make it a good value at a price of $120 per share, with a valuation of 25 times next year's earnings. This is on the lower end of the 30-35x forward earnings multiple band observed among large tech companies, suggesting potential upside. The investment strategy involves initiating a core holding in NVIDIA and adjusting based on market trends and performance. While acknowledging potential risks, such as reduced capital expenditures from major customers, the company's position in the current market cycle and ongoing demand for its products justify its inclusion. The anticipated Blackwell cycle with strong growth rates is expected to allow NVIDIA to perform well over the next year, making it a valuable asset in a diversified investment portfolio.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 07:29 PM\nSource:[MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/nvidia-is-still-poised-for-greatness/ar-AA1qwXHW)\n\n**Adobe's Q3 Results Exceed Analysts' Expectations**\nAdobe's Q3 results exceeded analysts' expectations, with earnings per share at $4.65 and revenue of $5.41B.

The Dow Jones index closed up 0.31%, at 40,861.71 points. The S&P 500 rose 1.07%, closing at 5,554.13 points, and the Nasdaq marked a gain of 2.17%, at 17,395.53 points. Initially, the opening of the New York stock exchange was negative, with declines of over 1%, following the August CPI, which indicated that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would not have space to initiate its monetary easing cycle more aggressively next week. However, investors returned to buying, mainly in search of technology stocks. Nvidia stood out, with gains of 8.80%, while Amazon rose 2.77% and Microsoft advanced 2.13%. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, said at a Goldman Sachs event that there is high demand for the company's new semiconductors, exceeding what the company has been able to deliver. Investors are also analyzing rumors that the US may allow the negotiation of chips with Saudi Arabia, according to sources revealed to Semafor. John Higgins, chief economist at Capital Economics, projects that the S&P 500 may surge around 500 points in the remaining months of 2024 and that a possible bubble in the technology sector has not burst. Higgins wrote, 'So far, there is not much evidence that AI adoption profits are waning,' highlighting Nvidia's latest earnings report. 'It's true that there has been a lot of talk about Nvidia having a perfect pricing. But the fact is that the company has continued to exceed analysts' expectations for revenue and earnings per share.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 11, 2024 08:52 PM\nSource:[UOL](https://tnonline.uol.com.br/noticias/economia/bolsas-de-ny-fecham-em-alta-lideradas-por-salto-da-nvidia-e-apos-instabilidade-com-cpi-914870)\n\n**Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now? | The Motley Fool**\nNvidia's stock has dropped 22% from its June 2024 high, partly due to concerns that the AI bull market may be over. Despite this, analysts estimate Nvidia will earn $2.84 per share this year and $4 per share next year, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26. However, there are risks to consider, such as Nvidia's revenue being propped up by a few large customers, and the potential for pricing pressure as the AI market evolves. Analysts have noted that traffic to ChatGPT has dropped in recent months, and Amazon's management has stated that its AI customers want better value. Nvidia's gross margins are currently in the mid-70s, but this could revert to long-term averages, which would be disastrous for investors. As such, long-term investors should consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to accumulate shares slowly, and be aware of the potential risks and volatility of the stock.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2024 10:47 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/10/is-nvidia-stock-a-buy-now/)\n\n**Could Nvidia Stock Double in the Next Year?**\nNvidia's stock has risen significantly in the past two years, with a 240% increase in 2023 and a 108% increase so far in 2024. The company's success is tied to the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) computing, and its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand. However, for Nvidia's stock to double, the company would need to be worth $5.2 trillion, which is a tall task in just a year. Analysts have already baked in 33% earnings growth into the stock, and the current valuation metrics are expensive, with a price tag of 50 times trailing earnings and 37 times forward earnings. While Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) rose 168% in Q2, it will face tough comparisons in the coming quarters. One analyst projects EPS of $5.45 for fiscal 2028, which is still short of the required $7.08 for the stock to double. Nvidia's growth trajectory suggests it will reach this mark around fiscal 2029, about four and a half years away. While a double in a year is unlikely, Nvidia's performance could still beat the broader market, which tends to double about every seven years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2024 12:35 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The influence of Bitcoin has almost always had an effect on the prices of altcoins, as increased liquidity and interest cause their value to rise. Many investors are looking at these promising altcoins, particularly ADA and XRP, as they are expected to benefit from the potential bull run. Cardano (ADA) has recently gained attention as it seems that fundamental and technical indicators are pointing to a rise. Currently, ADA is trading at a lower price than its all-time high of $3.09. Analysts believe that even if Cardano does not follow Bitcoin, there is strong support for Cardano at $0.2803, from which further growth can occur. Cardano's RSI is at 45.2, indicating a light bearish sentiment, but the overall trend for the coin is bullish. Investors are curious to see if ADA can break through its resistance at $0.4057; if it succeeds, it could lead to a price increase to $0.4662. Ripple (XRP) is also ready to be a leading altcoin and will increase in value as Bitcoin rises. The gradual growth of XRP in the current price range of $0.5643 - $0.5904 shows some bullish momentum, as the RSI is at 57.26. If the Bitcoin rally occurs, Ripple could reach important resistance levels of $0.6651 and $0.7639. Analysts are optimistic about the growth potential of XRP and believe it could reach $2.20 as market demand increases. This recent positive momentum for Ripple is supported by broader optimistic expectations from investors who consider Ripple a strategic, long-term investment. If XRP falls below the support level of $0.4498, short-term corrections may be possible, but the overall sentiment remains bullish. The usability of XRP in cross-border payments and its strong market position make it one of the most significant coins in the token category. While Bitcoin approaches a bull market, investors seeking long-term gains can invest in Ripple. Rexas is the only altcoin that has emerged from unknown territory, with real applications in a market dominated by speculation in digital assets. RXS enables investors to create liquidity in traditionally illiquid real assets by effectively tokenizing real estate and commodities. This innovative approach has stimulated demand, with over 102 million tokens sold and $5 million raised so far. Fractional ownership via RXS allows investors to own valuable assets, making investment portfolios more flexible. With the current token price of $0.070, the next funding phase should increase the price, attracting even more interest. Investors seeking stability and diversification outside conventional cryptocurrencies value the very safe and verified platform of Rexas Finance.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 03:00 PM\nSource:[newsbit.nl](https://newsbit.nl/zullen-cardano-ada-en-ripple-xrp-exploderen-als-bitcoin-btc-90-000-bereikt-investor-shares-insights-en-de-ultieme-altcoin-keuze-voor-de-bull-run/)\n\n**Robinhood, Kraken, Galaxy Digital launch USDG: A new era of global stablecoin dominance | Stock Market News**\nA consortium of companies including Robinhood, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital has launched a new stablecoin network called the Global Dollar Network, which aims to accelerate the use of stablecoins worldwide.

The MiCA regulation is expected to enter into force soon, and it includes strict rules for stablecoins.

Tether's dominance in the market is due to its first mover advantage, but its lack of transparency around its reserves has raised concerns. Consumer protection group Consumers' Research has criticized Tether's lack of a full audit from a reputable accounting firm, calling it a 'disaster for consumers waiting to happen.' However, with the European Union's new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, Tether may be forced to delist its stablecoin from EU exchanges. Circle, the issuer of USD Coin, already holds the necessary license to operate in the EU. Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino has stated that the company is working on a 'technology-based solution' to serve the EU market.

If possible, flying on Thanksgiving Day itself may also be a good option, as it tends to be the least crowded day. Sally French, NerdWallet's travel expert, recommends booking flights early, ideally in early October, as prices tend to be lower during this time. She also advises against waiting for last-minute deals, as flights often sell out quickly during the Thanksgiving travel period. The worst days to fly are Wednesday, November 27, Tuesday, November 26, Sunday, December 1, and Saturday, November 30, with Sunday, December 1 being the busiest day of the year in most years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 04:31 PM\nSource:[Lifehacker Australia](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2024/09/the-best-and-worst-days-to-fly-around-thanksgiving)\n\n**Demand for Air Travel Expected to Break All Records in 2024: IBA**\nAccording to a recent report by IBA, a leading market intelligence and aviation consulting company, global air travel demand is expected to exceed 9 trillion passenger kilometers (RPKs) for the first time in 2024, representing a 4.2% increase from the previous record of 8.6 trillion RPKs set in 2019. This growth is driven by a constant increase in GDP in various regions, combined with a reduction in unit costs and improved fuel efficiency, resulting in increasing profitability for airlines worldwide. However, IBA noted that the global political and economic scenario, along with supply chain challenges and labor strikes, will affect aircraft deliveries, reducing them compared to 2023. The recovery of delivery levels to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 is not expected before 2026. The issue related to GTF engines has impacted aircraft availability, and the percentage of narrowbodies out of contract has fallen to levels not seen since before the pandemic. Many operators are extending their aircraft leases, resulting in fewer transitions and retirements. Currently, airlines like IndiGo and Viva Aerobus are facing high rates of GTF engine failures, leading to extremely low retirement rates, with less than 200 retirements expected in 2024. Despite the decline in transaction volumes between 2021 and 2023, IBA predicts a stabilization in 2024. New narrowbodies from Airbus, such as the A321neo, have stood out in leasing negotiations, showing a growth in value of up to 8.4% per year, although engine values have grown at even higher rates, reaching 49.2%. Narrowbody leases have increased by up to 25% since last year. Meanwhile, older aircraft have maintained their values, with some types, such as the Airbus A319 and the Boeing 737 NG, showing growth of 40% to 60% over the past 12 months. There has also been a significant increase in leases for these types of aircraft. IBA predicts a 9.2% increase in global airline capacity from 2023 to 2024. The largest expansion in capacity in seats in the third quarter of 2024 was observed in the Asia-Pacific region, with a growth of 12%, while North America shows a more modest increase of only 3%. However, operational performance in Q2 decreased in Europe and North America, with EBIT margins falling between 3% and 6%. IBA also identified a slight improvement in the average risk classification in the global market, although specific segments, such as cargo and ACMI operators, have seen a significant decline. Despite the absolute increase in emissions returning to pre-pandemic levels, carbon intensity has stabilized, indicating an improvement in fuel efficiency. This shows that, although demand and activity are growing, there is also a movement towards more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. Although IBA predicts a general decline in yields in various global regions in 2024, the most substantial growth was identified in full-service airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by suppressed international demand. On the other hand, the situation in the low-cost segment in North America represents a high risk, with potential bankruptcies due to sustained inflation and overcapacity.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 07:56 PM\nSource:[AEROIN](https://aeroin.net/demanda-por-transporte-aereo-deve-quebrar-todos-os-recordes-em-2024-iba)\n\n**Column: The busiest travel days around Thanksgiving**\nAccording to NerdWallet's analysis of Transportation Security Administration data from 2021 to 2023, the Sunday after Thanksgiving is the busiest day to fly, with over 2.9 million people screened at U.S. airport checkpoints in 2023.

Despite the challenges faced by the aviation industry in recent years, including pandemic-related restrictions, extreme weather events, and rising fuel costs, the conditions are now improving. Decreasing fuel prices and regained pricing power are indicators that it may be an ideal time to reevaluate the sector. The Bank of America highlights four key factors that could lead to outperformance in the aviation industry in the coming months. These developments are particularly relevant for those who may have prematurely written off the sector. Firstly, TSA data shows that demand for air travel remains stable at a high level despite reduced airline capacity. This is crucial as it signals that passengers continue to fly in large numbers despite reduced available seating capacity, leading to improved pricing power, which can positively impact airline revenue. Currently, the TSA checks over 2.5 million passengers daily, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. A new record was reached in July, with over 3 million passengers checked on a single day. As the following graph shows, passenger traffic in the US is now regularly above pre-pandemic levels. US airlines are adjusting their domestic flight capacity. The reason for this is the oversupply of seats during the summer months, which led to a price drop and reduced margins, despite robust air travel demand. By reducing capacity, airlines can increase ticket prices without risking significant passenger decline. This reflects the classic dynamics of supply and demand. With stable demand, airlines, particularly in the context of the autumn season, could benefit from a significant increase in revenue. Fuel is one of the largest cost factors for airlines, making up 20-30% of their total costs. After a period of rising fuel prices, we now see a certain relief, which is good news for the aviation industry. The BofA has increased its profit forecasts for several airlines, including United and Alaska Airlines, due to the recent decline in fuel prices. Lower fuel costs combined with higher ticket prices could help airlines stabilize their profitability and possibly exceed earnings expectations in the 4th quarter. Historically, airlines tend to perform better in the autumn. According to an analysis by the BofA of the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index since 2000, the second half of the year has been the stronger half. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in three of the last six months of the year, namely September, October, and November. If one looks at the development of the past, investors who enter the market now could achieve attractive returns by the end of the year. The aviation industry is positioning itself strategically for sustainable success beyond the short-term upswing. Airlines are using their strengthened cash flows to make essential investments, including expanding their workforce, modernizing their fleets, and implementing new IT systems. At the same time, debt repayment is being accelerated. According to a report by the Bank of America, US airline debt stood at $143 billion at the end of 2023, down from $168 billion at the end of 2021. Although the level remains above pre-pandemic levels, this decline signals a serious commitment to balance sheet repair. Furthermore, airlines are driving forward the modernization of their fleets by replacing older, less efficient aircraft with new, fuel-efficient models, which should further reduce operational costs. American Airlines announced in March the order of 260 new aircraft from Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer to meet the growing demand. Prior to this, United Airlines had announced the purchase of 110 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus in October 2023. While air travel may appear to be a purely passenger transportation service at first glance, a closer look reveals a much more complex business. Airlines must strike a delicate balance: on the one hand, providing sufficient capacity to meet demand, on the other hand, setting prices that enable solid profitability. Delta Air Lines has, despite a challenging start to the year, including the CrowdStrike issue, moderately increased its forecast for earnings per share to $5 to $7. Similarly, the Alaska Air Group has adjusted its earnings forecasts upwards due to robust summer demand and lower fuel costs. Even budget airlines like Frontier Airlines are recording surprisingly strong margin improvements through capacity adjustments. In my opinion, the aviation industry is currently characterized by a remarkable adaptability, making it an interesting investment opportunity. Airlines that efficiently manage their capacity, keep costs under control, and maintain their pricing power will position themselves as winners. For investors who prioritize valuable investments, the aviation industry presents itself as a potentially promising option. Airlines are traded at attractive price-to-earnings ratios, and with a view to the forecasted earnings growth in the fourth quarter and beyond, this may be a good time to review an allocation in this sector. As always, timing is crucial. Stabilizing high passenger numbers according to the Transportation Security Administration, decreasing domestic capacity, declining fuel prices, and seasonal factors all speak in favor of a strong development of the aviation industry in the second half of the year, which could mark the ideal time to build positions in this market.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 07:23 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://de.investing.com/analysis/4-grunde-warum-airlineaktien-bis-jahresende-kraftig-abheben-konnten-200493153)\n\n**Google reveals the best week to purchase Thanksgiving flights**\nA recent study by SmartAsset found that airfare prices at San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport (OAK) increased by 10% in the past year, with the average domestic flight cost rising from $275.86 in 2023 to $303.55 in 2024.

Jet fuel production also increased to 1.9 million barrels per day, an 8% rise from the previous year. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reported a 6.2% increase in passenger travel numbers from January to July 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Airlines for America projected an additional 26,000 scheduled flights per day to meet the higher demand for air travel. Despite the hurricane season, gasoline prices in the Gulf Coast remained steady after a Category 1 storm reached landfall in Texas. The price of gasoline is predominantly underpinned by crude oil, accounting for approximately 60% of the cost. Gasoline prices are expected to remain relatively flat with slower but consistent economic growth, according to the EIA. Jet fuel is a significant component of the economy, contributing about 1.3% of GDP, $535 billion in economic activity, and 2.6 million jobs, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2024 08:33 AM\nSource:[Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720631-jet-fuel-demand-soared-this-summer)\n\n**Air travel could break Labor Day weekend record**\nThe Labor Day weekend is expected to be the busiest travel period ever for U.S. airlines, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipating over 17 million passengers to be screened between Thursday and next Wednesday.

Linden's departure follows the departure of night tsar Amy Lame and is the third of Mr Khan's deputy mayors to leave in recent months. Mayor Sadiq Khan praised Linden's 'exceptional service' and said she had worked hard to ensure that London was 'tough on crime but also tackling its complex causes head on'. However, Linden's time in office saw the Met placed into special measures and hit by a series of scandals, including the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer. According to the Met's most recent statistics, gun crime is up 8.6 per cent year on year, robbery is up 11.4 per cent and shoplifting is up 45 per cent.

According to the study, published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, flu vaccine coverage was 80.7% among 8.8 million healthcare workers in over 4,000 acute care hospitals during the 2023-24 cold and flu season. However, COVID vaccine coverage was only 10.5% among workers in over 14,000 nursing homes. The report noted that COVID-19 vaccine coverage decreased from 22.8% in the 2022-23 respiratory virus season to 10.5% in the 2023-24 season. The authors emphasized the need to investigate barriers to vaccination among healthcare personnel and identify strategies to address these challenges.

No Wonder the Vaccines Don’t Work**\nA recent study found that only 11% of 'flu' cases are caused by the influenza virus, which raises questions about the effectiveness of flu vaccines. The study suggests that the clinical similarity between influenza-like illness (ILI) and influenza makes it difficult to distinguish between the two, and that most ILI cases are caused by other microorganisms. The authors argue that the lack of understanding of the microbiology of ILI and the failure to identify a precise burden of influenza morbidity or mortality has led to wildly inflated CDC estimates and the promotion of ineffective vaccination measures. They also point out that influenza viruses mutate continuously, making vaccination a 'moving target'. The authors conclude that the public is being misled by politicians and the media, who are using the 'flu' label to justify vaccination programs and secure funding for health services.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 02:26 PM\nSource:[principia-scientific.com](https://principia-scientific.com/just-11-of-flu-cases-are-caused-by-influenza-no-wonder-the-vaccines-dont-work/)\n\n**US outpatient antibiotic prescribing returning to pre-COVID levels**\nAccording to a recent analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US outpatient antibiotic prescribing is returning to pre-COVID levels.

However, from July to September 2022, prescribing volume approached pre-pandemic levels, and by October to December 2022, it exceeded those levels by 3.6%. The authors suggest that the uptick of influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 in late 2022 contributed to the observed trends in antibiotic prescribing.

The report found that the number of hospitalizations due to influenza has varied over the seasons, with the highest counts and rates of hospitalizations occurring during the 2017-18 season. The report also found that the proportion of patients who received influenza antiviral treatment increased over the seasons, from 44.1% in the 2010-11 season to 63.4% in the 2022-23 season. Additionally, the report found that the proportion of patients who were vaccinated against influenza increased over the seasons, from 36.4% in the 2010-11 season to 59.1% in the 2022-23 season. The report also analyzed trends in clinical characteristics and outcomes, including the proportion of patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the proportion of patients who died in the hospital. The report found that the proportion of patients who were admitted to the ICU increased over the seasons, from 12.1% in the 2010-11 season to 18.5% in the 2022-23 season. The report also found that the proportion of patients who died in the hospital decreased over the seasons, from 3.4% in the 2010-11 season to 2.1% in the 2022-23 season. Overall, the report provides valuable insights into the epidemiology of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States and highlights the importance of vaccination and antiviral treatment in preventing severe illness and death due to influenza. 'This report provides a comprehensive summary of data collected by FluSurv-NET from the 2010-11 through 2022-23 influenza seasons, including trends in cumulative rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes for patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections,' said the report.

According to the Clínica Universidad de Navarra, the treatment for the flu includes good hydration and paracetamol to reduce fever and alleviate pain. The months of November and December are the most critical for contracting the flu, and the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. The Sistema de Vigilancia de Infección Respiratoria Aguda del Instituto de Salud Carlos III reported a 46% positivity rate for flu in the last week of 2023, compared to 5.38% in the previous month. Doctors recommend not going to work during a period of illness, especially for high-risk groups such as children, the elderly, and pregnant women. A justified reason for not going to work for up to 3 days is a mild illness like the flu, without the need to present any documentation for Incapacidad Temporal (IT). If the illness persists, it is recommended to contact the doctor and request a medical leave. In cases of severe illness, it is best to seek specialized medical attention and obtain a diagnosis from a healthcare provider. Once the diagnosis is made, it is advisable to inform the employer of the expected duration of the leave.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 20, 2024 04:07 AM\nSource:[La Razón](https://www.larazon.es/economia/incapacidad-temporal-cuantos-dias-puedo-estar-baja-laboral-gripe_2024102067125976afcb530001ba87c5.html)\n\n**CDC reports rising levels of Mycoplasma pneumonia and RSV in young kids**\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported rising levels of Mycoplasma pneumonia and RSV in young kids. According to the CDC, pneumonia and acute bronchitis related to M pneumoniae bacteria have increased since late spring and have remained high, peaking in late August. The CDC noted that the increase in children ages 2-4 years is notable because M. pneumoniae historically hasn't been recognized as a leading cause of pneumonia in this age group. Additionally, RSV activity is still low overall, but there are signs of increased activity in the southeastern United States, especially in young children. Emergency department visits for COVID-19 and test positivity continued to decline last week, with test positivity currently at 6.3%. The CDC also reported that deaths from the virus were down last week, with 327 reported. CDC wastewater tracking shows that viral levels remain low, with levels currently highest in the northeast. Regarding flu, the CDC said that seasonal flu activity remains low nationally, with no new pediatric flu deaths reported, keeping the total at zero for the 2024-2025 flu season.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 07:34 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pneumonia/cdc-reports-rising-levels-mycoplasma-pneumonia-and-rsv-young-kids)\n\n**Get Your Flu Vaccine Before End of October**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends getting the influenza vaccine by the end of October to provide solid protection during the cold and flu season. The ideal time to get the flu vaccine is before flu activity starts, which typically peaks between December and February. The vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate and cause illness in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. The FDA emphasizes that the flu vaccine will not make you sick with the flu, but rather trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The FDA notes that anyone can get sick with flu, but children, people age 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with certain chronic medical conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses, 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits, 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 6 million influenza-related illnesses, 2.9 million influenza-associated medical visits, 65,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 3,700 influenza-associated deaths.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 01:35 PM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/health/health-news/flu-vaccine-shot/2024/10/17/id/1184419/)\n\n**The Right Time is Now to Get Your Flu Vaccine**\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends getting the influenza vaccine by the end of October to provide solid protection during the cold and flu season. 'Flu viruses typically spread in fall and winter, with activity peaking between December and February,' the agency said. The flu vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. 'It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body, which is an important reason to get your flu vaccine early, before flu activity starts,' the FDA added. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 140 million cases of the flu, 12,000 hospitalizations, and 6,000 deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 3.5 million cases of the flu, 40,000 hospitalizations, and 2,000 deaths. 'Anyone can get sick with flu,' the FDA said. 'Typically, children and people age 65 and older are most at risk of developing serious complications from influenza.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 06:00 AM\nSource:[U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-10-17/the-right-time-is-now-to-get-your-flu-vaccine)\n\n**Respiratory diseases peak expected in December, experts say**\nAccording to experts, the peak of respiratory diseases is likely to occur in December. The unusually warm September may have helped to delay the flu season. 'We had a prolonged summer, and therefore the epidemic season is likely to be delayed to later dates', said Pshenichnaya. As of October 15, 807,000 people have contracted respiratory viruses (ORVI) in the last week, while 30,000 have contracted COVID-19. The curve of infections has not grown, but has even decreased by 5% over the past two weeks. Although neither ORVI nor the flu will disappear, experts do not expect any unpleasant surprises this year. The few cases of flu reported in recent weeks show that the country is circulating old, well-known strains that are familiar to our immune system. These strains are also included in the vaccines being administered this fall. 'The viruses causing the disease are still dominated by rhinovirus, adenovirus, and other 'seasonal' pathogens. COVID-19 cases remain at 30,000 per week, which is an order of magnitude lower than in previous waves linked to omicron', said Alexander Gorелов, deputy director of the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology. Respiratory viruses are easily transmitted in crowded areas. In half of the cases, children are the first to be infected in a family, and then their parents and grandparents. Therefore, doctors recommend taking advantage of the delay in the flu season and getting vaccinated. Additionally, seniors are also vaccinated for free against pneumococcus, a bacterium that often follows respiratory infections and 'attaches' to a weakened body, causing pneumonia. 'This vaccination is performed once every five years, which is sufficient to maintain stable immunity', emphasized Gorелов.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 06:18 PM\nSource:[Российская газета](https://rg.ru/2024/10/15/pik-orvi-i-grippa-ozhidaetsia-v-dekabre.html)\n\n**The Flu Vaccine Might Be Less Effective This Year**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the influenza vaccine being used this flu season may be less effective than last year's vaccine, based on data from five South American countries. The vaccine reduced hospitalization risk by 35% in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, compared to 51.9% effectiveness last year. The CDC notes that the vaccine's effectiveness 'might be similar in the Northern Hemisphere' if similar flu viruses circulate. This year's flu vaccines in the US will target the H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B (Victoria) strains, and health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccination. According to the CDC, an estimated 75 million people in the US got the flu between October 2023 and April 2024, resulting in 900,000 hospitalizations and between 17,000 and 100,000 deaths.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 12:25 PM\nSource:[Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/s/viewarticle/flu-vaccine-might-be-less-effective-this-year-2024a1000igq)\n\n**CDC: 35% flu vaccine efficacy in South America may predict similar for US season**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the flu vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization among high-risk groups in five Southern Hemisphere countries was low (35%) during the 2024 flu season. This may predict similar efficacy during the upcoming Northern Hemisphere flu season if similar A(H3N2) viruses predominate. According to lead author Erica Zeno, 'While Southern Hemisphere data cannot predict exactly what will happen in the Northern Hemisphere, what we can say is that if we see similar influenza viruses (strains or clades) circulating this season in the Northern Hemisphere, we can expect similar vaccine effectiveness against influenza-related hospitalizations.' The CDC has forecasted that the upcoming flu season will be similar to or lower than that of the 2023-2024 season rate of 8.9 weekly laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations per 100,000, with moderate confidence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 04:43 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/cdc-35-flu-vaccine-efficacy-south-america-may-predict-similar-us-season)\n\n**Get Vaccinated Now: Experts Warn of Influenza Peak in December 2024**\nThe peak of the influenza season is expected to occur in December 2024, but doctors recommend getting vaccinated immediately. 'It's generally between the end of December and the first few days of January that we see the peak,' explains Elisabetta Alti, director of general medicine at the Asl Toscana Centro. 'So, it's best to get vaccinated now, giving our immune system time to build defenses, so we're protected when the flu and Covid viruses spread widely.' The double vaccination against flu and Covid is recommended for people over 60, those with chronic illnesses, pregnant women, and those in high-risk professions such as healthcare workers and teachers. 'The double vaccination is really beneficial, as we receive safe and effective protection against two viruses that can cause significant problems in the coming months,' says Dr. Alti. The Tuscany Region has purchased over 900,000 doses of flu vaccine, including specific vaccines for the elderly, children, and adults. Vaccination against flu and Covid-19 is currently underway in Tuscany, with elderly residents in care homes starting on October 1 and the general public able to get vaccinated at their family doctor's office or pediatrician's office starting on October 7.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 04:21 PM\nSource:[corriere.it](https://corrierefiorentino.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/24_ottobre_07/influenza-2024-il-picco-sara-a-natale-ma-vaccinatevi-subito-756cb860-596a-48f1-a258-0748d0df4xlk.shtml)\n\n**AstraZeneca's FluMist approval for self-administration could increase flu vaccine uptake**\nThe US FDA has approved AstraZeneca's FluMist for self-administration, increasing the accessibility of seasonal influenza vaccines. According to GlobalData, the influenza virus caused 2.1 million illnesses, 21,000 hospitalizations, and 4,700 deaths during the 2023-2024 US influenza season. Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData, said, 'FluMist is approved for use in the US in children and adults ages 2 through 49 years. It is the only seasonal influenza vaccine to be delivered intranasally, which makes it a great option for those who may be needle-phobic.' The US CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older receives a vaccination each influenza season. AstraZeneca plans to utilize a third-party online pharmacy to provide FluMist for self-administration, which is expected to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season. GlobalData's survey reveals that the percentage of patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza who were administered FluMist during the 2022-2023 season were 2.2% of children 2-4 years of age, 13.4% of children 5-17 years of age, and 3.4% of adults 18-49 years of age. Kurdach concludes, 'By increasing access to FluMist, there is potential for these percentages to increase. It is possible that we will see an increase in US patient shares of FluMist, given the convenient route of administration and ease of access, as well as an overall increase in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 05:08 AM\nSource:[Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/healthcare-astrazenecas-flumist-approval-for-self-administration-could-increase-flu-vaccine-uptake-globaldata-3623524)\n\n**Influenza 2024: Expert Warns of Intense Season, Offers Key Advice**\nAccording to virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco, the upcoming influenza season is expected to be intense, with possibly more than 14.5 million cases. The new Covid variant, XEC, is also expected to play a significant role. Pregliasco advises to continue protecting vulnerable individuals and to follow five key rules: get vaccinated, use common sense when wearing masks, wash hands frequently, avoid antibiotics, and practice responsible self-medication. He also emphasizes the importance of getting tested for Covid, especially for vulnerable individuals, and using antiviral medication, such as Paxlovid, if necessary.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 12:08 PM\nSource:[Adnkronos](https://www.adnkronos.com/cronaca/influenza-2024-attesa-stagione-intensa-sintomi-e-vaccino-i-consigli_1EMU2VbMDM30FZCDszC8Ct)\n\n**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Worst Season in 10 Years**\nThe influenza season for 2024 is expected to be the worst in the last 10 years, according to virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco. The new variant of Covid, XEC, is expected to contribute to the high number of cases, which could reach 14.5 to 15 million. Pregliasco warns that it's essential to continue protecting vulnerable individuals. The viruses expected to be prevalent during the autumn-winter season of 2024-2025 include A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and the XEC variant of Covid, as well as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Pregliasco notes that the season of respiratory infections has not ended, and the levels of contagion have not decreased below the critical threshold, even during the summer. He emphasizes the importance of following the 'golden rules' to prevent the spread of the virus: getting vaccinated, using common sense when wearing masks, washing hands frequently, not using antibiotics unnecessarily, and adopting responsible self-medication practices.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 11:56 AM\nSource:[Il Giorno](https://www.ilgiorno.it/cronaca/influenza-2024-sintomi-cure-vifcoipu)\n\n**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Severe Season Ahead**\nThe upcoming influenza season is expected to be severe, with 150 million cases per week predicted. Experts warn that the sudden change in temperature has favored the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza. 'Today we have many children who have never been in contact with the influenza virus, which can circulate more quickly. The problem is that if more people become infected, the number of deaths and severe cases could be high among the elderly and vulnerable,' says epidemiologist Gianni Rezza. To mitigate this, Rezza suggests increasing the vaccination rate against influenza. In Australia, the previous season was the second worst in the past 10 years due to the A/H3N2 variant. In Italy, 14.5 million cases of influenza-like illnesses were reported last year, and this year's numbers are expected to be similar or higher. The US FDA has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine, a nasal spray, for people aged 2-49. The vaccine is available online and can be administered at home after completing a questionnaire to assess suitability for self-administration.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 04:20 AM\nSource:[RaiNews](https://www.rainews.it/articoli/2024/09/influenza-2024-150mila-casi-a-settimana-verso-unaltra-stagione-record-56a489e4-04cb-46f6-9154-59b90f11595c.html)\n\n**CDC Continues to Respond to Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Outbreak**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) in multiple states in the United States. Since April 2024, 14 human cases of infection with the avian influenza A(H5) virus have been reported in the US. Four of these cases were associated with exposure to infected dairy cows, and nine with exposure to infected poultry. The risk of contracting avian influenza H5 for the general public remains low. The USDA reports that 213 dairy herds in 14 US states have confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows. The CDC is working with the USDA, FDA, ASPR, state and local health officials, and other partners to monitor the situation and prevent the spread of the virus. The CDC is also conducting serosurveys to assess past exposure to H5 viruses among veterinarians and other veterinary professionals. The CDC is posting a new webpage describing influenza surveillance activities for the 2024-2025 flu season, which include monitoring of wastewater for influenza A virus and avian influenza A(H5) in the US. The CDC recommends that people avoid contact with sick or dead animals, including wild and domestic birds, and avoid exposure to animal waste, unpasteurized milk, and materials that have been in contact with infected animals. The CDC also recommends that people who have contact with animals during their work should know the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and take the necessary precautions. 'It is essential to reduce the risk of people and contain the risk for public health in general,' said the CDC. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 10:07 PM\nSource:[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://espanol.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-09202024.html)\n\n**Influenza Season 2024: What You Need to Know**\nThe influenza season 2024 is approaching, and it's essential to know the facts about this contagious disease. According to the SSa, the influenza season starts in the fall and winter months in regions with temperate climates, while in tropical climates, the virus circulates throughout the year. Globally, the influenza has an estimated attack rate of 5-10% in adults and 20-30% in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that there are 1 billion cases of seasonal influenza worldwide, with 3 out of 5 cases being severe and causing between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths. In Mexico, the influenza season typically occurs in the fall and winter months, with cases appearing as early as October and peaking in December, January, and February. The symptoms of influenza include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Some people may also experience vomiting and diarrhea, more commonly in children than adults. The influenza is most contagious during the first 3 days of the illness, but it can be transmitted to others from 1 day before symptoms appear to 5-7 days after becoming sick. People with weakened immune systems or young children may be contagious for longer periods. The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, which can then be inhaled by others. 'It's essential to take precautions and get vaccinated to protect yourself and others from the flu,' said Dr. [no doctor mentioned in the article].\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 06:51 PM\nSource:[adn40Mx](https://www.adn40.mx/salud/temporada-influenza-2024-cuando-inicia-tratamiento-sintomas-enfermedad-respiratoria)\n\n**As Flu Season Approaches, American Lung Association Urges Annual Vaccination to Prevent Severe Illness**\nThe American Lung Association is urging the public to get an annual flu vaccination to prevent severe illness as flu season approaches.

She noted that there were no group cases of illness during the summer, so the epidemic season in the cold season should occur later than in 2023. It is likely that this increase will occur in late November to December. Popova also emphasized that by September 30, the readiness of medical institutions to work during the increase in cases will be checked. This includes ensuring that hospitals do not run out of antiviral medications, personal protective equipment, and disinfectants. This also applies to pharmacies, reports RIA Novosti.

This number matches the previous high of 199 reported during the 2019-2020 season. Of the 158 children who were eligible for a flu vaccine and for whom vaccination status is known, 131 (83%) were not fully vaccinated. Flu vaccination can be lifesaving for children and has been shown to reduce the severity of illness in people. According to the CDC, flu vaccination last season reduced the risk of flu medical visits by about two-thirds and flu-related hospitalization by about half for vaccinated children. The CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine, especially children at higher risk for serious flu-related complications. Among the reported deaths, 73 were younger than 5 years old, and 126 were between 5 and 17 years. About half of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A virus infections, while 46% were associated with influenza B viruses. Flu vaccine uptake among children was lagging compared to previous seasons, with coverage for the 2023-2024 season being 2.2 percentage points lower than the previous season and 8.5 percentage points lower compared with pre-pandemic coverage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 03:52 PM\nSource:[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://espanol.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2023-2024/2023-2024-flu-deaths-children.htm)\n\n**Everybody you know coming down sick at the moment? Here's why**\nThe US is experiencing a surge in illnesses, with COVID-19 cases on the rise, particularly in the West. According to Dr. Eve Elizabeth Pennie, a general practitioner, the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 disrupted seasonal cold and flu patterns, making people's immune systems weaker when they returned to their normal lives. This, combined with low vaccination rates and the evolution of the virus, is causing more severe illnesses. Dr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist, said, 'Late summer, early fall, is a really interesting time for the spread of infectious disease... There's all sorts of intermixing.' The CDC reported that 16.3% of people who took a COVID test were positive for the virus, up from 7.5% in July 2020. Vaccination rates for flu have been consistently lower in 2024 than in the three years previous, with 158 million vaccines distributed in the 2023-2024 season, compared to 176 million in the 2021-2022 season. Dr. Gupta said, 'I'm concerned that we've entered a space where we have a series of threats that seem like they're rapidly evolving.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 03:44 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13843305/Everybody-know-coming-sick-moment-Heres-why.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), 'the best available protection against influenza is a vaccination.' The Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO) recommends an annual flu vaccination and a Corona booster shot for certain groups. These include people over 60, pregnant women, chronically ill individuals such as diabetics, people with high blood pressure, and immunocompromised individuals. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary from year to year, ranging from 20 to 60 percent, with older adults experiencing around 40 percent protection. The STIKO also recommends an annual Corona booster shot for individuals with a high risk of severe disease, including those over 60, people with underlying conditions such as asthma, COPD, and heart disease, and healthcare workers with direct patient contact. Studies have shown that this protection lasts for at least 12 months, making a booster shot in the fall particularly important for high-risk groups. The optimal time for flu vaccination is between October and mid-December, but a later vaccination is also recommended if the flu season has not yet begun.

The study analyzed data from the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) database, which collected information on laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations among Americans of all ages from 2010-11 to 2022-23. The study found that the number of hospital cases ranged from a low of 2,415 cases during 2011-12 to a high of 29,695 during 2017-18. Adults 65 years and older had the highest flu-related hospitalization rate across all age-groups, followed by children ages 0 to 4 years. The study also found that the proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit ranged from 14.1% during 2021-22 to 22.3% during 2013-14, and the proportion of patients who died in the hospital ranged from 2.2% during 2021-22 to 3.5% during 2013-14.

This represents a decrease of 297 cases (5.27%) compared to the previous week (October 14-20, 2024). Of the total cases, 4780 were viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, 849 were pneumonias, and 1 case was diagnosed clinically with influenza. In this period, there were no reported cases of confirmed influenza by RTPCR test and no deaths. The analysis by age group shows a high incidence of pneumonias in people aged 15-49, while acute respiratory infections (ARI) were the most frequent in children aged 5-14. In the analyzed week, 209 hospitalizations were necessary (3.71% of the total cases), a slightly higher number than in the previous week, with 14 additional cases. Of these, 108 hospitalizations were for ARI, 101 for pneumonias, and no cases of influenza. The influenza vaccination campaign in Iași County has recorded a total of 33,876 people vaccinated as of October 29, 2024.

'Temperatures affect it, and the temperature fluctuations are particularly insidious because it's easier to catch a cold. When it's cold, people tend to cover themselves, but when there are temperature fluctuations, people get caught off guard by the cold and it's more frequent to catch a cold.'

The ideal time to get the flu vaccine is before flu activity starts, which typically peaks between December and February. The vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate and cause illness in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. The FDA emphasizes that the flu vaccine will not make you sick with the flu, but rather trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The FDA notes that anyone can get sick with flu, but children, people age 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with certain chronic medical conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses, 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits, 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths.

Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData, said, 'FluMist is approved for use in the US in children and adults ages 2 through 49 years. It is the only seasonal influenza vaccine to be delivered intranasally, which makes it a great option for those who may be needle-phobic.' The US CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older receives a vaccination each influenza season. AstraZeneca plans to utilize a third-party online pharmacy to provide FluMist for self-administration, which is expected to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season. GlobalData's survey reveals that the percentage of patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza who were administered FluMist during the 2022-2023 season were 2.2% of children 2-4 years of age, 13.4% of children 5-17 years of age, and 3.4% of adults 18-49 years of age. Kurdach concludes, 'By increasing access to FluMist, there is potential for these percentages to increase.

'Vaccines are not just a shield against illness—they are an important tool in our public health efforts.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 01:00 PM\nSource:[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-concerns-about-respiratory-diseases-among-public-drop-to-new-lows-us-health-officials-urge-vaccination-302258010.html)\n\n**COVID & Infections: Number of Hospitalizations Increases**\nThe number of patients with respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat, and fever has increased weekly. According to the ÖGK, 9,999 cases of grippe-like infections, 35 cases of actual flu, and 1,361 cases of COVID-19 infections have been reported, totaling 11,395 cases. This represents a 46% increase from the previous week, while overall hospitalizations in Lower Austria have increased by 9%. The ÖGK advises high-risk patients to take precautions such as regular handwashing and wearing masks to prevent infections and further transmission. They also recommend that the entire population be vaccinated against influenza, and that high-risk patients be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, the actual number of COVID-19 cases may be higher, as the virus is no longer reportable since July 2023 and fewer tests are being conducted. According to Virologist Monika Redlberger-Fritz, 34% of analyzed samples are currently positive for COVID-19, while only 11% are positive for rhinoviruses, which cause common colds and flu. The rest are attributed to influenza and other viruses. Redlberger-Fritz expects hospitalization numbers to continue rising in the coming weeks as both coronaviruses and rhinoviruses continue to spread.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 03:30 AM\nSource:[news.ORF.at](https://noe.orf.at/stories/3274476)\n\n**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Severe Season Ahead**\nThe upcoming influenza season is expected to be severe, with 150 million cases per week predicted. Experts warn that the sudden change in temperature has favored the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza. 'Today we have many children who have never been in contact with the influenza virus, which can circulate more quickly. The problem is that if more people become infected, the number of deaths and severe cases could be high among the elderly and vulnerable,' says epidemiologist Gianni Rezza. To mitigate this, Rezza suggests increasing the vaccination rate against influenza. In Australia, the previous season was the second worst in the past 10 years due to the A/H3N2 variant. In Italy, 14.5 million cases of influenza-like illnesses were reported last year, and this year's numbers are expected to be similar or higher. The US FDA has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine, a nasal spray, for people aged 2-49. The vaccine is available online and can be administered at home after completing a questionnaire to assess suitability for self-administration.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 04:20 AM\nSource:[RaiNews](https://www.rainews.it/articoli/2024/09/influenza-2024-150mila-casi-a-settimana-verso-unaltra-stagione-record-56a489e4-04cb-46f6-9154-59b90f11595c.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The porcine case was detected in a small farm in Oregon and is the first case of its kind in the US. The farm has been quarantined and the animals have been slaughtered. According to experts, the fact that the case was detected in a small farm with non-commercial purposes reduces the risk of contagion and does not affect the food market. However, experts warn that the introduction of pigs into the equation could change the dynamics of the epidemic, as pigs have a respiratory system similar to humans and can be infected by both avian and human viruses. This could lead to the creation of new variants, potentially more contagious to humans. The epidemic has affected over 100 million birds, 440 farms, and at least 10,400 wild birds, and has had a significant impact on the meat and dairy industries. The H5N1 avian flu has caused at least 904 human infections and 464 deaths worldwide since 2022.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/medicina-y-salud/deteccion-gripe-aviar-cerdo-ee-uu-pesima-noticia-facilita-su-salto-a-humanos)\n\n**Russia Sees Rise in Coronavirus Hospitalizations**\nAccording to the COVID-19 operational headquarters, hospitalizations due to coronavirus infection in Russia have increased by 14.1% over the past week.

'We expect 200,000 cases per week nationwide, but it's harder to predict the peak, which is usually at the end of December, but last year it was at the end of November,' Andreoni said. He also notes that the recent temperature fluctuations in Italy will help the virus spread. 'Temperatures affect it, and the temperature fluctuations are particularly insidious because it's easier to catch a cold. When it's cold, people tend to cover themselves, but when there are temperature fluctuations, people get caught off guard by the cold and it's more frequent to catch a cold.'

The ideal time to get the flu vaccine is before flu activity starts, which typically peaks between December and February. The vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate and cause illness in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. The FDA emphasizes that the flu vaccine will not make you sick with the flu, but rather trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The FDA notes that anyone can get sick with flu, but children, people age 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with certain chronic medical conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses, 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits, 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths.

They analyzed data from 2015 to 2024 and found that there will be more than 1,600 new flu cases confirmed each day in U.S. laboratories by the end of November, nearly double the number of cases during the same time period last year. According to Hao Wang, director of the Interdisciplinary Lab for Mathematical Ecology and Epidemiology at the University of Alberta, the team predicts the initial surge of flu cases this year will come a month earlier than it did last year. Wang hopes this information will inform public health officials and make an impact on their decision-making. Junling Ma, a full professor at the University of Victoria, agrees that the model is suitable for capturing the key features of influenza and thinks it is likely to predict an earlier surge.

According to the CDC, the peak hospitalization burden for flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus is expected to be similar to or lower than last season. To boost immunization rates and reduce hospitalizations, health systems are rolling out diverse flu vaccination strategies, including free community flu shot clinics and vaccinating staff to maintain strong staffing levels. The CDC reported that flu vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among adults 18-49 to 73% among adults 65 and older during the last virus season. As stated by the CDC, the 2023-24 flu season was 'moderately severe,' with an estimated 34 million illnesses, 15 million healthcare visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths. 'Flulapalooza' events, such as the one hosted by Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are also being held to promote flu vaccination and reduce the spread of illness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2024 02:37 PM\nSource:[Becker's Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/hospitals-push-flu-shots-ahead-of-virus-season.html)\n\n**U.S. COVID update (September 29): 117,000 new cases, 1,213 new deaths**\nAccording to BNO News, the United States reported 117,284 new COVID cases and 1,213 new deaths between September 23 and September 29.

Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News Medical Contributor, attributes the rise in pediatric flu-related hospitalizations and deaths to 'vaccine skepticism' following the COVID-19 pandemic. She recommends getting the annual flu shot 'sometime before Thanksgiving, mid-November' for most children, but emphasizes that it's best to get vaccinated as soon as possible. In addition to vaccination, medical experts suggest practicing preventive methods such as avoiding sick people, covering your mouth when coughing, washing your hands, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 10:58 PM\nSource:[12 Media KXII Television](https://www.kxii.com/2024/09/29/flu-season-returns-how-help-prevent-illness)\n\n**New Grim Milestone for Flu Pediatric Deaths Set**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported one new flu-related death in a child last week, bringing the total number of U.S. pediatric deaths for the 2023-2024 season to 200, surpassing the previous high of 199 deaths reported during the 2019-2020 season. According to the CDC, approximately 80% of children who were eligible for a flu vaccine and for whom vaccination status was known were not fully vaccinated. The CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, especially children at higher risk for serious flu complications. Flu vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of flu-related medical visits by approximately two-thirds and halve the risk of flu-related hospitalization for vaccinated children.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 05:13 PM\nSource:[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2023-2024/2023-2024-flu-deaths-children-200.htm)\n\n**AstraZeneca's FluMist approval for self-administration could increase flu vaccine uptake**\nThe US FDA has approved AstraZeneca's FluMist for self-administration, increasing the accessibility of seasonal influenza vaccines. According to GlobalData, the influenza virus caused 2.1 million illnesses, 21,000 hospitalizations, and 4,700 deaths during the 2023-2024 US influenza season. Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData, said, 'FluMist is approved for use in the US in children and adults ages 2 through 49 years. It is the only seasonal influenza vaccine to be delivered intranasally, which makes it a great option for those who may be needle-phobic.' The US CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older receives a vaccination each influenza season. AstraZeneca plans to utilize a third-party online pharmacy to provide FluMist for self-administration, which is expected to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season. GlobalData's survey reveals that the percentage of patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza who were administered FluMist during the 2022-2023 season were 2.2% of children 2-4 years of age, 13.4% of children 5-17 years of age, and 3.4% of adults 18-49 years of age. Kurdach concludes, 'By increasing access to FluMist, there is potential for these percentages to increase. It is possible that we will see an increase in US patient shares of FluMist, given the convenient route of administration and ease of access, as well as an overall increase in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 05:08 AM\nSource:[Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/healthcare-astrazenecas-flumist-approval-for-self-administration-could-increase-flu-vaccine-uptake-globaldata-3623524)\n\n**As Concerns about Respiratory Diseases Among Public Drop to New Lows, US Health Officials Urge Vaccination**\nNew survey results from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) show that few US adults intend to get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19, RSV, or pneumococcal disease this fall and winter, citing concerns about vaccine side effects and a general distrust of vaccines. Only 38% of US adults say they will definitely get a flu vaccine, and 26% say they will definitely get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Health officials from NFID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized that everyone age 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine and an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to help protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. According to new CDC data, the 2023-2024 flu season in the US was moderately severe with an estimated 41 million illnesses, 490,000 hospitalizations, and 25,000 flu-related deaths. 'We can protect ourselves and those we care about by getting updated vaccines to reduce the risk of serious illness from flu and COVID-19,' said CDC Director Mandy K. Cohen, MD, MPH. 'Vaccines are not just a shield against illness—they are an important tool in our public health efforts.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 01:00 PM\nSource:[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-concerns-about-respiratory-diseases-among-public-drop-to-new-lows-us-health-officials-urge-vaccination-302258010.html)\n\n**COVID & Infections: Number of Hospitalizations Increases**\nThe number of patients with respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat, and fever has increased weekly. According to the ÖGK, 9,999 cases of grippe-like infections, 35 cases of actual flu, and 1,361 cases of COVID-19 infections have been reported, totaling 11,395 cases. This represents a 46% increase from the previous week, while overall hospitalizations in Lower Austria have increased by 9%. The ÖGK advises high-risk patients to take precautions such as regular handwashing and wearing masks to prevent infections and further transmission. They also recommend that the entire population be vaccinated against influenza, and that high-risk patients be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, the actual number of COVID-19 cases may be higher, as the virus is no longer reportable since July 2023 and fewer tests are being conducted. According to Virologist Monika Redlberger-Fritz, 34% of analyzed samples are currently positive for COVID-19, while only 11% are positive for rhinoviruses, which cause common colds and flu. The rest are attributed to influenza and other viruses. Redlberger-Fritz expects hospitalization numbers to continue rising in the coming weeks as both coronaviruses and rhinoviruses continue to spread.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 03:30 AM\nSource:[news.ORF.at](https://noe.orf.at/stories/3274476)\n\n**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Severe Season Ahead**\nThe upcoming influenza season is expected to be severe, with 150 million cases per week predicted. Experts warn that the sudden change in temperature has favored the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza. 'Today we have many children who have never been in contact with the influenza virus, which can circulate more quickly. The problem is that if more people become infected, the number of deaths and severe cases could be high among the elderly and vulnerable,' says epidemiologist Gianni Rezza. To mitigate this, Rezza suggests increasing the vaccination rate against influenza. In Australia, the previous season was the second worst in the past 10 years due to the A/H3N2 variant. In Italy, 14.5 million cases of influenza-like illnesses were reported last year, and this year's numbers are expected to be similar or higher. The US FDA has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine, a nasal spray, for people aged 2-49. The vaccine is available online and can be administered at home after completing a questionnaire to assess suitability for self-administration.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 04:20 AM\nSource:[RaiNews](https://www.rainews.it/articoli/2024/09/influenza-2024-150mila-casi-a-settimana-verso-unaltra-stagione-record-56a489e4-04cb-46f6-9154-59b90f11595c.html)\n\n**Influenza 2024: Bassetti Warns of 'Challenging' Season with 20 Million Expected Cases**\nMatteo Bassetti, an infectious disease specialist at San Martino Hospital in Genoa, predicts that the 2024 influenza season will be 'challenging', possibly worse than the previous year. He notes that in Australia, where vaccination rates are high, the situation is 'even worse than 2023'. In Italy, where less than 1 in 5 people are vaccinated against the flu, Bassetti warns that the consequences of not vaccinating will be severe, including overcrowding in hospitals and emergency rooms. He estimates that 20 million Italians may contract the flu this year, compared to 15 million last year. Bassetti advises people to get vaccinated between late September and late October, as the first cases are likely to appear in mid-November. 'We are used to blaming the healthcare system, but in this case, the responsibility also lies with the citizens who refuse to get vaccinated, even though it is free and available in pharmacies or from their family doctor.' \nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 05:24 PM\nSource:[Quotidiano Nazionale](https://www.quotidiano.net/cronaca/influenza-settembre-2024-bassetti-previsioni-y6um7oml)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

It's about to drive a wave of new startups.**\nThe high-stakes AI lab landscape is fragmenting due to ego clashes, commercial pressures, and personal values. Researchers are leaving large labs to form new startups, attracting significant investments from VCs. For example, Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence raised $1 billion, while Black Forest Labs and H secured $100 million and $220 million respectively. According to PitchBook, startups building foundational models have raised a record $22.9 billion in VC funding so far in 2024. The trend is expected to continue, with more AI labs fragmenting and new startups emerging. Noel Hurley, ex-VP at Arm, attributes this phenomenon to 'ego-driven' researchers who are 'told they're brilliant' and encouraged by the VC community. Nathan Benaich, founder of Air Street Capital, notes that researchers may want to take their work in different directions, leading to a 'cracked team' that can achieve more with fewer people.

The bill, which aimed to require safety testing for powerful AI models, was seen as a 'first-of-its-kind legislation' by some, but Newsom argued it was too broad and didn't take into account the specific risks of AI deployment. Kaili Lambe, policy and advocacy director for Accountable Tech, expressed concern that regulation often moves slowly while technology advances rapidly. Landon Klein, director of U.S. policy for the Future of Life Institute, agreed that timely regulation is necessary to prevent risks associated with AI. Newsom has proposed partnering with industry experts to develop guardrails for AI, but some experts, such as Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information and Innovation Foundation, argue that more evidence is needed before placing guardrails on the tech.

The bill, proposed by Democratic State Senator Scott Wiener, included measures such as mandatory security tests for models with a cost of over $100 million and 'emergency stop buttons' to shut down models in emergency situations. Newsom argued that the bill's strict requirements were overly restrictive, even for models used in low-risk scenarios. However, this reasoning ignores the broader consequences of unregulated AI. AI security should not be treated as an afterthought or an optional consideration for economic growth. AI is a powerful technology that can cause significant harm if mismanaged, and the state's responsibility is to set a high standard for development. The veto of SB 1047 shows that California missed an opportunity to take a leadership role in AI governance at a critical time. Newsom's veto decision has implications beyond California, as it sends a signal that the US may be hesitant to implement strict AI security standards. This undermines the country's ability to lead in global AI governance. The failure of the bill also weakens international coordination on AI security. SB 1047 could have complemented federal efforts, such as the 'Safe and Reliable Artificial Intelligence Development and Use' executive order issued by the federal government in 2023, by providing a framework for consistency between state and federal regulations. The veto also undermines the need for proactive, implementable security measures. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, the need for such measures will only grow. California could have taken a leading role in establishing comprehensive AI security standards and serving as an example to the rest of the country and the world. Instead, the veto leaves a regulatory gap that could allow untested and potentially harmful technologies to spread unchecked.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: October 01, 2024 04:16 AM\nSource:[Haber3com](https://www.haber3.com/kose-yazisi/kaliforniyanin-yapay-zeka-guvenligi-konusundaki-kacirdigi-firsat-newsomun-vetosunun-sonucla/6203380)\n\n**California's AI safety bill sparks heated debate as decision deadline nears**\nCalifornia's Senate Bill (SB) 1047, the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, has sparked a heated debate among tech companies, politicians, and the entertainment industry. The bill, which requires large AI models to undergo safety tests before public release, has both supporters and critics. Supporters, including the National Organization for Women and the Future of Life Institute, argue that the bill is necessary to mitigate potential AI risks. However, tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, as well as various tech industry associations, oppose the bill, citing concerns about the potential burden of safety requirements on model developers.

It has 49,000 processors and can process data at a speed of over 100,000 laptops working simultaneously. According to Bronson Messer, director of science at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Frontier consumes up to 27 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 10,000 homes. The supercomputer has been used for various research projects, including studies on subatomic particles, galaxies, and the development of new medicines. It has also been used to create large language models (LLM) for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In 2023, the Frontier had 1,744 users from 18 countries, and it is expected that at least 500 scientific articles will be published based on its calculations in 2024. The supercomputer's main component is housed in a room the size of a warehouse, with 74 racks containing 9,408 nodes, each with four graphics processing units (GPU) and a central processing unit (CPU). The system is continuously evaluated by a team of engineers to detect any problems. To use the Frontier, scientists must personalize their code to use it efficiently, and only 25% of proposals are approved. The supercomputer is expected to be surpassed by the Aurora, located in the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, which is expected to enter operation by the end of 2024.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 09:40 AM\nSource:[La Tercera](https://www.latercera.com/tendencias/noticia/como-es-el-supercomputador-mas-rapido-del-mundo-y-cuales-son-sus-funciones/TJH4PJFJONE65EAEGRVTYXC3NU)\n\n**Why Some Are Predicting That Governor Newsom Is Going To Veto That AI ‘Existential Risk' Bill Pending In California**\nCalifornia Governor Newsom is deciding whether to sign or veto the 'Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act' (SB 1047), a bill aimed at regulating AI.

The US, EU, and individual states are all working to establish limits on AI, but the patchwork of regulations makes it challenging for security leaders to stay on top of the requirements. The US is pushing for an international consensus on AI, while the EU is advancing its own legislation on 'worldwide rules' concerning AI. However, there are still areas of fuzziness in AI rules, particularly in the EU's efforts to categorize high- and low-risk systems. Mike Price, chief technology officer at ZeroFox, emphasized the need for a strategy that protects against potential misuse and promotes the development of a stronger and more sustainable global AI ecosystem. He also highlighted the importance of education around AI, as current capabilities favor bad actors and leave the uneducated vulnerable to attack. The US is also experiencing a fragmented nature of AI regulation, with individual states deriving their own regulations and putting in place their guard rails. California's legislation, the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, is a notable example, mandating safety testing and empowering the attorney general to take companies to task if their AI creates a threat.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:30 AM\nSource:[CSO Online](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3535621/clear-as-mud-global-rules-around-ai-are-starting-to-take-shape-but-remain-a-little-fuzzy.html)\n\n**Will California pass an AI law that is dividing Silicon Valley?**\nCalifornia's Governor Gavin Newsom has until September 30th to decide whether to sign a Bill regulating artificial intelligence (AI), which has divided Silicon Valley. The Bill, known as the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Systems Act, aims to require developers of large AI models to perform basic safety testing, assess potential risks, and implement reasonable safeguards. Critics argue that the Bill would hobble early-stage companies and open-source developers, while proponents say it is necessary to prevent harm and ensure accountability. The Bill would apply to companies doing business in California, regardless of their location, and would introduce civil penalties of up to 10% of the cost of training a model for developers whose tools cause harm. Supporters, including actor's union SAG-AFTRA and women's groups, have expressed qualified support for the Bill, while opponents, including OpenAI and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, have warned that it would stifle innovation and lead to a brain drain in California. 'The big AI companies which have been the most vocal on this issue are currently locked in their race for market share and profit maximisation, which can lead to cutting corners when it comes to safety, and that's why we need some rules for those leading this race,' said Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal.

Summit, which was the world's most powerful supercomputer in 2018, has been surpassed by newer technologies and now ranks ninth globally. Its successor, Frontier, has claimed the title of the world's first exascale supercomputer and significantly outpaces Summit's computational power. ORNL has not confirmed whether it would consider selling Summit, but acquiring the supercomputer could be an attractive opportunity for those with the financial resources. The supercomputing landscape has evolved massively since Summit's debut, with the rise of AI-driven data centers increasing demand on energy resources. Frontier is both the world's fastest and most energy-efficient supercomputer, but ORNL is planning a successor, named Discovery, which is set to debut by 2028. 'Summit has played a key role in over 100 research projects, including contributions to the National AI Research Resource initiative,' said ORNL, as they bid farewell to the supercomputer. 'There is certainly a precedent for such systems being sold,' said ORNL, referencing the sale of the Cheyenne supercomputer for $480,085.

The summit produced the Bletchley Declaration on AI safety and commissioned a 'State of the Science' report to assess the present and potential future risks, opportunities, and capabilities of general-purpose AI. The report highlights the need for broader global cooperation in defining AI risks and developing robust mitigation solutions. It also emphasizes the importance of equitable inclusion of diverse perspectives, particularly from the Global South, to contend with the risks and harms from AI and democratize the benefits of these systems. The report notes that harmful bias and underrepresentation in AI systems have been challenges since before the current AI boom and will likely persist for the foreseeable future. It also warns that the global AI divide, where frontier AI research and development primarily occurs in Western countries, will exacerbate inequalities between nations. The report concludes that the capabilities of general-purpose AI are advancing rapidly, but there is limited understanding of the capabilities and inner workings of these systems, especially as they are suited to generate external harms. Experts disagree on the expected pace of future progress of general-purpose AI capabilities, and several technical methods can help to mitigate risks, though all current methods have limitations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2024 06:58 PM\nSource:[The Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/examining-advanced-ai-capabilities-and-risks)\n\n**US proposes reporting mandates for AI developers, cloud providers**\nThe US Commerce Department is proposing a reporting requirement for leading AI developers and cloud providers to evaluate their technology's safety and defense capabilities.
