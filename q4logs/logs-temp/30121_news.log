**Goodbye Beige and Terracotta: The Top Color Trends for 2025**
This autumn-winter 2024-2025, the color is bold and unapologetic. Gone are the days of the grey and industrial aesthetic of the 2000s, and the neutral chromatic palette that came with it. According to decorator Juliana de Giacomi, 'Before, people seemed to be afraid of color, it was shunned. We stuck to a minimalist, Pinterest-inspired home, and it was almost sterile.' The new color trends for 2025 are bold and vibrant, but not so overwhelming that they cause eye strain. Think sophisticated dark red, warm brown, and buttery yellow. The beige and terracotta of the past are being replaced by the grey pigeon, burnt orange, and caramel brown. These new colors are perfect for creating a feel-good atmosphere, and can be incorporated into your space through accent walls, accessories, or furniture.

**The colour palette for 2025 – these are the shades paint experts say we’ll see everywhere next year**
The colour palette for 2025 has been announced by major paint brands, and it's all about darker, autumnal shades paired with occasional pops of lightness. Mandy Rippon, product manager at Frenchic Paint, says 'There is currently an eclectic mix of colours of the year and paint palette predictions for emerging colour trends... In 2025, we will see neutrals getting warmer and earthier and deeply serene, nature-inspired colours continuing to grow in popularity.' Earthy tones are set to dominate, with rich jewel shades like purple and brown leading the way. Lick's colour palette for 2025 includes both dark jewel tones and earthy tones, as does Benjamin Moore's colour palette accompanying its COTY of 2025, Cinnamon Slate. Dulux's colour of the year for 2025, True Joy, is a vibrant, sunny yellow that can be used as an accent colour or as part of a wider colour scheme. 'Whilst yellow is one of the bolder colours on the spectrum, True Joy is complementary to a vast range of palettes, it brings out the positivity in even the most neutral of shades and is the figurative glue that binds more daring colour stories together,' says Marianne Shillingford, creative director and colour expert at Dulux. The cultural mood for 2025 is nostalgia, which has trickled down into interiors, impacting how we decorate our homes. Lick's colour palette of 2025 features eight different shades that decorators would be familiar with, that would encapsulate that feeling of nostalgia and inspire decorators to think about the colours of their childhood.

Other key colors for winter 2025 include bright red, sapphire, emerald green, and violet, which can be incorporated into various silhouettes, from chunky sweaters to boho gowns.

**Colors and Styles for Good Luck in 2025: A Guide to the Year of the Wooden Snake**
According to astrologers and feng shui experts, the colors and styles that will bring good luck and prosperity in 2025 are green, yellow, beryl, and metallic tones. Green is the main color of the year, symbolizing nature, renewal, and harmony. Yellow represents the sun and prosperity, while beryl promotes creativity and balance. Metallic tones, such as gold and bronze, will attract wealth and luxury. On the other hand, dark blue and black should be avoided as they may conflict with the energy of the Wooden Snake and create tension. For women, the recommended styles include evening dresses in velvet, silk, or satin, and combinations of wide pants with bright decorative elements. For men, the suggested styles include suits in green, bordeaux, or gray tones, paired with bright shirts or cardigans. Each zodiac sign has its own unique colors and styles that will bring good luck and prosperity in 2025.

**It's Official -- These 8 Beauty Trends Are About to Dominate Spring/Summer 2025**
The Spring/Summer 2025 beauty trends are dominated by blue eyeshadow, optimistic pastel tones, and bold lip colors. Blue eyeshadow, a throwback to the '70s and Y2K era, is a key trend, with frosted blue and electric blue shades making an appearance on the runways. Pastel tones, including bright pink and spring green, are also prominent, often paired with a grungy, smudged look. Bold lip colors, including lacquered cherry reds, are also trending, with designers like Chanel and Moschino showcasing the look. Additionally, the 'clean girl' aesthetic, characterized by a bare-faced look with minimal makeup, is still going strong. Hair trends include sleek, polished styles, such as slicked-back crops and buns, as well as retro silhouettes and sculpted shapes. 'In France, after red lipstick, our favourite lip look is called 'bouche mordue' (just bitten lips),' says Violette Serrat, founder of Violette Fr. 'To achieve it, we apply lip balm, a touch of lipstick, then kiss a tissue to remove excess shine so it looks more like our naked lips.'

According to Pantone, the colour of the year for 2024 is Peach Fuzz, a light and optimistic pink shade.

**Pantone 2025: Future Dusk, a New Palette for the Future of Fashion**
The fashion world is eagerly awaiting the announcement of Pantone's 2025 color, a trend that will set the tone for upcoming collections and styles worldwide. Although Pantone has not officially announced the color, rumors and predictions are circulating among experts, with one of the tones that sounds strong being Future Dusk, a shade that combines blue and purple, evoking the serenity and freshness of cloudy landscapes. This color projects calmness and tranquility, and its versatility will allow it to be the protagonist in both daytime and nighttime looks, depending on how it is combined with other tones and textures. Future Dusk recalls the Very Peri of 2022, but with a greater inclination towards blue, making it colder and more serious. It is an elegant and contemporary option that adapts to a wide range of styles and occasions. The article also mentions previous Pantone colors, including Ultimate Gray and Illuminating (2021), Very Peri (2022), Viva Magenta (2023), and Peach Pink (2024). For 2025, the color is expected to be widely used in formal suits and dresses, elegant shirts, and accessories, and will be a great option for those looking for a refined and timeless look.

**5 Paint Colors Going Out of Style in 2025 — And What You Should Replace Them With Before Then**
Interior designers have identified five paint colors that are going out of style in 2025: gray, pure white, green, blue, and beige. They recommend replacing these colors with softer alternatives, such as soft yellow, off-white, aubergine, violet, and terracotta. According to Martha Franco, 'Grays can feel cold and impersonal, not conveying warmth and welcoming spaces.' Helen Shaw suggests replacing gray with 'Summerdale Gold HC-17', a warm and earthy color. Josephine du Rietz predicts that white will be replaced with bolder colors, such as burgundy. Peter Spalding suggests that green kitchens will be 'absolutely dead' and recommends aubergine as a replacement. The designers also advise against using blue, suggesting that rich jewel tones or lilac/violet tones can add depth and sophistication. Finally, they recommend replacing beige with earthy tones, such as terracotta, which can add character and warmth to a space.

**Festifolies 2025: A Colorful Celebration Takes Shape**
The Festifolies 2025, a celebration of the Saint-Aignan-de-Grandlieu neighborhood, is taking shape. A year before the 5th edition, a festive picnic was held to unveil the theme: colors. The event was attended by around 50 people, including new and returning participants. They discovered the theme and the mascot, Festy, who was officially named. The participants were also informed about the parade, which will be the highlight of the event. Teams will be formed, and each team will be assigned a color by drawing lots. They will receive a package with flags, plates, cups, tables, chairs, and invitations to organize a neighborhood picnic with their assigned color. The goal is to create a colorful parade with teams dressed in their assigned colors, as explained by Valérie Lieppe, deputy mayor. Some teams have already formed, and the first colors were drawn: La Jaune'drôlerie (yellow) for La Gendronnerie, Les écrevisses (red) for La route du Lac and La rue des Martins-Pêcheurs, and Les Douze Prés (violet) for Le quartier des Douze Traits. More colors are still to be drawn, and interested parties can contact Laetitia Duret at 02 40 26 44 41 or 06 86 97 25 99.

According to Bruna Galliano, director of creative and color consultant at Suvinil, 'In a complex and multiple time, a single color would not be able to summarize the feeling of the time.

The company also released a palette with 22 tones, divided into five palettes: resistance, regeneration, nostalgia, hybridism, and optimism. Meanwhile, the Coral brand has chosen Curry Dourado (a warm and full-of-life yellow) as the color of 2025, which is part of the 'Destemida' palette, along with 'Artesanal' and 'Ancestralidade' palettes.

**PPG Announces Purple Basil as Color of the Year 2025**
PPG has announced Purple Basil (PPG1046-7) as its Color of the Year 2025, a rich and soothing dusty violet with mauve undertones. The color reflects the trend towards movement and change, evident in everything from fashion to interior design. According to Vanessa Peterson, PPG Global Color Styling Lead, Consumer Products, Industrial Coatings, 'The consumers are embracing an unprecedented era of newness, and movement is a clear global theme that is shaping design trends across various industries.' The 'Kinetic' color theme for 2025, which includes four different color palettes, 'spells out the need for self-reliance in a fast-paced world, highlighting the interplay between nature and science that drives innovation, as well as the influence of new tools like artificial intelligence that foster boundless creativity.' Purple Basil is a sophisticated and elegant color that works well in both traditional and more unconventional applications. As a violet, it is warm enough to be inviting but cool enough to create a mysterious atmosphere. The tension between its blue and red properties gives it a kinetic energy that complements the 40 color tone pairs in the four color palettes of 2025 from PPG: Extra Celestial, Bio-Fuse, Artificial, and Earth and Archive. 'It is a time of change with endless new possibilities that we can't even imagine, driven by new tools that foster human creativity,' said Peterson. 'Consumers are embracing this time of change and movement, and we see that the color trends reflect the demand for dynamic colors that go beyond soft, more banal, and safe color choices and instead prefer rich jewel tones, deeper earthy pastels, and mid-tones inspired by ancestors.'

**Glidden's 2025 Color of the Year Makes Purple Shockingly Approachable**
Glidden by PPG has announced its 2025 Color of the Year, Purple Basil, a warm and lush violet shade that is both bold and neutral. According to Ashley McCollum, PPG color expert for the Glidden brand, consumers are increasingly selecting colors that bring them joy and are less concerned with what others think. The color selection follows the trend of mixing multiple styles and echoes the current interior design trends of reimagining traditional style, adding touches of quiet luxury, and hinting at nostalgia. Purple Basil can be used in various ways, such as on front doors, office or study walls, bathroom and kitchen cabinets, or as a bold accent color in a formal dining room. McCollum notes that consumers are ready to dive into the world of bold color and are willing to stray from neutrals like gray and off-white. 'Consumers are unapologetically selecting colors that are bringing them joy,' McCollum says. 'You spend so much time in your space, so why default to a neutral when you can make your space feel exactly the way you want for yourself and your family?'

**Paula Echevarría and Violeta Mangriñán Show Us How to Combine White in Autumn**
Paula Echevarría and Violeta Mangriñán, the 'Pantene hair' girls, have shown us how to combine white color in autumn. They have demonstrated that white is not just for summer, but can be a stylish choice for the autumn-winter season 2024/2025. The looks are as white as the clouds in the sky, perfect for elegant queens of the snow. Abandoning linen and cotton, white pants have become the favorite for winter. They can be paired with cream tones, but also with bolder tones. Violeta has shown that you can even combine white with a golden sequined skirt. According to the stars of the Street Style of the Copenhagen Fashion Week, the formula is reliable: wear white from head to toe. This is a classic choice that can be combined with the latest trends of the season. As Paula Echevarría said, 'Gorof is a great brand that combines elegance and irreverence.' She has chosen the Argentine designer's brand for her outfit, a white top with a palazzo pant, both in white. 'I am one of the first celebrities to wear Gorof in Spain,' she added. 'It's a great opportunity to showcase the brand's style.'
