**Australian Recorded Flu Cases the Highest on Record**
Australia has recorded the highest number of influenza cases since national surveillance records began, with 352,782 laboratory-confirmed flu cases in 2024. This surpasses the previous peak of 313,454 cases in 2019. New South Wales (NSW) has recorded the highest number of influenza cases in 2024, with 157,620 laboratory-recorded notifications. Despite the high number of cases, nearly 8.8 million Australians have taken the flu vaccine between March 1 and Oct. 6, with vaccination rates highest in NSW, followed by Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia. However, a survey found that only 27 percent of parents answered 'yes' when asked if their child was vaccinated against the flu in 2024, down from 31 percent in Sept. 2023.

**Kyiv Sees Increase in Hospitalizations Due to COVID-19, Influenza, and ARVI**
In Kyiv, 9433 new cases of influenza, acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI), and COVID-19 were registered in the last week. Although the overall incidence rate has decreased by 25.9% among both adults and children, the number of hospitalizations has increased. According to the Kyiv City Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases, 5855 cases of ARVI were detected in children, down from 8026 in the previous week (a decrease of 27%). The incidence rate among adults decreased from 4699 to 3578. However, the number of hospitalized patients with influenza and ARVI increased, with 157 people, including 122 children, being hospitalized. 'Additionally, 90 people were infected with COVID-19, including 4 children under 17 years old. 15 people were hospitalized, including 3 children. One adult patient is in the intensive care unit. No deaths from COVID-19 and influenza complications were reported during the reporting period,' said the statement. The current incidence rate in Kyiv is 2.5 times lower than the epidemic threshold. The authorities reminded Ukrainians that vaccination is the most reliable protection against severe COVID-19 progression.

**Who Should Get Vaccinated Against Flu and Corona Now?**
As the risk of infections increases in the fall, vaccinations against flu and Corona are becoming more important, especially for high-risk groups. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), 'the best available protection against influenza is a vaccination.' The Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO) recommends an annual flu vaccination and a Corona booster shot for certain groups. These include people over 60, pregnant women, chronically ill individuals such as diabetics, people with high blood pressure, and immunocompromised individuals. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary from year to year, ranging from 20 to 60 percent, with older adults experiencing around 40 percent protection. The STIKO also recommends an annual Corona booster shot for individuals with a high risk of severe disease, including those over 60, people with underlying conditions such as asthma, COPD, and heart disease, and healthcare workers with direct patient contact. Studies have shown that this protection lasts for at least 12 months, making a booster shot in the fall particularly important for high-risk groups. The optimal time for flu vaccination is between October and mid-December, but a later vaccination is also recommended if the flu season has not yet begun. The Corona vaccination should also be administered in the fall to ensure protection during the infection season. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in advising patients on individual vaccination recommendations, taking into account the current flu season and individual risks and needs.

**Flu-Linked Hospitalization Rates Vary Across Seasons, Highest in Adults 65 Years and Older**
According to research published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, influenza-associated hospitalization rates varied significantly across seasons, with the highest rates in adults 65 years and older. The hospitalization rates ranged from 8.7 to 102.9 per 100,000 population before the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate was 0.8 for 2020-2021, but returned to recent pre-pandemic levels in 2022-2023. The researchers found that adults 65 years and older consistently had the highest hospitalization rate, followed by children aged 0 to 4 years in most seasons. The prevalence of underlying medical conditions increased with age, ranging from 36.9% to 95.4% for children and adults 65 years and older, respectively. Antiviral use decreased from 90.2% in 2018-2019 to 79.1% in 2022-2023, especially among children and adolescents. As Angelle Naquin, MPH, from the CDC, notes, 'Each of these findings are of public health importance on their own but collectively highlight the importance of conducting robust and adaptable annual public health surveillance for influenza-associated hospitalizations.'

**Study shows varied impact of flu in US, with up to 29,000 hospital cases in a season**
A new study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report shows the continued impact of influenza on the US healthcare system over the past 13 flu seasons. The study analyzed data from the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) database, which collected information on laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations among Americans of all ages from 2010-11 to 2022-23. The study found that the number of hospital cases ranged from a low of 2,415 cases during 2011-12 to a high of 29,695 during 2017-18. Adults 65 years and older had the highest flu-related hospitalization rate across all age-groups, followed by children ages 0 to 4 years. The study also found that the proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit ranged from 14.1% during 2021-22 to 22.3% during 2013-14, and the proportion of patients who died in the hospital ranged from 2.2% during 2021-22 to 3.5% during 2013-14. Furthermore, the study found a concerning trend of a decline in antiviral treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza, from 90% during the 2018-19 influenza season to 79% during the 2022-23 season. 'The decline in antiviral treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza from 90% during the 2018-19 influenza season to 79% during the 2022-23 season represents a concerning trend and highlights missed opportunities to prevent influenza-associated complications among those at increased risk for severe influenza complications,' the authors concluded.

**CDC Forecast Gives Dates When COVID-19 Hospitalizations Could Peak This Season**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released its latest outlook for flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) this season. According to the CDC, 'As of mid-October, overall US respiratory disease activity remained low.' However, the agency expects a winter increase in cases, with a peak in COVID-19 hospitalizations likely in late December and early January. The CDC predicts that the 2024-2025 fall and winter virus season will have a similar or lower number of combined peak hospitalizations compared to last season. Vaccination is the best line of defense against these viruses, and the CDC recommends flu and COVID-19 vaccines for everyone aged 6 months and older, and RSV vaccination for select high-risk groups. Simple measures such as hand washing, staying home when sick, and wearing a face covering in enclosed or crowded spaces can also help stop the spread of infection.

**Influenza australiana: Experts Warn of 200,000 Cases per Week, Importance of Vaccination**
The first cases of influenza australiana have been identified in Piemonte and Lombardia, but Professor Massimo Andreoni, scientific director of the Società italiana malattie infettive e tropicali, warns that it is likely to be spreading in the Lazio region and in Rome as well. 'We expect 200,000 cases per week nationwide, but it's harder to predict the peak, which is usually at the end of December, but last year it was at the end of November,' Andreoni said. He also notes that the recent temperature fluctuations in Italy will help the virus spread. 'Temperatures affect it, and the temperature fluctuations are particularly insidious because it's easier to catch a cold. When it's cold, people tend to cover themselves, but when there are temperature fluctuations, people get caught off guard by the cold and it's more frequent to catch a cold.' Andreoni also emphasizes the importance of vaccination, citing the experience of Australia, where there were 15 million cases and a significant increase in hospitalizations. 'It's essential to vaccinate now, as it takes 15 days for the vaccine to take effect.'

**Whooping cough on the rise in NJ as flu season arrives. How bad will it be?**
Whooping cough cases are on the rise in New Jersey, with 423 confirmed cases as of October 12, more than double the 176 cases at the same time last year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecast that the 2024-25 season will be similar to last season or even lower in severity, with an 80% chance that peak hospitalizations will be the same or lower nationally. New Jersey health officials are reminding residents to get their flu and COVID vaccinations, which are effective during November and December holiday gatherings and still have enough strength to last into early spring. Dr. Kaitlan Baston, the state health commissioner, said, 'These vaccines are updated to give you the best protection from serious illness, hospitalization and death.' COVID hospitalizations have decreased in recent weeks, from 500 to 600 daily in August down to 250 to 300 in October, state data shows.

**Get Your Flu Vaccine Before End of October**
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends getting the influenza vaccine by the end of October to provide solid protection during the cold and flu season. The ideal time to get the flu vaccine is before flu activity starts, which typically peaks between December and February. The vaccine targets the three influenza strains most likely to circulate and cause illness in the United States, identified by watching flu trends in the southern hemisphere. The FDA emphasizes that the flu vaccine will not make you sick with the flu, but rather trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body. The protection provided by an annual flu vaccine diminishes over time, and might be too low to prevent a person from catching the flu this season. The FDA notes that anyone can get sick with flu, but children, people age 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with certain chronic medical conditions are most at risk of developing serious complications. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses, 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits, 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 6 million influenza-related illnesses, 2.9 million influenza-associated medical visits, 65,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 3,700 influenza-associated deaths.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were 140 million cases of the flu, 12,000 hospitalizations, and 6,000 deaths. The CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided 3.5 million cases of the flu, 40,000 hospitalizations, and 2,000 deaths. 'Anyone can get sick with flu,' the FDA said. 'Typically, children and people age 65 and older are most at risk of developing serious complications from influenza.'

**H1N1 and H3N2 viruses responsible for Martinique's influenza epidemic**
The influenza epidemic in Martinique, which occurred between December 2023 and March 2024, was a period during which 280 patients with this pathology passed through the emergency room of the CHU. The impact of this epidemic was more significant than in previous seasons. At the time of the balance, two viruses were identified in Martinique this season: the H1N1 virus, followed by the H3N2 virus, both of which were in circulation. In total, 2,428 people were tested positive and 16,940 people were ill, with almost 1,300 consultations per week recorded by public health France. This is almost twice as many as the previous epidemic, which lasted for nearly 30 weeks in Martinique. SOS doctors also operated nearly 734 home consultations. In February, at the peak of the epidemic and a little after the carnival, SOS doctors performed nearly 230 visits per week. It's worth noting that in previous seasons, only emergency room visits and pediatric hospitalizations were reported to the Regional Health Agency. Since June 2023, all hospital information is systematically reported for all age groups. 25% of patients required hospitalization until March 2024. Furthermore, the surveillance system for severe cases of influenza admitted to the CHU of Martinique's intensive care unit allowed for the identification of 18 cases from late December 2023 to February 2024. 3 deaths are to be deplored. In total, 280 patients with influenza were admitted to the emergency room in Martinique and 71 people had to be hospitalized.

**The Flu Vaccine Might Be Less Effective This Year**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the influenza vaccine being used this flu season may be less effective than last year's vaccine, based on data from five South American countries. The vaccine reduced hospitalization risk by 35% in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, compared to 51.9% effectiveness last year. The CDC notes that the vaccine's effectiveness 'might be similar in the Northern Hemisphere' if similar flu viruses circulate. This year's flu vaccines in the US will target the H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B (Victoria) strains, and health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccination. According to the CDC, an estimated 75 million people in the US got the flu between October 2023 and April 2024, resulting in 900,000 hospitalizations and between 17,000 and 100,000 deaths.

**COVID-19 Weekly Report: 35 Deaths and 672 New Hospital Admissions Recorded - ProtoThema English**
The latest COVID-19 report from the Health and Human Services (HHS) indicates a concerning rise in cases. During the week of September 23 to September 29, 2024, there were 35 deaths, 672 new hospital admissions, and 23 intubations due to the virus. The COVID-19 positivity rate has increased in all tested samples compared to the previous week. The recent rise in hospital admissions is noteworthy, with 672 new admissions reported, an increase from the weekly average of 593 over the past four weeks. The ECDC identified the KP.3 sub-variant of BA.2.86 as a strain of interest, but fortunately, these variants have not been associated with an increased risk of severe disease. Public health officials recommend that vulnerable populations adhere to preventative measures against respiratory infections and seek medical advice promptly if symptoms arise. Positivity rates for influenza remain very low, with no new severe influenza cases requiring ICU hospitalization or additional deaths from laboratory-confirmed influenza this week.

**Beat the flu to the punch**
James Shirley, a resident of Troy, has been taking the flu shot since 2003 and has only had the flu once. He encourages others to get vaccinated, saying, 'I would rather take the shot than take a chance on getting the flu.' The CDC estimates that between October 2023 and April 2024, as many as 75 million people in the United States got the flu, resulting in up to 900,000 hospitalizations and between 17,000 and 100,000 deaths. Shirley believes that getting a flu shot is the best way to stay well, saying, 'If there's a shot that will help me not be sick, I will take it.'

**Hospitals push flu shots ahead of virus season**
Hospitals and health systems are working to vaccinate community members and staff against influenza before the upcoming virus season. According to the CDC, the peak hospitalization burden for flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus is expected to be similar to or lower than last season. To boost immunization rates and reduce hospitalizations, health systems are rolling out diverse flu vaccination strategies, including free community flu shot clinics and vaccinating staff to maintain strong staffing levels. The CDC reported that flu vaccine coverage ranged from 37% among adults 18-49 to 73% among adults 65 and older during the last virus season. As stated by the CDC, the 2023-24 flu season was 'moderately severe,' with an estimated 34 million illnesses, 15 million healthcare visits, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 17,000 deaths. 'Flulapalooza' events, such as the one hosted by Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are also being held to promote flu vaccination and reduce the spread of illness.

**New Grim Milestone for Flu Pediatric Deaths Set**
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported one new flu-related death in a child last week, bringing the total number of U.S. pediatric deaths for the 2023-2024 season to 200, surpassing the previous high of 199 deaths reported during the 2019-2020 season. According to the CDC, approximately 80% of children who were eligible for a flu vaccine and for whom vaccination status was known were not fully vaccinated. The CDC recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, especially children at higher risk for serious flu complications. Flu vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of flu-related medical visits by approximately two-thirds and halve the risk of flu-related hospitalization for vaccinated children.

**AstraZeneca's FluMist approval for self-administration could increase flu vaccine uptake**
The US FDA has approved AstraZeneca's FluMist for self-administration, increasing the accessibility of seasonal influenza vaccines. According to GlobalData, the influenza virus caused 2.1 million illnesses, 21,000 hospitalizations, and 4,700 deaths during the 2023-2024 US influenza season. Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData, said, 'FluMist is approved for use in the US in children and adults ages 2 through 49 years. It is the only seasonal influenza vaccine to be delivered intranasally, which makes it a great option for those who may be needle-phobic.' The US CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older receives a vaccination each influenza season. AstraZeneca plans to utilize a third-party online pharmacy to provide FluMist for self-administration, which is expected to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season. GlobalData's survey reveals that the percentage of patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza who were administered FluMist during the 2022-2023 season were 2.2% of children 2-4 years of age, 13.4% of children 5-17 years of age, and 3.4% of adults 18-49 years of age. Kurdach concludes, 'By increasing access to FluMist, there is potential for these percentages to increase. It is possible that we will see an increase in US patient shares of FluMist, given the convenient route of administration and ease of access, as well as an overall increase in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake.'

**Few Americans concerned about upcoming respiratory virus season**
According to a recent survey by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), only 38% of Americans plan to get a flu shot this year, and 26% plan to get a COVID vaccine. Concern over COVID-19 has dropped from 34% in 2022 to 20% in 2024, and only 17% are concerned about flu. Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emphasized the importance of vaccination, saying, 'The single most important thing folks can do to protect themselves as we get into fall and winter is get vaccinated.' Despite this, many Americans remain hesitant, with 67% agreeing that annual flu vaccination is the most effective way to prevent flu-related hospitalizations and deaths, yet still refusing to get vaccinated. Vaccines have been shown to prevent thousands of hospitalizations, with the CDC estimating that flu vaccination prevented 105,000 to 240,000 hospitalizations during the 2023-24 flu season.

**As Concerns about Respiratory Diseases Among Public Drop to New Lows, US Health Officials Urge Vaccination**
New survey results from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) show that few US adults intend to get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19, RSV, or pneumococcal disease this fall and winter, citing concerns about vaccine side effects and a general distrust of vaccines. Only 38% of US adults say they will definitely get a flu vaccine, and 26% say they will definitely get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Health officials from NFID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized that everyone age 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine and an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to help protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. According to new CDC data, the 2023-2024 flu season in the US was moderately severe with an estimated 41 million illnesses, 490,000 hospitalizations, and 25,000 flu-related deaths. 'We can protect ourselves and those we care about by getting updated vaccines to reduce the risk of serious illness from flu and COVID-19,' said CDC Director Mandy K. Cohen, MD, MPH. 'Vaccines are not just a shield against illness—they are an important tool in our public health efforts.'

**COVID & Infections: Number of Hospitalizations Increases**
The number of patients with respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat, and fever has increased weekly. According to the ÖGK, 9,999 cases of grippe-like infections, 35 cases of actual flu, and 1,361 cases of COVID-19 infections have been reported, totaling 11,395 cases. This represents a 46% increase from the previous week, while overall hospitalizations in Lower Austria have increased by 9%. The ÖGK advises high-risk patients to take precautions such as regular handwashing and wearing masks to prevent infections and further transmission. They also recommend that the entire population be vaccinated against influenza, and that high-risk patients be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, the actual number of COVID-19 cases may be higher, as the virus is no longer reportable since July 2023 and fewer tests are being conducted. According to Virologist Monika Redlberger-Fritz, 34% of analyzed samples are currently positive for COVID-19, while only 11% are positive for rhinoviruses, which cause common colds and flu. The rest are attributed to influenza and other viruses. Redlberger-Fritz expects hospitalization numbers to continue rising in the coming weeks as both coronaviruses and rhinoviruses continue to spread.

**Influenza 2024: Experts Warn of Severe Season Ahead**
The upcoming influenza season is expected to be severe, with 150 million cases per week predicted. Experts warn that the sudden change in temperature has favored the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza. 'Today we have many children who have never been in contact with the influenza virus, which can circulate more quickly. The problem is that if more people become infected, the number of deaths and severe cases could be high among the elderly and vulnerable,' says epidemiologist Gianni Rezza. To mitigate this, Rezza suggests increasing the vaccination rate against influenza. In Australia, the previous season was the second worst in the past 10 years due to the A/H3N2 variant. In Italy, 14.5 million cases of influenza-like illnesses were reported last year, and this year's numbers are expected to be similar or higher. The US FDA has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine, a nasal spray, for people aged 2-49. The vaccine is available online and can be administered at home after completing a questionnaire to assess suitability for self-administration.
