**Helldivers 2’s DSS storyline is starting to get stale as players just want the goods**
Helldivers 2 players are growing tired of the ongoing storyline for the Democracy Space Station (DSS), feeling that it's taking too long and offering little reward. Despite the construction of the DSS being complete in-universe, new Major Orders continue to pop up, leading to player disinterest. Some players have expressed frustration on Reddit, stating that Arrowhead is 'milking the arc' and using a 'carrot and stick' approach to keep players engaged. However, the game has introduced new content, such as new weapons, enemies, and storylines, to keep players engaged. Players are simply looking for something new to focus on, rather than the ongoing DSS storyline.

**After Helldiver 2's latest Major Order win, it looks like Super Earth is setting up its own Terminid version of Jurassic Park**
Helldivers 2 has successfully completed another Major Order, creating a protective border around Acamar IV and paving the way for Super Earth's 'Termind Research Preserve.' However, the Preserve's plan to contain alien bugs using electrical fencing and nuclear bombardments raises concerns. High Command's note claims that 'past lessons learned from the failure of the Terminid Farms have been applied,' but the plan to build a 'Tyranny Park' for civilians to see the creatures up close is worrying. The park's goal is to 'deepen our citizen's understanding of the horrors of Tyranny,' but it's a recipe for disaster. The victory will also allow the construction of the DSS to continue on-schedule.

**Black Myth Wukong Snubbed from Golden Joystick Awards' Game of the Year Category**
Black Myth Wukong, a highly anticipated game, has broken numerous records and is still played by an average of 300,000 players on Steam two months after its release. Despite expectations of winning the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards, the game has not been nominated for the Golden Joystick Awards' Game of the Year category. The voting for the Golden Joystick Awards 2024 has begun, with 20 categories in total, but Black Myth Wukong is not listed among the nominees for Best Game on Home Consoles. Many players have expressed disappointment and frustration on social media, with some accusing the awards of being rigged due to political bias against Chinese games. They claim that Wukong received unnecessary hate and low ratings due to a lack of 'diversity and inclusivity', which is why its nomination was expected.

**Helldivers 2 Shouldn’t Win Game of the Year Because We Can’t Let Sony Get Away With It**
Helldivers 2 has been a popular game in 2024, but its developer, Arrowhead, and publisher, Sony, have made several mistakes that have led to a significant player drop-off and community backlash. Despite a recent update that brought back some players, the game's troubles are far from over. Allowing Helldivers 2 to win Game of the Year would send the wrong message to the gaming community and enable companies to overlook player needs. Sony's handling of the game, including its decision to require a PlayStation Network account for Steam players, has been sloppy and has highlighted the company's disconnect with its player community. 'It would suggest that companies can get away with launching unfinished or poorly managed games and still receive accolades based on initial success,' said the author. 'Sony's heavy-handed tactics are a reminder that platform holders must be held accountable for how they treat their players.'

**Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 and Helldivers 2 Are Two Sides of the Same Coin**
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 and Helldivers 2 are two co-op horde shooters released in 2024, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Space Marine 2 offers a power fantasy with boss battles, gory combat, and superhuman playable characters, as well as several progression systems and customization options. In contrast, Helldivers 2 is a more chaotic co-op experience with a focus on teamwork and a variety of planets, enemies, and objectives. While Space Marine 2's gameplay loop is more repetitive, its character and weapon progression systems are more complex and rewarding. Additionally, Space Marine 2 has a PvP game mode and an offline mode, making it more accessible to solo players. However, its repetitiveness is addressed by a 2024-2025 roadmap that will add new content, including new Operations, a new enemy type, and a new weapon. Helldivers 2, on the other hand, will continue to grow over time with new content, but its weapon-balancing problem needs to be resolved. Ultimately, both games offer unique experiences and are enjoyable in their own ways.
