**Got $5,000? These 3 Growth Stocks Are Trading Near Their 52-Week Lows. | The Motley Fool**
The Motley Fool suggests three growth stocks that are trading near their 52-week lows: Dollar General (DG), Nike (NKE), and Merck (MRK). These stocks have seen better days, but investors shouldn't count them out in the long run. Dollar General is down 43% this year due to a 'financially constrained' core customer, but it has over 20,000 stores and could scale back its business to improve profitability. Nike is struggling due to inflation and a change in leadership, but it remains a popular brand with potential for growth. Merck is undervalued at just 10 times its estimated future profits, despite a 6% decline this year. The company has been investing in research and development and pursuing acquisitions to bolster its growth prospects.

**Is MRK Stock Undervalued At $100?**
Merck's Q3 results exceeded street estimates, with revenues and earnings of $16.7 billion and $1.57 per share, respectively. The growth was driven by higher sales of Keytruda, but the company lowered its full-year earnings outlook due to a one-time charge. Despite this, analysts estimate Merck's valuation to be $130 per share, reflecting a 25% upside from its current market price of $102. The company's recent acquisitions are expected to bolster its growth in the coming years. MRK stock has underperformed the broader markets this year, but has increased its value in each of the last three years. However, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period, providing better returns with less risk.

**Is Merck Stock a Buy? | The Motley Fool**
Merck's stock may be a buy for investors with a long-term perspective. The pharmaceutical giant's cancer medicine, Keytruda, has been a major contributor to its sales, but its patent protection will lapse in 2028, leading to competition from biosimilars. While Merck has a pipeline of programs in phase 3 clinical trials, none of them have a similar addressable market to Keytruda. However, the company has a strong balance sheet with $11.3 billion in cash and $13.1 billion in trailing-12-month free cash flow, allowing it to invest in R&D and potentially acquire biotechs with promising programs. As a result, Merck may be able to provide decent returns to its shareholders up to the patent expiry and beyond, making it a good purchase for investors willing to hold the stock for at least six years or more.

**Merck Stock: Slight Negative Signal at the Start of the Trading Day**
The Merck KGaA stock started the trading day with a slight negative signal, down 0.48% compared to yesterday. The current value is 12.51% lower than its 52-week high of €177.00. The company's market capitalization is €68.69 billion, making it the 6th largest component of the DAX index, with a 3.73% weighting. In the company's last fiscal year, which ended in December 2022, Merck reported a revenue of €22.30 billion and a profit of €4.47 billion. The company had around 62,176 employees worldwide at the end of 2022.

**Where Will Merck Be in 5 Years?**
Merck's stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024, down 2% while the broader market is up 21%. However, the company's key product, Keytruda, a cancer drug, has been the best-selling medicine in the world since last year, generating $25 billion in sales. According to estimates, Keytruda's sales will continue to grow until 2028, when it will hit peak sales above $30 billion. However, Merck will lose patent exclusivity for Keytruda in 2028, which will lead to a decline in sales. To mitigate this, Merck is developing a subcutaneous version of Keytruda, which could extend its patent exclusivity beyond 2028. Additionally, the company has a new therapy, Winrevair, which could hit sales of $3.9 billion by 2029, and a deep pipeline with over 80 programs in phase 2 studies and over 30 in phase 3 trials. However, Merck may face a headwind from Summit Therapeutics' cancer medicine, ivonescimab, which is licensed from Akeso Biopharma.

**3 Absurdly Cheap Stocks That Pay High Dividends | The Motley Fool**
The Motley Fool recommends three absurdly cheap dividend stocks: Merck (MRK), Gilead Sciences (GILD), and Novartis (NVS). These stocks are trading at less than 15 times their expected future profits. Merck pays a 2.8% dividend yield, while Gilead Sciences pays 3.6% and Novartis pays 3.2%. Merck has been innovating and has recently received approval for a new drug, Winrevair, which could generate over $6 billion in revenue. Gilead Sciences has a stable business and has reported $1.1 billion in profit in the trailing 12 months. Novartis has strong growth prospects and is projecting sales growth of at least 5% per year through 2027. 'For long-term investors, Merck makes for an attractive investment to load up on today,' and 'Gilead can make for an underrated stock to hold for the long term, even for growth investors.'

**Merck (MRK) Advances While Market Declines: Some Information for Investors**
Merck (MRK) stock has risen to $106.64 with a +0.28% movement compared to the previous day, outperforming the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.05%. The company's stock has dropped by 8.03% in the past month, but is expected to report earnings of $1.56 per share on October 31, 2024, representing a year-over-year decline of 26.76%. Our consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $16.51 billion, up 3.43% from the year-ago period. The Zacks Rank system rates Merck as a #3 (Hold), with a Forward P/E ratio of 13.59, representing a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.88. The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry ranks in the top 12% of all industries, with a Zacks Industry Rank of 30.

**Merck Stock Down More Than 14% in 6 Months: Buy, Sell or Hold?**
Merck's MRK stock has declined 14.4% in the past six months, underperforming the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry and the S&P 500 Index. Despite this, the company boasts six blockbuster drugs, including Keytruda, which accounts for 50% of pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda's sales are gaining from rapid uptake across earlier-stage indications, and Merck is working on strategies to drive long-term growth. The company has made regulatory and clinical progress across areas like oncology, vaccines, and infectious diseases, and has executed strategic business moves like acquisitions and collaborations. However, Merck is heavily reliant on Keytruda and should look to diversify its product lineup. The company's second-largest product, Gardasil, is seeing grim sales in China. Merck's valuation appears attractive relative to the industry, and the company has a strong pipeline of new products, including Capvaxive and Winrevair, which have the potential to generate significant revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has declined, but the company is expected to drive top-line growth in the mid-to-long term. We believe the stock may be a good buy on the dip for long-term investors.

**Merck stock edges lower as CMS alters negotiating process**
Merck's stock is declining due to the US government's new process for pharmaceutical pricing negotiations, which may hurt the company's margins. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced additional steps for the second bargaining process for up to 15 new drugs, including Merck's Januvia, a diabetes medication. According to an anonymous CMS official, 'What we plan to do is have meetings with manufacturers before CMS actually sends an initial offer.' Merck's stock has broken key support levels and is in downtrend territory, with a potential fall to the mid-$80s if the $100 level is broken. The company is also facing competition for its cancer drug Keytruda from other medications.

**Merck Stock Under Pressure Ahead of Quarterly Report**
Merck KGaA, a leading company in the fields of health, life science, and performance materials, is set to release its quarterly report on November 14, 2024.

Analysts see potential in the current valuation, citing a price-to-sales ratio of 0.97 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.21 as attractive from a fundamental perspective. However, investors should keep an eye on the upcoming quarterly report and market trends, as these could impact the stock's short-term performance.

**Is Merck Stock a Buy?**
Merck's stock is considered attractive for long-term investors despite the challenges facing its top-selling medicine, Keytruda. Keytruda's sales make up about 45% of Merck's revenue, but it may face stiff competition from Summit Therapeutics' ivonescimab, which has shown better results in a phase 3 study in China. However, ivonescimab still needs to undergo U.S.-based phase 3 studies before it can challenge Keytruda in the U.S. market. Additionally, Keytruda will lose patent exclusivity in the U.S. in 2028, which could lead to a significant decline in sales. Merck plans to mitigate this by launching a subcutaneous formulation of Keytruda, which could generate up to $8 billion in revenue by 2030. The company also has a pipeline of new medicines, including Winrevair, which was approved in March. Overall, Merck's revenue is expected to grow through 2028, and the company should recover eventually and deliver solid financial results long after.

**Where Will Merck Stock Be in 5 Years? | The Motley Fool**
Merck's stock has returned 72% in the past five years, driven by the success of its Keytruda immunotherapy drug. However, the company faces uncertainty as the Keytruda patent is set to expire in 2028, forcing Merck to find a new growth driver.

The company is working to secure new indications for its existing pharmaceuticals and advance its pipeline of novel candidates. However, the emergence of biosimilars and alternative treatments poses a risk to Merck's leadership position in the PD-1 protein inhibitors category. Merck's stock is trading at a fair valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14, and investors confident in the company's management have a good reason to stay bullish on the stock.

**Where Will Merck Stock Be in 5 Years?**
Merck's stock has returned 72% in the past five years, driven by its Keytruda immunotherapy drug, which has become a global standard of care for various cancers. However, the company faces uncertainty regarding the Keytruda platform, which could lose its patent exclusivity by 2028, forcing Merck to find a new growth driver. Despite this, Merck's outlook remains constructive, with a 5-7% revenue growth forecast for 2024 and a midpoint earnings-per-share (EPS) target of $7.94 to $8.04, representing a 7% increase from the company record in 2022. The company's strategy is centered on securing new indications for its existing pharmaceuticals while advancing an extensive pipeline of novel candidates. However, there are concerns that alternative treatments could begin to take market share away from Merck sooner, and the company will need to find a replacement for Keytruda as competition from biosimilars emerges over the next decade. Despite these uncertainties, Merck's stock is trading at a fair level, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14, near a peer-group average of 15.

**Merck Stock Appears Ready To Return To June Highs (Technical Analysis) (NYSE:MRK)**
Merck stock is expected to experience a year-end rally, potentially reaching highs of $133, according to technical and sentiment indicators. The stock's recent decline in July was seen as a five-month distribution top, but analysts believe it's ready for a rebound. The chart below shows Merck's price movement since 2019, with two trend channels indicating support and resistance. The lower channel is expected to provide support for another move up, at least to $133. The Sentiment King's technical tool shows that 'too many' investors expect lower prices for Merck, which is a positive signal for higher prices. Bollinger bands also indicate strong support at $110. The long-term RSI index for Merck shows that the recent sell-off has moved the RSI down below 45, which is intermediate-term oversold levels. Analysts recommend that new investors invest half the money they intend to allocate to Merck now, and the other half if the price returns to $110 or breaks above $120.
