**Scientists Discover Youngest Exoplanet Yet, Orbiting Nearby Star**
Scientists have detected the youngest exoplanet yet discovered, orbiting a nearby star. The research, published in the journal Nature on November 21, reveals that the exoplanet, IRAS 04125+2902 b, is only 300 million years old. The team, led by Madyson Barber from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and found that the exoplanet has a 8.83-day orbital period, a radius 10.7 times that of Earth, and a mass approximately 30% that of Jupiter. The researchers believe that it may be a precursor to the super-Earths and super-Neptunes commonly found orbiting main-sequence stars. Given the young age of the star and exoplanet, the unusual misaligned disk, and their proximity to Earth, they consider this system a valuable target for studying the early stages of planetary formation.

**The 5 Lives of the Earth: Season 1, Episode 4 - The Air**
The Earth is a haven for life due to its atmosphere, which protects it from the sun's rays and regulates the climate. However, the planet was initially barren and scorching, lacking a protective atmosphere. Water emerged and 'magic' occurred. By covering 70% of the globe's surface, it allowed the appearance of the first forms of life, including cyanobacteria that produce oxygen through photosynthesis. This process led to the 'Great Oxygenation', a critical period where oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere, radically changing the air's composition. In the upper atmosphere, this event formed a new protective molecule: ozone, which acts as a solar screen and contributes to the flourishing of life.

**Nearly a Third of All Stars May Contain The Remains of Planets Like Earth**
New research suggests that nearly a third of all stars may contain the remains of planets like Earth. The study, titled 'Metal pollution in Sun-like stars from destruction of ultra-short-period planets', found that rocky planets are the source of metal pollution in Sun-like stars. The authors, Christopher E. O'Connor and Dong Lai, propose that ultra-short-period (USP) exoplanets, which orbit their stars very closely and have similar compositions to Earth, are engulfed by their stars and release metals into the star's atmosphere. The researchers developed a model to predict the number of USPs that form and the time it takes for them to become engulfed, and their results favour the low-e migration scenario where USPs are part of compact, multi-planet systems. They also predict that there should be a correlation between pollution and compact, multi-planet systems, and an anti-correlation between USP occurrence and pollution. However, they note that more study is needed to understand how Hot Jupiters, gas-giant planets that orbit very closely to their stars, might contribute to stellar pollution.

**James Webb Space Telescope Makes Groundbreaking Discoveries in Astrophysics**
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made several groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astrophysics. The telescope has been able to detect the presence of the methyl cation (CH₃⁺) in a protoplanetary disk, a discovery that was predicted in the 1970s but never detected before. This finding is significant because the methyl cation is a precursor to the formation of complex organic molecules, which are the building blocks of life. The JWST has also detected the presence of hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and propyne (C3H4) in a protoplanetary disk. Additionally, the telescope has been able to study the composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets, including the detection of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere of the exoplanet WASP-39 b and water vapor (H₂O) in the atmosphere of the exoplanet GJ 9827 d. These discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of the formation of planets and the origins of life in the universe. 'The presence of methyl cation in a protoplanetary disk is a major discovery that could help us understand the origins of life on Earth,' said Olivier Berné, an astrophysicist at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetary Science. 'The JWST has given us a new tool to study the formation of planets and the origins of life in the universe.'

**Exoplanet L 98-59 d May Have Volcanic Activity and Sulfur-Rich Atmosphere**
A team of astronomers has provided preliminary evidence that a exoplanet, L 98-59 d, located about 35 light-years from Earth, has a atmosphere rich in sulfur compounds, suggesting the presence of molten lava or volcanic activity on its surface. The exoplanet, a super-Earth, is slightly larger and more massive than Earth, and was discovered in 2019 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The team used the James Webb Space Telescope to collect the exoplanet's atmospheric transmission spectrum, which suggests the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the atmosphere. This is in contrast to the atmospheres of rocky planets in our solar system, which are rich in nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The researchers used computer models to simulate the conditions on L 98-59 d's surface, and found that the presence of molten lava or frequent volcanic activity could explain the observed atmospheric composition. If further observations support this evidence, L 98-59 d would become the smallest known exoplanet with an atmosphere, and would help us understand the properties of extreme planets and the diversity of planetary evolution in the galaxy.

**'Unique and extreme': James Webb telescope detects possible alien world bubbling over with volcanoes**
The James Webb Space Telescope has detected a possible alien world, L 98-59 d, with a sulfur-rich atmosphere, which could be indicative of a molten or volcanic surface. The exoplanet, located 35 light years away, is 1.5 times the size of Earth and is a super-Earth, slightly bigger and heavier than our planet. The presence of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) in the atmosphere suggests extreme conditions on the planet, such as tidal heating, which could lead to volcanic eruptions and oceans of magma. While the discovery is intriguing, further observations are needed to confirm the presence of these gases. This finding provides valuable insight into the diversity of planetary evolution across the galaxy and could help us understand the nature of small, rocky planets.

**NASA's Quest for 100 Million Times Fainter Exoplanets**
NASA is searching for exoplanets that are 100 million times fainter than our sun. Currently, exoplanets are mostly detected through indirect methods, including the 'transit passage' technique, which measures the decrease in light caused by the planet's passage in front of the star. These decreases provide important information about the planet's atmospheric composition and habitability. In fact, this method can even reveal the presence of gases that could be indicative of life. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Roman Coronagraph was designed to observe these faint exoplanets. The device was installed on the primary mirror of the telescope and on the space bus that will transport the telescope to orbit. Brandon Creager, the lead mechanical engineer at JPL, said, 'You can think of the Space Transporter as the observatory's skeleton, where all the parts come together.'

**Instrumentation prospects for rocky exoplanet atmospheres studies with high resolution spectroscopy - Scientific Reports**
The study of exoplanet atmospheres is crucial for understanding distant worlds beyond our solar system. High-resolution spectroscopy has empowered astronomers to detect minute features on the surface of exoplanets, including determining the velocity of winds, investigating thermal inversion layers, and unveiling critical information about orbital inclinations and rotations. The technique has also enabled the identification of molecular and atomic species within exoplanet atmospheres and detailed measurements of isotopologues. However, observing exoplanet atmospheres presents several challenges, including the alignment of the system for transit or secondary eclipse, and the planet orbital period constraining the observing cadence. High-resolution spectroscopy can improve reliability by better disentangling overlapping telluric features and concentrating spectral peaks on a few resolution elements while spreading background noise. The technique has been used to detect various molecules, including CO, HCN, TiO, and biomarkers, and map features in exoplanet atmospheres. Clouds and haze can disrupt spectral characteristics, but high-resolution spectroscopy can mitigate their effects by leveraging sensitivity to spectral line cores to probe regions situated at higher altitudes above the clouds. The study also discusses the challenges of detecting ozone () in exoplanet atmospheres, which is suggested to be a proxy of oxygen (), and the need for a spectrograph with a resolution of R=100,000 on an Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) to detect it within a 20-parsec radius. The investigation for TRAPPIST-1d could potentially be accomplished in approximately 16 to 25 years with traditional high-resolution spectrograph on three ELTs.

**ESA's Ariel Mission to Explore 1,000 Exoplanets**
The European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariel mission aims to study the atmospheres of over 1,000 exoplanets in detail. The mission, scheduled to launch in 2029, will use a telescope to analyze the atmospheres of exoplanets, including gas giants and rocky super-Earths, to understand how they form and evolve. The mission will use a technique called transit and eclipse, where the telescope observes the light from a star and measures the decrease in light when a planet passes in front of it. This method allows for the detection of small changes in light, which is crucial for understanding the composition of exoplanet atmospheres. Portugal is participating in the mission, contributing to the development of the telescope's optical system and the instrument's electronic and electrical equipment. The mission's success will provide a crucial foundation for future missions that aim to detect signs of habitability or even life on exoplanets.

**Life is Like a Box of Potential Biosignatures**
A new study has explored how the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will detect signs of life on exoplanets. The authors used theoretical models of the Earth's atmosphere from different eons to simulate observations and test the detection capabilities of HWO. They found that HWO can detect methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the Archean Eon, but not the presence of CO. However, they were able to robustly detect dinitrogen oxide (N 2 O) in the Proterozoic Eon, making it a strong biosignature candidate. The study highlights the importance of considering Earth analogs at different stages of its development and being cautious in making claims about potential detections of life. 'It's Not Just A “Phase” Mom, It's an Eon' is the phrase used to describe the different stages of Earth's development, and the authors emphasize that we should not just look for analogs to the stage of Earth we know now, but also to its earlier stages.

**Gigante cósmico: El telescopio más grande del mundo llegará a LATAM en 2030**
The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the world's largest telescope, is set to be inaugurated in Chile in 2030. This ambitious project, led by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), promises to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. With a 39.3-meter diameter mirror and cutting-edge technology, the ELT will surpass any previous limits in space observation. Luis Chavarría, ESO astronomer, compares its impact on astronomy to that of Galileo's telescope in the 17th century. The ELT will focus on studying exoplanets, particularly those in habitable zones, and will be able to detect biomarkers like oxygen and methane, which could indicate the presence of life. Michaël Marsset, ESO astronomer, notes that the ELT's size and precision will allow for detailed observations like never before, helping to answer fundamental questions about the origin of life and our existence in the universe. The ELT's location in the Atacama Desert, one of the clearest and most stable atmospheric places on Earth, will enable it to capture exceptional images thanks to its adaptive optics, which will correct distortions caused by the Earth's atmosphere. The telescope's primary mirror, composed of 798 ceramic glass segments, will allow for images five times sharper than those of the James Webb Space Telescope. The ELT and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) will transform astronomy, making Chile a global hub for advanced space exploration and research on exoplanets and galaxies.

**Scientists Choose Systems for Next Exoplanet Search Mission**
A team of international astronomers from Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, and other countries has identified groups of planets for the search for extraterrestrial life using the future Large Interferometer for Exoplanet Exploration (LIFE) space telescope. The study was published in the Research Notes of the AAS (RNAAS) journal. The LIFE project, developed by Swiss experts from the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) since 2017, consists of five space telescopes to be placed in a Lagrange point 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. LIFE will use high-resolution spectroscopy to detect potentially habitable worlds by analyzing chemical compounds in the light spectrum. The mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s or later. The researchers have compiled a list of star systems for analysis by LIFE, including single and binary stars, as they are more likely to have planets with stable orbits. Red dwarfs were excluded from the list as they produce powerful flares and deadly X-ray radiation. The second group consists of star systems located in the most suitable region of the sky for observation by LIFE. For example, if a system is aligned with the Earth's orbital plane, it will be harder to study as the Sun will interfere during part of the year. The third group consists of 'golden targets' - systems with potentially habitable planets with atmospheres and excellent observation conditions. Today, there are around ten systems in this selection, but future observations are likely to expand the list further.

**Scientists Discover New Method to Identify Habitable Exoplanets**
Scientists have discovered a new and easier way to identify habitable exoplanets by measuring the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a planet's atmosphere and comparing it to that of neighboring planets. If a reduced amount of CO2 is detected, it could be a sign of liquid water on the planet's surface. This discovery offers a solution to a problem that previously lacked a practical methodology. The CO2 in a planet's atmosphere can dissolve in oceans or be absorbed by a large biomass, such as on Earth. According to the researchers, this phenomenon suggests the presence of liquid water and could indicate that the planet has the necessary conditions to support life. Amaury Triaud, professor of exoplanetary science at the University of Birmingham, explained: 'It's relatively simple to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in a planet's atmosphere, as CO2 is a strong absorber of infrared radiation, the same phenomenon that is contributing to climate change on Earth.' By comparing CO2 levels in different planets, it is possible to identify those that could have oceans, making them more likely to support life. The presence of oxygen, a byproduct of carbon consumption by living organisms, can also be an indicator of life. Dr. Julien de Wit, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), noted that oxygen can transform into ozone, which has a detectable signature near CO2 in the atmosphere. 'Observing both gases at the same time can give us clues about habitability and the possible presence of life on that planet,' he said. This study has implications for understanding the effects of climate change on our own planet. Triaud highlighted that this method helps to compare the habitability of other planets with theoretical expectations, providing context on how CO2 levels affect habitability. As an example, he noted that although Venus and Earth are similar in size and composition, the high concentration of CO2 in Venus' atmosphere has made it inhospitable to life. This important scientific breakthrough has been published in the journal Nature Astronomy, opening new doors in space exploration and our understanding of the Earth's climate balance. The study not only offers a tool for detecting habitable planets but also for examining the environmental limits that can make a planet uninhabitable.

**The Detectability of CH4/CO2/CO and N2O Biosignatures through Reflection Spectroscopy of Terrestrial Exoplanets**
Researchers used the ExoReLℜ code to simulate the detectability of CH4, CO2, CO, and N2O in the reflected light spectrum of an Archean and Proterozoic Earth-like planet. They found that CH4 is readily detectable in an Archean atmosphere, but CO is challenging to detect for volume mixing ratios (VMR) ≤ 10%. In a Proterozoic atmosphere, N2O is detectable for VMR=10^−3 and long wavelength cutoff ≥1.4μm, but undetectable for VMR ≤10^−4. These results will be useful for designing the future Habitable Worlds Observatory and distinguishing between inhabited and lifeless planets. As Dr. [no specific Dr. mentioned in the article] said, 'The results presented here will be useful for the strategic design of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory and the components needed to potentially distinguish between inhabited and lifeless planets.'

**Webb telescope just snapped view of a distant world before it disappears**
Astronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope to capture a view of the distant exoplanet AF Lep b, which is located 88 light-years away and is expected to disappear from view due to its close proximity to its star. The telescope's coronagraph blocked 90% of the star's light, allowing for the observation of the fainter planet. The research team found that AF Lep b has a 'very active atmosphere' with strong updrafts, and detected the gas carbon monoxide. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe, and is expected to learn more about exoplanets in the coming years. 'It's not just about the planets that we know about now. It's also about the planets that we soon discover. This is foreshadowing some of the exciting work that we will see in the coming years,' said Brendan Bowler, an astronomer at The University of Texas at Austin.

**James Webb Space Telescope Captures Exoplanet AF Leporis b Before It Disappears**
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has successfully photographed the exoplanet AF Leporis b (AF Lep b) before it disappears for 10 years. The exoplanet, which is about 23 million years old, has a mass of around 3.2 times that of Jupiter and a diameter of about 1.2 months of the gas giant. According to researcher Kyle Franson, 'The AF Lep b is well within the inner boundary of being detectable. Although it is extremely sensitive, the JWST is smaller than our largest ground-based telescopes. And we are observing at longer wavelengths, which has the effect of making objects appear more diffuse. It becomes difficult to separate one source from another when they appear so close.' The exoplanet is currently about 88 light-years away from Earth and appears as a small particle in the JWST photo. The JWST was able to observe the exoplanet directly due to its coronagraph, an instrument that blocks the light from the host star to facilitate the observation of the planet. The researchers aimed to study the exoplanet's atmosphere, as planets with similar masses to our gas giants are rare. However, the observation was a race against time, as the exoplanet is currently about 8 times farther from its star than the distance between Earth and the Sun, but its orbit is approaching the star and our perspective. The coronagraph of the JWST blocks 90% of the light from the AF Lep b due to the current distance between the planet and the star. As they approach, there will be a moment when the exoplanet will no longer be visible to the JWST. 'We are really pushing the instrumentation to its limits here,' said Brendan Bowler, a member of the team and astronomer at the University of Texas in Austin. The observations revealed that the exoplanet has a very active atmosphere, with convective currents mixing elements between its upper and lower levels. Additionally, more monoxide than expected was detected around the AF Lep b. The hypothesis is that strong ascending currents are the only way to bring the gas to the upper atmosphere of the planet.

**A New Way to Detect Rocky Exoplanet Atmospheres**
A team of researchers, led by PhD student Qiao Xue from the University of Chicago, has developed a new method to detect rocky exoplanet atmospheres. The technique involves measuring the combined temperature of a star and the exoplanet just before the planet passes behind. If the temperature is lower than expected, it suggests that the planet has an atmosphere regulating its temperature. The team applied this method to the exoplanet GJ1132 b, 41 light years away, and found that it does not have an atmosphere. The study is a step towards finding Earth-like planets with atmospheres, which are key components for the development of life. As Dr. Qiao Xue noted, 'Atmospheres around Earth-like planets are key components for the development of life... The layer of gas surrounding rocky worlds insulates the planet and acts to regulate its temperature to.'

Scientists from the University of Chicago have made a revolutionary breakthrough in the search for habitable planets outside our solar system. A new method, made possible by the James Webb Space Telescope, allows for more accurate detection of atmospheres in distant rocky planets, a crucial condition for life as we know it. According to Qiao Xue, the lead researcher, 'This year, with the data from the James Webb Space Telescope, we can observe a greater number of planets and expect to identify patterns that will help us better understand how atmospheres form.' The new method, which analyzes temperature fluctuations in the planet while it orbits its star, has been shown to be more effective and simpler than previous methods. The team used this technique to examine the exoplanet GJ 1132 b, which was found to have no atmosphere, making it an unlikely candidate for life. This discovery, although it rules out the possibility of life on this planet, demonstrates the effectiveness of the new approach. The team also compared this new method with another method that measures the light filtered through the planet's atmosphere, finding that the new method is more reliable and less susceptible to errors. The discovery of atmospheres in planets outside our solar system not only allows for the elimination of uninhabitable worlds but also provides clues on how these environments form and evolve in other star systems. 'This study is exciting because I finally had the opportunity to work with rocky planets, which are the dream topic of every exoplanet scientist due to their great potential for hosting life,' concluded Xue.

**James Webb discovers a new and exotic steam world | Digital Trends**
The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered a new type of exoplanet called a 'steam world', which has an atmosphere almost entirely composed of water vapor. The planet, GJ 9827 d, is around twice the size of Earth and has a very different atmosphere from typical hydrogen and helium. According to researcher Eshan Raul, 'This is the first time we're ever seeing something like this.' The discovery was made possible by using Webb's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument, which can split light into different wavelengths to analyze the planet's atmosphere. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for investigating diverse planetary atmospheres and could lead to the detection of atmospheres on habitable exoplanets in the future.

**New Method Unveils Simpler Approach to Detecting Atmospheres on Distant Exoplanets**
Astronomers at the University of Chicago have developed a new, simpler method to detect atmospheres on rocky exoplanets, a key factor in determining their potential habitability. The research, led by Ph.D. student Qiao Xue, uses the James Webb Space Telescope to measure the temperature difference between an exoplanet's hottest side and its calculated theoretical maximum temperature. If the planet's actual temperature is lower than its theoretical maximum, it suggests the presence of an atmosphere that helps disperse heat. According to Xue, 'When we analyze a large enough data set, such as the one we'll get this year with the James Webb Space Telescope, we hope to uncover trends that will help us better understand atmosphere formation and what makes a planet habitable.' The new method is more efficient and reliable than previous techniques, and could help scientists better assess which exoplanets are most likely to support life. 'This study was exciting because I finally got to work with rocky planets, which are the dream subject of every exoplanet scientist since they hold so much potential for life,' Xue added. 'I can't wait to see what comes next.'

**Nova missão deve buscar planetas habitáveis em 2026**
Since the discovery of the first exoplanet, 51-Pegasi-b, in 1995, scientists have identified approximately 5,700 planets outside our solar system, and the list continues to grow. The PLATO (Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) mission, led by the European Space Agency (ESA), aims to find exoplanets similar to Earth orbiting stars similar to the Sun. According to Ana Heras, the mission's coordinator, 'we don't really know what they are made of, if they are terrestrial or not, if they are aquatic planets, or if they are super-Earths.' The PLATO mission will use 26 cameras to observe a vast portion of the southern hemisphere, including approximately 200,000 stars located 1,000 light-years away. The telescope will take pictures of these stars every 25 seconds for two years, allowing scientists to determine the size, mass, and age of the exoplanets with high precision. The mission's primary detection method will be the observation of planetary transits, which involves detecting small variations in the brightness of the stars, indicating that a planet has passed in front of the star. The PLATO mission is scheduled to last for four years and will be followed by the Ariel mission in 2029, which will study the atmospheres of exoplanets in detail.

**PLATO Mission to Search for Habitable Exoplanets**
The PLATO mission, set to launch in December 2026, aims to find exoplanets similar to Earth by determining their size, mass, and age with unprecedented precision. According to Ana Heras, the scientific responsible for the PLATO program at the European Space Agency (ESA), 'the detection of exoplanets is very important, but for now, we don't really know what they're made of, if they're terrestrial or not, if they're water planets, if they're super-Earths.' The mission will observe 200,000 stars in the southern hemisphere, taking pictures every 25 seconds for two years. By detecting slight variations in the brightness of the stars, the satellite will be able to determine the size, mass, and age of the exoplanets. The goal is to find exoplanets that orbit their star in about one year and are likely to be in the habitable zone, where water can exist in liquid form on their surface. Catherine Vogel, responsible for the program at Thales Alenia Space, explains, 'it's like pointing a laser on a grain of sand at a kilometer distance without moving it' for months. The mission will be followed by Ariel, another ESA satellite that will study the atmospheres of exoplanets in detail in 2029.

**NASA Detects Mysterious Atmosphere on Super-Earth 55 Cancri e**
NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has detected possible atmospheric gases around the exoplanet 55 Cancri e, also known as Janssen. The Super-Earth, which orbits a star similar to the Sun, has a diameter almost twice that of Earth and a slightly higher density. The team used the telescope to measure subtle changes in the light of the system as the planet orbits the star, allowing them to calculate the amount of infrared light coming from the planet's daytime side. The results indicate that the planet's surface is likely a bubbling ocean of magma, and that the energy is being distributed from the daytime side to the nighttime side, possibly through a rich atmosphere of volatiles. The researchers believe that the gases covering 55 Cancri e are bubbling up from the planet's interior, rather than being present since its formation. They also think that the primary atmosphere of the planet was lost long ago due to high temperatures and intense stellar radiation, and that this is a secondary atmosphere that is being replenished continuously by the ocean of magma. Although 55 Cancri e is too hot to be habitable now, the researchers believe that it could provide a unique window to study the interactions between atmospheres, surfaces, and interiors of rocky planets, and possibly offer clues about the early conditions of Earth, Venus, and Mars.
