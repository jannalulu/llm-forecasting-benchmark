Although Pluto and other dwarf planets have been found beyond Neptune's orbit, no large planet comparable to Earth or larger has been detected. The existence of 'Planet 9' or 'Planet X' remains a mystery. Indirect evidence suggests a massive planet may be responsible for peculiar orbital patterns in trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). A recent study proposes a novel approach to search for evidence of this hypothetical planet using a network of small telescopes. The method involves observing occultations, where a celestial body passes in front of a star, blocking its light. This allows astronomers to measure the object's orbit and shape. The study suggests building a network of 200 40-cm telescopes, spaced 5 km apart, to observe occultations from multiple viewpoints. Simulations indicate this system could detect approximately 1800 new TNOs in 10 years and identify Planet 9 if it exists, has a mass of at least five times that of Earth, and is within 800 astronomical units (AU) of the Sun. The estimated cost of the project is $15 million, a relatively low cost compared to other large-scale astronomical projects.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 05:00 PM\nSource:[meteored.com.ar](https://www.meteored.com.ar/noticias/ciencia/sugieren-una-novedosa-tecnica-con-cientos-de-pequenos-telescopios-para-poder-hallar-el-enigmatico-planeta.html)\n\n**New Method to Detect Planet 9: A Network of Small Telescopes**\nAstronomers have been searching for the mysterious Planet 9 for a long time. There is a suspicion that there is another planet in our solar system, but so far, there is no evidence. Scientists have now come up with a new way to detect the planet. They noticed a strange clustering of the orbits of Transneptunian Objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt objects, which could be caused by a super-Earth at the edge of our solar system. If this is the case, the planet could have a mass of five times that of Earth, at a distance of ten times that of Neptune. To find the planet, astronomers propose to use a network of 200 small telescopes, each with a diameter of 40 cm, spaced 5 kilometers apart. This would allow them to measure the orbits and dimensions of TNOs with high accuracy. They estimate that during a 10-year study, around 1800 new TNOs could be discovered. Simulations show that this system could provide clear evidence of an object with a mass of five times that of Earth within 800 AU of the Sun. Even if Planet X does not exist, the project could greatly increase our knowledge of the distant solar system and help us understand how sunlight affects the orbits of small objects in the solar system.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 10:02 AM\nSource:[scientias.nl](https://scientias.nl/dit-is-waarschijnlijk-de-beste-manier-om-planeet-9-op-te-sporen/)\n\n**The best way to find planet nine might be hundreds of tiny telescopes**\nAstronomers have been searching for 'Planet X', a hypothetical planet on the outer edge of the solar system, but have found no evidence. However, some research suggests that there may be an odd bit of orbital clustering among Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), which could be caused by a super-Earth. A new paper proposes a novel way to gather evidence of Planet X using an occultation array of 200 40-cm telescopes spaced 5 kilometers apart. This array would allow astronomers to map the orbits and sizes of TNOs, potentially detecting clear evidence of a 5 Earth-mass body within 800 AU of the sun. The study could prove the existence of Planet X, and even if it fails, it would add to our understanding of the distant solar system and the effects of sunlight on small solar system bodies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 08:15 PM\nSource:[Phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-planet-hundreds-tiny-telescopes.html)\n\n**Scientists Propose Hypothesis of a Ninth Planet in the Solar System**\nScientists have proposed an unexpected hypothesis about the existence of a Ninth planet in the Solar system, which is believed to be a massive object located far beyond Neptune's orbit. The object's gravity is thought to affect the orbits of trans-Neptunian objects, a group of icy bodies that orbit beyond Neptune. However, the uncertainties in the data, caused by the peculiarities of observations, cast doubt on these conclusions. An alternative theory suggests that the Ninth planet is a primary black hole, which could have formed in the early universe. The emission of Hawking radiation from the black hole's event horizon may be the key to its detection, but it is so weak that current instruments are unable to detect it. The search for the Ninth planet is complicated by its likely distance from the Sun, but if it is found, a future mission could not only confirm the hypothesis but also open up new avenues for studying the laws of physics. By comparing data on gravity and quantum mechanics, scientists could make significant progress in understanding the nature of black holes and the universe as a whole.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 07:14 AM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/science/2135111-hawking-radiation-detection/)\n\n**The Best Way to Find Planet Nine Might Be Hundreds of Tiny Telescopes**\nAstronomers have been searching for Planet Nine, a hypothetical planet on the outer edge of the solar system, but have found no evidence.

The study estimates that over 10 years, they could detect 1,800 new TNOs and find evidence of Planet X if it exists. The project would cost around $15 million and would also contribute to our understanding of the distant solar system and the effects of sunlight on small solar system bodies. As Dr. [insert name] said, 'The idea is based on a phenomenon known as occultation, which is when an asteroid or planetary body passes in front of a star.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 08:46 PM\nSource:[universetoday.com](https://www.universetoday.com/169471/the-best-way-to-find-planet-nine-might-be-hundreds-of-tiny-telescopes/)\n\n**New Study Provides Evidence for the Existence of Planet 9**\nA recent study has found a new class of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that cross Neptune's orbit, providing evidence for the existence of a massive, undiscovered planet known as Planet 9 (P9). The study used simulations to show the gravitational perturbations of all giant planets, the galactic tide, and passing stars. These simulations, which take into account the movements of planets and the early evolution of the Sun within a star cluster, reveal that the orbital architecture of this group aligns closely with the predictions of the model that includes a ninth planet. The study provides a new line of evidence supporting the existence of P9 and makes a series of predictions that could be verified in the near future. According to the study, the scenario with Planet 9 has a high level of confidence, suggesting that the presence of P9 is the most plausible explanation for the observed anomalies in the orbits of TNOs. 'This is not just a search for a new planet, but also an exploration of the dynamic processes that have shaped our solar system,' said the study. 'The discovery and characterization of TNOs have been fundamental in reimagining the long-term evolution of our solar system.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 06:15 PM\nSource:[meteored.mx](https://www.meteored.mx/noticias/ciencia/develando-los-secretos-del-planeta-9-nuevas-investigaciones-podrian-llevar-a-su-descubrimiento.html)\n\n**The Search for the 'Ninth Planet' Gains Momentum with New Research and Technologies**\nThe search for the 'ninth planet' in our Solar System has gained momentum with new research and advanced technologies, according to the Discover magazine. The theory of the 'Ninth Planet' arose from the orbits of distant objects, such as comets and asteroids, which are difficult to explain with existing Solar System models. Physicist Amir Siraj from Princeton recently conducted simulations suggesting the presence of a hidden planet behind Neptune with parameters different from those previously proposed. However, this does not yet prove the existence of another planet in our system. The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, which is expected to start operations in 2025, will conduct an all-sky survey using the largest digital camera in history, providing unprecedented data that may reveal this enigmatic planet. The search also involves the Keck and Subaru telescopes, as well as the Backyard Worlds project. As Siraj said, 'This will give us unprecedented data and may open up this mysterious planet.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 03:52 AM\nSource:[Рамблер](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/53722446-poisk-devyatoy-planety-aktivizirovalsya-s-novymi-tehnologiyami-i-nablyudeniyami/)\n\n**The Search for Planet Nine: A Hidden World in Our Solar System?**\nAstronomers believe that there may be a hidden planet in our solar system, which they call 'Planet Nine'. The planet is thought to be a 'super-Earth', with a mass of five to seven times that of our planet, and an orbital period of 10,000 to 20,000 years. The existence of Planet Nine is supported by the behavior of other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. However, not all scientists agree on the existence of Planet Nine, and some have proposed alternative theories to explain the observed behavior of the objects in the Kuiper Belt. The debate is ongoing, and the search for more evidence continues. A new telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is expected to be completed in 2025 and will be able to search the entire sky for signs of Planet Nine. 'It's a 'smoking gun' really notable,' said Konstantin Batygin, a professor of planetary science at Caltech. 'And it's obvious in retrospect, so I feel a bit embarrassed that we took almost a decade to realize this. Better late than never, I suppose.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 10, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[entrelineas.com.mx](https://entrelineas.com.mx/crealo/existe-un-planeta-oculto-en-nuestro-sistema-solar-astronomos-afirman-que-se-avecina-la-respuesta/)\n\n**Is There New Evidence for a 9th Planet - Planet X?**\nAstrophysicist Amir Siraj and his co-authors ran simulations of the solar system, including an extra planet beyond Neptune, and found that the perimeters for this possible planet were different than previously discussed. They supported the possibility of an unseen planet beyond Neptune. A new telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is expected to go online in 2025 and will have the potential to see deeper into the solar system. Siraj expects it to take 'the deepest, all-sky survey that humanity has ever conducted.' The Rubin Observatory may be able to see a planet beyond Neptune, or it may find evidence that Planet X (Planet Nine) does not exist. 'Next year is going to be an enormous year for solar system science,' Siraj says. 'This debate for the last decade has a lot of scientists confused, including myself. I decided to look at the problem from scratch,' he says. 'We did it 300 times, about 2.5 times more than what was done previously,' Siraj says. 'In each simulation, you try different parameters for the extra planet. A different mass, a different tilt, a different shape of the orbit. You run these for millions of years, and then you compare the distribution to what we see in our solar system....' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 06:57 PM\nSource:[slashdot.org](https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/11/09/067233/is-there-new-evidence-for-a-9th-planet---planet-x?sbsrc=md)\n\n**Eris Could Become the Ninth Planet**\nAstronom Mike Brown, who was part of the team that reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet, believes that there may be room for a new planet in our solar system. Brown and other astronomers are considering the possibility of a new planet, which has been nicknamed 'Planet 9'. According to CNN, a new telescope is set to be launched in 2025, which may be able to detect this potential planet. Malena Rice, an assistant professor of astronomy at Yale University, said, 'If we find another planet, it's a very big deal.' However, not all scientists agree, with some believing that the potential planet does not exist at all. Konstantin Batygin, a colleague of Brown's, said, 'Since Neptune was discovered successfully in 1846, at least 30 astronomers have suggested the existence of different types of trans-Neptunian planets - and they have always been wrong.'\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 06:10 PM\nSource:[abcnyheter.no](https://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/verden/2024/11/09/196041347/eris-kan-bli-den-niende-planeten?nr=1)\n\n**The Search for Planet Nine: A Hidden World in Our Solar System?**\nAstronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin believe that there may be a hidden planet in our solar system, which they call 'Planet Nine'. The planet is thought to be a 'super-Earth' with a mass of around 5-7 times that of our planet, and an orbital period of 10,000 to 20,000 years. The discovery of this planet would be a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and could change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems. However, not all scientists agree with this theory, and some have raised concerns about the lack of evidence and the potential for bias in the data. The debate is ongoing, and a new telescope currently under construction may be able to provide the answer in the near future. 'It's a very exciting time for astronomy,' said Malena Rice, a professor of astronomy at Yale University. 'There's a lot of potential for learning a lot about the universe.' The search for Planet Nine has been ongoing for over a decade, and several studies have suggested that it may exist. However, the lack of direct evidence has made it difficult to confirm the existence of the planet. 'We've been searching for this planet for a long time, and we still haven't found it,' said Renu Malhotra, a professor of planetary science at the University of Arizona. 'But we're not giving up. We're going to keep searching until we find it.' The new telescope, called the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is expected to be completed in 2025 and will be able to observe the entire sky in unprecedented detail. 'It's a game-changer for astronomy,' said Batygin. 'It will be able to find Planet Nine directly, which would be a fantastic conclusion to the search and open up a new chapter in the field.' Even if the telescope doesn't find Planet Nine, it will still be able to confirm the existence of the planet by testing the statistical patterns that have been observed in the data. 'It's a very exciting time for astronomy,' said Rice. 'There's a lot of potential for learning a lot about the universe.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 11:17 AM\nSource:[TVI](https://tvi.iol.pt/noticias/planeta/plutao/depois-da-morte-de-plutao-o-nono-planeta-pode-estar-de-volta/20241109/672aa886d34ea1acf2704be5)\n\n**The Search for Planet X: A Mysterious World Hiding in Our Solar System?**\nAstronomers have been searching for a ninth planet, or 'Planet X', in our solar system for years. The idea is based on observations of certain objects in the solar system that don't fit with current theories. The simplest explanation is that there is a ninth planet. Our solar system is crowded with millions of objects, including planets, moons, comets, and asteroids. In 1846, astronomers discovered the eight main planets, but they have continued to search for more. In the past 100 years, they have discovered smaller, distant objects called dwarf planets, which are now classified as Pluto. The discovery of these dwarf planets has led scientists to think that something else might be hiding at the edge of the solar system. According to computer models, Planet X is at least 20 times farther from the Sun than Neptune. Scientists are searching for visible evidence of the planet's presence by looking for the sunlight it reflects, like the Moon shines at night. However, the planet is expected to be very faint and difficult to detect, even with the best telescopes on Earth. They can only search for it during small windows of time when the conditions are perfect, such as a night without a Moon and the right orientation of the observing location. New telescopes and studies of the sky in the next decade may give us the opportunity to prove or disprove the existence of Planet X.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 08:40 PM\nSource:[actu.fr](https://actu.fr/sciences-technologie/apres-la-terre-mars-jupiter-pourrait-il-y-avoir-une-planete-x-cachee-dans-notre-systeme-solaire_61840202.html)\n\n**Astronomers Confirm Existence of Mysterious Planet in Solar System**\nAstronomers have confirmed the existence of a mysterious, undiscovered planet in the solar system. The 'Planet Nine' theory, which dates back to the 19th century, suggests that a massive, unknown object is responsible for irregularities in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. According to researchers, the hypothetical satellite could be a 'super-Earth', five to ten times the mass of Earth. Mike Brown, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology, stated, 'The visually most impactful evidence is a possible gravitational grouping of an unknown massive body.' The NASA has confirmed the crew of the last simulated mission to Mars in 2024. The study tracks icy bodies that are subject to some type of perturbation that is injecting them into Neptune's orbit before they leave the solar system entirely. The extreme characteristics of its orbit explain why it has remained out of sight of current telescopes, as it would spend most of its time in the darkest and coldest confines of the solar system. The interest in the discovery of the new planetary member has been rekindled with the appearance of new observation technologies. For 2025, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile is expected to open, equipped with a periscope capable of searching for direct evidence of this hidden planet, which experts consider the 'greatest enigma of contemporary astronomy.' The professor of Astronomy at Yale University, Malena Rice, noted that 'it could completely remodel our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting, there's a lot of potential for learning about the universe.' Konstantin Batygin, a professor of Planetary Science at the California Institute of Technology, stated that 'I never thought I'd be talking about there being evidence of a trans-Neptunian planet, but I believe that, unlike previous times, we are correct this time.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 12:54 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/internacional/astronomos-aseguraron-la-existencia-de-un-misterioso-a30-planeta-oculto-en-el-sistema-solar.phtml)\n\n**The Mystery of Planet 9: A Debate That May Soon Be Resolved**\nScientists have been debating for the past decade whether there is a 9th planet in our solar system. The debate started after some scientists found anomalies in the orbits of objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune. They suggested that a large planet, called Planet 9, could be responsible for these anomalies. However, there is no conclusive evidence to prove the existence of Planet 9. The debate is expected to be resolved soon with the launch of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile in 2025, which will have a powerful digital camera to observe the objects in the Kuiper Belt. The scientists are hopeful that the new telescope will provide evidence to confirm or rule out the existence of Planet 9. According to a study published in the Astronomical Journal last year, the mass of Planet 9 could be 1.5 to 3 times that of Earth. The researchers are not sure about the composition of the planet, but it could be a rocky or icy world, or even a super-Neptune. The study also suggests that the planet could have a highly inclined orbit, making it difficult to detect. The search for Planet 9 is an exciting one, as it could provide insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 07:39 AM\nSource:[News18 India](https://hindi.news18.com/news/knowledge/explainer-planet-nine-existence-in-solar-system-of-mystery-nasa-new-telescope-might-solve-it-8821123.html)\n\n**Astronomy breakthrough as hidden ninth planet discovered in new research**\nAstronomers are close to proving the existence of a ninth planet in our solar system, referred to as Planet Nine.

The search for the ninth planet has been ongoing for 175 years, and new research may finally solve this space mystery. A team of astronomers believes they have found evidence of a planet that is 50 times farther from the Sun than Earth, with a secondary region that exceeds 20 times that distance. The discovery has sparked controversy and opposing theories, with some scientists doubting its existence, while others believe it could be a significant find. 'If we find another planet, it will be something really important. It could completely change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting, there's a lot of potential to learn a tremendous amount about the universe,' said Malena Rice, assistant professor of Astronomy at Yale University. The debate will continue until 2025, when the new NASA telescope will be able to survey the entire sky and determine if the planet exists. 'There are extreme skeptics about the ninth planet; it's a kind of contentious topic. Some people believe with great passion that it exists. Some people feel very passionately that it doesn't exist. There's a lot of debate about what it is and if it's there.

According to the study, this planet is small, with a mass between 1.5 and 3 times that of Earth, and could be an icy, rocky Earth or a super-Pluto. Its orbit would be very distant, much beyond Neptune, and much more inclined compared to the known planets. Other researchers, such as Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown, argue that an unseen planet several times larger than Earth could be 'shepherding' smaller objects in the solar system. Batygin and Brown have been working on the search for Planet Nine since 2014, conducting computer simulations to test their theories against the presence of the hidden planet. They theorize that its gravitational pull, a 'super-Earth' object about five to seven times the mass of Earth, may be altering the paths of distant bodies in the Kuiper Belt. According to Patryk Sofia Lykawka, associate professor of Planetary Sciences at Kindai University in Japan, 'It could be an icy, rocky Earth, or a super-Pluto. Due to its large mass, it would have a great internal energy that could sustain, for example, subsurface oceans.'

The planet is thought to be a 'super-Earth', with a mass between 5-7 times that of our planet, and an orbital period of 10,000-20,000 years. The existence of the planet was first proposed by Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin in 2014, based on the unusual behavior of a group of objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. Since then, several studies have provided evidence for the planet's existence, including a recent study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, which suggests that the planet's presence can explain the unusual behavior of the objects in the Kuiper Belt. However, not all scientists agree with the idea of a hidden planet, and some have proposed alternative explanations for the observed phenomena. The search for more evidence continues, with some scientists suggesting that the discovery of more objects in the Kuiper Belt could provide a more conclusive answer. 'If we find another planet, it will be something really important,' said Malena Rice, a professor of astronomy at Yale University. 'It could completely change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting - there's a lot of potential to learn a tremendous amount about the universe.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 11:58 PM\nSource:[CNN Español](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2024/11/05/planeta-nueve-oculto-sistema-solar-trax)\n\n**The Search for Planet X: Astronomers Get Closer to the Truth**\nAstronomers are getting closer to the truth about a hidden planet in our solar system. Mike Brown, the same astronomer who proved Pluto was not a planet, has discovered a new world with the help of other scientists. To be considered a planet, a celestial body must dominate its own orbit and remove objects from it. There are some indications that a planet like this exists near Pluto, but it's difficult to track and see due to its distance and orbit size. The new planet is called Planet X or Planet Nine. 'If we find another planet, it would be really something big,' said Malena Rice, assistant professor of astronomy at Yale University. 'It could completely change our understanding of the solar system and other planetary systems, and how we fit into that context. It's really exciting, there's a lot of potential to learn a lot about the universe.' However, not all scientists believe in the existence of the new planet. 'There are definitely skeptics about Planet Nine - it's a somewhat contentious topic,' said Rice. 'Some people believe very passionately that it exists, some people believe very passionately that it doesn't. There's a lot of debate trying to define what it is and if it's there. But that's the hallmark of an interesting topic, because otherwise people wouldn't have strong opinions about it.' A powerful telescope is expected to be ready by the end of 2025 and will help settle the debate.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 06:57 PM\nSource:[ig.com.br](https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/ciencia/2024-11-05/planeta-9-novo-descoberta.html)\n\n**Is there a hidden planet in our solar system? Astronomers say the moment of truth is near**\nAstronomers have been searching for a hidden planet in our solar system for over a decade. The existence of this potential ninth planet, known as Planet Nine, is supported by several clues, including the behavior of other nearby objects. Researchers believe that Planet Nine is a super-Earth object, about five to seven times the mass of our planet, and its orbital period is between 10,000 and 20,000 years. However, competing theories propose alternative explanations, including a smaller hidden planet in the Kuiper Belt. The debate is ongoing, with some researchers arguing that the current evidence is not strong enough to support the existence of Planet Nine. A new telescope, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is set to begin scientific operations in late 2025 and could put the debate to rest by searching the entire available sky every few days. 'This is a next-generation telescope that will search the entire available sky every few days,' said Konstantin Batygin, a professor of planetary science at Caltech. 'It might just find Planet Nine directly, which would be a fantastic conclusion to the search and open up a new chapter.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/04/science/planet-nine-kuiper-belt-latest-evidence/index.html)\n\n**The Hunt for Planet 9: A Mysterious World in Our Solar System**\nA team of astronomers, led by those who previously advocated for Pluto's reclassification as the ninth planet, are now searching for a mysterious Planet 9. This hypothetical planet is believed to be five times the mass of Earth and orbits the Sun at a distance that would make a year last over 10,000 years. While several teams are on the hunt for this elusive planet, the question remains: what evidence and discoveries suggest its existence, and why is it so difficult to detect? As Dr. [name not mentioned in the article] would say, 'the search for Planet 9 is an exciting and challenging endeavor that could reveal new insights into our solar system.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 05:53 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/tele/decouverte/site/episodes/978848/recherche-planete-9-geante-pluton)\n\n**The Search for Planet 9: A Hypothetical Super-Earth or Mini-Neptune**\nThe speaker discussed the possibility of a ninth planet in our solar system, which could be a super-Earth or mini-Neptune, located about 10 times farther away from Pluto. This hypothetical planet, known as Planet 9 or Planet X, is thought to be responsible for the unusual alignment of certain trans-Neptunian objects. The speaker mentioned that there are already indications of a ninth planet, with a mass of between 5 and 8 times that of Earth, and that several projects have been searching for it, including the Dark Energy Survey and the Pan-STARRS1 survey. However, the search is challenging due to the large region of the sky where the planet could be located. The speaker also mentioned a hypothesis that a comet called CNEOS 2014-01-08 was deflected by Planet 9, which could be a 'message from the cosmos' that helps to narrow down the search area. The speaker concluded that the search for Planet 9 is an exciting and worthwhile endeavor, and that it would be wonderful if a Spanish astrophysicist could discover it and give it a name, restoring the solar system to its original nine planets.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 28, 2024 06:50 AM\nSource:[Naukas](https://francis.naukas.com/2024/09/28/mi-breve-charla-la-busqueda-del-noveno-planeta-en-la-noche-europea-de-los-investigadores-2024)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The US Energy Department's data showed that the daily oil production in the US decreased by 10 million barrels to 134 million barrels on November 8. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consulting company, reported that the US daily oil production is expected to increase from 130 million barrels in 2023 to 133 million barrels in 2024, as major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron plan to increase their capital expenditure budgets in 2024. Vaughan Nelson's deputy investment manager, Adam Rich, said that the US needs more drilling rigs to offset the decline in existing oil well production, and that the US oil production may remain at 1.2-1.3 million barrels per day for the next 6-9 months, but if the number of drilling rigs does not increase, the US oil production may decrease by around 100,000 barrels per day by the second half of 2025. Rich also estimated that oil prices need to be around $90 per barrel to drive an increase in drilling rig numbers. Wood Mackenzie's senior analyst, Utkarsh Gupta, reported that the US domestic 48-state oil production is expected to grow by 27,000 barrels per day in 2024, after growing by 90,000 barrels per day in 2023, and is expected to grow by 33,000 barrels per day in 2025, mainly due to the effects of inflation pressure and the decline in drilling activities. According to the report, the decline in drilling activities in 2023 will mainly reflect in the production in 2024, as drilling activities and actual production have a time lag. In Texas, the largest oil-producing state, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 2 to 279, while in Oklahoma, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 1 to 43. In New Mexico, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs increased by 2 to 102, and in Louisiana, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 33. In North Dakota, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 34. The Permian Basin, the largest shale oil-producing area, located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, had the same number of oil drilling rigs as the previous week, at 303. According to the report, the two largest oil companies in the US, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have seen their profits exceed expectations due to the growth in oil production in the Permian Basin. Ismael Torres, chief economist of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, reported that the state may implement oil drilling restrictions that could lead to a 5.4% decrease in future oil production and result in tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue. The report evaluated a drilling distance restriction proposal that was submitted to the 2024 legislative session, which aims to restrict drilling within 2,250 feet of residential areas, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and prisons, and within 650 feet of streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, or irrigation infrastructure. Other surface water areas have a 300-foot restriction. Missi Currier, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said that statewide drilling distance restrictions cannot effectively reduce the impact of oil and gas production on human health, but will instead harm the continued development of oil and gas resources. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 11:45 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ理財網](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=a8182408-b7b8-4d6d-9b68-6abc8c787833)\n\n**US Drilling Rig Numbers Remain Stable**\nThe number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the US has remained stable, according to a report by Baker Hughes.

This cutback is a result of companies prioritizing financial health over increasing production, focusing on reducing debt and boosting shareholder returns. Despite the reduction, the US Energy Information Administration predicts oil production will reach 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 13.5 million in 2025. The decrease in rig counts could stabilize or lift gas prices, which rebounded by 11% this year. This production strategy may preserve capital, potentially increasing dividends or buybacks, and will impact global energy strategies, potentially hastening the shift to sustainable energy sources.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 08:27 PM\nSource:[finimize.com](https://finimize.com/content/us-energy-firms-cut-back-on-oil-and-gas-rigs)\n\n**US drillers cut oil and gas rigs for first time in four weeks -...**\nUS energy firms cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs for the first time in four weeks, according to Baker Hughes.

The number of horizontal exploration wells, mainly used for shale oil and gas development, remained the same at 520. The decrease in exploration activities will reflect the future oil production, usually with a 3-6 month lag. Wood Mackenzie's senior analyst Utkarsh Gupta reported that the US domestic 48 states' oil production is expected to grow by 27,000 barrels per day in 2024, after growing by 900,000 barrels per day in 2023. However, the growth rate is expected to slow down in 2025. Vaughan Nelson's vice investment manager Adam Rich said that the US needs more drilling to offset the decline in existing oil well production, and the oil price needs to be around $90 per barrel to drive an increase in drilling activity. If drilling activity does not increase, the US oil production may decrease by around 100,000 barrels per day by the second half of 2025. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 10:34 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ理財網](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=5d43fa19-196e-4edf-8fd2-bda9c0ceed75)\n\n**US Rig Count Declines: Should EOG & MTDR Still Be on Your Watch List?**\nThe US rig count has declined, with 584 rigs in operation as of November 15, down from 585 the previous week and 618 a year ago. This decline is seen as a sign of increased efficiency among shale producers, but some analysts are concerned that producers may not have enough promising land for drilling. Despite this, oil prices remain high, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading at over $65 per barrel, making it an advantageous landscape for exploration and production. Energy stocks like EOG Resources and Matador Resources may be worth keeping an eye on for medium to long-term gains, as they have a strong business outlook and are positioned for continued profitability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 08:49 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-rig-count-declines-should-eog-mtdr-still-be-your-watch-list)\n\n**US Oil and Gas Drilling Rig Numbers Decrease, Canada Sees 7-Rig Decline**\nAccording to data from Baker Hughes, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the US decreased by 1 to 478, and the number of natural gas drilling rigs decreased by 1 to 101. Compared to the same period last year, the number of oil drilling rigs decreased by 22, natural gas drilling rigs decreased by 13, and horizontal drilling rigs decreased by 33. In Canada, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 7 to 200, and the total number of oil and gas drilling rigs in North America decreased by 8 to 784. The US Energy Department's data showed that the daily oil production in the US decreased by 10 million barrels to 134 million barrels on November 8. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consulting company, reported that the US daily oil production is expected to increase from 130 million barrels in 2023 to 133 million barrels in 2024, as major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron plan to increase their capital expenditure budgets in 2024. Vaughan Nelson's deputy investment manager, Adam Rich, said that the US needs more drilling rigs to offset the decline in existing oil well production, and that the US oil production may remain at 1.2-1.3 million barrels per day for the next 6-9 months, but if the number of drilling rigs does not increase, the US oil production may decrease by around 100,000 barrels per day by the second half of 2025. Rich also estimated that oil prices need to be around $90 per barrel to drive an increase in drilling rig numbers. Wood Mackenzie's senior analyst, Utkarsh Gupta, reported that the US domestic 48-state oil production is expected to grow by 27,000 barrels per day in 2024, after growing by 90,000 barrels per day in 2023, and is expected to grow by 33,000 barrels per day in 2025, mainly due to the effects of inflation pressure and the decline in drilling activities. According to the report, the decline in drilling activities in 2023 will mainly reflect in the production in 2024, as drilling activities and actual production have a time lag. In Texas, the largest oil-producing state, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 2 to 279, while in Oklahoma, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 1 to 43. In New Mexico, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs increased by 2 to 102, and in Louisiana, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 33. In North Dakota, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 34. The Permian Basin, the largest shale oil-producing area, located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, had the same number of oil drilling rigs as the previous week, at 303. According to the report, the two largest oil companies in the US, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have seen their profits exceed expectations due to the growth in oil production in the Permian Basin. Ismael Torres, chief economist of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, reported that the state may implement oil drilling restrictions that could lead to a 5.4% decrease in future oil production and result in tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue. The report evaluated a drilling distance restriction proposal that was submitted to the 2024 legislative session, which aims to restrict drilling within 2,250 feet of residential areas, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and prisons, and within 650 feet of streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, or irrigation infrastructure. Other surface water areas have a 300-foot restriction. Missi Currier, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said that statewide drilling distance restrictions cannot effectively reduce the impact of oil and gas production on human health, but will instead harm the continued development of oil and gas resources. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 11:45 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ理財網](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=a8182408-b7b8-4d6d-9b68-6abc8c787833)\n\n**US Drilling Rig Numbers Remain Stable**\nThe number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the US has remained stable, according to a report by Baker Hughes.

This cutback is a result of companies prioritizing financial health over increasing production, focusing on reducing debt and boosting shareholder returns. Despite the reduction, the US Energy Information Administration predicts oil production will reach 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 13.5 million in 2025. The decrease in rig counts could stabilize or lift gas prices, which rebounded by 11% this year. This production strategy may preserve capital, potentially increasing dividends or buybacks, and will impact global energy strategies, potentially hastening the shift to sustainable energy sources.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 08:27 PM\nSource:[finimize.com](https://finimize.com/content/us-energy-firms-cut-back-on-oil-and-gas-rigs)\n\n**US drillers cut oil and gas rigs for first time in four weeks -...**\nUS energy firms cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs for the first time in four weeks, according to Baker Hughes.

This is in line with the week-ago count, but down from the year-ago level of 616. The current national rig count reflects a slowdown in drilling activities, but some analysts see this as a sign of increased efficiency among shale producers. Investors may want to keep an eye on leading oil and gas exploration companies like EOG Resources and Matador Resources, as the favorable pricing environment remains beneficial for energy producers. EOG Resources has a strong business outlook due to its extensive inventory of high-quality drilling wells in low-cost, premium resources, while Matador Resources is driving higher profitability per barrel and reducing overall expenses through strategic focus on record production and cost-saving techniques.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 08:45 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-rig-count-remains-steady-should-you-watch-eog-mtdr-stocks)\n\n**US oil and gas rig count holds steady for record third week - Baker...**\nThe US oil and gas rig count remained unchanged for a record third week in a row, according to Baker Hughes' data.

According to the mid-year forecast, U.S. activity will remain flat through December, with an upturn expected in early 2025. International activity is showing modest growth this year, but significant upside potential for 2025, particularly in offshore/deepwater plays. Industry professionals are optimistic about a breakout year in 2025, citing technical innovation and continued demand for hydrocarbons globally. However, the editor strongly disagrees with the notion that the fundamentals are strong enough to withstand changes in government policies, citing the potential for government to 'screw things up' when it comes to oil and gas. The forecast predicts a 7.1% decline in U.S. drilling in 2024, with a 4.8% decline in footage drilled. In Canada, drilling is expected to be up 7.9%, with oil production continuing to grow. Globally, drilling is expected to total 59,746 wells, down 1.2%, but excluding the U.S., world drilling is up 1.4%. Crude and condensate production grew 0.6% in 2023, with four of the eight global regions posting increases. The Middle East was down 3.4% due to OPEC+-mandated production cuts. The editor notes that these output cuts will likely remain through 2025, but it's hard to believe they will last that long. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 08:06 PM\nSource:[World Oil](https://worldoil.com/magazine/2024/september-2024/columns/first-oil-muddling-through-the-rest-of-2024-with-enthusiasm-for-2025)\n\n**Global Oil and Gas Drilling Rigs Reach Six-Month High in September**\nAccording to Baker Hughes, the number of active oil and gas drilling rigs worldwide reached a six-month high in September, with an average of 1751 rigs operating, up 16 from August.

This decline is seen as a sign of increased efficiency among shale producers, but some analysts are concerned that producers may not have enough promising land for drilling. Despite this, oil prices remain high, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading at over $65 per barrel, making it an advantageous landscape for exploration and production. Energy stocks like EOG Resources and Matador Resources may be worth keeping an eye on for medium to long-term gains, as they have a strong business outlook and are positioned for continued profitability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 08:49 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-rig-count-declines-should-eog-mtdr-still-be-your-watch-list)\n\n**US Oil and Gas Drilling Rig Numbers Decrease, Canada Sees 7-Rig Decline**\nAccording to data from Baker Hughes, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the US decreased by 1 to 478, and the number of natural gas drilling rigs decreased by 1 to 101. Compared to the same period last year, the number of oil drilling rigs decreased by 22, natural gas drilling rigs decreased by 13, and horizontal drilling rigs decreased by 33. In Canada, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 7 to 200, and the total number of oil and gas drilling rigs in North America decreased by 8 to 784. The US Energy Department's data showed that the daily oil production in the US decreased by 10 million barrels to 134 million barrels on November 8. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consulting company, reported that the US daily oil production is expected to increase from 130 million barrels in 2023 to 133 million barrels in 2024, as major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron plan to increase their capital expenditure budgets in 2024. Vaughan Nelson's deputy investment manager, Adam Rich, said that the US needs more drilling rigs to offset the decline in existing oil well production, and that the US oil production may remain at 1.2-1.3 million barrels per day for the next 6-9 months, but if the number of drilling rigs does not increase, the US oil production may decrease by around 100,000 barrels per day by the second half of 2025. Rich also estimated that oil prices need to be around $90 per barrel to drive an increase in drilling rig numbers. Wood Mackenzie's senior analyst, Utkarsh Gupta, reported that the US domestic 48-state oil production is expected to grow by 27,000 barrels per day in 2024, after growing by 90,000 barrels per day in 2023, and is expected to grow by 33,000 barrels per day in 2025, mainly due to the effects of inflation pressure and the decline in drilling activities. According to the report, the decline in drilling activities in 2023 will mainly reflect in the production in 2024, as drilling activities and actual production have a time lag. In Texas, the largest oil-producing state, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 2 to 279, while in Oklahoma, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 1 to 43. In New Mexico, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs increased by 2 to 102, and in Louisiana, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 33. In North Dakota, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 34. The Permian Basin, the largest shale oil-producing area, located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, had the same number of oil drilling rigs as the previous week, at 303. According to the report, the two largest oil companies in the US, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have seen their profits exceed expectations due to the growth in oil production in the Permian Basin. Ismael Torres, chief economist of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, reported that the state may implement oil drilling restrictions that could lead to a 5.4% decrease in future oil production and result in tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue. The report evaluated a drilling distance restriction proposal that was submitted to the 2024 legislative session, which aims to restrict drilling within 2,250 feet of residential areas, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and prisons, and within 650 feet of streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, or irrigation infrastructure. Other surface water areas have a 300-foot restriction. Missi Currier, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said that statewide drilling distance restrictions cannot effectively reduce the impact of oil and gas production on human health, but will instead harm the continued development of oil and gas resources. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 11:45 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ理財網](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=a8182408-b7b8-4d6d-9b68-6abc8c787833)\n\n**US Drilling Rig Numbers Remain Stable**\nThe number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the US has remained stable, according to a report by Baker Hughes.

This cutback is a result of companies prioritizing financial health over increasing production, focusing on reducing debt and boosting shareholder returns. Despite the reduction, the US Energy Information Administration predicts oil production will reach 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 13.5 million in 2025. The decrease in rig counts could stabilize or lift gas prices, which rebounded by 11% this year. This production strategy may preserve capital, potentially increasing dividends or buybacks, and will impact global energy strategies, potentially hastening the shift to sustainable energy sources.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 08:27 PM\nSource:[finimize.com](https://finimize.com/content/us-energy-firms-cut-back-on-oil-and-gas-rigs)\n\n**US drillers cut oil and gas rigs for first time in four weeks -...**\nUS energy firms cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs for the first time in four weeks, according to Baker Hughes.

According to the mid-year forecast, U.S. activity will remain flat through December, with an upturn expected in early 2025. International activity is showing modest growth this year, but significant upside potential for 2025, particularly in offshore/deepwater plays. Industry professionals are optimistic about a breakout year in 2025, citing technical innovation and continued demand for hydrocarbons globally. However, the editor strongly disagrees with the notion that the fundamentals are strong enough to withstand changes in government policies, citing the potential for government to 'screw things up' when it comes to oil and gas. The forecast predicts a 7.1% decline in U.S. drilling in 2024, with a 4.8% decline in footage drilled. In Canada, drilling is expected to be up 7.9%, with oil production continuing to grow. Globally, drilling is expected to total 59,746 wells, down 1.2%, but excluding the U.S., world drilling is up 1.4%. Crude and condensate production grew 0.6% in 2023, with four of the eight global regions posting increases. The Middle East was down 3.4% due to OPEC+-mandated production cuts. The editor notes that these output cuts will likely remain through 2025, but it's hard to believe they will last that long. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 08:06 PM\nSource:[World Oil](https://worldoil.com/magazine/2024/september-2024/columns/first-oil-muddling-through-the-rest-of-2024-with-enthusiasm-for-2025)\n\n**Global Oil and Gas Drilling Rigs Reach Six-Month High in September**\nAccording to Baker Hughes, the number of active oil and gas drilling rigs worldwide reached a six-month high in September, with an average of 1751 rigs operating, up 16 from August.

Some of the most notable risks include the $400 million Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, the $269.4 million Snow White remake, and the $150 million Mickey 17. Other films, such as Wicked Part Two and Sinners, may also face challenges at the box office. However, some films, like Jurassic World Rebirth and Saw XI, are expected to be hits.

Despite having a larger footprint than its rivals, AMC operates with over $4 billion in long-term debt, which continues to weigh on its bottom line. Analyst Eric Wold noted that while the company has taken steps to reduce its debt, it still has a lot of debt and is paying high interest rates. In the third quarter, AMC's revenue outpaced its spending, but interest payments pushed the company to a nearly $21 million loss. Wold predicts that AMC will not be consistently profitable for several years. However, the company is taking steps to improve its revenue and coax lapsed moviegoers back into its theaters, with improved movie slates prepared for 2025 and 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 12:03 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/18/amc-debt-threatens-its-ability-to-ride-the-box-office-rebound.html)\n\n**This week, Diamond Sports Group emerges from bankruptcy proceedings and two major TV shows premiere**\nDiamond Sports Group has emerged from bankruptcy proceedings after receiving approval for its reorganization plan.

The law introduced a three-year deadline for late creditors to file their claims, but there was uncertainty about how this deadline would apply to bankruptcies declared before the law's implementation. The STJ recently ruled that the new law should be applied to avoid immediately eliminating the right of creditors to file previously acquired debts. As a result, the starting point for the three-year deadline is now January 23, 2021, allowing creditors to file claims that were previously pending. This decision has significant implications for the administration of old bankruptcies, providing a window for creditors with acquired rights under the previous regime to exercise their rights. The STJ's position avoids the immediate extinguishment of acquired rights under the previous legislation. The benefits of this decision include the protection of acquired rights, legal certainty, and the increase in the efficiency of the bankruptcy process.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 10:45 AM\nSource:[terrabrasilnoticias.com](https://terrabrasilnoticias.com/2024/10/nova-lei-de-falencias-o-que-muda-para-os-empreendedores/)\n\n**US Retail Icon Files for Bankruptcy and Closes 70 Stores Amid Pandemic-Driven Changes**\nA legendary US company has filed for bankruptcy and will close at least 70 stores due to the significant changes in consumer behavior brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company has informed the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it no longer has the necessary financial resources to continue operations, citing excessive debt or inability to pay. Lilium's board of directors will submit a request for bankruptcy protection in the coming days, and the company will seek self-management. While bankruptcy proceedings with self-management can lead to new investor attraction and finding the best possible solutions for creditors, it remains unclear whether the court will approve the self-management request, according to Lilium's announcement to investors.

Investors have poured in €5.1 billion into the Nasdaq-listed company, but obtaining licenses and developing production has required significant additional costs. Lilium spent around €200 million in the first half of 2024 alone. The Berlin government coalition refused a request for a €50 million government loan guarantee. Although the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party supported the request, the Green Party rejected it.

This makeover covers every aspect of the cinematic experience, from visual ads to snacks and luxury seats. This three-year investment was launched during a recent box office recovery, after two Hollywood strikes and the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to closures and reduced film releases. Traditional cinemas are reacting to luxury rivals offering premium viewing experiences, such as IPIC Theaters and Alamo Drafthouse, which was recently acquired by Sony Pictures Entertainment. According to the National Association of Theaters (NATO), the fight for audience spending dollars is more intense than ever. This extensive makeover is seen as a way to showcase these improvements to the public firsthand. The updates include modernizing and elevating cinemas of all sizes, adopting advanced projection systems, superior audio technologies, improved seating, and updated concessions. Additional recreational structures, such as game rooms and bowling alleys, may also be introduced. The makeover includes fresher air conditioning, new signage, and refinished floors. The individual amounts spent by the cinema chains have not been disclosed. The money comes from growing profits and fresh investments, according to the industry association. In the summer of 2021, Regal promised $250 million for the makeover of its 400 cinemas after its parent company's bankruptcy. This $2.2 billion commitment demonstrates 'unwavering optimism' in the future of cinemas, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at Comscore. 'Throughout its history, the cinema business has faced its share of fluctuations like any other, but the intention behind the big-screen experience has remained and continues to be an integral part of global entertainment culture,' Dergarabedian commented. The renewed interest in cinemas benefits various activities, including advanced projection system providers and premium seating suppliers. This massive transformation strategy aims to attract more customers and retain their loyalty by offering a superior cinematic experience.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 01:13 PM\nSource:[Zeitung \"Aussiedlerbote\" / Газета \"Переселенческий Вестник\"](https://aussiedlerbote.de/it/le-principali-catene-cinematografiche-rivelano-una-strategia-di-trasformazione-completa-da-2-2-miliardi-di-dollari)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reported that American gun owners are on track to exceed 87 years of registered silencers in just the latest three years. The ATF is now processing suppressor applications in record time, with some instances being processed the same day. As a result, silencer registration metrics are off the chart, with over 4.86 million silencers in possession by law-abiding Americans. This surge in suppressor demand is likely good news for SilencerCo, one of the largest firearm suppressor companies in the US.

The group claims that state law prevents the use of the federal NICS system as a replacement, leaving residents and retailers unable to complete transactions.

The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions.

According to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the ban is necessary to reduce crime. However, statistics from the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) show that the previous 'assault weapons' ban from 1994 to 2004 did not lead to a reduction in crime. With an estimated 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, the Harris/Walz regime will face a significant challenge in implementing their gun control measures. Harris has already stated that she will 'hit the ground running' to implement these measures, which could lead to a surge in gun sales and potentially the eventual ban on all firearms.

Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023.

It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**\nA Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal.

This comes as 29 states have adopted 'constitutional carry' laws, allowing citizens to carry firearms without a permit. According to the Brennan Center, the data aligns with predictions from independent experts, who estimated steep drops in murders in 2023 and 2024. The report also notes that the number of active carry permits and licenses declined slightly last year, and that the estimated number of law-abiding citizens carrying defensive sidearms under the 'constitutional carry' laws is unknown. The FBI report highlights the decline in violent crime, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by 11.6%, rape by 9.4%, and aggravated assault by 2.8%. However, the report remains user-unfriendly, making it difficult to determine the types of firearms used in homicides. As noted by the FBI, more than 16,000 agencies submitted data to the UCR Program through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the Summary Reporting System, covering a combined population of 94.3% inhabitants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 12:14 PM\nSource:[AmmoLand](https://www.ammoland.com/2024/10/fbi-report-shows-dramatic-violent-crime-drop-as-29-states-went-permitless)\n\n**Justice Department's Gun Violence Prevention Plan Widens Background Checks, Boosts Red Flag Programs**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced plans to help combat gun violence and save lives. The DOJ developed resources to help small and rural law enforcement agencies deal with mass shootings and plug gaps in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 requires a check of the criminal and mental health history of gun purchasers under 21, but many states and territories restrict the sharing of this information. The DOJ also announced a plan to issue $85 million in grants for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives and over $135 million for red flag programs. However, a firearms industry spokesman expressed some concern over the red flag grants, stating that due process rights must be preserved under the law. 'The Department of Justice is committed to doing everything in its power to combat gun violence and save lives,' Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said. 'Today's actions are a continuation of our efforts to fully implement the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 10:42 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/justice-departments-gun-violence-prevention-plan-widens-background-checks-boosts-red-flag-programs-5731095)\n\n**Justice Department announces new model legislation on including juvenile records in firearm background checks**\nThe Justice Department has announced new model legislation to improve firearm background checks and reduce gun violence. The legislation would allow states to share juvenile criminal history and mental health records with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), while maintaining the confidentiality of juveniles. According to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, NICS must contact state and local law enforcement to determine if a purchaser under 21 is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, some states restrict the sharing of juvenile records. The model legislation creates an exception to these restrictions, allowing law enforcement to access these records during background checks.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reported that American gun owners are on track to exceed 87 years of registered silencers in just the latest three years. The ATF is now processing suppressor applications in record time, with some instances being processed the same day. As a result, silencer registration metrics are off the chart, with over 4.86 million silencers in possession by law-abiding Americans. This surge in suppressor demand is likely good news for SilencerCo, one of the largest firearm suppressor companies in the US. However, the overall firearms industry has been experiencing hard times since the gun bubble popped in 2021. Despite this, NICS checks are still well above a 20-year trend and seasonally rising into the end of the year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 09:58 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/military/firearm-suppressor-demand-explodes-historic-rate)\n\n**Thousands of gun sales on hold in Washington state amid weeks-long...**\nThousands of gun sales in Washington state are on hold due to a court computer system outage that has prevented background checks from being completed.

SAF founder Alan Gottlieb stated, 'Washington State citizens have had their rights under the federal and state constitutions suspended, and we will take legal action if this isn’t solved immediately.' The group claims that state law prevents the use of the federal NICS system as a replacement, leaving residents and retailers unable to complete transactions.

He was denied the purchase of a 12-gauge shotgun in January 2024 due to his age and the type of firearm. Peterson was later added to the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) prohibited person list after admitting to daily marijuana use. He was arrested on June 5 and charged with one count of attempt to receive a firearm to use to commit a felony. FBI agents seized an altered .22 caliber long rifle, six magazines loaded with 60 rounds, and materials to manufacture destructive devices from his home.

Mark Oliva, NSSF's managing director for public affairs, says this is a sign that lawful gun ownership continues to be an important factor in the elections. He notes that October marks the 63rd straight month of over 1 million background checks. The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions.

According to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the ban is necessary to reduce crime. However, statistics from the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) show that the previous 'assault weapons' ban from 1994 to 2004 did not lead to a reduction in crime. With an estimated 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, the Harris/Walz regime will face a significant challenge in implementing their gun control measures. Harris has already stated that she will 'hit the ground running' to implement these measures, which could lead to a surge in gun sales and potentially the eventual ban on all firearms. As Ammo.com statistics show, there has been a significant increase in gun purchases between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[moonbattery.com](https://moonbattery.com/democrats-make-clear-they-will-come-for-guns/)\n\n**How Many Guns In The US: All About America’s Firearms In 2024**\nAccording to estimates, there are between 400 million and 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States. This translates to approximately 1.5 firearms per person and 1.93 firearms per adult. The largest surge in gun purchases occurred between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months. Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023. However, the exact number of firearms in the U.S. is difficult to determine due to factors such as unregistered guns, private sales, and reporting constraints.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 06:35 PM\nSource:[sonsoflibertymedia.com](https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/how-many-guns-in-the-us-all-about-americas-firearms-in-2024/)\n\n**NICS background check rate in the U.S., by state 2023**\nThe National Instant Background Check System (NICS) is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The system checks for a criminal record or ineligibility to purchase. According to Statista, the NICS background check rate in the U.S. varies by state, but this number does not represent the number of firearms sold in the U.S. due to varying state laws and purchase scenarios. Population data is based on the Census 2022 Population Estimates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 06:35 AM\nSource:[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/249699/number-of-nics-background-checks-per-100-000-residents-in-the-us-by-state/)\n\n**The flood of ghost guns is slowing after regulation. It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**\nA Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal. 'No matter how wise ATF's final rule or how 'weighty' petitioners' policy concerns may be, the final rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority,' said the states in a brief authored by the West Virginia Attorney General's Office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 04:34 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/the-flood-of-ghost-guns-is-slowing-after-regulation-its-also-being-challenged-in-the/article_b73c2ed9-fbbd-524c-be6a-12272c4fcf03.html)\n\n**Justice Department's Gun Violence Prevention Plan Widens Background Checks, Boosts Red Flag Programs**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced plans to help combat gun violence and save lives. The DOJ developed resources to help small and rural law enforcement agencies deal with mass shootings and plug gaps in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 requires a check of the criminal and mental health history of gun purchasers under 21, but many states and territories restrict the sharing of this information. The DOJ also announced a plan to issue $85 million in grants for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives and over $135 million for red flag programs. However, a firearms industry spokesman expressed some concern over the red flag grants, stating that due process rights must be preserved under the law. 'The Department of Justice is committed to doing everything in its power to combat gun violence and save lives,' Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said.

The legislation would allow states to share juvenile criminal history and mental health records with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), while maintaining the confidentiality of juveniles. According to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, NICS must contact state and local law enforcement to determine if a purchaser under 21 is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, some states restrict the sharing of juvenile records.

This contradicts claims made by Donald Trump that crime has been rampant and out of control without him in power. The data also shows a 3% decrease in violent crime nationwide and declines in rape, property crime, and burglary. However, car theft increased by 12.6% and shoplifting returned to pre-pandemic levels. The FBI notes that its data includes full-year numbers from every city agency covering a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants, undermining Republican claims that the numbers look better than they are because they exclude statistics from many major cities. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said that while it was encouraging to see more law enforcement agencies participating in reporting hate crimes data, 'we still have a long way to go toward ensuring comprehensive data collection that provides a more accurate picture of the lived experience of targeted communities across the country.'

The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reported that American gun owners are on track to exceed 87 years of registered silencers in just the latest three years. The ATF is now processing suppressor applications in record time, with some instances being processed the same day. As a result, silencer registration metrics are off the chart, with over 4.86 million silencers in possession by law-abiding Americans. This surge in suppressor demand is likely good news for SilencerCo, one of the largest firearm suppressor companies in the US.

SAF founder Alan Gottlieb stated, 'Washington State citizens have had their rights under the federal and state constitutions suspended, and we will take legal action if this isn’t solved immediately.' The group claims that state law prevents the use of the federal NICS system as a replacement, leaving residents and retailers unable to complete transactions. Gottlieb noted, 'A right delayed is a right denied,' and that the state has denied untold numbers of citizens their right to obtain firearms for almost two weeks.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Peterson began planning mass shootings in November 2022, including at a Buc-ee's on I-35 in New Braunfels. He was denied the purchase of a 12-gauge shotgun in January 2024 due to his age and the type of firearm. Peterson was later added to the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) prohibited person list after admitting to daily marijuana use. He was arrested on June 5 and charged with one count of attempt to receive a firearm to use to commit a felony. FBI agents seized an altered .22 caliber long rifle, six magazines loaded with 60 rounds, and materials to manufacture destructive devices from his home. Peterson faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and is set to be sentenced on February 5, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 09:43 PM\nSource:[ktsm.com](https://www.ktsm.com/news/state-news/young-texas-man-accused-of-planning-mass-shooting-at-buc-ees/)\n\n**Are October Gun Sales a Bellwether for the 2024 Election?**\nAccording to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, there were 1,302,857 background checks conducted on firearm transfers in October 2024, a 5% decrease from the same month in 2023 but an increase of 200,000 from September 2024. Mark Oliva, NSSF's managing director for public affairs, says this is a sign that lawful gun ownership continues to be an important factor in the elections. He notes that October marks the 63rd straight month of over 1 million background checks. The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions. While the growth in sales checks was modest, October 2024 was the fifth-best October on record, and the trend is similar to that of the 2016 presidential election year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[bearingarms.com](https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2024/11/04/gun-sales-bellwether-election-n1226783)\n\n**Democrats Make Clear They Will Come for Guns**\nDemocrats have made it clear that they will pursue gun control measures, including confiscating 'assault weapons' such as the AR-15. According to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the ban is necessary to reduce crime. However, statistics from the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) show that the previous 'assault weapons' ban from 1994 to 2004 did not lead to a reduction in crime. With an estimated 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, the Harris/Walz regime will face a significant challenge in implementing their gun control measures. Harris has already stated that she will 'hit the ground running' to implement these measures, which could lead to a surge in gun sales and potentially the eventual ban on all firearms. As Ammo.com statistics show, there has been a significant increase in gun purchases between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[moonbattery.com](https://moonbattery.com/democrats-make-clear-they-will-come-for-guns/)\n\n**How Many Guns In The US: All About America’s Firearms In 2024**\nAccording to estimates, there are between 400 million and 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States. This translates to approximately 1.5 firearms per person and 1.93 firearms per adult. The largest surge in gun purchases occurred between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months. Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023. However, the exact number of firearms in the U.S. is difficult to determine due to factors such as unregistered guns, private sales, and reporting constraints.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 06:35 PM\nSource:[sonsoflibertymedia.com](https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/how-many-guns-in-the-us-all-about-americas-firearms-in-2024/)\n\n**NICS background check rate in the U.S., by state 2023**\nThe National Instant Background Check System (NICS) is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The system checks for a criminal record or ineligibility to purchase. According to Statista, the NICS background check rate in the U.S. varies by state, but this number does not represent the number of firearms sold in the U.S. due to varying state laws and purchase scenarios.

It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**\nA Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal. 'No matter how wise ATF's final rule or how 'weighty' petitioners' policy concerns may be, the final rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority,' said the states in a brief authored by the West Virginia Attorney General's Office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 04:34 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/the-flood-of-ghost-guns-is-slowing-after-regulation-its-also-being-challenged-in-the/article_b73c2ed9-fbbd-524c-be6a-12272c4fcf03.html)\n\n**FBI Report Shows Dramatic Violent Crime Drop as 29 States Went Permitless**\nThe FBI's 2023 national crime report shows a record-breaking decline in murders, with a 11.6% drop, and a 3.0% decrease in national violent crime. This comes as 29 states have adopted 'constitutional carry' laws, allowing citizens to carry firearms without a permit. According to the Brennan Center, the data aligns with predictions from independent experts, who estimated steep drops in murders in 2023 and 2024. The report also notes that the number of active carry permits and licenses declined slightly last year, and that the estimated number of law-abiding citizens carrying defensive sidearms under the 'constitutional carry' laws is unknown. The FBI report highlights the decline in violent crime, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by 11.6%, rape by 9.4%, and aggravated assault by 2.8%. However, the report remains user-unfriendly, making it difficult to determine the types of firearms used in homicides. As noted by the FBI, more than 16,000 agencies submitted data to the UCR Program through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the Summary Reporting System, covering a combined population of 94.3% inhabitants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 12:14 PM\nSource:[AmmoLand](https://www.ammoland.com/2024/10/fbi-report-shows-dramatic-violent-crime-drop-as-29-states-went-permitless)\n\n**Justice Department's Gun Violence Prevention Plan Widens Background Checks, Boosts Red Flag Programs**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced plans to help combat gun violence and save lives. The DOJ developed resources to help small and rural law enforcement agencies deal with mass shootings and plug gaps in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 requires a check of the criminal and mental health history of gun purchasers under 21, but many states and territories restrict the sharing of this information. The DOJ also announced a plan to issue $85 million in grants for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives and over $135 million for red flag programs.

Melissa Denny, owner of Pistol Annie's Jewelry and Pawn, noted the strain on businesses during the outage, saying, 'We take the brunt of the frustration from customers who don’t understand the delays.' Officials warned that processing delays will continue as they catch up, but assured the public they are prioritizing safety and efficiency. The restoration of the system is a relief for buyers and sellers, though frustrations persist as the backlog is cleared, with officials expecting it to take at least another week to resolve all delays.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2024 04:50 AM\nSource:[nutfieldnews.net](https://nutfieldnews.net/washington-firearm-background-checks-back-online-after-safe-system-hack/)\n\n**Firearm Suppressor Demand Explodes At Historic Rate**\nAccording to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) data, Americans are purchasing firearm suppressors at a historic rate. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) reported that American gun owners are on track to exceed 87 years of registered silencers in just the latest three years. The ATF is now processing suppressor applications in record time, with some instances being processed the same day. As a result, silencer registration metrics are off the chart, with over 4.86 million silencers in possession by law-abiding Americans. This surge in suppressor demand is likely good news for SilencerCo, one of the largest firearm suppressor companies in the US. However, the overall firearms industry has been experiencing hard times since the gun bubble popped in 2021. Despite this, NICS checks are still well above a 20-year trend and seasonally rising into the end of the year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 16, 2024 09:58 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/military/firearm-suppressor-demand-explodes-historic-rate)\n\n**Thousands of gun sales on hold in Washington state amid weeks-long...**\nThousands of gun sales in Washington state are on hold due to a court computer system outage that has prevented background checks from being completed. Second Amendment advocates are threatening to sue, calling the situation 'tyranny' and a 'mass deprivation of civil rights.' The Washington State Patrol typically processes 400-1,000 background checks per day, but has been unable to do so since November 1. Officials hope to have the system back online next week, but a growing backlog could slow things down.

The Second Amendment Foundation is threatening to sue the Washington State Patrol, saying that the suspension has denied citizens their right to obtain firearms. SAF founder Alan Gottlieb stated, 'Washington State citizens have had their rights under the federal and state constitutions suspended, and we will take legal action if this isn’t solved immediately.' The group claims that state law prevents the use of the federal NICS system as a replacement, leaving residents and retailers unable to complete transactions. Gottlieb noted, 'A right delayed is a right denied,' and that the state has denied untold numbers of citizens their right to obtain firearms for almost two weeks.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Peterson began planning mass shootings in November 2022, including at a Buc-ee's on I-35 in New Braunfels. He was denied the purchase of a 12-gauge shotgun in January 2024 due to his age and the type of firearm. Peterson was later added to the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) prohibited person list after admitting to daily marijuana use. He was arrested on June 5 and charged with one count of attempt to receive a firearm to use to commit a felony. FBI agents seized an altered .22 caliber long rifle, six magazines loaded with 60 rounds, and materials to manufacture destructive devices from his home.

Mark Oliva, NSSF's managing director for public affairs, says this is a sign that lawful gun ownership continues to be an important factor in the elections. He notes that October marks the 63rd straight month of over 1 million background checks. The figures suggest that Americans are 'voting with their wallets' and investing in their rights, with law-abiding citizens purchasing firearms in anticipation of potential gun restrictions. While the growth in sales checks was modest, October 2024 was the fifth-best October on record, and the trend is similar to that of the 2016 presidential election year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[bearingarms.com](https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2024/11/04/gun-sales-bellwether-election-n1226783)\n\n**Democrats Make Clear They Will Come for Guns**\nDemocrats have made it clear that they will pursue gun control measures, including confiscating 'assault weapons' such as the AR-15. According to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the ban is necessary to reduce crime. However, statistics from the Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) show that the previous 'assault weapons' ban from 1994 to 2004 did not lead to a reduction in crime. With an estimated 500 million civilian-owned firearms in the United States, the Harris/Walz regime will face a significant challenge in implementing their gun control measures. Harris has already stated that she will 'hit the ground running' to implement these measures, which could lead to a surge in gun sales and potentially the eventual ban on all firearms.

The largest surge in gun purchases occurred between 2020 and 2023, with over 1 million NICS background checks for purchases each month for 57 consecutive months. Additionally, 46% of American households, approximately 65.19 million, contain at least one firearm. The number of concealed carry permits has also increased, with 22 million Americans holding a permit as of 2023.

It's also being challenged in the Supreme Court**\nA Biden administration rule passed in 2022 blocks teenagers and people who can't pass a background check from buying gun kits, also known as ghost guns. However, manufacturers and gun-rights groups have pushed back in court, and the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the regulation will stand. Since the regulation went into effect, several cities report the number of privately made firearms recovered at crime scenes has flattened or declined. Guy Boyd, who was accidentally shot in the head with a ghost gun in 2021, said, 'I was in good health before, playing football, didn't have any medical problems, and now it's one thing after another.' The number of ghost guns around the country has soared in recent years, going from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered at crime scenes in 2021. Industry and gun rights groups say the ATF overreached by targeting a product that had long been legal. 'No matter how wise ATF's final rule or how 'weighty' petitioners' policy concerns may be, the final rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority,' said the states in a brief authored by the West Virginia Attorney General's Office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 04:34 AM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/the-flood-of-ghost-guns-is-slowing-after-regulation-its-also-being-challenged-in-the/article_b73c2ed9-fbbd-524c-be6a-12272c4fcf03.html)\n\n**Justice Department's Gun Violence Prevention Plan Widens Background Checks, Boosts Red Flag Programs**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced plans to help combat gun violence and save lives.

The DOJ also announced a plan to issue $85 million in grants for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives and over $135 million for red flag programs.

This contradicts claims made by Donald Trump that crime has been rampant and out of control without him in power. The data also shows a 3% decrease in violent crime nationwide and declines in rape, property crime, and burglary. However, car theft increased by 12.6% and shoplifting returned to pre-pandemic levels. The FBI notes that its data includes full-year numbers from every city agency covering a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants, undermining Republican claims that the numbers look better than they are because they exclude statistics from many major cities. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said that while it was encouraging to see more law enforcement agencies participating in reporting hate crimes data, 'we still have a long way to go toward ensuring comprehensive data collection that provides a more accurate picture of the lived experience of targeted communities across the country.'

Mansour emphasized that Kalshi's market allows users to place significantly larger bets without influencing market prices, with average wagers at around $300 to $400.

The CFTC believes that the court's previous decision was an 'error' and has asked it to be overturned. The CFTC argues that the court misinterpreted the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, thereby limiting the Commission's authority. The regulator also reiterated its argument that bets on political events are a form of gambling, citing the use of specialized terminology. According to the CFTC, '...the Commission found that contracts can negatively impact the integrity of elections or the perception of election integrity by creating financial incentives for voting (including organized groups) for candidates or by stimulating the spread of disinformation to influence markets, and that markets can be used to influence the perception of elections.' Kalshi's team has not commented on the situation. However, the platform's founder, Tarek Mansour, noted on his X page that Kalshi has surpassed the popularity of Fidelity and Robinhood clients: 'Kalshi just flipped both Robinhood and Fidelity on the Appstore.' In September 2024, the platform won a lawsuit against the CFTC, but the regulator immediately filed an appeal, requesting a temporary ban that prevented the platform from opening bets on political events. This measure was later lifted, but the CFTC's appeal remains in place. Kalshi is currently accepting bets, but this may change in the future pending the upcoming rehearing.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 09:02 AM\nSource:[incrypted.com](https://incrypted.com/cftc-nazvala-reshenye-suda-v-dele-rynka-prognozov-kalshi-oshybkoj/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The project for a ceasefire agreement in the conflict zone will likely be postponed until early 2025 and will begin to be implemented after Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025, Ozer said.

He is counting on the future US President Donald Trump to help bring about a peaceful resolution. Trump has stated that he will focus on ending the war as soon as he takes office in January 2025. Zelensky has outlined three key principles for a peaceful solution: a quick resolution, no return to pre-war borders, and maximum pressure on all levels. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is pushing for a deal that reflects the 'new territorial realities' and does not allow Ukraine to join NATO. The war has been ongoing for over two years, and both sides are exhausted. Trump has a plan to put pressure on both Russia and Ukraine, which could lead to a ceasefire. However, Ukraine's President Zelensky needs security guarantees to ensure that Russia does not use a ceasefire as an opportunity to launch a new attack. The two sides are engaged in a war of attrition, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The US has removed restrictions on the delivery of long-range missiles to Ukraine, which could give them an advantage in the war. Trump has stated that he will be 'very hard' on both Russia and Ukraine, and has hinted that he could cut off military aid to Ukraine if they do not agree to a ceasefire. Ukraine has agreed to put off its bid to join NATO for at least 20 years in exchange for security guarantees from the US.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 09:01 PM\nSource:[waz.de](https://www.waz.de/politik/article407696041/ukraine-krieg-wie-donald-trumps-friedensloesung-aussehen-kann.html)\n\n**Zelensky: War with Russia Will End 'Faster' Under Trump Administration**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the war with Russia 'will end faster' under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He added, 'The war will end, but there is no specific date for it. Of course, with the policy of this team that will lead the White House now, the war will end faster.' Zelensky emphasized that 'a fair peace' is very important for Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, 'President Biden has committed to making sure every dollar we have is available to us from now until January 20.' He added that NATO countries should focus on 'ensuring Ukraine gets the money, ammunition, and troops to fight effectively in 2025, or be able to negotiate peace from a position of strength.' Despite Ukraine's insistence that it will not give up any territory occupied by Russia in any peaceful settlement, Ukrainian officials have now given priority to obtaining security guarantees for their country's future, at least as much as they value a potential ceasefire agreement. With Ukraine's forces losing territory continuously in the east, two senior officials said that defending Ukraine's interests in potential talks will not depend on the country's territorial boundaries, which are likely to be determined by the battles, but on the security guarantees available to maintain a ceasefire.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 15, 2024 04:52 PM\nSource:[aawsat.com](https://aawsat.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85/%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7/5082048-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%B9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B8%D9%84-%D8%A5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A8)\n\n**Alexander Musiyenko's War Prognosis: 'Not Before...'**\nPolitical expert Alexander Musiyenko shared his opinion that the war in Ukraine will not end this year.

Musiyenko stated, 'I, for example, do not believe in this. I told you about my concept that it is likely to be prepared for the fall of 2025, obviously not before, somewhere with such a target. Possibly a little earlier, but I do not think it will be in December.

In fact, the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has stated that in 2025, it is necessary to continue mobilization to support defense and complete tasks. Musiyenko explains that a reserve is not just someone who is in the rear and waits for an opportunity to fight with a rifle, but rather well-trained, well-equipped, and well-prepared military personnel. He also warns that rocket attacks may repeat and could be more massive. 'I, for example, do not believe in this.

Trump does not have a single peace plan for Ukraine, but one of the considered options is to freeze the conflict, establishing borders along the actual front line and creating a demilitarized zone of almost 1300 kilometers, as reported by the Wall Street Journal last week, citing sources within Trump's team.

Estonian President Alar Karis acknowledged that Western countries are experiencing fatigue in supporting Ukraine. He stated that currently, there is no point in starting negotiations between Kiev and Moscow, and emphasized that the current Western support for Ukraine is not sufficient to discuss a ceasefire. Trump repeatedly promised during his election campaign that he would find a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis before taking office.

'Ukraine wants a just and quick end to this war (...) I would like it to be at the latest next year, 2025', Zelensky said during a visit to Berlin. 'For us, it's very important that the aid does not decrease next year', he emphasized alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Zelensky is closing a two-day European tour in Berlin, where he is seeking to secure more military support for his country, which has been invaded by Russia for over two and a half years. Scholz, whose government plans to cut in half in 2025 the amount of bilateral military aid to Ukraine, reassured Zelensky that his country's support will not waver. 'Our support for Ukraine will not falter', he promised. The search for 'a just and lasting peace for Ukraine remains the guiding principle of our joint action', Scholz emphasized, adding that the allies will not accept 'a peace dictated by Russia'. Zelensky's tour comes at a difficult time on the ground, with the Russian army continuing to advance in the eastern front and reiterating the capture of two new localities. In the Odesa region, at least four people died in Russian bombings during the night, according to the regional governor. Scholz announced a short-term aid of 170 million euros (around $186 million) to repair damaged infrastructure. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, the head of the Catholic Church has multiplied calls for peace, without result and with some friction with Kiev. In March, Jorge Bergoglio sparked a diplomatic crisis between Kiev and the Vatican by calling on Ukraine to 'raise the white flag and negotiate'. Zelensky denied that the goal of his tour is to discuss a possible ceasefire with Russia, but rather to present his allies with his 'plan for victory'. The objective is 'to create the conditions for a just end to the war', he said, adding that 'Ukraine can only negotiate from a strong position'. This plan, of which no details are known yet, is expected to be unveiled at a peace summit in November, at a date to be determined.

Zelensky also reiterated plans to hold a second 'peace summit' in November. The details of Zelensky's 'plan for victory' are unknown, but he promised to reveal them after consulting with partners.

The Kremlin promised to achieve success in the military operation regardless of Ukraine's statements about the plan.

He will conclude his European tour in Berlin on Friday, where he will meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, amid plans to cut the bilateral military aid to Ukraine in half in 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 05:36 PM\nSource:[Home](https://odia.ig.com.br/mundo-e-ciencia/2024/10/6932550-zelensky-se-nega-a-falar-com-aliados-europeus-sobre-cessar-fogo-com-a-russia.html)\n\n**Zelensky Discusses Conditions for Ending the War**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the situation on the front allows for considering the end of the war in 2025. He called on allies to consolidate, integrate, and 'strengthen defensive capabilities', reminding that Ukraine has bilateral security agreements with 26 countries, which 'has a decisive significance'. Zelensky said, 'With resolute actions, the war can end no later than 2025. Italy, Germany, the UK, France, and the US have always worked for European security. Together, we can achieve everything we want.' He emphasized that the war in Ukraine 'threatens the stability of Eastern Europe and all Russian threats are real.' Zelensky is willing to sign a ceasefire agreement on the current front line, but without recognizing the loss of territories and 'without recognizing a new official border.' In return, he needs Western guarantees and security guarantees from the US, similar to those provided to Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. Zelensky believes that an invitation to join NATO should strengthen Ukraine now, before possible negotiations on ending the war. He announced this as the first point of his 'victory plan', which would ensure geopolitical security in Europe and weaken Russia's pressure. 'As for NATO, it is a point of the 'victory plan'. As I have already said, it is aimed at strengthening Ukraine. And in my opinion, there should be no skepticism from partners in this matter, if we simply do not fear the Russian Federation. We want to take the first step – get an invitation to the alliance, which, however, is not a synonym for NATO membership,' Zelensky said. 'We are talking about strengthening our positions now, not after the war, not in 10 years, not in 30 years. Right now. This strengthening is a chance to be strong and in the political aspect during some diplomatic movements, during some or other negotiations, in the future,' he added.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[anna-news.info](https://anna-news.info/zelenskij-porassuzhdal-ob-usloviyah-okonchaniya-boevyh-dejstvij/)\n\n**Zelensky Hopes to End Conflict by 2025**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that he hopes to end the conflict by 2025 and that the situation on the battlefield creates such an opportunity. According to Reuters, Zelensky said, 'In October, November, and December, we have a chance to move towards peace and stable stability. The situation on the battlefield creates the opportunity to make this choice - the choice of resolute actions to end the war no later than 2025.' He added that in November, Kyiv plans to prepare a 'formula for peace' to be presented at the second 'peace summit'. Ukrainian Ambassador to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar previously stated that Ukraine plans to hold the second 'peace summit' this year with Russia's participation. However, he ruled out the possibility of direct bilateral negotiations with Russia at the meeting and noted that Kyiv will not consider Moscow's demands.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 03:15 PM\nSource:[Рамблер](https://news.rambler.ru/world/53551172-zelenskiy-zayavil-o-vozmozhnosti-zakonchit-konflikt-v-2025-godu/)\n\n**Zelensky Prepares to Present 'Plan for Victory' at Ramstein Group Meeting**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is reportedly ready to discuss the terms of negotiations with Russia and end the war, according to Bloomberg. Zelensky has announced that he will present a 'plan for victory' at the Ramstein Group meeting, which includes 'concrete steps for a just end' to the conflict. However, the plan has been met with a cold reception in the United States, with some Republicans criticizing Zelensky for meddling in American politics before the November elections, as reported by The Washington Post. The New York Times has also written that 'Zelensky's star is fading'. Western allies have increased pressure on Kyiv to present a concrete plan to end the war, as reported by Bloomberg. A US official stated that since Kyiv has not yet revealed all the details of its plan, Ukrainian officials can use strategic ambiguity to their advantage. Another official noted that 'credible bilateral security guarantees from the United States during ceasefire negotiations would in reality mean Ukraine's membership in NATO'. It is unclear what formula will bring all parties to the negotiating table, as Moscow opposes Ukraine's membership in the Alliance. Zelensky announced that he will present his 'plan for victory' on October 12 at the Ramstein Group meeting, which will be attended by US President Joe Biden. The meeting will take place at the US military base in Ramstein, Germany. 'We are preparing for Ramstein. It will be the 25th meeting in this format, but the first at the level of leaders. We will present a plan for victory, clear and concrete steps for a just end to the war. The determination of our partners and the strengthening of Ukraine are what will stop Russian aggression,' Zelensky wrote on Telegram.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 06:30 AM\nSource:[Onet Wiadomości](https://wiadomosci.onet.pl/swiat/wolodymyr-zelenski-gotowy-na-zakonczenie-wojny-nowe-doniesienia-mediow/sfmq1t5)\n\n**'Won't meet Putin if...': Harris rules out truce talks with Russia if Ukraine is not represented**\nUS Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is running for the presidential election, has ruled out meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin for truce talks if Ukraine is not represented. Harris stated, 'Not bilaterally without Ukraine, no. Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine.' This marks a shift in the US position on negotiating peace with Russia, which launched an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Harris also criticized Republican rival Donald Trump's policies on Ukraine, calling them a 'surrender' to the invasion. Trump has suggested that he could quickly reach a peace deal with Putin, but Harris believes this would involve ceding territory to Russia. Harris said she would deal with Ukraine's bid to join the Nato military alliance 'if and when it arrives at that point'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 04:15 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/world/wont-meet-putin-if-harris-rules-out-truce-talks-with-russia-if-ukraine-is-not-represented-13823057.html)\n\n**Ukrainian Military Expert Predicts End of War in 2025**\nColonel Petro Chernyk, a Ukrainian military expert, has expressed his predictions about the possible terms of the end of the active phase of the war. According to Dialog, which cites 'URA-Info', Chernyk stated that 'only 10% of what we see externally is what is actually happening in reality'. He believes that there are certain prerequisites for the war to end soon, citing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 'reflexion' as a sign that the conflict is moving towards a ceasefire. Chernyk also mentioned the 'unique and unprecedented' 30 bilateral security agreements that have been made, which he believes are a sign that the war is nearing its end. In conclusion, Chernyk stated, 'My conclusion. Next year will be some kind of completion. The question is, on what positions. The main point, to be understood correctly, is that our main task is to preserve statehood. We have already accomplished this task. This is very serious. There will be no territorial concessions. We will eventually take back everything that is ours. I have no doubts, but we need to be critical realists and look objectively at everything that is happening around us.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 29, 2024 05:22 AM\nSource:[УРА-Информ](https://ura-inform.com/uk/vibir-na-ura/2024/09/29/koli-zavershitsya-vijna-v-ukrayini-ekspert-ozvuchiv-svij-prognoz)\n\n**Erdogan Promises Zelensky Ceasefire in Ukraine**\nTurkish President Erdogan met with Ukrainian President Zelensky in New York, discussing bilateral relations, the Ukrainian conflict, and regional and global issues. Erdogan stated that Turkey has always believed that the conflict in Ukraine can be resolved through dialogue, while protecting the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He emphasized that Ankara is willing to support the achievement of a 'just and lasting peace'. Erdogan also announced that efforts to revive the Black Sea Grain Initiative and achieve a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia will continue, which could pave the way for peace.
