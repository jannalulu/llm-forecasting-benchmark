    "question_title": "Will \"slaughterbots\" kill at least 50 people outside a military conflict by 2025?\n\n",
    "summary": "Probabilities from all runs: 2.0%, 2.5%, 1.75%, 2.0%, 1.0%, 1.0%, 1.0%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 1.0%.\n\nSummary: Both groups of forecasting runs analyze the likelihood of autonomous drones, or \"slaughterbots,\" killing at least 50 people outside military conflicts by 2025. Key points include the lack of historical precedent and current technological use, which is primarily within military contexts. There are significant technical, ethical, and regulatory hurdles before such technologies might see non-military use. Moreover, there are no recent, verified incidents of autonomous drones causing mass civilian casualties without military involvement, and the timeframe until early 2025 is notably short. Both groups predicted a low probability for this event, with the first group estimating a 1.00% chance and the second group at 0.50%."

    "question_title": "Will lab-grown complex vital organs be used successfully in humans before 2025?\n",
    "summary": "The probabilities from all the runs are 10.0, 2.0, 10.0, 10.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0. \n\n**Key Points Summary:** The forecasting runs suggest a very low likelihood of successful implantation of lab-grown complex vital organs in humans by January 1, 2025, due to historical precedent and current technological status. Despite advances in related research areas like lab-grown liver tissues and blood vessels, no comprehensive organ transplants have reached the necessary stage. The strict criteria of a 100-day survival without life support impose additional challenges. Recent developments highlight ongoing experimental stages and indicate potential future breakthroughs, but not within the short remaining timeframe. Overall, the probabilities reflect skepticism regarding meeting the 2025 target."

    "question_title": "Will there be a culturally significant development in aging research before January 1, 2025?\n",
    "summary": "Probabilities from all runs were: 10.0, 2.5, 1.25, 10.0, 10.0, 5.8, 5.8, 8.3, 7.8, and 7.8. \n\nBoth groups of forecasting runs highlight the challenges in anticipating a culturally significant development in aging research by January 1, 2025. Key points include the historical context where aging research has not yet sparked widespread societal or media attention, despite ongoing growth and investment in the field. Recent studies and news do not demonstrate a breakthrough that meets the resolution criteria or captures mainstream cultural relevance. The forecasts consider the high bar set by criteria such as recognition in major media or political discussions, and stress how these limitations and the short timeframe contribute to low probability estimates, largely ranging between 5% and 15% in likelihood."

    "question_title": "Will Elon Musk be the richest person in the world on December 31, 2024, according to Forbes?",
    "summary": "The probabilities from all forecasting runs are 70.0%, 82.0%, 82.5%, 80.0%, 80.0%, 87.5%, 80.25%, 87.5%, 87.5%, and 80.5%.\n\n**Summary**: Both groups of forecasts agree that Elon Musk has a strong likelihood of remaining the richest person by the end of 2024. Key factors include his current lead of $49 billion, consistent wealth maintenance in 2024, and multiple successful ventures like Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. Risks such as Tesla's stock volatility and legal challenges are acknowledged but are mitigated by Musk's other assets and the short timeframe remaining in the year. Competing billionaires like Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg pose a lesser threat due to the current wealth gap. Given these factors, the forecasts converge around an 80% probability for Musk to maintain his status."

    "question_title": "Will Oregon voters approve Measure 118, which would initiate a universal basic income in the state, funded by corporate tax?",
    "summary": "The probabilities from all the runs are: 20.0, 20.0, 20.0, 25.0, 20.0, 30.5, 30.5, 25.3, 30.0, and 30.5.\n\nBoth groups of forecasts emphasize significant opposition to Measure 118, underscored by organized resistance from key stakeholders, including Oregon's Democratic Governor, business coalitions, and labor unions. The historical challenges for similar tax increase and UBI-like measures, the measure's potential adverse economic implications, and negative polling data indicate substantial voter dissent. Despite some progressive support, primarily from out-of-state, limited local backing and the presence of a well-funded opposition campaign suggest the measure is headed for defeat. Economic concerns, projected budget shortfalls, and institutional opposition further erode the measure's chances, leading forecasters to estimate a relatively low probability of passage, ranging mainly between 20% and 30.5%."

    "question_title": "Will Donald Trump Lose in New York State by under 6.0 points in the 2024 election?",
    "summary": "The probabilities from all runs are 2.0%, 15.0%, 10.0%, 7.5%, 7.5%, 12.0%, 12.0%, 20.0%, 15.0%, and 12.0%.\n\nKey Points Summary:\nBoth forecast analyses emphasize New York's historical Democratic lean, with Biden winning by 23.1 points in 2020 and Hochul by 6.39 points in 2022, signaling a traditionally Democratic voting pattern. Current polling shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump by margins ranging from 12 to 16 points, indicating a significant Democratic advantage. Despite some narrative shifts suggesting mild gains for Trump, the lead remains substantial, and any sub-6-point margin of loss for Trump would require an unprecedented polling error and dramatic shifts in voting patterns. The risk of Trump losing by less than six points is consistently deemed low across analyses, with probabilities predicting such an outcome between 5.00% and 20.00%, suggesting that a tight race for Trump in New York remains improbable."

    "question_title": "Will Kamala Harris be president before January 1, 2025?",
    "summary": "The probabilities from all the runs are 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1, 1, 1.25, 1, and 1.\n\nThe forecasts collectively highlight a very low probability of Kamala Harris becoming president for at least 30 consecutive days before January 1, 2025. Key points include historical patterns showing low incidence of vice presidents assuming the presidency mid-term, especially with no immediate indication of health crises, resignation, or impeachment affecting Joe Biden. With the election happening on November 5, 2024, and inauguration not until January 20, 2025, any path for Harris to assume presidency due to Biden leaving office is constrained by time, needing 30 days within roughly a 55-day window, thereby further reducing likelihood. Overall, the low probability estimates reflect these constraints and historical precedent."

    "question_title": "Before January 5, 2025, will the KP lineage constitute less than 50% of the COVID-19 variants monitored in the US?",
    "summary": "The probabilities from all runs are: 45.0%, 45.0%, 30.0%, 30.0%, 10.0%, 75.5%, 35.5%, 30.5%, 20.0%, and 20.0%.\n\n**Summary of Key Points**: Both forecasts emphasize KP's current dominance at 68% and rapid rise of XEC from 2% to 17% as crucial factors. There's consensus that displacing KP below 50% by January 5, 2025, is unlikely due to the short two-month window and XEC's need to maintain unprecedented growth. Historical trends show dominant variants typically require 3-4 months to be displaced. While the possibility of new variants and transmission dynamics during the holiday season pose risks, the inertia of KP's established presence suggests it will likely remain above the 50% threshold in the immediate future."

    "question_title": "Will the XEC COVID-19 variant account for at least 50% of the variants monitored in the US before January 5, 2025?",
    "summary": "The probabilities from all runs are as follows: 32.5%, 20.0%, 15.0%, 30.0%, 30.0%, 30.0%, 30.0%, 25.0%, 25.0%, and 35.5%.\n\nThe first group of runs highlights the competition between XEC and the dominant KP.3.1.1 variant, noting XEC's increased transmissibility, ongoing vaccine effectiveness, and the constrained timeline. The second group of runs underscores XEC's rapid initial growth and potential to outcompete, bolstered by favorable winter conditions; however, they also recognize the strong presence and historical resilience of KP.3.1.1. Both analyses peg the likelihood of XEC reaching 50% dominance before January 5, 2025, as moderate, emphasizing the variant's growth patterns, competitive potential, limited time window, and contextual factors like seasonal spread. The probability estimates converge around modest probability, largely suggesting skepticism about a near-term shift in dominance."
