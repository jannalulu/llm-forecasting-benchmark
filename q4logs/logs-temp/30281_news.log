**US Rig Count Declines: Should EOG & MTDR Still Be on Your Watch List?**
The US rig count has declined, with 584 rigs in operation as of November 15, down from 585 the previous week and 618 a year ago. This decline is seen as a sign of increased efficiency among shale producers, but some analysts are concerned that producers may not have enough promising land for drilling. Despite this, oil prices remain high, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading at over $65 per barrel, making it an advantageous landscape for exploration and production. Energy stocks like EOG Resources and Matador Resources may be worth keeping an eye on for medium to long-term gains, as they have a strong business outlook and are positioned for continued profitability.

**US Oil and Gas Drilling Rig Numbers Decrease, Canada Sees 7-Rig Decline**
According to data from Baker Hughes, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the US decreased by 1 to 478, and the number of natural gas drilling rigs decreased by 1 to 101. Compared to the same period last year, the number of oil drilling rigs decreased by 22, natural gas drilling rigs decreased by 13, and horizontal drilling rigs decreased by 33. In Canada, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 7 to 200, and the total number of oil and gas drilling rigs in North America decreased by 8 to 784. The US Energy Department's data showed that the daily oil production in the US decreased by 10 million barrels to 134 million barrels on November 8. Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consulting company, reported that the US daily oil production is expected to increase from 130 million barrels in 2023 to 133 million barrels in 2024, as major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron plan to increase their capital expenditure budgets in 2024. Vaughan Nelson's deputy investment manager, Adam Rich, said that the US needs more drilling rigs to offset the decline in existing oil well production, and that the US oil production may remain at 1.2-1.3 million barrels per day for the next 6-9 months, but if the number of drilling rigs does not increase, the US oil production may decrease by around 100,000 barrels per day by the second half of 2025. Rich also estimated that oil prices need to be around $90 per barrel to drive an increase in drilling rig numbers. Wood Mackenzie's senior analyst, Utkarsh Gupta, reported that the US domestic 48-state oil production is expected to grow by 27,000 barrels per day in 2024, after growing by 90,000 barrels per day in 2023, and is expected to grow by 33,000 barrels per day in 2025, mainly due to the effects of inflation pressure and the decline in drilling activities. According to the report, the decline in drilling activities in 2023 will mainly reflect in the production in 2024, as drilling activities and actual production have a time lag. In Texas, the largest oil-producing state, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 2 to 279, while in Oklahoma, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs decreased by 1 to 43. In New Mexico, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs increased by 2 to 102, and in Louisiana, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 33. In North Dakota, the number of oil and gas drilling rigs remained the same at 34. The Permian Basin, the largest shale oil-producing area, located in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, had the same number of oil drilling rigs as the previous week, at 303. According to the report, the two largest oil companies in the US, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have seen their profits exceed expectations due to the growth in oil production in the Permian Basin. Ismael Torres, chief economist of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, reported that the state may implement oil drilling restrictions that could lead to a 5.4% decrease in future oil production and result in tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue. The report evaluated a drilling distance restriction proposal that was submitted to the 2024 legislative session, which aims to restrict drilling within 2,250 feet of residential areas, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and prisons, and within 650 feet of streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, or irrigation infrastructure. Other surface water areas have a 300-foot restriction. Missi Currier, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said that statewide drilling distance restrictions cannot effectively reduce the impact of oil and gas production on human health, but will instead harm the continued development of oil and gas resources.

**US Drilling Rig Numbers Remain Stable**
The number of oil and gas drilling rigs in the US has remained stable, according to a report by Baker Hughes. The total number of drilling rigs decreased by only one to 584 in the period ending November 15, compared to 585 in the previous three weeks. This is 34 fewer than the same period last year. The number of oil drilling rigs decreased by one to 478, while the number of natural gas drilling rigs decreased by one to 101. The number of drilling rigs working on both oil and gas increased by one to five. Of the 568 drilling rigs focused on oil production, 568 were on land, 14 were in open waters, and 2 were in inland waters. In Canada, the number of drilling rigs decreased by seven to 200, with 5 fewer oil rigs and 2 fewer natural gas rigs. In Mexico, the number of drilling rigs remained the same at 12, and the total number of drilling rigs in North America decreased by 12 to 784.

**US Energy Firms Cut Back On Oil And Gas Rigs**
US energy firms have reduced the number of oil and natural gas rigs, with the total rig count falling to 584, a 6% drop from last year. This cutback is a result of companies prioritizing financial health over increasing production, focusing on reducing debt and boosting shareholder returns. Despite the reduction, the US Energy Information Administration predicts oil production will reach 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 13.5 million in 2025. The decrease in rig counts could stabilize or lift gas prices, which rebounded by 11% this year. This production strategy may preserve capital, potentially increasing dividends or buybacks, and will impact global energy strategies, potentially hastening the shift to sustainable energy sources.

**U.S. Drillers Cut Oil and Gas Rigs for Fourth Time in Five Weeks – Baker Hughes**
U.S. energy firms cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs for the fourth time in five weeks, according to Baker Hughes. The oil and gas rig count fell by one to 585, with 482 oil rigs and 99 gas rigs. This is 39 rigs, or 6%, below the total rig count from this time last year. The decline in rigs is due to lower oil and gas prices, higher labor and equipment costs, and companies focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns. U.S. oil futures are down 3% so far in 2024, while U.S. gas futures are 10% lower. Despite the decline in rigs, U.S. crude production hit a record high of 13.5 million barrels per day last week. The EIA forecasts U.S. crude output to rise to 13.2 million bpd in 2024 and 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

**Muddling through the rest of 2024 with enthusiasm for 2025**
The upstream industry is expected to maintain the status quo for the remainder of 2024, with great enthusiasm building for 2025. According to the mid-year forecast, U.S. activity will remain flat through December, with an upturn expected in early 2025. International activity is showing modest growth this year, but significant upside potential for 2025, particularly in offshore/deepwater plays. Industry professionals are optimistic about a breakout year in 2025, citing technical innovation and continued demand for hydrocarbons globally. However, the editor strongly disagrees with the notion that the fundamentals are strong enough to withstand changes in government policies, citing the potential for government to 'screw things up' when it comes to oil and gas. The forecast predicts a 7.1% decline in U.S. drilling in 2024, with a 4.8% decline in footage drilled. In Canada, drilling is expected to be up 7.9%, with oil production continuing to grow. Globally, drilling is expected to total 59,746 wells, down 1.2%, but excluding the U.S., world drilling is up 1.4%. Crude and condensate production grew 0.6% in 2023, with four of the eight global regions posting increases. The Middle East was down 3.4% due to OPEC+-mandated production cuts. The editor notes that these output cuts will likely remain through 2025, but it's hard to believe they will last that long.

**US drillers cut oil and gas rigs for third week in a row - Baker Hughes - ET Auto**
US drillers have cut the number of oil and gas rigs for the third week in a row, according to Baker Hughes. The oil and gas rig count fell by 2 to 585 in the week to October 4, with oil rigs dropping to 479, their lowest since July 19. Despite higher oil prices, drillers have reduced spending on drilling activities, leading to a decline in US crude output. The EIA predicts US crude output will reach 13.7 million barrels per day in 2025, down from a record 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023. On the gas side, US gas output is expected to slide to 103.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 billion cubic feet per day in 2023. 'Those higher oil prices prompted drillers to boost U.S. crude output from a record 12.9 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023 to 13.3 million bpd in 2024 and 13.7 million bpd in 2025,' according to the EIA outlook.
