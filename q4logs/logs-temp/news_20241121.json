Bernard, who held the position of Associate Director, Competitor Intelligence, expressed his surprise at the decision via LinkedIn. The layoffs were communicated via email to affected workers, with many expressing outrage on social media.

Failure to comply may result in termination. This decision has been met with resistance from employees, with 73% of administrative staff reportedly seeking new jobs. The move has sparked debate about the future of remote work and its benefits. Nicholas Bloom, an economist from Stanford University, acknowledges that remote work can hinder learning, innovation, and communication, but also highlights its benefits for work-life balance and employee well-being. Other companies, such as Microsoft and Google, have stated that they will maintain a hybrid work model, but only if productivity remains high. The article suggests that companies should strive for a balance between employee satisfaction and productivity, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 07:55 AM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/retorno-ao-escritorio-e-o-fim-do-teletrabalho/)\n\n**Adam Neumann Buys Discounted Aventura Office Complex for $116M**\nAdam Neumann, the former WeWork CEO, has purchased a three-building office complex in Aventura, Florida, for $116.2 million through his new venture Flow, alongside Israeli developer Canada Global.

Neumann's contribution to the purchase transaction totals $36 million, which includes a $25 million investment into Canada Global and $11 million in equity from Flow.

However, as revealed in Lionel Barber's new biography, the two men met in 2017 when Son attempted to interest Buffett in SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund. The fund included companies with inflated valuations, such as WeWork, which was described by a SoftBank insider as 'feeding a monkey alcohol' due to its founder Adam Neumann's excessive spending and hype. Son's insistence on setting his sights higher led to the fund's downfall, mirroring the rise and fall of Son's own career. 'Masa' flew directly from Tokyo to Buffett's home in Nebraska to pitch the Vision Fund, showcasing his unique approach to business. According to Barber, Son's actions were a reflection of the extraordinary era in which he operates. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 11:01 PM\nSource:[Nikkei Asia](https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Books/Books-Rise-fall-and-rise-of-Masayoshi-Son-mirrors-extraordinary-era)\n\n**Adam Neumann plots Flow's expansion in South Florida and Middle East**\nAdam Neumann, former CEO of WeWork, is optimistic about the expansion of his latest venture, Flow, a community-focused residential property provider, in South Florida and the Middle East. Flow has already seen success in South Florida, with its two apartment buildings, Flow Miami and Flow Fort Lauderdale, almost entirely leased. Neumann plans to 'double down' on South Florida and Saudi Arabia, with potential locations in Jeddah and West Palm Beach. Flow's focus on community and technology allows it to charge a premium, with rents ranging from $2,223 to $5,000. Neumann believes that Flow's unique approach is not just about amenities, but about creating a 'feeling' of community. The company owns and manages its properties outright, unlike WeWork, and develops its technology in-house. Expansion plans include a new condominium property, Flow House, in Miami, and further expansion in the Middle East.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 10:59 PM\nSource:[costar.com](https://www.costar.com/article/343909054/adam-neumann-plots-flows-expansion-in-south-florida-and-middle-east)\n\n**Adam Neumann, word for word: Founder aims to explain Flow**\nAdam Neumann, co-founder of WeWork, discussed his new startup Flow, a multifamily real estate company, at the TRD South Florida Real Estate Forum.

He highlighted the unique features of Flow House, a condo development in Miami, which includes a resident-led wellness program, a broker portal, and a focus on community building. Neumann also discussed the company's expansion plans, including a 900-unit development in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Flow has received $350 million in investments from Andreessen Horowitz and has a valuation of over $1 billion. Neumann has also created a new product called WorkFlow, which is a competitor to WeWork. WorkFlow will offer shared office spaces and flexible offices, with a focus on creating a positive and productive environment for its users. According to Neumann, WorkFlow will be a more mature version of WeWork, with a focus on consistency and fewer errors. The company has already signed its first lease for an office space in Fort Lauderdale, and plans to expand to other locations. Neumann has learned from his past mistakes with WeWork, and is taking a more cautious approach with WorkFlow, saying 'we're not rushing, we're not trying to be the first, we're just trying to do it right'.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 08:40 PM\nSource:[mind.ua](https://mind.ua/publications/20280643-robota-nad-pomilkami-batko-wework-zasnuvav-konkurenta-svoyij-pershij-kompaniyi)\n\n**Is Nike Laced Up and Ready to Go? | The Motley Fool**\nMotley Fool analysts Jason Moser and Ricky Mulvey discuss various companies, including Nike, Tesla, and WeWork. Nike's recent earnings report showed a decline in revenue and a decrease in direct and digital sales. Jason Moser believes that Nike's strategy is the main issue, and that the company needs to focus on its wholesale relationships. Tesla's delivery numbers were slightly lower than expected, but the company's overall performance is still strong. Jason Moser notes that Tesla is a polarizing investment idea, and that CEO Elon Musk's behavior has increased the risk profile of the company. WeWork's founder Adam Neumann has introduced a new competitor to WeWork, called Flow, which is a more mature version of the company. Jason Moser is skeptical of Neumann's ability to succeed with this new venture. The conversation also touches on the importance of leadership and vision in companies that are trying to pivot or expand their business models.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 10:46 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/10/14/is-nike-laced-up-and-ready-to-go/)\n\n**WeWork Expands in Mexico, Sees Growth in Nearshoring Trend**\nWeWork, a multinational coworking space company founded in 2010 by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey, has faced challenges in recent years. However, under the leadership of John Santora, the company has expanded to 629 locations worldwide. In Mexico, WeWork has 22 buildings, with 14 in Mexico City, 4 in Guadalajara, and 4 in Monterrey, totaling over 200,000 square meters and hosting 5,000 companies with nearly 30,000 employees. The company's first location in Mexico was in the Varsovia building in the Juárez neighborhood, and it has since expanded to other areas, including Reforma, Polanco, and Mitikah. WeWork's CEO in Mexico, Karen Scarpetta, notes that the company has seen a significant increase in occupancy, from 30% in 2020 to 75% in 2024. Scarpetta attributes this growth to the company's flexibility and the increasing trend of 'nearshoring,' where US companies are using Mexico as a hub for technological development. WeWork is expected to continue this trend, with estimates suggesting that the company's spaces could triple in the next few years. In 2025, WeWork plans to focus on consolidation and expansion in the Mexican market.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[elsoldecuautla.com.mx](https://www.elsoldecuautla.com.mx/analisis/nombres-nombres-y-nombres-nearshoring-empuja-aqui-avance-de-wework-con-8-anos-mexico-lider-de-al-y-2025-etapa-de-consolidar-12684774.html)\n\n**Adam Neumann Launches New Company Workflow, Focused on Flexible Office Spaces**\nAdam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, has launched a new company called Workflow, which offers flexible office spaces.

Neumann's new company is part of Flow, a real estate company that he founded in 2022, which has received $350 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz. Flow has four residential buildings in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Atlanta, and has also established a property management arm. Workflow will offer shared workspaces and private offices for rent, and has already signed its first deal with a tenant in Fort Lauderdale. Neumann has learned from his previous experience with WeWork, where he was ousted in 2019 after the company's IPO was delayed. He has vowed to take a more cautious approach with Workflow, saying 'we're not trying to be the biggest, we're trying to be the best.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 07:45 AM\nSource:[aleqt.com](https://www.aleqt.com/2024/10/09/article_2751108.html)\n\n**WeWork's Adam Neumann Is Back -- and He's Launching a New Miami Condo Complex Called Flow House: See Inside the Luxury Units**\nAdam Neumann, the founder of WeWork, is back in the real estate market with a new luxury condo complex in Miami called Flow House. The 40-story building, scheduled to open in 2025, will offer 466 upscale units for sale, each with expansive floor-to-ceiling windows, luxurious bathroom finishes, and custom lighting packages. Flow House aims to provide a sense of community and connection, with amenities such as a social lounge, yoga studio, and conference room. According to Neumann, 'We learned while building Flow over the last two years that the exact same needs faced by renters are also faced by owners in terms of lack of community and lack of connectivity.' The complex will also feature a lobby bar, 24-hour resident service, and access to food and beverage services. Neumann's company, Flow, earlier this year offered to buy WeWork for $650 million.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 06:05 PM\nSource:[San Francisco Gate](https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/wework-s-adam-neumann-is-back-and-he-s-19821278.php)\n\n**Adam Neumann's New Venture Sounds a Lot Like WeWork**\nAdam Neumann, the co-founder of WeWork, is starting a new service called Workflow, which offers coworking spaces with a more sophisticated aesthetic.

Unlike WeWork, Workflow will rely on spaces within Flow's residential buildings, potentially reducing long-term lease expenses. Neumann stated, 'I am the kind of person who actually learns more from their mistakes than their successes,' and 'when people like being in a building, they stay.'

Workflow differs from WeWork in its aesthetic and business model, relying on spaces within Flow's residential buildings to minimize long-term lease expenses. Neumann stated, 'when people like being in a building, they stay. When people stay, it increases occupancy and the value.' Flow received a $350 million investment from Andreessen Horowitz in 2022, which pushed its valuation above $1 billion.

This approach aims to avoid the vulnerabilities that contributed to WeWork's downfall. Neumann has stated that he is approaching his new venture with humility and a focus on community-building, saying, 'The lack of community and the disconnection that people feel is even more relevant today.' He has also emphasized the importance of listening and slowing down, lessons he learned from his past experiences.

Four months after a failed attempt to re-buy his old company, Neumann launched Workflow, a coworking service that will directly compete with WeWork. According to Bloomberg, Workflow will focus on spaces in residential buildings that Neumann's real estate company, Flow, already owns or manages. This approach aims to avoid the long-term commitments associated with traditional leases. Neumann claims that Workflow is filling a gap in the market, driven by the growing demand for flexible workspaces post-pandemic. 'The lack of community and disconnection people feel is even more relevant today,' Neumann says, assuring that there is renewed demand for community-driven workspaces. Workflow is part of Flow, the real estate company Neumann founded in 2022, which has already received significant investments, including $350 million from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. Flow currently has four residential buildings in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Atlanta, and has expanded to international markets like Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The company is also starting to sell units in a condominium project in Miami. Flow's mission, according to Neumann, is to create connections between residents and provide easy access to amenities, which is extended to Workflow, offering integrated coworking spaces in its residential buildings. The goal is to blend living and working environments, with private offices and community coworking areas available to tenants and companies. Unlike WeWork, Neumann says he is approaching Workflow with more caution and discipline. 'I know my priorities because of what I've been through,' Neumann said, adding that his new approach is about 'slowing down' and listening more attentively. 'We're learning.

The company, which created ChatGPT, is not profitable and is expected to lose $5 billion this year. Despite this, investors such as SoftBank and Tiger Global Management have invested heavily in OpenAI, with SoftBank investing $500 million and Tiger Global Management investing $350 million. The deal has been compared to the failed investment in WeWork, which was led by SoftBank's Masayoshi Son. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has portrayed the for-profit transition as a natural part of the organisation's evolution, but it has led to intense internal turmoil. The company's revenue is expected to climb to $11.6 billion in 2025, but it is still in the early stages of financial maturation.

Neumann stated, 'The investment in Canada Global establishes a strategic partnership between Flow and Canada Global, aiming to create and develop world-class real estate projects outside of Israel, starting in the United States.' Flow plans to expand its US portfolio to six buildings by early 2025 and will oversee Canada Global's real estate activities outside of Israel.

Flow's expansion into Saudi Arabia has raised questions about Neumann's intentions and the potential impact on the local market. 'Flow is designed for everyone,' said Amy Stevens, Flow's spokesperson, in a statement to Forbes. 'The changes in the building design are to align with our brand.' Neumann has also hinted at plans to expand Flow to other countries, including the US. 'Arabia Saudita is almost like a startup,' Neumann said in a conference last year. 'Arabia Saudita has a founder. Not a founder, a prince.' Flow is not Neumann's first attempt at the co-living market, having launched WeLive in 2016, which was later shut down due to financial struggles.

Neumann's startup has opened its first properties in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with a focus on creating a community-driven living experience. The properties feature coworking spaces, yoga classes, and hotel-style cleaning services. Neumann's goal is to create a sense of community among residents, with services such as laundry and cleaning, as well as amenities like pools, gyms, and bowling alleys. Flow has also launched in Florida, with a focus on offering long-term rental contracts in eco-friendly buildings. The startup has received funding from Andreessen Horowitz and has plans to expand globally. Neumann's previous attempt at co-living, WeLive, was shut down after his departure from WeWork. Flow is seen as a new attempt by Neumann to enter the residential market, with a focus on community-driven living. 'Flow is designed for everyone. The changes in the building are to align it with our brand,' said Amy Stevens, Flow's spokesperson, in a statement to Forbes. 'We saw residential buildings and said, what if we use technology to operate the systems better, bring people who focus on hospitality... and run an apartment building like the Four Seasons, with that level of service?' Neumann said in an event in Saudi Arabia in October 2023. 'Arabia Saudita is almost like a startup,' Neumann said in a conference in March 2023, alongside his investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. 'Arabia Saudita has a founder. You don't call him a founder, you call him his highness,' Horowitz said in reference to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Flow has also organized events such as a 'cacao ceremony' and yoga classes, with the goal of creating a sense of community among residents. 'Join a art class, perfect that yoga pose or discover the hidden corners of our beloved city with your new friends,' Flow Riad posted on Instagram in August. Neumann has a history of investing in real estate, with a focus on co-living and community-driven living. He has also invested in a property management startup, Alfred, and acquired a rival startup, Carson, whose technology is now integrated into Flow. 'We are not and were not rivals,' said Stevens.

They have been able to accumulate this wealth through their retail business, which includes a chain of discount stores, supermarkets, and other retail outlets.

The company's strategy of selling everyday products at low prices has fueled the stellar run, and experts say it's not surprising to see the Waltons reap the rewards. The siblings, Jim, Rob, and Alice, rank among the world's 20 wealthiest people and have net worths in excess of $100 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. David King, a management professor at Florida State University, attributed Walmart's success to its value for money, ubiquity, and national logistics network. Art Weinstein, a marketing professor at Nova Southeastern University, credited Sam Walton's philosophy of centering the customer and the company's low prices, one-stop shopping experience, and supply chain expertise. The Waltons have retained more of the company over the years because Walmart has largely self-financed its scaling, unlike many tech companies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 09:04 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-stock-price-sam-walton-family-wealth-billionaires-retail-strategy-2024-10)\n\n**Forbes List Debunks the Myth of the Rich and the Poor**\nThe Forbes list reveals that the mantra of the left about the rich and the poor is incorrect. The list shows that 7 out of the 10 richest people in 2014 are no longer in the top 10 in 2024. This demonstrates that wealth is not static and that the rich are not always the same. Christy Walton, for example, lost 67% of her fortune and fell from the 9th position in 2014 to the 140th position in 2024. On the other hand, Elon Musk rose from the 158th position in 2014 to the 2nd position in 2024, with a fortune of nearly $200 billion.

His older brother, Rob Walton, has a net worth of $100.4 billion, while their sister, Alice Walton, has a net worth of $99.7 billion. The family's total net worth exceeds $350 billion. The three siblings have increased their net worth by $30 billion in 2024. The family has been investing in various new activities, including Rob Walton's purchase of the Denver Broncos in 2022 for a record $4.65 billion. They have also invested in converting their hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, into an outdoor arts and sports center. Rob Walton served as the president of Walmart's board of directors from 1992 to 2015 and was instrumental in the company's global expansion. Alice Walton has focused on collecting art and philanthropy, and has recently become the world's richest woman with a net worth exceeding $84 billion. She has donated around $5.7 billion to various foundations in the last decade and has founded the Crystal Bridge Museum of American Art. The three brothers no longer serve on Walmart's board of directors, but their diversified investments have contributed to the company's stock reaching historic highs, with a value of $80.60 per share.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 22, 2024 08:33 AM\nSource:[Lado.mx](http://lado.mx/noticia.php?id=16755367)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The period varies depending on the type of outstanding charge. For example, for debts related to the payment of IRPEF, IVA, IRES, Irap, or stamp duty, the cancellation occurs after 10 years. However, in this period, sanctions and interest are also calculated on the debt. For these, the cancellation occurs after 5 years. Many debts in 2025 will be canceled automatically due to the reform of the cancellation period. Specifically, debts considered uncollectible after 5 years due to the debtor's death, company bankruptcy, or debtor's nullity will be canceled automatically. For other debts, it is necessary to send a self-help request after receiving a payment reminder. As of January 1, 2025, the following debts will be canceled: tax notices issued from January 1, 2020, for local taxes; tax and duty notices issued from January 1, 2015; and car toll notices that expired before January 1, 2022. Additionally, from January 1, 2025, no more sanctions and interest will be applied to debts prior to 2021, but the debt itself must still be paid.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 17, 2024 03:09 PM\nSource:[Termometro Politico](https://www.termometropolitico.it/1623589_debiti-col-fisco-quali-vanno-in-prescrizione-nel-2025-elenco.html)\n\n**Bankruptcy Case Trial Adjourned Until January 15, 2025**\nThe T.C.

(NASDAQ:IHRT) shares have risen by almost 70% year-to-date. The company is restructuring its debt, which has removed an overhang on its stock, according to Bank of America Securities. Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich has upgraded the rating for iHeartMedia from Underperform to Neutral, while raising the price target from $1 to $3. Ehrlich stated that the company has entered into a 'transaction support agreement with a group of debt holders' to refinance at least 80% of its outstanding debt and extend maturities by three years. This will result in an overall debt reduction, with cash interest being kept 'essentially flat.' Ehrlich noted that this removes a significant overhang for shares, as the debt was approaching maturity and there were concerns regarding the company's ability to refinance its capital structure. The debt restructuring and better-than-expected 2025 guidance make the risk-reward 'more balanced,' Ehrlich said. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 05:31 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/41912203/iheartmedia-announces-debt-restructuring-analyst-turns-bullish-and-raises-forecast-3x)\n\n**iHeartMedia to Save $200M Annually Through Cost Cuts, Embrace of Technology**\niHeartMedia, the country's largest broadcast radio company, is expected to save $200 million annually in 2025 through cost cuts and the adoption of technology.

CEO Bob Pittman said, 'The transaction support agreement marks an important step in our effort to optimize our balance sheet, and it provides the company with the flexibility to remain focused on iHeart's transformation.' Technology is expected to reduce annual expenses by $150 million in 2025, while measures taken earlier this year will bring the total annual savings to $200 million. iHeartMedia's third-quarter revenue increased 5.8% to $1.01 billion, meeting the company's prior guidance of mid-single-digit growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 09:25 PM\nSource:[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/iheartmedia-earnings-radio-giant-save-200m-cost-cuts-tech/)\n\n**iHeartMedia Concludes Debt Restructuring Agreement**\niHeartMedia, Inc. has announced an agreement with the majority of its creditors to restructure its existing debt, a move aimed at improving the company's financial flexibility. The agreement, known as the Transaction Support Agreement (TSA), involves the media giant and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the iHeartMedia parties, and is supported by lenders and bondholders representing approximately 80% of the company's existing debt. iHeartMedia will offer exchange transactions to all holders of its existing debt, proposing to extend the maturity of the offered debt by three years. There are two alternative structures for the exchange transaction: one involves iHeartCommunications issuing new guaranteed debt, and the other, if participation thresholds are not met, will see new subsidiaries issue debt after the transfer of certain assets and an intercompany note. The company has also modified its asset-based loan facility (ABL) to adapt to the exchange transactions and related activities, including modifying certain clauses and provisions and increasing the interest rate. These modifications will take effect once specific conditions are met, including the completion of one of the TSA transactions. iHeartMedia plans to launch the exchange offer soon, although the exact timeline has not been specified. The company has filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing more details on the TSA, the ABL amendment, and related transactions. Legal and financial advisors have been engaged both for the company and for an ad hoc group of initial supporters, indicating the complexity and importance of the debt restructuring efforts. As iHeartMedia navigates its debt restructuring, recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to the company's financial situation. With a market capitalization of $274.97 million, the company's stock has experienced significant volatility. The company's revenue for the past 12 months up to the second quarter of 2023 was $3.75 billion, with a slight growth in revenue of 0.99% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the previous quarter. InvestingPro's advice highlights that the company's stock has taken a hit in the last week, with a total return on price over 1 week of -12.12%. This recent decline aligns with the company's announcement of its plans to restructure its debt, suggesting investor uncertainty about the outcome. Despite this short-term volatility, the stock has shown a strong return of 21.68% over the past three months, indicating a certain positive sentiment before the debt restructuring announcement. Another relevant advice from InvestingPro notes that analysts do not expect the company to be profitable this year. This perspective underscores the importance of the debt restructuring initiative, as iHeartMedia seeks to improve its financial flexibility and potentially pave the way for future profitability.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 12:55 PM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/company-news/iheartmedia-conclut-un-accord-de-restructuration-de-sa-dette-93CH-2634847)\n\n**iHeartMedia Reaches Agreement to Restructure Debt**\niHeartMedia, Inc. has announced an agreement with its major creditors to restructure its outstanding debt, a move aimed at improving the company's financial flexibility.

Kick-Ass was a precursor to edgier comic book adaptations like The Boys and Invincible, and it performed well at the box office, grossing $96 million worldwide on a budget of $30 million.

Considering the average theater commission of around 50% and the film's estimated budget of $110-150 million, these earnings would not be enough to cover the costs. The predictions are based on online discussions, ticket pre-orders, and general audience sentiment towards the film. While there is a possibility that the film may exceed expectations, the fact that all previous similar films from Sony Pictures have had mediocre quality and received average/low ratings from audiences suggests that the predictions may be adjusted downwards.

The movie's box office performance is expected to be surpassed by Red One, a Christmas comedy starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, which is projected to open with $20-40 million. Venom 3's opening weekend of $51 million was a franchise low, lower than Black Adam's opening weekend in 2022.

The film's success is part of Sony's cost-conscious strategy, which has reaped millions in profits from the Venom trilogy. However, this approach can be double-edged, as seen with the mixed results of other live-action Spider-Man spinoffs, such as Morbius and Madame Web. Comscore box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian notes that the quality of the movies, appeal of lesser-known characters, and marketing strategies are crucial to success. Venom: The Last Dance has propelled the franchise past $1.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales against a combined production cost of $330 million before marketing.

The research, published in the journal Nature on November 21, reveals that the exoplanet, IRAS 04125+2902 b, is only 300 million years old. The team, led by Madyson Barber from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and found that the exoplanet has a 8.83-day orbital period, a radius 10.7 times that of Earth, and a mass approximately 30% that of Jupiter. The researchers believe that it may be a precursor to the super-Earths and super-Neptunes commonly found orbiting main-sequence stars. Given the young age of the star and exoplanet, the unusual misaligned disk, and their proximity to Earth, they consider this system a valuable target for studying the early stages of planetary formation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 08:27 AM\nSource:[科学网](https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2024/11/534443.shtm)\n\n**The 5 Lives of the Earth: Season 1, Episode 4 - The Air**\nThe Earth is a haven for life due to its atmosphere, which protects it from the sun's rays and regulates the climate. However, the planet was initially barren and scorching, lacking a protective atmosphere. Water emerged and 'magic' occurred. By covering 70% of the globe's surface, it allowed the appearance of the first forms of life, including cyanobacteria that produce oxygen through photosynthesis. This process led to the 'Great Oxygenation', a critical period where oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere, radically changing the air's composition. In the upper atmosphere, this event formed a new protective molecule: ozone, which acts as a solar screen and contributes to the flourishing of life.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 12:04 AM\nSource:[tvmag.lefigaro.fr](https://tvmag.lefigaro.fr/programme-tv/programme/les-5-vies-de-la-terre-f1907899980)\n\n**Nearly a Third of All Stars May Contain The Remains of Planets Like Earth**\nNew research suggests that nearly a third of all stars may contain the remains of planets like Earth. The study, titled 'Metal pollution in Sun-like stars from destruction of ultra-short-period planets', found that rocky planets are the source of metal pollution in Sun-like stars. The authors, Christopher E. O'Connor and Dong Lai, propose that ultra-short-period (USP) exoplanets, which orbit their stars very closely and have similar compositions to Earth, are engulfed by their stars and release metals into the star's atmosphere. The researchers developed a model to predict the number of USPs that form and the time it takes for them to become engulfed, and their results favour the low-e migration scenario where USPs are part of compact, multi-planet systems. They also predict that there should be a correlation between pollution and compact, multi-planet systems, and an anti-correlation between USP occurrence and pollution. However, they note that more study is needed to understand how Hot Jupiters, gas-giant planets that orbit very closely to their stars, might contribute to stellar pollution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 03:57 AM\nSource:[ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-stars-may-contain-the-remains-of-planets-like-earth)\n\n**James Webb Space Telescope Makes Groundbreaking Discoveries in Astrophysics**\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made several groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astrophysics. The telescope has been able to detect the presence of the methyl cation (CH₃⁺) in a protoplanetary disk, a discovery that was predicted in the 1970s but never detected before. This finding is significant because the methyl cation is a precursor to the formation of complex organic molecules, which are the building blocks of life. The JWST has also detected the presence of hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and propyne (C3H4) in a protoplanetary disk. Additionally, the telescope has been able to study the composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets, including the detection of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere of the exoplanet WASP-39 b and water vapor (H₂O) in the atmosphere of the exoplanet GJ 9827 d. These discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of the formation of planets and the origins of life in the universe. 'The presence of methyl cation in a protoplanetary disk is a major discovery that could help us understand the origins of life on Earth,' said Olivier Berné, an astrophysicist at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetary Science.

The exoplanet, a super-Earth, is slightly larger and more massive than Earth, and was discovered in 2019 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The team used the James Webb Space Telescope to collect the exoplanet's atmospheric transmission spectrum, which suggests the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the atmosphere. This is in contrast to the atmospheres of rocky planets in our solar system, which are rich in nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. The researchers used computer models to simulate the conditions on L 98-59 d's surface, and found that the presence of molten lava or frequent volcanic activity could explain the observed atmospheric composition.

Currently, exoplanets are mostly detected through indirect methods, including the 'transit passage' technique, which measures the decrease in light caused by the planet's passage in front of the star. These decreases provide important information about the planet's atmospheric composition and habitability. In fact, this method can even reveal the presence of gases that could be indicative of life. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Roman Coronagraph was designed to observe these faint exoplanets. The device was installed on the primary mirror of the telescope and on the space bus that will transport the telescope to orbit.

High-resolution spectroscopy has empowered astronomers to detect minute features on the surface of exoplanets, including determining the velocity of winds, investigating thermal inversion layers, and unveiling critical information about orbital inclinations and rotations. The technique has also enabled the identification of molecular and atomic species within exoplanet atmospheres and detailed measurements of isotopologues. However, observing exoplanet atmospheres presents several challenges, including the alignment of the system for transit or secondary eclipse, and the planet orbital period constraining the observing cadence. High-resolution spectroscopy can improve reliability by better disentangling overlapping telluric features and concentrating spectral peaks on a few resolution elements while spreading background noise. The technique has been used to detect various molecules, including CO, HCN, TiO, and biomarkers, and map features in exoplanet atmospheres. Clouds and haze can disrupt spectral characteristics, but high-resolution spectroscopy can mitigate their effects by leveraging sensitivity to spectral line cores to probe regions situated at higher altitudes above the clouds. The study also discusses the challenges of detecting ozone () in exoplanet atmospheres, which is suggested to be a proxy of oxygen (), and the need for a spectrograph with a resolution of R=100,000 on an Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) to detect it within a 20-parsec radius. The investigation for TRAPPIST-1d could potentially be accomplished in approximately 16 to 25 years with traditional high-resolution spectrograph on three ELTs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 08:15 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78071-5)\n\n**ESA's Ariel Mission to Explore 1,000 Exoplanets**\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariel mission aims to study the atmospheres of over 1,000 exoplanets in detail.

They found that HWO can detect methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the Archean Eon, but not the presence of CO. However, they were able to robustly detect dinitrogen oxide (N 2 O) in the Proterozoic Eon, making it a strong biosignature candidate. The study highlights the importance of considering Earth analogs at different stages of its development and being cautious in making claims about potential detections of life.

The LIFE project, developed by Swiss experts from the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) since 2017, consists of five space telescopes to be placed in a Lagrange point 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. LIFE will use high-resolution spectroscopy to detect potentially habitable worlds by analyzing chemical compounds in the light spectrum. The mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s or later. The researchers have compiled a list of star systems for analysis by LIFE, including single and binary stars, as they are more likely to have planets with stable orbits. Red dwarfs were excluded from the list as they produce powerful flares and deadly X-ray radiation. The second group consists of star systems located in the most suitable region of the sky for observation by LIFE. For example, if a system is aligned with the Earth's orbital plane, it will be harder to study as the Sun will interfere during part of the year. The third group consists of 'golden targets' - systems with potentially habitable planets with atmospheres and excellent observation conditions.

If a reduced amount of CO2 is detected, it could be a sign of liquid water on the planet's surface. This discovery offers a solution to a problem that previously lacked a practical methodology. The CO2 in a planet's atmosphere can dissolve in oceans or be absorbed by a large biomass, such as on Earth. According to the researchers, this phenomenon suggests the presence of liquid water and could indicate that the planet has the necessary conditions to support life. Amaury Triaud, professor of exoplanetary science at the University of Birmingham, explained: 'It's relatively simple to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in a planet's atmosphere, as CO2 is a strong absorber of infrared radiation, the same phenomenon that is contributing to climate change on Earth.' By comparing CO2 levels in different planets, it is possible to identify those that could have oceans, making them more likely to support life. The presence of oxygen, a byproduct of carbon consumption by living organisms, can also be an indicator of life. Dr. Julien de Wit, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), noted that oxygen can transform into ozone, which has a detectable signature near CO2 in the atmosphere. 'Observing both gases at the same time can give us clues about habitability and the possible presence of life on that planet,' he said. This study has implications for understanding the effects of climate change on our own planet. Triaud highlighted that this method helps to compare the habitability of other planets with theoretical expectations, providing context on how CO2 levels affect habitability. As an example, he noted that although Venus and Earth are similar in size and composition, the high concentration of CO2 in Venus' atmosphere has made it inhospitable to life. This important scientific breakthrough has been published in the journal Nature Astronomy, opening new doors in space exploration and our understanding of the Earth's climate balance. The study not only offers a tool for detecting habitable planets but also for examining the environmental limits that can make a planet uninhabitable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 05:50 AM\nSource:[elimparcial.com](https://www.elimparcial.com/locurioso/2024/10/24/cientificos-descubren-una-nueva-y-mas-facil-forma-de-identificar-exoplanetas-habitables/)\n\n**The Detectability of CH4/CO2/CO and N2O Biosignatures through Reflection Spectroscopy of Terrestrial Exoplanets**\nResearchers used the ExoReLℜ code to simulate the detectability of CH4, CO2, CO, and N2O in the reflected light spectrum of an Archean and Proterozoic Earth-like planet.

This is foreshadowing some of the exciting work that we will see in the coming years,' said Brendan Bowler, an astronomer at The University of Texas at Austin. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 12:26 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/webb-telescope-just-snapped-view-090000628.html)\n\n**Astronomers Rush to Observe Exoplanet AF Lep b Before It Disappears**\nScientists from the University of Texas and Johns Hopkins University used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe AF Lep b, a gas giant exoplanet that will be invisible for the next decade. According to Kyle Franson, 'AF Lep b is just at the limit of what we can detect.' The team used the JWST's coronógrafo to block 90% of the light from the nearby star, allowing them to observe the faint planet. The researchers are excited about the new possibilities offered by the JWST, which has provided impressive images of the universe since its launch in 2022. As Brendan Bowler, co-author of the study, said, 'These data were obtained in the second year of JWST operations. There's much more to come.' The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 12:30 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/tecno/ciencia/2024/10/17/astronomos-apuraron-al-telescopio-james-webb-para-observar-un-exoplaneta-antes-de-que-desaparezca/)\n\n**James Webb Space Telescope Captures Exoplanet AF Leporis b Before It Disappears**\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has successfully photographed the exoplanet AF Leporis b (AF Lep b) before it disappears for 10 years. The exoplanet, which is about 23 million years old, has a mass of around 3.2 times that of Jupiter and a diameter of about 1.2 months of the gas giant. According to researcher Kyle Franson, 'The AF Lep b is well within the inner boundary of being detectable. Although it is extremely sensitive, the JWST is smaller than our largest ground-based telescopes. And we are observing at longer wavelengths, which has the effect of making objects appear more diffuse. It becomes difficult to separate one source from another when they appear so close.' The exoplanet is currently about 88 light-years away from Earth and appears as a small particle in the JWST photo. The JWST was able to observe the exoplanet directly due to its coronagraph, an instrument that blocks the light from the host star to facilitate the observation of the planet. The researchers aimed to study the exoplanet's atmosphere, as planets with similar masses to our gas giants are rare. However, the observation was a race against time, as the exoplanet is currently about 8 times farther from its star than the distance between Earth and the Sun, but its orbit is approaching the star and our perspective. The coronagraph of the JWST blocks 90% of the light from the AF Lep b due to the current distance between the planet and the star. As they approach, there will be a moment when the exoplanet will no longer be visible to the JWST. 'We are really pushing the instrumentation to its limits here,' said Brendan Bowler, a member of the team and astronomer at the University of Texas in Austin. The observations revealed that the exoplanet has a very active atmosphere, with convective currents mixing elements between its upper and lower levels. Additionally, more monoxide than expected was detected around the AF Lep b. The hypothesis is that strong ascending currents are the only way to bring the gas to the upper atmosphere of the planet.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 10:38 PM\nSource:[olhardigital.com.br](https://olhardigital.com.br/2024/10/14/ciencia-e-espaco/james-webb-consegue-observar-exoplaneta-antes-que-ele-desaparecesse/)\n\n**A New Way to Detect Rocky Exoplanet Atmospheres**\nA team of researchers, led by PhD student Qiao Xue from the University of Chicago, has developed a new method to detect rocky exoplanet atmospheres. The technique involves measuring the combined temperature of a star and the exoplanet just before the planet passes behind. If the temperature is lower than expected, it suggests that the planet has an atmosphere regulating its temperature. The team applied this method to the exoplanet GJ1132 b, 41 light years away, and found that it does not have an atmosphere. The study is a step towards finding Earth-like planets with atmospheres, which are key components for the development of life. As Dr. Qiao Xue noted, 'Atmospheres around Earth-like planets are key components for the development of life... The layer of gas surrounding rocky worlds insulates the planet and acts to regulate its temperature to.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 10:27 AM\nSource:[universetoday.com](https://www.universetoday.com/168850/a-new-way-to-detect-rocky-exoplanet-atmospheres/)\n\n**New Method Detects Atmospheres in Exoplanets, Bringing Us Closer to Finding Habitable Worlds**\nScientists from the University of Chicago have made a revolutionary breakthrough in the search for habitable planets outside our solar system. A new method, made possible by the James Webb Space Telescope, allows for more accurate detection of atmospheres in distant rocky planets, a crucial condition for life as we know it. According to Qiao Xue, the lead researcher, 'This year, with the data from the James Webb Space Telescope, we can observe a greater number of planets and expect to identify patterns that will help us better understand how atmospheres form.' The new method, which analyzes temperature fluctuations in the planet while it orbits its star, has been shown to be more effective and simpler than previous methods. The team used this technique to examine the exoplanet GJ 1132 b, which was found to have no atmosphere, making it an unlikely candidate for life. This discovery, although it rules out the possibility of life on this planet, demonstrates the effectiveness of the new approach. The team also compared this new method with another method that measures the light filtered through the planet's atmosphere, finding that the new method is more reliable and less susceptible to errors. The discovery of atmospheres in planets outside our solar system not only allows for the elimination of uninhabitable worlds but also provides clues on how these environments form and evolve in other star systems. 'This study is exciting because I finally had the opportunity to work with rocky planets, which are the dream topic of every exoplanet scientist due to their great potential for hosting life,' concluded Xue.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 07:30 AM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/ciencia-america/2024/10/10/como-un-nuevo-metodo-del-telescopio-webb-permite-detectar-atmosferas-en-exoplanetas/)\n\n**James Webb discovers a new and exotic steam world | Digital Trends**\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has discovered a new type of exoplanet called a 'steam world', which has an atmosphere almost entirely composed of water vapor. The planet, GJ 9827 d, is around twice the size of Earth and has a very different atmosphere from typical hydrogen and helium. According to researcher Eshan Raul, 'This is the first time we're ever seeing something like this.' The discovery was made possible by using Webb's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument, which can split light into different wavelengths to analyze the planet's atmosphere. This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for investigating diverse planetary atmospheres and could lead to the detection of atmospheres on habitable exoplanets in the future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 05:35 PM\nSource:[Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/space/james-webb-steam-world/)\n\n**New Method Unveils Simpler Approach to Detecting Atmospheres on Distant Exoplanets**\nAstronomers at the University of Chicago have developed a new, simpler method to detect atmospheres on rocky exoplanets, a key factor in determining their potential habitability. The research, led by Ph.D. student Qiao Xue, uses the James Webb Space Telescope to measure the temperature difference between an exoplanet's hottest side and its calculated theoretical maximum temperature. If the planet's actual temperature is lower than its theoretical maximum, it suggests the presence of an atmosphere that helps disperse heat. According to Xue, 'When we analyze a large enough data set, such as the one we'll get this year with the James Webb Space Telescope, we hope to uncover trends that will help us better understand atmosphere formation and what makes a planet habitable.' The new method is more efficient and reliable than previous techniques, and could help scientists better assess which exoplanets are most likely to support life. 'This study was exciting because I finally got to work with rocky planets, which are the dream subject of every exoplanet scientist since they hold so much potential for life,' Xue added.

The PLATO (Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) mission, led by the European Space Agency (ESA), aims to find exoplanets similar to Earth orbiting stars similar to the Sun. According to Ana Heras, the mission's coordinator, 'we don't really know what they are made of, if they are terrestrial or not, if they are aquatic planets, or if they are super-Earths.' The PLATO mission will use 26 cameras to observe a vast portion of the southern hemisphere, including approximately 200,000 stars located 1,000 light-years away. The telescope will take pictures of these stars every 25 seconds for two years, allowing scientists to determine the size, mass, and age of the exoplanets with high precision. The mission's primary detection method will be the observation of planetary transits, which involves detecting small variations in the brightness of the stars, indicating that a planet has passed in front of the star. The PLATO mission is scheduled to last for four years and will be followed by the Ariel mission in 2029, which will study the atmospheres of exoplanets in detail.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 28, 2024 01:28 AM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/nova-missao-deve-buscar-planetas-habitaveis-em-2026,c5e52d347c6593c58348372b299e92b7eamwc1pl.html)\n\n**PLATO Mission to Search for Habitable Exoplanets**\nThe PLATO mission, set to launch in December 2026, aims to find exoplanets similar to Earth by determining their size, mass, and age with unprecedented precision. According to Ana Heras, the scientific responsible for the PLATO program at the European Space Agency (ESA), 'the detection of exoplanets is very important, but for now, we don't really know what they're made of, if they're terrestrial or not, if they're water planets, if they're super-Earths.' The mission will observe 200,000 stars in the southern hemisphere, taking pictures every 25 seconds for two years. By detecting slight variations in the brightness of the stars, the satellite will be able to determine the size, mass, and age of the exoplanets. The goal is to find exoplanets that orbit their star in about one year and are likely to be in the habitable zone, where water can exist in liquid form on their surface. Catherine Vogel, responsible for the program at Thales Alenia Space, explains, 'it's like pointing a laser on a grain of sand at a kilometer distance without moving it' for months. The mission will be followed by Ariel, another ESA satellite that will study the atmospheres of exoplanets in detail in 2029.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 09:20 AM\nSource:[Bluewin](https://www.bluewin.ch/fr/infos/sciences-technique/exoplan-tes-la-mission-plato-en-qu-te-de-terres-habitables-2382415.html)\n\n**NASA Detects Mysterious Atmosphere on Super-Earth 55 Cancri e**\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope has detected possible atmospheric gases around the exoplanet 55 Cancri e, also known as Janssen. The Super-Earth, which orbits a star similar to the Sun, has a diameter almost twice that of Earth and a slightly higher density. The team used the telescope to measure subtle changes in the light of the system as the planet orbits the star, allowing them to calculate the amount of infrared light coming from the planet's daytime side. The results indicate that the planet's surface is likely a bubbling ocean of magma, and that the energy is being distributed from the daytime side to the nighttime side, possibly through a rich atmosphere of volatiles. The researchers believe that the gases covering 55 Cancri e are bubbling up from the planet's interior, rather than being present since its formation. They also think that the primary atmosphere of the planet was lost long ago due to high temperatures and intense stellar radiation, and that this is a secondary atmosphere that is being replenished continuously by the ocean of magma. Although 55 Cancri e is too hot to be habitable now, the researchers believe that it could provide a unique window to study the interactions between atmospheres, surfaces, and interiors of rocky planets, and possibly offer clues about the early conditions of Earth, Venus, and Mars.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 04:56 PM\nSource:[Metro Ecuador](https://www.metroecuador.com.ec/entretenimiento/2024/09/23/la-nasa-detecta-una-super-tierra-con-una-atmosfera-misteriosa-que-podria-ser-habitable-en-un-futuro-lejano)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The layoffs are a result of companies embracing AI and automation, leading to job losses in previously safe positions. The human impact of layoffs is significant, and the industry is seeing a shift in priorities. Some notable companies that have conducted layoffs include Meta, which laid off employees across multiple teams, and Intel, which cut 15,000 employees, 15% of its total staff. Other companies, such as WeTransfer, laid off 75% of its staff, and Rad Power, an e-bike startup, has conducted five rounds of layoffs since April 2021.

They also pointed out that Alphabet's planned counterproposals in December could lead to a more favorable outcome. Additionally, the bank noted that Alphabet trades at a discount to its break-up value and has a lower layoff risk compared to its peers, leaving room for growth in the BPA with the new CFO. Despite the challenges, Bank of America maintains a 'Buy' rating for Alphabet with a price target of $206.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 07:04 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Español](https://es.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amenaza-de-disolucion-de-google-hay-algo-positivo-en-la-medida-2863307)\n\n**Tech sector makes a comeback: Developer jobs return as hiring surges post-layoffs**\nThe tech sector, which faced layoffs and a hiring freeze, is now experiencing a comeback with tech giants and startups actively recruiting developers.

Companies like Microsoft, Google, Northvolt, Apple, IBM, Intel, Dell, and Luminar have implemented silent layoffs. The report highlights that companies use techniques like 'Work From Office' mandates to trigger job cuts without making official announcements. For example, Amazon's 5-day return-to-office mandate has led to nearly 1,900 employees looking for job changes. Google's 2023 layoffs, announced through a 2 AM email, became a PR nightmare and attracted negative press.

Companies such as Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap, and Microsoft have made significant layoffs in the first months of 2024. Even smaller startups have seen a considerable number of layoffs, and in some cases, have shut down operations entirely. The reason for the layoffs is the focus on artificial intelligence, which is accompanied by an increasing attention to costs. The layoffs in 2024 are targeted at sectors that are less profitable. According to McKinsey, by 2030, at least 14% of workers may need to change jobs due to digitalization, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The first companies that can afford to take this path are those that control, to a large extent, the development of the technologies they themselves must use. This is the necessary choice that guides the organizational restructuring that will lead to an increase in employees in more innovative areas and a reduction in employment in less profitable areas.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 10:20 AM\nSource:[Key4biz](https://www.key4biz.it/i-licenziamenti-nel-settore-tech-non-si-fermano-nel-2024-oltre-139mila-tagli-anche-colpa-dellai/506304)\n\n**Tech Layoffs Reach Alarming Levels in 2024**\nAccording to a study by BestBrokers, 211,033 employees have been laid off in 194 tech companies worldwide so far this year, in addition to the 260,000 layoffs registered in 2023. This brings the total number of tech layoffs between 2022 and 2023 to over 400,000, with a 59% increase in layoffs in the tech industry last year. Women have been disproportionately affected by these layoffs, with 56.9% of recent layoffs occurring in US-based companies. Dell, Intel, and Tesla are among the companies leading the trend, with 18,500, 15,000, and 14,000 layoffs, respectively, driven by fierce competition and declining sales. Google has also confirmed a new round of layoffs, citing a need to reduce costs and optimize investment performance. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in these layoffs, as companies seek to reduce costs and invest in AI, which is a rapidly growing area. Many young people who graduated with degrees in tech are now struggling to find work, and some are turning to non-tech jobs. According to a recent survey, three out of five workers fear losing their jobs in the next decade due to AI, and two out of five expect their salaries to decline as a result of AI.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 09:23 AM\nSource:[CubaSí](http://cubasi.cu/en/node/375629)\n\n**Thousands laid off in August and September in the technology sector as the global jobs bloodbath intensifies**\nThe tech industry has seen a massive wave of layoffs, with over 137,500 workers laid off by over 400 companies worldwide, according to Layoffs.fyi. This year, Google laid off over 12,000 workers, while Amazon announced a mandatory return to office for five-days-a-week scheduling starting January 2025. The layoffs are driven by the pressure from hedge funds, investment firms, and billionaires to drive up corporate valuations through 'restructuring' measures, i.e., the destruction of jobs. The working class is being targeted by the ruling class, with highly educated and skilled workers being treated as disposable. The wealth generated by the labor of the working class is concentrated in the hands of a shrinking elite, while tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook have seen their wealth soar. The layoffs in the tech sector are the result of the drive to maximize profits, often at the expense of long-term growth, stability, and workers' rights.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 04:08 AM\nSource:[World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/09/23/kbje-s23.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The layoffs will primarily affect Germany, where around 2,900 people will be let go, while 800 employees will be affected in the UK and 300 in the rest of the continent. Ford is particularly concerned about the passenger car business, which has suffered significant losses in recent years, and the transition to electric vehicles and new competition has been 'disruptive'. The company is also considering bringing back thermal and hybrid vehicles that could help revive the European division. 'We need a clear and unequivocal political agenda to promote electric mobility,' said John Lawler, Ford's financial director, in a letter to the German government. 'We lack investments in charging infrastructure, significant incentives to help consumers switch to electric vehicles, and more flexibility in meeting CO2 emission targets.' However, the company acknowledges that the lack of government support and economic incentives for electric vehicles has contributed to the crisis. 'The market is only growing when supported by generous incentives, often incompatible with state finances and the principle of subsidies,' said Lawler. 'These incentives end up helping wealthy car owners buy premium vehicles, such as Teslas.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 21, 2024 10:51 AM\nSource:[Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2024/11/21/ford-europa-entro-il-2027-licenziamenti-per-4-000-dipendenti-pesa-la-frenata-dellelettrico/7775909/)\n\n**4000 job cuts!

The job cuts will primarily be in Germany and the United Kingdom. According to Ford Europe vice president Peter Godsell, the company is experiencing 'weaker demand for electric vehicles than we had previously forecast and we continue to have challenges around our operating costs... so we need decisive action to restructure our business.' Ford's European sales dropped 17.9% through September this year, significantly more than the 6.1% loss in the industry as a whole. The company has called on the German government to provide more incentives and better charging infrastructure to help consumers transition to EVs, as EV sales in Germany fell 28.6% in the first nine months of this year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 06:37 PM\nSource:[etnownews.com](https://www.etnownews.com/companies/4000-job-cuts-us-based-auto-giant-plans-massive-layoffs-by-2027-evs-behind-this-decision-article-115499322)\n\n**Ford's Electric Vehicle Push Falters, 4000 Employees to be Laid Off**\nFord is facing a crisis after a failed attempt to transition to electric vehicles. As a result, 4000 employees in Germany and the UK will be laid off, just a month before Christmas. This is the second major layoff for Ford in a short period, following a reduction of 3800 employees in February 2023. Ford's sales have plummeted by 18% in Europe so far this year. The company is now calling for government assistance to help sell their electric vehicles. 'What we lack in Europe and Germany is a clear, unmistakable political agenda to promote e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives, and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 targets,' wrote Ford's CFO John Lawler in a letter to the German government, as reported by Reuters.\nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: November 20, 2024 01:59 PM\nSource:[carup.se](https://carup.se/fords-nya-elbilar-floppar-maste-saga-upp-4000/)\n\n**Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy Plan to Bring Back Federal Employees to the Office**\nElon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), plan to bring back federal employees who have been working remotely since the pandemic to the office five days a week. According to Ramaswamy, 'we will not even mention mass layoffs, we will just tell them they need to come back to the office five days a week from 8am to 6pm.' Ramaswamy believes that currently, employees 'do not go to work' and that he and Musk will use 'the air hammer and the electric saw' to 'clean up the bureaucracy' and save the billions that Trump needs but that, according to estimates by several economists, are impossible to recover. The plan is to force employees to return to the office, which will likely lead to a significant number of them quitting. Currently, two-thirds of the 2.2 million federal employees work remotely, but only 10% can do so full-time, while the rest must go to the office at least five days every two weeks. This policy was decided by Joe Biden in August 2023 to start bringing federal employees back to their pre-pandemic routines. Musk has been known for his anti-remote work stance, calling it 'morally wrong' and showing signs of intransigence at Tesla and X, formerly Twitter.

Analysts expect Tesla to sell more than 516,000 vehicles between October and December to reach its sales target, but deliveries could miss by as much as 2%.

Companies such as Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap, and Microsoft have made significant layoffs in the first months of 2024. Even smaller startups have seen a considerable number of layoffs, and in some cases, have shut down operations entirely. The reason for the layoffs is the focus on artificial intelligence, which is accompanied by an increasing attention to costs. The layoffs in 2024 are targeted at sectors that are less profitable. According to McKinsey, by 2030, at least 14% of workers may need to change jobs due to digitalization, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The first companies that can afford to take this path are those that control, to a large extent, the development of the technologies they themselves must use. This is the necessary choice that guides the organizational restructuring that will lead to an increase in employees in more innovative areas and a reduction in employment in less profitable areas.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 10:20 AM\nSource:[Key4biz](https://www.key4biz.it/i-licenziamenti-nel-settore-tech-non-si-fermano-nel-2024-oltre-139mila-tagli-anche-colpa-dellai/506304)\n\n**Tech Layoffs Reach Alarming Levels in 2024**\nAccording to a study by BestBrokers, 211,033 employees have been laid off in 194 tech companies worldwide so far this year, in addition to the 260,000 layoffs registered in 2023. This brings the total number of tech layoffs between 2022 and 2023 to over 400,000, with a 59% increase in layoffs in the tech industry last year. Women have been disproportionately affected by these layoffs, with 56.9% of recent layoffs occurring in US-based companies. Dell, Intel, and Tesla are among the companies leading the trend, with 18,500, 15,000, and 14,000 layoffs, respectively, driven by fierce competition and declining sales. Google has also confirmed a new round of layoffs, citing a need to reduce costs and optimize investment performance. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is a major factor in these layoffs, as companies seek to reduce costs and invest in AI, which is a rapidly growing area. Many young people who graduated with degrees in tech are now struggling to find work, and some are turning to non-tech jobs. According to a recent survey, three out of five workers fear losing their jobs in the next decade due to AI, and two out of five expect their salaries to decline as a result of AI.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 27, 2024 09:23 AM\nSource:[CubaSí](http://cubasi.cu/en/node/375629)\n\n**Thousands laid off in August and September in the technology sector as the global jobs bloodbath intensifies**\nThe tech industry has seen a massive wave of layoffs, with over 137,500 workers laid off by over 400 companies worldwide, according to Layoffs.fyi. This year, Google laid off over 12,000 workers, while Amazon announced a mandatory return to office for five-days-a-week scheduling starting January 2025. The layoffs are driven by the pressure from hedge funds, investment firms, and billionaires to drive up corporate valuations through 'restructuring' measures, i.e., the destruction of jobs. The working class is being targeted by the ruling class, with highly educated and skilled workers being treated as disposable. The wealth generated by the labor of the working class is concentrated in the hands of a shrinking elite, while tech billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook have seen their wealth soar. The layoffs in the tech sector are the result of the drive to maximize profits, often at the expense of long-term growth, stability, and workers' rights.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 04:08 AM\nSource:[World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/09/23/kbje-s23.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The state will need to provide more assisted-living facilities, nursing home beds, and medical facilities to meet the growing demand. Frank Rainwater, executive director of the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, said, 'On a state level, you will need more assisted-living facilities, more nursing home beds, more medical facilities.' The aging population will face increasing problems with access to healthcare services and reliable transportation. Jasper County, which is on the coast, may face the most dire crunch, with nearly 47 percent of the population expected to be 65 or older by 2040.

The latest drought monitor shows that parts of the Grand Strand are experiencing moderate drought conditions. According to the forecast, no significant rainfall is expected for at least the next week, and conditions are expected to worsen as we head into November. The U.S. Drought Monitor, a team effort since 1999, is produced jointly by the National Drought Mitigation Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 12:43 PM\nSource:[wmbfnews.com](https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/10/31/first-alert-drought-conditions-continue-worsen/)\n\n**How South Carolina’s population has changed since 2020 and what it could mean for the election**\nSouth Carolina's population has grown by over 250,000 people since 2020, making it the fastest-growing state in the nation. The influx of new residents, mostly from neighboring Georgia and North Carolina, has raised questions about how the shifting electorate could impact the 2024 election. Despite the growth, fewer people are registered to vote than in 2020, and the newcomers who have registered are disproportionately Republican. However, population declines are happening in rural areas, primarily in the Pee Dee region, where Democrats tend to lean more heavily. The state is also seeing a shift in the average age of people moving to the state, with a growing number of retirees flocking south in search of warmer weather and lower taxes. Whether this has any electoral impact will primarily depend on turnout, according to Kirk Randazzo, a political science professor at the University of South Carolina. 'The 65 and older crowd is much more reliable in terms of showing up to vote,' he said. 'And the younger demographic tends to not show up, especially if there are obstacles or inconveniences that kind of stand in the way of casting their vote.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 09:37 PM\nSource:[wjbf.com](https://www.wjbf.com/news/south-carolina-news/how-south-carolinas-population-has-changed-since-2020-and-what-it-could-mean-for-the-election/)\n\n**Dry Weather Patterns: What's causing our extended drought**\nThe Southeast, including South Carolina, is experiencing an extended drought due to dry weather patterns. La Niña is contributing to this by favoring conditions that keep rain systems away from the region. La Niña has brought in more high-pressure activity, which pushes rainstorms away and keeps the skies clear and dry. As a result, the region is experiencing a lack of tropical activity, reducing the chances for relief from heavy rains in late summer or early fall. This is making it even more challenging for South Carolina to receive the rain it needs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 10:48 PM\nSource:[WLTX News 19 Columbia](https://www.wltx.com/article/weather/dry-weather-patterns-extended-drought/101-26671745-3e11-41ce-a527-aadbc04ea917)\n\n**FIRST ALERT: 27 days without measurable rainfall, drought conditions starting to worsen**\nThe southeastern United States is experiencing severe drought conditions, with 37% of South Carolina under 'Abnormally Dry' conditions and 8% under moderate drought conditions. The region has seen 27 days without measurable rainfall, and the drought monitor has expanded and intensified drought conditions in several areas. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, drought conditions were expanded in Alabama, and moderate drought was introduced in parts of coastal South Carolina. The forecast looks dry for the next 10 days, with only a slight chance of isolated showers. As stated by the U.S. Drought Monitor, 'it takes a complete 180° flip of the weather pattern to bring significant changes.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 12:38 PM\nSource:[wmbfnews.com](https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/10/24/first-alert-27-days-without-measurable-rainfall-drought-conditions-starting-worsen/)\n\n**North Carolina Drought Worsens, Leaving Residents Without Access to Clean Water**\nA severe drought in North Carolina has left residents struggling to access clean water, with many relying on bottled water or driving long distances to collect it. The drought has also affected healthcare facilities, with some forced to shut down due to a lack of water. According to Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, director of the Center for Climate and Weather Extremes at Columbia University, 'This is not just a drought, it's a drought of the highest order.' The drought has led to an increase in respiratory problems, with many residents experiencing symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 60% of Americans have at least one underlying health condition, and 40% have multiple conditions, making them more susceptible to illness. The drought has also exacerbated existing health issues, with a surge in cases of heart disease and pneumonia. In North Carolina, over 230 people have been affected by the drought, with 17 reported deaths in Florida's Miami-Dade County. The drought is expected to worsen, with the National Weather Service predicting a high chance of severe weather events in the coming weeks.\nOriginal language: Unknown\nPublish date: October 20, 2024 02:21 PM\nSource:[shuud.mn](https://www.shuud.mn/a/558142)\n\n**Severe drought in southern Africa leaves 15m people in urgent need of food aid**\nA severe drought in southern Africa, caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, has left 15 million people in urgent need of food aid, starting this month. The region, which includes countries such as Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Angola, Botswana, and Lesotho, is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 22 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with 2 million children suffering from acute malnutrition. The WHO report notes that the food stocks of countries in the region have reached a critical point, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis. The situation is expected to worsen in the coming months, with an increase in disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, and measles. The drought has also led to an energy crisis, with countries such as Namibia and Zambia experiencing daily power outages. The region is expected to be under the influence of the La Nina weather phenomenon next month, which could lead to above-average heavy rainfall, but also potential floods and waterlogging that could affect agriculture.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 11:07 AM\nSource:[nation.com.pk](https://www.nation.com.pk/16-Oct-2024/severe-drought-in-southern-africa-leaves-15m-people-in-urgent-need-of-food-aid)\n\n**Drought in Southern Africa: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Public Health Situation Analysis (PHSA) (14 October 2024) - Angola**\nThe 2024 El Niño event has caused widespread drought conditions in southern Africa, affecting countries such as Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The drought has led to severe food shortages, limited access to clean water, disease outbreaks, and loss of livestock. According to FEWS NET estimates, nearly 23 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique being the most affected. It is estimated that between 14.0 and 14.9 million people will need urgent humanitarian assistance during the lean season from October to December 2024. The drought has also led to the displacement of thousands of people, disease outbreaks, and significant impacts on agriculture. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing cholera epidemic and the emerging risk of mpox, which may divert resources and response efforts away from the drought response in some affected countries. 'The situation has relatively stabilized', but water shortages are undermining hygiene and sanitation efforts, and the risk of cholera outbreaks remains in countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. The drought may also increase the risk of HIV and AIDS transmission, mental health issues, and gender-based violence, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced preparedness and response mechanisms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 09:27 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/angola/drought-southern-africa-angola-botswana-lesotho-malawi-mozambique-namibia-zambia-zimbabwe-public-health-situation-analysis-phsa-14-october-2024)\n\n**South America Faces Severe Drought, Power Outages, and Economic Consequences**\nThe International Center for Research on the El Niño Phenomenon has released a report on the drought affecting South America. The report states that the region is experiencing a more severe drought than in previous years. August 2024 was the warmest month on record, with temperatures breaking global records for the 15th consecutive month. The prediction for October is that there will be above-normal rainfall in the Pacific region of Colombia and southern Brazil, but below-normal rainfall in northeastern South America, the coast of Ecuador, the Amazon, and central and southern Chile. The drought, caused by a lack of precipitation, has kept some of the country's reservoirs below historical levels, affecting the production of hydroelectric energy. As a result, the country has been experiencing power outages since September, lasting up to 10 hours a day. The forecast is not encouraging until December. 'In the next quarter (October to December 2024), temperatures are expected to be above normal in most of South America, especially in northern Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, the Titicaca basin, eastern Amazonia, and northwestern Argentina.' The report also states that there will be below-normal rainfall in Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, eastern Amazonia, western Ecuador, southern Brazil, and central and southern Chile. The drought has already affected communities in the Sierra and Amazon regions, with over 4,000 hectares of land burned, including crops and pastures. The consequences of the drought include transportation disruptions, food insecurity, water shortages, and reduced air quality. The report notes that the drought is more severe than in 2023, when the Amazon experienced its worst drought on record. 'This affects transportation, food security, water provision, and access to services. More than 2.5 million hectares of Amazonian forest were burned in the month, almost double the historical average, causing populations in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay to be affected by smoke and reduced air quality.' The report also mentions that the level of Lake Titicaca remains below historical averages, with a 17-centimeter drop in August due to scarce rainfall and high solar radiation. 'The river flows of Ramis, Coata, and Ilave, tributaries of the lake, have deficits of 51%, 83%, and 30% compared to their historical averages.' The report concludes that the drought is a prolonged decrease in water resources in a given region, which has socio-economic consequences. Its impact depends on the population's preparation and the characteristics of the region's economic activities in relation to their water consumption. The report classifies drought as a physical phenomenon into four categories: meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socio-economic.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 07:20 PM\nSource:[EL UNIVERSO](https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/informes/cortes-de-luz-la-sequia-seguira-con-precipitaciones-por-debajo-de-lo-normal-en-el-ultimo-trimestre-del-ano-segun-pronosticos-nota/)\n\n**SC legislature won’t return early for Helene special session**\nSouth Carolina's legislature is not planning to hold a special session to address the damage from Hurricane Helene before January 2025. Senate President Thomas Alexander said it's premature to estimate the financial impact of the storm, but by January, they will have a better handle on the costs. The state has over $300 million in reserves for unexpected expenses. The damage estimate from Helene has surpassed $250 million, with over 5,200 homes damaged and more than 300 destroyed. Homeowners and renters in 23 counties are eligible for individual assistance from FEMA. Nearly 30 counties have been approved for public assistance, which covers local government costs like debris removal. Agencies such as the Department of Transportation and the National Guard will need help to cover costs from storm response and recovery. Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers said all farmers in South Carolina have taken a hit this year due to the summer drought, Debby, and Helene. Lawmakers are considering supplemental assistance for farmers and whether to incentivize utilities to bury powerlines, but said it's too soon to know.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 11:35 PM\nSource:[live5news.com](https://www.live5news.com/2024/10/08/sc-legislature-wont-return-early-helene-special-session/)\n\n**UN Prepares for Drought Conference, Highlights Human-Made Causes**\nThe United Nations is searching for a solution to stop or at least slow down the spread of drought periods. A partial answer was prepared in Geneva this week, but not given. Delegates from all countries that have joined the UN Convention against the Spread of Drought (UNCDD) have been negotiating in climate-controlled rooms. The four-day meeting ('Drought Resilience +10') in Geneva did not result in breakthroughs, but it laid the groundwork for the conference of contracting states in December. The goal is to adopt a binding final document that obliges individual states to fight droughts according to a global plan and with joint forces. This includes cross-border planning of measures against drought, building early warning systems, joint crisis management, management of water resources, grasslands, and forests. The UNCCD aims to finalize this document in a few weeks and will discuss the causes of droughts in December in Riyadh. Droughts are human-made, caused by climate change, overuse of land, urbanization, excessive irrigation, deforestation, and soil degradation. The UN estimates that 90% of the world's population will be affected by drought, heat, and their consequences by 2100, and that the number of people suffering from extreme heat combined with drought will more than double. Even if the global average temperature increase is limited to 1.5°C by the end of the century, 120 million people will still suffer from extreme heat. The UN has calculated that managing water resources can save up to $1.4 trillion worldwide, protecting mangroves can save an additional $1 trillion, and making new infrastructure more resistant to heat and drought can save $4 trillion. The drought in South America is particularly severe, with the Amazon River's water level at 4.5 meters below the normal level. This has cut off hundreds of smaller towns and villages, forcing residents to walk for hours under the scorching sun to buy groceries. The European satellite program Copernicus has reported that the Amazon rainforest has emitted three times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to extensive forest fires, a record not seen since 2010 in Brazil and not seen in the past 25 years in Bolivia.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 05:02 AM\nSource:[diepresse.com](https://www.diepresse.com/18929508/was-ein-ausgeduennter-amazonas-und-ein-beschauliches-genf-gemeinsam-haben)\n\n**Candidates Commit to Climate Action Ahead of 2024 Elections**\nWith the recent floods in the South, the long drought in the country, and the wildfires of probable criminal origin in various regions, the climate issue has become a pressing concern for the population in 2024. As a result, initiatives have emerged to promote candidates committed to addressing climate change. Áurea Carolina, ex-vereadora and director of Nossas, emphasizes that 'democracy and social rights cannot be discussed without considering the consequences of climate inequality.' The organization has created the Vote pelo Clima platform, which brings together candidates who have committed to developing policies for energy transition, environmental protection, and urban adaptation to reduce tragedies. Over 1,000 candidatures from various parties have been registered, with no restrictions on party affiliation. Another initiative, the Bancada do Clima, was created by members of the Rede, PSDB, and PSOL parties, and currently has over 240 candidates in 26 states. Mercedes Bustamante, professor at the UnB, highlights the importance of municipal policies in addressing climate change, citing examples such as the creation of an inventory to identify pollution sources and project ways to reduce impact. Victor Marchezini, professor at the Unesp, emphasizes the need for municipalities to prepare for extreme climate conditions, with detailed plans for prevention and response to crises.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 03, 2024 03:18 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2024/10/plataformas-reunem-candidatos-comprometidos-com-o-clima-nas-eleicoes-municipais.shtml)\n\n**Drought in South of Sonora Threatens Thousands of Jobs**\nThe drought in the South of Sonora is putting thousands of jobs at risk, as the area's agricultural production is expected to be severely reduced. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), around 400,000 people are employed in agriculture in Sonora each year, with at least half of them working in the South of the state. However, due to the drought, the area that will be planted in the 2024-2025 cycle is expected to be only 13% of the usual 300,000 hectares. Luis Jesús Valenzuela, a 48-year-old farmer, expressed his concern about the lack of work, saying, 'It's hard to believe that there's no work, because every year there's a shortage of people, but never a shortage of work.' Luis Cruz Carrillo, president of the Yaqui River Irrigation District, stated that the situation is 'very discouraging' and that there is no possibility of improvement before the start of the agricultural cycle on October 10. He added that the three dams in the Yaqui River system are at 19% of their capacity, compared to 40% at the same time last year. Cruz Carrillo emphasized that there will be a 'serious shortage of circulating funds for the economy of the South of the state' and that 4.5 million workdays will not be given due to the lack of planting. Omar Cruz Guillén, secretary of the Alianza Campesina del Noroeste (Alcano), expressed that the situation affects not only farmers but also the entire community, as the two valleys generate at least 20 million pesos per cycle and the reduction will have a 'grave economic impact' of over 12 million pesos. He called on the federal government to apply an emergency plan to support those affected by the drought.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2024 03:38 PM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL](https://www.elimparcial.com/son/ciudad-obregon/2024/09/23/estan-en-riesgo-miles-de-empleos-por-falta-de-siembras-en-el-sur-de-sonora)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."
