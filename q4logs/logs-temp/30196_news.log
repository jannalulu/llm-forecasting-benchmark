**Bausch Health Companies' SWOT analysis: debt woes cloud strong Q3 stock performance By Investing.com**
Bausch Health Companies Inc. (BHC) has shown a mix of strong financial performance and ongoing challenges, particularly related to its debt structure. The company reported revenues of $2.51 billion in Q3 2024, a 12% year-over-year increase and 9% organic growth. However, its high debt leverage of approximately 7x and upcoming debt maturities in 2025-2026 pose significant risks to the company's future growth prospects. BHC's management has been actively evaluating options to maximize the value of its equity stake in Bausch+Lomb (BLCO) for shareholders, which could lead to significant upside for the company. Despite these efforts, the company faces risks from potential generic competition, particularly for its key products like Xifaxan, and its high debt levels may limit its ability to invest in research and development. Successful execution of BHC's strategic initiatives could significantly boost shareholder value, but the company's debt issues and the possibility of bankruptcy proceedings could delay or even halt this process.

**TPG, Blackstone bid for Bausch + Lomb in potential $14 billion deal**
Private equity firms TPG and Blackstone are teaming up to bid for Bausch + Lomb in a potential $14 billion deal, managed by Goldman Sachs. The sale aims to address disputes related to Bausch Health's large debt. Bausch + Lomb is expected to generate significant revenue from its contact lenses and eye care drugs. According to sources, offers are likely to value Bausch + Lomb at an enterprise value between $13 billion and $14 billion, translating to up to $25 per share. The company closed Friday trading at $19.47 per share. Goldman Sachs is managing the sale process to resolve tensions between Bausch Health's shareholders and creditors. Formal bids are expected by the end of the month, though sources indicated that there is no certainty that a deal will be finalized. 'The spin-off of Bausch + Lomb has been stalled due to concerns that losing its more profitable subsidiary could leave Bausch Health insolvent, given its $21 billion debt load,' said a source. Bausch Health faces $10 billion in debt maturities before 2027, with a $2.4 billion fixed-rate loan due next year being the most pressing.

**TPG and Blackstone team up to bid for eyecare company Bausch + Lomb**
Private equity groups TPG and Blackstone are teaming up to bid for eyecare company Bausch + Lomb, with a potential deal valued at $13-14 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The bid comes as Bausch + Lomb's parent company, Bausch Health, is struggling with a $21 billion debt pile and has been put up for sale to resolve an impasse over a separation. TPG already owns ophthalmology company BVI Medical, and Blackstone has expressed interest in buying Bausch + Lomb before it went public in 2022. Formal bids are expected by the end of the month, but it is still possible that a deal may not occur. Bausch + Lomb's chief executive, Brent Saunders, has said that the company is 'a great asset' and that he is 'excited' about the potential sale. However, some creditors, including Apollo Management and Elliott Management, have expressed concerns about the sale and have opposed a spin-off process. 'A sale would allow Bausch Health to pay down its debts and potentially pay a special dividend to shareholders,' said one person familiar with the matter. However, this move would likely rankle creditors.

Icahn's investment firm, Icahn Capital LP, holds a $242.01 million stake in BHC. Despite concerns about the company's financial position, including potential bankruptcy and the sale of its eye care unit, BHC delivered mixed second-quarter results with revenues up 11% yearly to $2.4 billion. However, its consolidated operating income fell to $389 million, and net income attributable to shareholders fell to $10 million.
