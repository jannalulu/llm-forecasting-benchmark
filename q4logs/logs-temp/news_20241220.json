National Weather Service meteorologists predict the mercury to drop into the mid-50s on Friday and Saturday nights, with daytime highs near 70 degrees through Sunday. Cooler overnight temperatures in the low 50s are possible in western areas of Palm Beach County. The rain chances fall to 30% on Thursday night and then drop to near 0 on Saturday, with downpours and rainfall totals of up to 3 inches possible in South Florida. Ana Torres-Vazquez, a meteorologist with the NWS office in Miami, said, 'It's looking like it's not going to be the strongest front of the season and there is still some uncertainty on timing.' The rain may be welcome, as nearly the entire Peninsula and Panhandle are considered either abnormally dry or suffering moderate drought. 'Because the rain will be falling over about a 72-hour time period, widespread flooding is unlikely, but there is a potential for localized flooding,' Torres-Vazquez said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 11:27 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/cold-front-squally-showers-passes-101019416.html)\n\n**Rain with some snow mixing in this morning; colder this weekend**\nA messy start is expected across the Miami Valley on Wednesday, with rain and snow mixing in during the morning hours.

Experts explained, 'These conditions will be beneficial for crops, as they will contribute to maintaining an adequate soil moisture availability, especially for crops in critical development stages.' However, they also warned that the risk of excessive moisture should not be overlooked, as it can lead to the proliferation of plant diseases. To mitigate these risks, agricultural institutions recommended that producers conduct regular monitoring to identify potential infestation hotspots and implement optimized measures to protect crop productivity.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 17, 2024 11:30 AM\nSource:[pontaporainforma.com.br](https://www.pontaporainforma.com.br/pronostican-condiciones-de-lluvias-beneficiosas-para-los-cultivos-en-fase-de-desarrollo/)\n\n**South Florida under NEXT Weather Alert due to flooding concerns over next few days**\nThe CBS Miami NEXT Weather Team has issued a NEXT Weather Alert due to the potential for scattered showers and storms that could lead to flooding concerns in South Florida from Tuesday to Thursday.

According to experts, the phenomenon is likely to develop in late 2024 or early 2025, with potential effects lasting until spring. The 'La Niña' phenomenon can bring extreme cold, snow, and polar air, with a 57% chance of this occurring between December 2024 and January 2025, according to a recent report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The north of Mexico tends to experience drier conditions during 'La Niña', which can affect agriculture, water availability, and increase the risk of forest fires. In contrast, the southern and southeastern regions of Mexico typically receive more rainfall during 'La Niña', which can lead to flooding and landslides. Robert Molleda, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Miami, notes that the combination of 'La Niña' in the Pacific and the warm waters of the Atlantic can lead to an increase in hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. 'La Niña' is a climate pattern that occurs in the tropical Pacific Ocean, characterized by cooler-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial region. This disrupts global climate patterns, influencing temperatures and precipitation in various regions worldwide. The phenomenon does not follow a fixed interval, but generally occurs every 2 to 7 years. The last time a similar event occurred was between 2020-2021.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 03, 2024 08:08 PM\nSource:[MVS Noticias](https://mvsnoticias.com/nacional/2024/12/3/fenomeno-de-la-nina-cuando-sera-su-impacto-en-mexico-que-provocara-668304.html)\n\n**Miami Weather Forecast for December 2**\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has released the weather forecast for Miami on December 2.

In Northern California, over 20 inches of rain fell in some areas, while in the western US, more winter alerts were issued. In the eastern part of the country, drivers are dealing with treacherous conditions on the roads, with some areas expecting up to two feet of snow by Saturday night. According to AAA, nearly 80 million people will travel 50 miles or more this week, a new record, and the Transportation Security Administration expects a record-breaking 18 million-plus passengers will fly between this coming Tuesday and Dec. 2. Travelers are advised to prepare for delays and have an emergency kit inside their vehicles. As one traveler, Kate Hansalman, said, 'So far, it’s been really smooth. I mean, I think we’re ahead of schedule enough that we’re probably not hitting too much of the holiday traffic, which is nice, but I assume probably later this week, it will get busier.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2024 04:07 AM\nSource:[wsvn.com](https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/long-lines-at-mia-as-bad-weather-threatens-to-snarl-travel-plans-across-us-ahead-of-thanksgiving/)\n\n**La Niña expected to deliver warmer, drier South Florida winter**\nA weak and short-lived La Niña is expected to emerge in December, leading to a warmer and drier winter in South Florida. According to Robert Molleda, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Miami office, 'So warmer and drier from now all the way through April. In fact, the models are indicating that it's possible that the February to April period could tilt a little drier.' La Niñas typically push the jet stream further north, resulting in less stormy weather. The region is in good shape for water supply, but water managers are keeping an eye on Lake Okeechobee, the primary dry season source for freshwater. The Army Corps will allow the lake to recede to help it recover from high wet season levels, said Maj. Cory Bell, district deputy commander for the Corps' Jacksonville District. 'As we move forward in the dry season, we're looking at lake recovery operations, and we will communicate that with our stakeholders,' he said. With a rainy season delivering about 120% of normal rainfall, water restrictions look unlikely, according to South Florida Water Management District officials.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 19, 2024 02:57 PM\nSource:[wlrn.org](https://www.wlrn.org/environment/2024-11-19/south-florida-winter-weather)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

How much more rain can we expect this weekend?**\nRecent rain in Houston has eased the drought in the area, with widespread rainfall totals of 2-5 inches observed across Southeast Texas in the first eight days of November. The rain is expected to continue this weekend, with Saturday being the rainiest day. However, the rain should not be a major issue for most outdoor plans, except for those that require indoor space. The rain is expected to clear up by early next week, with mostly sunny skies and high temperatures nearly 10 degrees warmer than usual. A stronger cold front is expected to arrive by the middle of next week, bringing temperatures and humidity down. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the recent rainfall has reduced drought levels in Southeast Texas, with 87% of the area now in moderate drought, down from 83% in severe drought just a week ago. As one meteorologist noted, 'It will depend on your destination and what time you are venturing out' when it comes to deciding whether to cancel outdoor plans due to the rain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 10:00 AM\nSource:[houstonchronicle.com](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-weather/forecast/article/saturday-drought-improves-weekend-showers-19897398.php)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."
