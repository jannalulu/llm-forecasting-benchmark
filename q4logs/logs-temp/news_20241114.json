Beijing's Response Could Be a New Currency War.**\nAs Asia prepares for the potential impact of a new Trump administration, Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People's Bank of China, will face significant challenges in navigating the economic shocks that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened. Trump's plans, including 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and a weaker dollar, could lead to a currency devaluation by China on a scale the global financial system has never encountered. This could have far-reaching consequences, including a potential new currency war. China's economy is already facing significant challenges, including a deepening property crisis, record youth unemployment, and dangerously high local-government debt. The timing of these challenges could not be worse, as Trump's administration is expected to be more aggressive in its trade policies. Pan's team will need to carefully manage the yuan to avoid a currency war and maintain economic stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 05:42 PM\nSource:[MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/china-trade-war-retaliation-rmb-tariffs-trump-a2f413db)\n\n**How can China unleash the spending power of its millions of migrant workers?**\nEconomists and academics urged China to step up 'people-centred urbanisation' and economic deregulation to boost domestic demand. Chi Fulin, president of the China Institute for Reform and Development, said, 'People-centred urbanisation is the fundamental solution to China's current domestic demand shortage.' He suggested filling public service gaps to empower China's nearly 300 million migrant workers, who could then power significant consumption. Chi emphasized the importance of incremental policies focused on people, rather than infrastructure, to boost consumption confidence and create long-term momentum for expanding domestic demand.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 09:30 AM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3286402/deregulation-migrant-workers-hold-key-boosting-demand-china-academics)\n\n**Prospects remain challenging for new graduates**\nA recent graduate, Guo, from the University of California, Los Angeles, and Johns Hopkins University, found it challenging to find a job in her field of consulting, despite her strong academic background. After sending her resume to over 50 companies, she received fewer than 10 responses. Guo noted that 'the job market feels vastly different from academia' and that hands-on experience is increasingly essential. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's unemployment rate for the urban labor force age 16 to 24 was 17.6 percent in September. Experts, including Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of the NBS, and Wang Ting, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, highlighted structural issues in the labor market, including changes in labor demand and technological unemployment. The government has introduced guidelines to expand employment channels for youth, including promoting vocational education and encouraging entrepreneurship. Guo hopes for more support for overseas students, including online interview opportunities and precise information-sharing platforms to understand domestic employment trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 01:13 AM\nSource:[China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/13/WS6733f9a8a310f1265a1cd014.html)\n\n**China's Labor Market: Challenges and Opportunities**\nThe new e-book by China Files explores the world of work in China, from the state of the economy to pension reform, amidst a high youth unemployment rate and new generations seeking to make their way in a constantly changing job market. The e-book examines the main themes of the world of work in China, starting from the state of the Chinese economy, which is slowing down. 'For the first time in a long time, children think they might have it worse than their parents,' we write in the opening article of the e-book. The youth unemployment rate remains high, and more and more Chinese girls and boys are turning to 'blue-collar' jobs, giving up or abandoning a stressful career in large companies to seek a more peaceful life with more free time. However, things are not always going well outside of offices, as is the case for many delivery workers and gig-economy workers. Meanwhile, Beijing has tried to give the economy a boost by gradually raising the retirement age, a policy that has created many complaints among the population. It remains to be seen if it will be enough. The e-book includes articles by Lorenzo Lamperti, Sabrina Moles, Francesco Mattogno, Vittoria Mazzieri, and Alessandra Colarizzi.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 12, 2024 08:40 AM\nSource:[china-files.com](https://www.china-files.com/cina-e-lavoro-gli-e-book-di-china-files-n29/)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases, But Economy Still Faces Challenges**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has decreased to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (BNS). However, this rate is still very high and the second highest of the year. The decrease is partly due to a change in methodology, as students and high school students are no longer included in the calculation. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group is significantly higher than in June (13.2%), which is likely due to the fact that nearly 12 million students graduated from university in China in June, increasing the number of people on the job market. The BNS also reported a decrease in unemployment rates for other age groups, including 25-29 year olds (6.7% in September, down from 6.9% in August) and the overall national unemployment rate (5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August). These numbers, which only account for urban areas, offer a glimmer of hope for China's economy, which has been struggling. The country is also facing low prices and a risk of deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 0.4% in September over the past year, down from 0.6% in August. The BNS also reported a 2.8% decrease in factory gate prices in September over the past year, a decline that has been ongoing since the end of 2022. However, retail sales, which are the main indicator of household consumption, rebounded by 3.2% in September over the past year, after a 2.1% increase in August. The Chinese authorities have recently announced a series of measures to stimulate economic activity, including interest rate cuts and relaxations on property purchases. The People's Bank of China has also announced a 'swap' program for insurance companies and investment funds, with an initial amount of over 200 billion yuan (26 billion euros). The governor of the central bank, Pan Gongsheng, has also hinted at a possible reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks before the end of 2024. The authorities hope that these efforts will support the economy and help achieve the official target of around 5% growth for 2024. However, opinions are divided, with some analysts believing that the recent measures are a step in the right direction, while others think that more needs to be done to address the structural challenges facing the economy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 09:35 AM\nSource:[La Tribune](https://www.latribune.fr/economie/international/chine-le-taux-de-chomage-des-jeunes-baisse-1009521.html)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases to 17.6% in September**\nChina has announced that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds has slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, a figure closely watched as the country tries to revive its slowing economy. This rate, which does not include high school students and university students, is still high but lower than the 18.8% recorded in August, the highest level since the beginning of 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China. The increase in the number of university graduates in June, with nearly 12 million students obtaining their diplomas, has added to the competition on the already difficult job market, which explains the sharp rise in unemployment this summer and its slight decline last month as some hiring took place. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, had declared in May that fighting youth unemployment should be considered an 'absolute priority'.

This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Economists and analysts look to youth unemployment rates for insight because they are more prone to fluctuations that can hint at corporate confidence and hiring trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 02:35 PM\nSource:[NewsBreak](https://www.newsbreak.com/los-angeles-times-521565/3608608080295-china-s-rising-youth-unemployment-signals-the-nation-s-economic-woes-are-far-from-over)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Becomes a Global Problem**\nChina's high youth unemployment is becoming a problem not only for the country itself but also for other nations, including Germany. According to Maximilian Butek from the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, 'it's mainly economic reasons' that drive people from China to the US. Many young people in China see no future for themselves, and the country's youth unemployment rate is at a record high, with 21.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds without a job in June 2024. The situation is so dire that the Chinese government has stopped publishing the statistics, only to resume them in December 2023, excluding students from the count. Nicole Goldin from the Atlantic Council believes that 'there are simply not enough jobs for all the young people coming out of university.' With nearly 12 million university graduates entering the job market this year, the country's economy is struggling to keep up, with a growth rate of only 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China's growth will slow down to 3.3% by 2029 due to various factors, including the ongoing crisis in the real estate sector, declining productivity, and an aging population. This could lead to China exporting its problems, such as youth unemployment, to other countries, including Africa, where Chinese companies are building infrastructure projects with Chinese workers. For Germany, this could mean a decline in Chinese imports, which have already decreased by 10% in 2023.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 09:47 AM\nSource:[Mannheim24](https://www.mannheim24.de/politik-wirtschaft/china-jugendarbeitslosigkeit-wirtschaft-wachstum-daten-exporte-importe-problem-krise-zr-93318303.html)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8% in August, according to official data, marking the second consecutive month of a new maximum, despite the authorities using a new statistical method.

The NBS also published the unemployment rate for young people aged 25-29, excluding students, which stood at 6.9% in August, a 0.4 percentage point increase from July. The NBS changed its methodology in January to exclude students from the youth unemployment rate, which had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. The new method aims to provide more accurate employment services and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies for young people. 'The calculation of the unemployment rate by age group, excluding students, better reflects the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society,' said the NBS.

The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:59 AM\nSource:[Market Business News](https://marketbusinessnews.com/chinas-youth-unemployment-crisis-rising-challenges-amid-economic-slowdown/398653)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**\nChina is facing a growing unemployment crisis, with the youth unemployment rate reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since the beginning of the year.

This is despite the government's efforts to revitalize its struggling economy. The unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 who are not in education increased to 17.1% in July, from 16.4% in June. The expected unemployment rate in June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. The graduation of around 12 million students from Chinese universities in June 2024 has increased competition in the Chinese job market, making it difficult for job seekers. This explains the sharp increase in unemployment rates in July. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among people aged 25-29 increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The release of August's unemployment figures comes after the release of disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth, which slowed down in the same month. These indicators once again highlight the challenges that Beijing faces in restarting its economy sustainably, despite its efforts.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[Argaam Investments](https://www.argaam.com/ar/article/articledetail/id/1755961)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches New Record High in August**\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in August 2024 reached a new record high. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The unemployment rate for the 25-29 age group also increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August. The youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level since the new calculation method was introduced in December 2023. The NBS had previously stopped releasing youth unemployment data by age group after it reached a record high of 21.3% in July 2023. The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students.

This rate is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The ONE had previously suspended the publication of youth unemployment data in the second half of last year due to a change in its calculation method to exclude university students. Before this change, the youth unemployment rate had reached 21.3% in June 2023. The alarming increase in youth unemployment in China reflects the country's economic challenges. The ONE's data highlights the need for effective measures to address this issue, which is exacerbated by the country's economic restructuring, aging population, and delayed retirement age. To tackle this problem, the Chinese government should implement policies and programs that promote job creation and improve employability among young people, such as investing in their education and training, providing incentives to companies that hire young people, and supporting entrepreneurship and business initiatives. These measures, along with a comprehensive strategy to address the various factors contributing to youth unemployment, will be crucial to mitigating this issue and ensuring a more prosperous future for young Chinese people.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 12:44 PM\nSource:[Qué!](https://www.que.es/2024/09/20/el-paro-juvenil-en-china-aumento)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Surges to 18.8% in August**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55. This change will be implemented over the next 15 years, starting from 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 12:08 PM\nSource:[Diario Siglo XXI](https://www.diariosigloxxi.com/texto-ep/mostrar/20240920140806/paro-juvenil-china-dispara-agosto-188-mayor-nivel-ano)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: A Complex Problem with Multiple Causes**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 21.3% in May 2023, prompting the government to stop publishing statistics. After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Experts, including Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of the NBS, and Wang Ting, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, highlighted structural issues in the labor market, including changes in labor demand and technological unemployment.

However, this rate is still very high and the second highest of the year. The decrease is partly due to a change in methodology, as students and high school students are no longer included in the calculation. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group is significantly higher than in June (13.2%), which is likely due to the fact that nearly 12 million students graduated from university in China in June, increasing the number of people on the job market. The BNS also reported a decrease in unemployment rates for other age groups, including 25-29 year olds (6.7% in September, down from 6.9% in August) and the overall national unemployment rate (5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August). These numbers, which only account for urban areas, offer a glimmer of hope for China's economy, which has been struggling. The country is also facing low prices and a risk of deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 0.4% in September over the past year, down from 0.6% in August. The BNS also reported a 2.8% decrease in factory gate prices in September over the past year, a decline that has been ongoing since the end of 2022. However, retail sales, which are the main indicator of household consumption, rebounded by 3.2% in September over the past year, after a 2.1% increase in August. The Chinese authorities have recently announced a series of measures to stimulate economic activity, including interest rate cuts and relaxations on property purchases. The People's Bank of China has also announced a 'swap' program for insurance companies and investment funds, with an initial amount of over 200 billion yuan (26 billion euros). The governor of the central bank, Pan Gongsheng, has also hinted at a possible reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks before the end of 2024. The authorities hope that these efforts will support the economy and help achieve the official target of around 5% growth for 2024. However, opinions are divided, with some analysts believing that the recent measures are a step in the right direction, while others think that more needs to be done to address the structural challenges facing the economy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 09:35 AM\nSource:[La Tribune](https://www.latribune.fr/economie/international/chine-le-taux-de-chomage-des-jeunes-baisse-1009521.html)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases to 17.6% in September**\nChina has announced that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds has slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, a figure closely watched as the country tries to revive its slowing economy. This rate, which does not include high school students and university students, is still high but lower than the 18.8% recorded in August, the highest level since the beginning of 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China. The increase in the number of university graduates in June, with nearly 12 million students obtaining their diplomas, has added to the competition on the already difficult job market, which explains the sharp rise in unemployment this summer and its slight decline last month as some hiring took place.

This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Economists and analysts look to youth unemployment rates for insight because they are more prone to fluctuations that can hint at corporate confidence and hiring trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 02:35 PM\nSource:[NewsBreak](https://www.newsbreak.com/los-angeles-times-521565/3608608080295-china-s-rising-youth-unemployment-signals-the-nation-s-economic-woes-are-far-from-over)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Becomes a Global Problem**\nChina's high youth unemployment is becoming a problem not only for the country itself but also for other nations, including Germany. According to Maximilian Butek from the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, 'it's mainly economic reasons' that drive people from China to the US. Many young people in China see no future for themselves, and the country's youth unemployment rate is at a record high, with 21.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds without a job in June 2024. The situation is so dire that the Chinese government has stopped publishing the statistics, only to resume them in December 2023, excluding students from the count. Nicole Goldin from the Atlantic Council believes that 'there are simply not enough jobs for all the young people coming out of university.' With nearly 12 million university graduates entering the job market this year, the country's economy is struggling to keep up, with a growth rate of only 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China's growth will slow down to 3.3% by 2029 due to various factors, including the ongoing crisis in the real estate sector, declining productivity, and an aging population. This could lead to China exporting its problems, such as youth unemployment, to other countries, including Africa, where Chinese companies are building infrastructure projects with Chinese workers. For Germany, this could mean a decline in Chinese imports, which have already decreased by 10% in 2023.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 09:47 AM\nSource:[Mannheim24](https://www.mannheim24.de/politik-wirtschaft/china-jugendarbeitslosigkeit-wirtschaft-wachstum-daten-exporte-importe-problem-krise-zr-93318303.html)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8% in August, according to official data, marking the second consecutive month of a new maximum, despite the authorities using a new statistical method.

The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:59 AM\nSource:[Market Business News](https://marketbusinessnews.com/chinas-youth-unemployment-crisis-rising-challenges-amid-economic-slowdown/398653)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**\nChina is facing a growing unemployment crisis, with the youth unemployment rate reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since the beginning of the year.

Before this change, the youth unemployment rate had reached 21.3% in June 2023. The alarming increase in youth unemployment in China reflects the country's economic challenges. The ONE's data highlights the need for effective measures to address this issue, which is exacerbated by the country's economic restructuring, aging population, and delayed retirement age. To tackle this problem, the Chinese government should implement policies and programs that promote job creation and improve employability among young people, such as investing in their education and training, providing incentives to companies that hire young people, and supporting entrepreneurship and business initiatives. These measures, along with a comprehensive strategy to address the various factors contributing to youth unemployment, will be crucial to mitigating this issue and ensuring a more prosperous future for young Chinese people.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 12:44 PM\nSource:[Qué!](https://www.que.es/2024/09/20/el-paro-juvenil-en-china-aumento)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Surges to 18.8% in August**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE).

After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

However, this rate is still very high and the second highest of the year. The decrease is partly due to a change in methodology, as students and high school students are no longer included in the calculation. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group is significantly higher than in June (13.2%), which is likely due to the fact that nearly 12 million students graduated from university in China in June, increasing the number of people on the job market. The BNS also reported a decrease in unemployment rates for other age groups, including 25-29 year olds (6.7% in September, down from 6.9% in August) and the overall national unemployment rate (5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August). These numbers, which only account for urban areas, offer a glimmer of hope for China's economy, which has been struggling. The country is also facing low prices and a risk of deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 0.4% in September over the past year, down from 0.6% in August. The BNS also reported a 2.8% decrease in factory gate prices in September over the past year, a decline that has been ongoing since the end of 2022. However, retail sales, which are the main indicator of household consumption, rebounded by 3.2% in September over the past year, after a 2.1% increase in August. The Chinese authorities have recently announced a series of measures to stimulate economic activity, including interest rate cuts and relaxations on property purchases. The People's Bank of China has also announced a 'swap' program for insurance companies and investment funds, with an initial amount of over 200 billion yuan (26 billion euros). The governor of the central bank, Pan Gongsheng, has also hinted at a possible reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks before the end of 2024. The authorities hope that these efforts will support the economy and help achieve the official target of around 5% growth for 2024. However, opinions are divided, with some analysts believing that the recent measures are a step in the right direction, while others think that more needs to be done to address the structural challenges facing the economy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 09:35 AM\nSource:[La Tribune](https://www.latribune.fr/economie/international/chine-le-taux-de-chomage-des-jeunes-baisse-1009521.html)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Decreases to 17.6% in September**\nChina has announced that the unemployment rate for 16-24 year olds has slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, a figure closely watched as the country tries to revive its slowing economy.

Officials expressed confidence that the economy would 'continue the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September,' but the data suggests that more work is needed to address the issue of youth unemployment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 02:35 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-13985571/Chinas-youth-unemployment-rate-falls-climbing-two-straight-months.html)\n\n**China's rising youth unemployment signals the nation's economic woes are far from over**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has been rising, reaching a new high of 18.8% in August. This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Economists and analysts look to youth unemployment rates for insight because they are more prone to fluctuations that can hint at corporate confidence and hiring trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 02:35 PM\nSource:[NewsBreak](https://www.newsbreak.com/los-angeles-times-521565/3608608080295-china-s-rising-youth-unemployment-signals-the-nation-s-economic-woes-are-far-from-over)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Becomes a Global Problem**\nChina's high youth unemployment is becoming a problem not only for the country itself but also for other nations, including Germany. According to Maximilian Butek from the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, 'it's mainly economic reasons' that drive people from China to the US. Many young people in China see no future for themselves, and the country's youth unemployment rate is at a record high, with 21.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds without a job in June 2024. The situation is so dire that the Chinese government has stopped publishing the statistics, only to resume them in December 2023, excluding students from the count. Nicole Goldin from the Atlantic Council believes that 'there are simply not enough jobs for all the young people coming out of university.' With nearly 12 million university graduates entering the job market this year, the country's economy is struggling to keep up, with a growth rate of only 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China's growth will slow down to 3.3% by 2029 due to various factors, including the ongoing crisis in the real estate sector, declining productivity, and an aging population. This could lead to China exporting its problems, such as youth unemployment, to other countries, including Africa, where Chinese companies are building infrastructure projects with Chinese workers. For Germany, this could mean a decline in Chinese imports, which have already decreased by 10% in 2023.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 09:47 AM\nSource:[Mannheim24](https://www.mannheim24.de/politik-wirtschaft/china-jugendarbeitslosigkeit-wirtschaft-wachstum-daten-exporte-importe-problem-krise-zr-93318303.html)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8% in August, according to official data, marking the second consecutive month of a new maximum, despite the authorities using a new statistical method.

The new method aims to provide more accurate employment services and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies for young people. 'The calculation of the unemployment rate by age group, excluding students, better reflects the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society,' said the NBS.

Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries.

After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Chen Feng, the ministry's spokesperson, stated that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council published the document 'Opinions on the Implementation of a Priority Employment Strategy to Promote High-Quality Employment,' which includes 24 measures in six key areas. These measures include stimulating the creation of jobs in the advanced manufacturing sector and supporting the development of the 'silver economy.' In terms of youth employment, the spokesperson mentioned that policies were implemented to support entrepreneurship and employment, including the reactivation of subsidies for labor expansion to companies, which benefited 620,000 university graduates and other young people. China's development goals for 2024 include a five percent economic growth rate and the creation of 12 million jobs.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 14, 2024 05:31 AM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2024/11/14/china-promueve-oportunidades-laborales-para-millones-de-graduados/)\n\n**How can China unleash the spending power of its millions of migrant workers?**\nEconomists and academics urged China to step up 'people-centred urbanisation' and economic deregulation to boost domestic demand. Chi Fulin, president of the China Institute for Reform and Development, said, 'People-centred urbanisation is the fundamental solution to China's current domestic demand shortage.' He suggested filling public service gaps to empower China's nearly 300 million migrant workers, who could then power significant consumption. Chi emphasized the importance of incremental policies focused on people, rather than infrastructure, to boost consumption confidence and create long-term momentum for expanding domestic demand.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 09:30 AM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3286402/deregulation-migrant-workers-hold-key-boosting-demand-china-academics)\n\n**Prospects remain challenging for new graduates**\nA recent graduate, Guo, from the University of California, Los Angeles, and Johns Hopkins University, found it challenging to find a job in her field of consulting, despite her strong academic background. After sending her resume to over 50 companies, she received fewer than 10 responses. Guo noted that 'the job market feels vastly different from academia' and that hands-on experience is increasingly essential. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's unemployment rate for the urban labor force age 16 to 24 was 17.6 percent in September. Experts, including Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of the NBS, and Wang Ting, a professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, highlighted structural issues in the labor market, including changes in labor demand and technological unemployment. The government has introduced guidelines to expand employment channels for youth, including promoting vocational education and encouraging entrepreneurship. Guo hopes for more support for overseas students, including online interview opportunities and precise information-sharing platforms to understand domestic employment trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 01:13 AM\nSource:[China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/13/WS6733f9a8a310f1265a1cd014.html)\n\n**Unemployment Rate Drops to 32.1% in Q3 2024 Amid Rise in Job Gains | Law-Order**\nSouth Africa's unemployment rate has dropped to 32.1% in Q3 2024, down from 33.5% in the previous quarter, according to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey by Statistics South Africa. The report shows a positive shift in employment figures, with the addition of 294,000 jobs, bringing total employment to 16.9 million. However, the number of discouraged work-seekers increased by 5%, adding 160,000 to this category. The construction sector led job gains with 176,000 new positions, while certain sectors experienced declines, such as finance, private households, and transport. Regionally, the Eastern Cape recorded the highest employment growth, adding 83,000 jobs, followed by the Western Cape with 75,000. Youth unemployment also showed improvement, dropping from 46.6% in Q2 2024 to 45.5% in Q3.

However, this rate is still very high and the second highest of the year. The decrease is partly due to a change in methodology, as students and high school students are no longer included in the calculation. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group is significantly higher than in June (13.2%), which is likely due to the fact that nearly 12 million students graduated from university in China in June, increasing the number of people on the job market. The BNS also reported a decrease in unemployment rates for other age groups, including 25-29 year olds (6.7% in September, down from 6.9% in August) and the overall national unemployment rate (5.1% in September, down from 5.3% in August). These numbers, which only account for urban areas, offer a glimmer of hope for China's economy, which has been struggling. The country is also facing low prices and a risk of deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by 0.4% in September over the past year, down from 0.6% in August. The BNS also reported a 2.8% decrease in factory gate prices in September over the past year, a decline that has been ongoing since the end of 2022. However, retail sales, which are the main indicator of household consumption, rebounded by 3.2% in September over the past year, after a 2.1% increase in August. The Chinese authorities have recently announced a series of measures to stimulate economic activity, including interest rate cuts and relaxations on property purchases. The People's Bank of China has also announced a 'swap' program for insurance companies and investment funds, with an initial amount of over 200 billion yuan (26 billion euros). The governor of the central bank, Pan Gongsheng, has also hinted at a possible reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks before the end of 2024. The authorities hope that these efforts will support the economy and help achieve the official target of around 5% growth for 2024. However, opinions are divided, with some analysts believing that the recent measures are a step in the right direction, while others think that more needs to be done to address the structural challenges facing the economy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 09:35 AM\nSource:[La Tribune](https://www.latribune.fr/economie/international/chine-le-taux-de-chomage-des-jeunes-baisse-1009521.html)\n\n**Youth Unemployment in China Declines Slightly in September**\nChina's youth unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds decreased to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August.

This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Economists and analysts look to youth unemployment rates for insight because they are more prone to fluctuations that can hint at corporate confidence and hiring trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 02:35 PM\nSource:[NewsBreak](https://www.newsbreak.com/los-angeles-times-521565/3608608080295-china-s-rising-youth-unemployment-signals-the-nation-s-economic-woes-are-far-from-over)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Becomes a Global Problem**\nChina's high youth unemployment is becoming a problem not only for the country itself but also for other nations, including Germany. According to Maximilian Butek from the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, 'it's mainly economic reasons' that drive people from China to the US. Many young people in China see no future for themselves, and the country's youth unemployment rate is at a record high, with 21.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds without a job in June 2024. The situation is so dire that the Chinese government has stopped publishing the statistics, only to resume them in December 2023, excluding students from the count. Nicole Goldin from the Atlantic Council believes that 'there are simply not enough jobs for all the young people coming out of university.' With nearly 12 million university graduates entering the job market this year, the country's economy is struggling to keep up, with a growth rate of only 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China's growth will slow down to 3.3% by 2029 due to various factors, including the ongoing crisis in the real estate sector, declining productivity, and an aging population. This could lead to China exporting its problems, such as youth unemployment, to other countries, including Africa, where Chinese companies are building infrastructure projects with Chinese workers. For Germany, this could mean a decline in Chinese imports, which have already decreased by 10% in 2023.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 24, 2024 09:47 AM\nSource:[Mannheim24](https://www.mannheim24.de/politik-wirtschaft/china-jugendarbeitslosigkeit-wirtschaft-wachstum-daten-exporte-importe-problem-krise-zr-93318303.html)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record High**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached a new record high of 18.8% in August, according to official data, marking the second consecutive month of a new maximum, despite the authorities using a new statistical method.

The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:59 AM\nSource:[Market Business News](https://marketbusinessnews.com/chinas-youth-unemployment-crisis-rising-challenges-amid-economic-slowdown/398653)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**\nChina is facing a growing unemployment crisis, with the youth unemployment rate reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since the beginning of the year. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24, not enrolled in education, increased to 18.8% from 17.1% in July. The expected unemployment rate for June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working to adjust their approach by no longer counting students. This indicates the significant economic challenges facing China, which requires immediate measures to revitalize the economy and create new job opportunities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[مصرس](https://www.masress.com/ahlmasr/13330549)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches Highest Level This Year**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level this year, reaching 18.8% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This is despite the government's efforts to revitalize its struggling economy. The unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 who are not in education increased to 17.1% in July, from 16.4% in June. The expected unemployment rate in June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. The graduation of around 12 million students from Chinese universities in June 2024 has increased competition in the Chinese job market, making it difficult for job seekers. This explains the sharp increase in unemployment rates in July. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among people aged 25-29 increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The release of August's unemployment figures comes after the release of disappointing data on retail sales and industrial production growth, which slowed down in the same month. These indicators once again highlight the challenges that Beijing faces in restarting its economy sustainably, despite its efforts.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[Argaam Investments](https://www.argaam.com/ar/article/articledetail/id/1755961)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Reaches New Record High in August**\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China, the youth unemployment rate in August 2024 reached a new record high. The unemployment rate for the 16-24 age group increased from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. The unemployment rate for the 25-29 age group also increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August. The youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level since the new calculation method was introduced in December 2023. The NBS had previously stopped releasing youth unemployment data by age group after it reached a record high of 21.3% in July 2023. The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students. The summer months are a time when young graduates are preparing to enter the workforce, which is why the youth unemployment rate is often high during this period, said the NBS.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 02:18 PM\nSource:[Dünya](https://www.dunya.com/ekonomi/cinde-genc-issizlik-orani-agustosta-yeni-rekor-seviyeye-ulasti-haberi-746871)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has increased to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The ONE had previously suspended the publication of youth unemployment data in the second half of last year due to a change in its calculation method to exclude university students. Before this change, the youth unemployment rate had reached 21.3% in June 2023. The alarming increase in youth unemployment in China reflects the country's economic challenges. The ONE's data highlights the need for effective measures to address this issue, which is exacerbated by the country's economic restructuring, aging population, and delayed retirement age. To tackle this problem, the Chinese government should implement policies and programs that promote job creation and improve employability among young people, such as investing in their education and training, providing incentives to companies that hire young people, and supporting entrepreneurship and business initiatives. These measures, along with a comprehensive strategy to address the various factors contributing to youth unemployment, will be crucial to mitigating this issue and ensuring a more prosperous future for young Chinese people.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 12:44 PM\nSource:[Qué!](https://www.que.es/2024/09/20/el-paro-juvenil-en-china-aumento)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Surges to 18.8% in August**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55. This change will be implemented over the next 15 years, starting from 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 12:08 PM\nSource:[Diario Siglo XXI](https://www.diariosigloxxi.com/texto-ep/mostrar/20240920140806/paro-juvenil-china-dispara-agosto-188-mayor-nivel-ano)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: A Complex Problem with Multiple Causes**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 21.3% in May 2023, prompting the government to stop publishing statistics. After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

'Traffic of vehicles on the Crimean Bridge has been resumed,' the channel reports. The bridge's automobile traffic was temporarily halted earlier, but the stop lasted less than an hour. The bridge's automobile traffic is periodically halted in case of a threat of attack from Ukrainian armed formations. After the Ukrainian drone attack on the Crimean Bridge on July 17, 2023, its automobile part was damaged, and later the bridge resumed work in a reverse mode. Additionally, on October 8, a cargo truck exploded on the Crimean Bridge, damaging three spans of the automobile section. The cargo's cisterns caught fire, and three people were killed in the blast, according to preliminary data from the Russian Investigative Committee. On October 12, the FSB reported that they had uncovered the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge, naming the organizer as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. The bridge was later restored. In July last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that plans to enhance the Crimean Bridge's security were being considered and would be implemented. He noted that it was premature to evaluate these plans before they were implemented. Putin emphasized that after completing all tasks, measures to enhance the bridge's security would be noticeable, referring to physical and technical protection. 'It's about this, not about some ideological content of the Crimean Bridge's protection,' he said.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2024 09:25 PM\nSource:[Московский Комсомолец](https://www.mk.ru/social/2024/11/04/dvizhenie-avtomobiley-po-krymskomu-mostu-vozobnovili.html)\n\n**Russia Charges Ukrainian Security Chief with Crimean Bridge Terror Attack**\nRussian investigators have charged the head of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), Vasyl Malyuk, with organizing a terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge in 2023, according to TASS. Malyuk has been accused of committing a terrorist act that resulted in the death of people, under article 'b' of chapter 3 of the Criminal Code, which carries a life sentence. The investigation found that Malyuk's involvement in the attack was confirmed by the results of operational and search activities. Malyuk has been arrested in absentia in Russia on another terrorism-related case. The Russian Foreign Ministry demanded in March 2024 that Ukraine immediately arrest and extradite Malyuk. Malyuk himself had previously admitted to planning the October 2022 attack on the Crimean Bridge, saying, 'I personally planned the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge.' The Crimean Bridge has been repeatedly attacked by drones and shelled by Ukraine since the start of the conflict. In October 2022, a truck exploded on the bridge, causing damage to two road spans and killing three people. Later, on July 17, 2023, two unmanned boats struck the bridge, killing two people and causing significant damage to the road and rail sections.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 12:19 AM\nSource:[РБК](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/670b4d599a79472a997f428d)\n\n**Crimea News: Rocket Attack, New Reservoirs, and Eco-Tech Parks**\nThe Ukrainian military attempted to attack Sevastopol with a rocket, but it was shot down by the city's air defense systems.

Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that Crimea is a de facto Russian region, despite international non-recognition. He also mentioned that the de jure status of the peninsula is resolved in a one-sided manner. In other news, two new reservoirs will be built on the southern coast of Crimea to supply water to Yalta and Alushta. Three eco-tech parks are expected to be completed in 2025 in the Saky, Belogorsk, and Lenin districts. The director of the Crimean safari park announced that the lions that killed the park manager, Leokadiya Perevalova, will not be euthanized and will remain in the park's enclosures.

The Crimean Bridge has been a target of Ukrainian forces, who have repeatedly attempted to attack it with rockets and have carried out two terrorist attacks. The first attack occurred on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded on the road section of the bridge, causing a fire that destroyed seven fuel tanks. Three people were killed in the blast. The bridge's two automobile spans were partially destroyed, but were repaired by December. On July 17, 2023, Ukraine launched a drone attack on the bridge, killing two people and injuring their 14-year-old daughter.

As a result, they blocked traffic on the Crimean Bridge and 'hid' the bridge in a smoke screen. The Russians traditionally blamed a rocket attack on the bridge, with explosions heard nearby. This is not the first time the bridge has been targeted; on October 8, 2022, a truck was detonated, causing an explosion and fire. Putin called it a 'terrorist act' and formed a government commission, while Russia accused the SBU of possible involvement. In July 2023, the bridge was attacked again, with two spans destroyed, and the SBU chief, Malyuk, confirmed that the operation was carried out using Sea Baby drones.

They know how to market themselves on this and will try to do any harm, wherever they can find a weak spot. They have no moral limits,' Konstantinov said. He emphasized that the Russian Armed Forces, law enforcement agencies, and authorities are taking necessary measures to ensure the security of the region. According to Sergey Gorbachev, a military expert, the main threats to Crimea come from the Odessa and Nikolaev regions, as well as the right bank of the Kherson region. The Ukrainian military uses a wide range of combat means, including Storm Shadow and ATACMS missiles, launched from modernized Su-24 bombers. The head of the SVR, Sergey Naryshkin, previously stated that the Crimean Bridge remains a top priority target for Ukrainian attacks using British Storm Shadow missiles.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2024 12:35 PM\nSource:[РИА Новости Крым](https://crimea.ria.ru/20241015/v-krymu-svyazali-ataki-na-poluostrov-s-vyborami-v-ssha--1141104553.html)\n\n**Georgian and Ukrainian Citizens Wanted for 2022 Crimean Bridge Bombing**\nLaw enforcement has issued an international arrest warrant for Georgian citizen Alexander Inasaridze and Ukrainian citizen Sergei Andreyenko, who are suspected of participating in the 2022 bombing of the Crimean Bridge.

Malyuk was previously charged with a similar offense, the destruction of the Crimean Bridge in 2022. In March 2024, Malyuk stated that Ukraine had conducted two successful operations in the area of the Crimean Bridge. The Crimean Bridge connects the temporarily occupied Crimea to Russian territory. There were two explosions on the Crimean Bridge, one in October 2022 and another in July 2023. Russian authorities and law enforcement accused Ukrainian special services of the blasts. Malyuk said that the SBU used a truck with 21 tons of explosives wrapped in a thick plastic sheet to destroy the bridge in October 2022. The second blast was carried out using Sea Baby drones.

He stated that the bridge is likely to be a target for Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. Naryshkin also mentioned that Ukraine has used Western-provided weapons to attack the Crimean Peninsula, including a June attack using US-supplied ATACMS missiles that killed 4 people and injured over 150 on a beach in Sevastopol. He recalled a statement by CIA Director William Burns that US military aid to Ukraine is intended to cause 'tangible harm to Russia', including 'attacks that penetrate Crimea'. The Crimean Bridge was built from 2016-2018 after Crimea officially joined the Russian Federation in 2014. Despite Moscow building a new land bridge to Crimea, Kiev still claims sovereignty over the peninsula and has sought to destroy the Crimean Bridge, which it alleges was built illegally. In January, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted that Kiev 'really wants to destroy' the Crimean Bridge and other Russian infrastructure. Since the 2022 conflict began, the Crimean Bridge has been attacked multiple times by missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In October 2022, a truck carrying explosives exploded on the bridge, causing significant damage and killing 3 people. In July 2023, a UAV attack also damaged the bridge's structure and killed 2 people.\nOriginal language: vi\nPublish date: October 09, 2024 10:55 PM\nSource:[vietnamnet.vn](https://vietnamnet.vn/nga-tiet-lo-muc-tieu-hang-dau-o-crum-nam-trong-tam-ngam-ten-lua-phuong-tay-2329791.html)\n\n**Crimean Bridge Destroyed by 21 Tons of Explosives in TNT Equivalent**\nThe Crimean Bridge was destroyed on October 8, 2022, using 21 tons of explosives in TNT equivalent, according to Artem Dehtiar, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Security Service. 'We managed to blow up the Crimean Bridge in October 2022 using a truck with explosives. The explosives were disguised as rolls of plastic film. The weight of the explosives was 21 tons in TNT equivalent,' Dehtiar said. 'After each special operation, the enemy increases security measures. Currently, especially after the second blow by the SBU, additional air defense systems and bonus structures in the sea have been installed on the Crimean Bridge to protect it from sea drones. But the Security Service does not stand still, technologies change, we constantly improve our developments and look for better solutions,' the SBU spokesperson said. 'This was a simultaneous blow to the object that provides the enemy's military needs and to Putin's pride,' Dehtiar stated. 'We did not just cut off the enemy's logistics corridor for delivering arms to the front, we also destroyed the myth of the extraordinary protection of this object. And separately, I would like to emphasize that the Crimean Bridge, through which the Russians transported troops and military equipment to the southern front of Ukraine, is an absolutely legitimate target for our state,' Dehtiar said. The Kerch Bridge is doomed, and after Ukraine's victory, the Black Sea will become a popular place for diving, the SBU spokesperson said. The SBU has two successful hits on the Crimean Bridge: the first in October 2022 using a truck with explosives and the second in July 2023 using sea drones, said Vasyl Malyuk, the head of the SBU. In October 2022, SBU sea drones attacked enemy ships in the Sevastopol Bay, damaging four military vessels, including the frigate Admiral Makarov. Last year, SBU drones hit enemy missile carriers 'Samum' and 'Pavel Davydov', a tanker 'SIG', a landing ship 'Olenegorsky Gornyak', caused damage to a military tugboat 'Nikolay Muru' and a reconnaissance-hydrographic ship 'Vladimir Kositsky'.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 03:20 PM\nSource:[gazeta.ua](https://gazeta.ua/articles/krym/_krimskij-mist-pidirvali-21yu-tonnoyu-vibuhivki-u-trotilovomu-ekvivalenti/1195742)\n\n**The SBU's Crimean Bridge Explosion: A Turning Point in the War**\nTwo years after the Crimean Bridge explosion, the consequences of the attack are still being felt. According to political analyst Alexei Golobutsky, the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) showed that the battle for the Black Sea can be won with creative and technological solutions. 'Even now, two years after the explosion, the Russians have not fully coped with the consequences. They cannot use the bridge to supply arms to the southern front, where the situation is much calmer than on the Donbass and Kharkov fronts. They no longer dare to transport heavy military equipment and ammunition by the bridge,' Golobutsky writes. The expert notes that the explosion marked the beginning of the 'period of stagnation' on the peninsula. He recalls that after the first explosion, the SBU was able to blow up the bridge again, and in July 2023, 'Sea Baby' drones hit two bridge pillars. Today, the occupiers are already accustomed to the hits and air alarms, as evidenced by recent explosions in Feodosia, where a oil terminal was blown up. The terminal is still burning, and the enemy's air defenses have been drawn to protect the bridge from a third explosion,' Golobutsky believes. The analyst emphasizes that the explosion showed that the battle for the Black Sea can be won with creative and technological solutions. 'The operation was developed and implemented by the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, with several employees of the Service. He personally participated in the design and implementation of the special operation. Interestingly, the bridge was blown up on the day after the birthday of the Russian dictator Putin. The explosion demonstrated that Putin's power over the occupied territories is just as vulnerable as the Crimean Bridge he built,' Golobutsky concludes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 02:02 PM\nSource:[ТСН.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/ato/ekspert-o-godovschine-podryva-krymskogo-mosta-sbu-sobytie-do-sih-por-vliyayuschee-na-hod-voyny-2675730.html)\n\n**Two Years Ago: Ukraine's Successful Attack on the Crimean Bridge**\nTwo years ago, on October 8, 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched the first attack on the Crimean Bridge, causing a partial collapse of two spans and significant damage to the road surface. Initially, the Russians tried to downplay the incident, but photos and videos from the scene quickly revealed the extent of the damage. The SBU press service recalled the successful operation, which was personally developed and implemented by SBU head Vasyl Maluk. 'October 8, 2022, will forever be etched in the history of our struggle. It was then that the SBU, as a result of a complex multi-level operation, delivered the first powerful blow to the 'symbol of Kremlin propaganda' - the Crimean Bridge. This bright explosion was a true celebration for all Ukrainians and a slap in the face to Putin's 70th birthday,' the statement reads. The explosive devices were disguised as rolls of tape and had a TNT equivalent of almost 21 tons. After the successful attack, the SBU targeted many other important objects in Russia and continues to do so. The Crimean Bridge, which was previously the main logistics artery for supplying military equipment and fuel to southern Ukraine, was severely damaged and lost its importance. The powerful explosion also caused panic and chaos among the occupiers, who began to flee Crimea in large numbers. It is worth noting that the first explosion on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, due to the detonation of an explosive device in a truck moving to Crimea from Russian territory. Initially, Russian social media reported that the explosion occurred on a railway line and was caused by a fire in a cargo wagon, which was being transported from Tamansk (Krasnodar Krai) to Kerch. The Kremlin immediately issued a manual to local journalists, instructing them to downplay the incident and omit certain details. After the explosion, Russian social media users went into a frenzy, accusing the authorities of lying and recalling past memes about explosions on military objects in occupied Crimea, including a Russian woman who...\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 10:34 AM\nSource:[telegraf.com.ua](https://news.telegraf.com.ua/ukr/ukraina/2024-10-08/5874769-dva-roki-tomu-bulo-zavdano-pershogo-udaru-po-krimskomu-mostu-yak-tse-bulo-video)\n\n**Ukraine's Successful Attack on the Crimean Bridge: A Blow to Putin's Propaganda**\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) successfully attacked the Crimean Bridge on October 8, 2022, dealing a significant blow to the Kremlin's propaganda and disrupting the supply of military equipment and fuel to the occupied south of Ukraine. The SBU press service recalled the successful operation, saying, 'This bright explosion was a real celebration for all Ukrainians and a slap in the face to Putin's 70th birthday. Since then, the bridge has ceased to be a main logistical artery for the enemy's supply of military equipment and fuel to the south of Ukraine. And most importantly, the explosion sowed panic and chaos among the occupiers, who began to massively flee from Crimea for the first time.' The attack caused a massive panic among the population, with long queues forming in stores and products being quickly cleared from shelves. Some Russians even fled the peninsula as far as possible. The successful operation also sparked a lively reaction among Ukrainians, with Monobank releasing a new design for their cards and Ukrposhta promising to release a new stamp dedicated to the event.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 08, 2024 07:54 AM\nSource:[novyny.live/](https://armiya.novyny.live/liapas-putinu-na-iuvilei-2-roki-tomu-sbu-vdarila-po-krimskomu-mostu-204827.html)\n\n**Crimean Bridge 'priority target' for British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles - Naryshkin  --  RT Russia & Former Soviet Union**\nRussia's Foreign Intelligence Agency (SVR) head, Sergey Naryshkin, has stated that the Crimean Bridge remains a top priority target for Ukraine in its attacks on the peninsula using Western-supplied weapons. Naryshkin noted that Ukraine has been using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, as well as American-made ATACMS missiles, to attack the peninsula. He also recalled that CIA Director William Burns had previously stated that Washington's military aid to Ukraine is meant to enable Kiev to 'inflict tangible damage on Russia,' including 'penetrating strikes on Crimea.' Naryshkin said, 'Burns thus voiced the old Anglo-Saxon maxim - to cut off Russia's access to the 'warm sea' at all costs.' The Crimean Bridge has been targeted numerous times since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, with most attacks being repelled, but a blast in October 2022 and a drone boat attack in July 2023 caused significant damage and loss of life.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 05:50 PM\nSource:[RT](https://www.rt.com/russia/605378-ukraine-crimea-bridge-storm-shadow/)\n\n**Crimean Bridge Remains Top Priority Target for Ukraine, Says Naryshkin**\nThe Crimean Bridge remains a top priority target for the Ukrainian regime, said Sergey Naryshkin, director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service. According to Naryshkin, the UK's use of Storm Shadow missiles to attack the bridge is a manifestation of the old Anglo-Saxon maxim 'to cut Russia off from the 'warm seas'. Naryshkin pointed out that Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, carried out with Western arms and space reconnaissance and guidance systems, continue unabated. Crimea's leader, Sergey Aksyonov, previously stated that the effectiveness of the Crimean Bridge's defense against air and sea attacks from the Ukrainian military is nearly 100%, and the object is currently not under threat. The first attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on October 8, 2022, when a truck exploded on the road section of the bridge, causing a fire on seven fuel tanks of a railway car and partial collapse of two road sections. Four people died in the blast. The FSB stated that the Ukrainian authorities were behind the attack, but the SBU refused to comment on the allegations. Later, SBU head Vasyl Malyuk claimed personal involvement in planning and executing the terrorist act. The second attack on the Crimean Bridge occurred on July 17, 2023, when two unmanned surface vessels struck the bridge. The blast killed a family of two from the Belgorod region and injured their 14-year-old daughter. The explosion damaged the road section of the bridge. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the attack a terrorist act and a senseless crime, stating that the bridge had not been used for military cargo transport for a long time. The bridge was reopened for traffic in a reverse mode the night after the attack. On September 14, the left section of the bridge was opened for car traffic a day ahead of schedule. By October, the Crimean Bridge was fully restored and all four lanes of the transport crossing were opened for traffic. During this time, the damaged sections were dismantled and new ones were installed.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 12:41 PM\nSource:[РИА Новости Крым](https://crimea.ria.ru/20241007/krymskiy-most-ostaetsya-prioritetnoy-tselyu-dlya-kieva--naryshkin-1140902786.html)\n\n**Ukrainian Forces Strike Major Russian Target in Crimea**\nUkrainian forces struck a major Russian-occupied target in Crimea, hitting the Fedyukhin oil terminal in Feodosiya. The attack caused a fire in the area, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The terminal is the largest in Crimea, handling significant volumes of oil products, including those used to supply the Russian occupation forces. 'The task was accomplished by units of the Rocket Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in cooperation with other components of the Ukrainian Defense Forces. Efforts to undermine the military-economic potential of the Russian Federation continue,' the General Staff said. The attack is the latest in a series of strikes on the terminal, which was also hit in March 2024, December 2023, and November 2023. The incident comes as Russia has increased security measures around the Kerch Strait Bridge, including the installation of new barriers and anti-aircraft missile systems. Ukrainian partisans claim that the Russians are afraid of a Ukrainian landing operation and are fortifying their positions, while a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Andriy Yusov, stated that a plan to destroy the bridge and retake Crimea has been developed, sparking a storm in the Russian information space.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 05:42 AM\nSource:[obozrevatel.com](https://war.obozrevatel.com/ukr/sili-oboroni-zavdali-udaru-po-morskomu-naftovomu-terminalu-u-feodosii-foto-ta-video.htm)\n\n**Explosions Reported in Zaporizhzhia**\nExplosions were reported in Zaporizhzhia, according to a Telegram message from TSN. The Russian military began targeting Ukraine's infrastructure on October 10, 2022, two days after the attack on the Crimean Bridge, which Russian authorities blame on Ukrainian special services. The attacks have been ongoing, targeting energy, defense industry, military management, and communication infrastructure across the country. Air raid alerts are issued daily in Ukrainian regions, sometimes nationwide. However, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov has stated that Russian forces do not target residential homes or social infrastructure in battles with the Ukrainian military.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 04:32 AM\nSource:[НОВОСТИ Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/svo/63071646/)\n\n**Russia Prepares for Unprecedented Attack on Crimean Bridge**\nRussia is preparing for an unprecedented attack on the Crimean Bridge, according to 'Crimean Wind'. New satellite images show a significant increase in defensive structures around the bridge. 'Russia has been placing barges on the southern side of the bridge since early May to protect the structure and the waterway from future Ukrainian attacks,' says the monitoring channel. The defensive measures have been strengthened with additional barges and floating boom barriers, which are located parallel to the bridge. However, new images taken on September 29 show a significant increase in the number of barges protecting the bridge, as well as two 'Pantsir' air defense systems near the bridge. This suggests that Russia is concerned not only with the threat from the sea, but also with protecting the bridge from air attacks. The Crimean Bridge is considered an illegal structure, and Ukraine has considered it a legitimate target for attacks. Ukrainian forces have already struck the bridge twice, on October 8, 2022, and July 17, 2023. The Guardian reported in April 2024 that the Ukrainian military was preparing a third attack on the bridge.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 09:25 AM\nSource:[РБК-Украина](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/rosiyani-gotuyutsya-bezpretsedentnoyi-ataki-1727859628.html)\n\n**Russia Builds Unknown Defensive Structure Near Crimean Bridge**\nRussian occupiers are building an unknown defensive structure near the Crimean Bridge. This is not the first time they have attempted to do so, but they have faced difficulties due to harsh weather conditions. According to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, Dmitry Pletenchuk, 'It will become clear what this is when they complete the construction. But this season, it's unlikely they will be able to finish it, as the stormy period is starting, and building in such conditions will be very difficult. It could be a defensive structure or another crossing - it's too early to make conclusions.' Pletenchuk noted that the Russians have repeatedly attempted to build defensive structures for the Kerch Strait Bridge, but have always failed due to harsh weather conditions. 'We'll see how they will pass this period, which starts in the fall and ends in the spring. They constantly try to place something new in the Kerch Strait, build various hydraulic or barrier structures. But periodically, they end up on the shore after another storm.' The Crimean Bridge has been a target for Ukrainian military forces, with successful attacks on October 8, 2022, and July 17, 2023. The Ukrainian military has stated that the bridge is a legitimate target. Additionally, the Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) is reportedly preparing a third strike on the Crimean Bridge.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 26, 2024 03:56 PM\nSource:[РБК-Украина](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/rosiyani-buduyut-nevidomu-sporudu-zahistu-1727364331.html)\n\n**Russia Installs Air Defense Systems Near Crimean Bridge**\nRussian occupiers are installing air defense systems near the Crimean Bridge, according to the 'Center for Investigative Journalism'. Two metal towers with 'Pantsir-S1M' anti-aircraft missile and gun systems have been installed on the island of Tuzla, on both sides of the bridge. The systems are designed to protect the Kerch Strait Bridge. The Center for Investigative Journalism noted that they first spotted 'Pantsir' on the Crimean Bridge in early September. The 'Pantsir' system is an export version of the air defense system with a armored cabin installed on a KamAZ-53958 chassis, painted in desert camouflage. The system has increased range and altitude capabilities. A dozen similar sections were also spotted on the construction site near Kerch. Additionally, the Russian occupiers are installing metal 'fences' in the sea, allegedly to protect against sea drone attacks. The context is that Russia occupied Crimea after a military blockade and a disputed referendum in March 2014. Ukraine does not recognize the annexation of the peninsula. The Crimean Bridge, connecting Crimea to Russia, was built after the occupation and opened in 2018 for cars and in 2019-2020 for trains. The bridge has been attacked twice, with the first explosion occurring on October 8, 2022, and the second on July 17, 2023. Ukrainian special services are believed to be behind the attacks. In March 2024, the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, stated that Ukraine has the potential to completely destroy the Crimean Bridge, but Russia is not currently using it to transport weapons and ammunition. The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kirill Budanov, believes that the ATACMS long-range missiles provided by the US could destroy the bridge, 'the question is just how many'. The Crimean Bridge should be destroyed as part of the 'desacralization of Crimea', said the head of the military intelligence and suggested that this could happen before the end of the year. Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stated that they intend to de-occupy all Ukrainian territories seized by Russia since 2014, including Crimea.

He stated, 'I consider it likely, not just possible. And when I wake up in the morning, I check Telegram channels, expecting it to happen soon. Especially since Western partners have openly said that it would be an absolutely legitimate military operation for Ukraine, and there are no moral or ethical barriers to using the weapons provided by the West for this purpose.' Grozev emphasized that Crimea is Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine has the right to reclaim it by any means necessary. He added, 'It's obvious that [Ukraine will strike the bridge] at the moment when the enemy is in a disadvantageous position. If the Kursk initiative remains at least at the same level as it is now for another month, I think it means that the enemy is at its lowest point of ability to defend Crimea. And it's likely that we will see something interesting then.' The Crimean Bridge, connecting Crimea to Russia, was built by Russia after the occupation of the peninsula in 2015. The road bridge was opened in 2018, and the railway bridge in 2019-2020. During the full-scale war, the Crimean Bridge was targeted by Ukraine twice, with the first explosion occurring on October 8, 2022, and the second on July 17, 2023.

The drought has led to a red flag warning for bush and forest fires, with wildfires burning thousands of acres on the border between New York and New Jersey. Officials have warned that the drought conditions are creating tinderbox conditions, with high winds, low humidity, and dry conditions. New York City's water supply system is being overhauled, with the city sourcing more water from a reservoir in Catskill Park, an area particularly affected by the dry conditions. Residents are being asked to conserve water, with the city's fire department warning that an open fire hydrant can release over 1,000 gallons per minute. The drought has also led to a decrease in New York City's average daily water demand, but officials say more can be done to avoid waste. 'The reality is, the drought that we're currently experiencing is just one example of how a changing climate is impacting our state today, not far off into the future, but right now,' said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. 'One of the attributes that is starting to come out (with climate change) is these rapid transitions from either very wet periods to very dry periods, or very dry periods to very wet periods,' said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2024 08:54 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-14079647/New-York-drought-conditions-fan-flames-spur-water-saving.html)\n\n**How much would snow help with drought conditions?**\nDrought conditions in KELOLAND have not improved significantly despite recent rain.

According to the US Drought Monitor, 62% of cattle were in drought-stricken areas at the end of October, the highest level since December 2022. Ranchers like Chad Engle in Nebraska have had to cull more of their herd than normal due to the dry conditions, and are unable to expand their herd in the face of drought. Analysts predict that the lack of pasture and high cattle prices will lead to a smaller herd size for years to come, and that beef production will be skewed towards the first half of 2025.

However, this is not the most expansive drought on record. The 2012 drought was more widespread, but the current one is more intense. The precipitation forecast for the next couple of weeks calls for more than normal rain, but it's unlikely to end the drought.

According to the Southeast Regional Climate Center, 100 weather stations across the U.S. recorded no rain in October, and over 70 weather stations recorded the driest October on record. The rapid development of drought created a 'flash drought' in many parts of the country, typically brought on by lower-than-normal precipitation rates and abnormally high temperatures. 'Although droughts usually develop slowly, a flash drought rapidly intensifies over a few weeks to a couple of months,' said Caily Schwartz, a scientist at the Global Water Security Center. Schwartz noted that Nebraska was in severe drought in late October, with little rain and higher-than-normal temperatures. Jason Otkin, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, 'This fall has been a prime example of flash drought across parts of the U.S.' Otkin's research showed that droughts have intensified more rapidly since the 1950s due to human-caused climate change, making drought monitoring and forecasting more difficult.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 01:05 PM\nSource:[NASA Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153526/drought-expands-across-the-us?linkId=642472860)\n\n**US Presidential Election 2024: What to Expect on Election Night**\nApproximately 240 million people will vote on November 5th to elect the next President of the United States.

Edison Research will collect the data, ensuring that the projections accurately reflect the electorate. However, it's essential to note that these figures are only estimates and do not represent the official result. The vote count will continue for several days after the election, and each state has its own process for counting votes, which means that the final results may take time to be confirmed. It's estimated that the final decision on who will be the next President will not be known until mid-December, when the electors from each state will formally cast their votes. The US electoral system is unique, with the candidate who receives the majority of votes in a state receiving all the electoral votes at stake, except in Nebraska and Maine, where a proportional system is applied. This method has led to situations where a candidate can win the presidency without receiving the majority of the national popular vote. The official result will be announced by Kamala Harris, who is not only the Vice President but also the President of the Senate, during a joint session of Congress scheduled for January 6, 2025, which will mark the beginning of the transition to the new government.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 05, 2024 08:02 AM\nSource:[Antena3](https://www.antena3.com/noticias/mundo/que-hora-sabran-resultados-elecciones-estados-unidos-2024_202411056729d097759afe0001497ec3.html)\n\n**Rio Negro may dry up by December due to below-average rainfall, warns SGB**\nThe Rio Negro in Manaus, Brazil is experiencing a concerning drought, with its water level dropping 32 centimeters in the last seven days to 12.18 meters on November 1. According to the Brazilian Geological Service (SGB), the river's instability is expected to continue until December, as the recent rainfall has been below average. The state of Amazonas is facing its worst drought in history, with over 800,000 people affected and economic losses of over R$ 620 million in 2024. The SGB also reported on the landslides in Porto da Terra Preta, Manacapuru, which occurred at the beginning of the month, citing 'landslides' as the main cause, according to researcher Jussara Cury. 'It was landslides', she summarized. The city of Manaus has closed the Praia da Ponta Negra due to the low water level, which has also altered the Encontro das Águas scenario.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 02:35 PM\nSource:[portaltabatinga.com.br](https://portaltabatinga.com.br/2024/rio-negro-pode-secar-ate-dezembro-com-chuvas-abaixo-da-media-alerta-sgb/)\n\n**NOAA's Winter Outlook Leaves the Region**\nNOAA's U.S. Winter Outlook for December 2024 through February 2025 predicts cooler and wetter conditions in the north and drier and warmer conditions in the south. However, for south central Nebraska and north central Kansas, the outlook is 'in the middle', with a 33.3% chance of above, below, or near normal temperatures and precipitation. Past weak La Nina winter periods suggest that the upcoming winter may favor near to slightly cooler temperatures, but precipitation trends are split. Historically, snowfall has averaged near normal during weak La Nina winters in the region. The winter ahead is likely to be one of 'normal variability' in terms of temperature and precipitation, with frequent storms and temperature swings, and potentially later snowfall.

Currently, 3.6 million Somalis are facing crisis-level hunger, projected to increase to 4.4 million by December. The WFP said, 'To avert further deterioration of food security and nutrition outcomes across the country, sustained humanitarian assistance, including anticipatory action, is urgently needed.' The appeal follows findings from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, which highlights that 1.6 million children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition until July 2025. The WFP noted a 14 percent increase in global acute malnutrition and a 21 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition compared to the same season last year. The IPC report aligns with global forecasts indicating an 80 percent probability of La Nina conditions, which could lead to drought in Somalia. The WFP said, 'This is due to anticipated below-average rains, localized flooding in the riverine and urban areas of Hiran, Gedo, Middle Shabelle, and Lower Shabelle, ongoing conflict, high food prices, and diseases contributing to acute food insecurity and malnutrition.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 04:56 PM\nSource:[newkerala.com](https://www.newkerala.com/news/2024/68620.htm)\n\n**No improvement for ongoing drought in Omaha**\nAccording to the Thursday drought monitor update, conditions in the Omaha area have not improved, with severe drought remaining across a majority of the area. Moderate drought has increased, with areas under abnormal dryness to the southeast. The entire state of Iowa is now experiencing abnormally dry conditions or worse, and a majority of Nebraska is experiencing some level of dry conditions or drought. The reason for this is the fact that the Omaha area has been incredibly dry recently, with a deficit of 1″ for the year, 4.5″ below average for the season of fall, and nearly 1.75″ in deficit for the month of October.

A slowly developing La Nina is expected to influence U.S. weather patterns, leading to drier-than-average conditions in the south, including large portions of the key winter wheat producing area. NOAA expects drought conditions to 'persist and worsen' across the central and southern U.S. Plains. Brian Pugh, operation drought lead with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, stated, 'Unfortunately, after a brief period in the spring of 2024 with minimal drought conditions across the country, more than a quarter of the land mass in the continental U.S. is currently in at least a moderate drought.' Justin Gilpin, chief executive officer of Kansas Wheat, said, 'When you see a forecast like that, it's certainly concerning.' He added that growers in Kansas, eastern Colorado, and Nebraska have been 'dusting in' their wheat in hopes of receiving some winter precipitation. However, emergence has been poor, and crops that were planted in September have been going backward.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 05:58 PM\nSource:[producer.com](https://www.producer.com/news/u-s-winter-wheat-drought-expected-to-worsen/)\n\n**Pie charts Showcase the High-Speed Progress of Nebraska Harvests**\nAccording to the USDA's Crop Progress report, Nebraska's corn and soybean harvests are progressing faster than normal as of October 21.

Agronomy Service Representative Travis Gustafson noted that many farmers in the state have already completed harvest, with yields holding steady under irrigation at 260 to 280 bushels per acre for corn. However, soybean yields have been more varied, with Gustafson stating that 'soybean yields in Nebraska were strong but they dropped off as the beans got dry.'

The drought has led to severe food shortages, limited access to clean water, disease outbreaks, and loss of livestock. According to FEWS NET estimates, nearly 23 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity, with Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique being the most affected. It is estimated that between 14.0 and 14.9 million people will need urgent humanitarian assistance during the lean season from October to December 2024. The drought has also led to the displacement of thousands of people, disease outbreaks, and significant impacts on agriculture. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing cholera epidemic and the emerging risk of mpox, which may divert resources and response efforts away from the drought response in some affected countries. 'The situation has relatively stabilized', but water shortages are undermining hygiene and sanitation efforts, and the risk of cholera outbreaks remains in countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. The drought may also increase the risk of HIV and AIDS transmission, mental health issues, and gender-based violence, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced preparedness and response mechanisms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2024 09:27 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/angola/drought-southern-africa-angola-botswana-lesotho-malawi-mozambique-namibia-zambia-zimbabwe-public-health-situation-analysis-phsa-14-october-2024)\n\n**NE pandemic-related homeowner aid program wraps up, as rent aid program seeks applicants**\nA pandemic-related program in Nebraska, the Nebraska Homeowner Assistance Fund, has wrapped up, providing $50 million in aid to 3,094 applicants, with an average of $14,834 per recipient. The program aimed to prevent Nebraskans from losing their homes due to COVID-19 hardships. Meanwhile, a separate program, the Nebraska Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA II), still has available funds to help eligible renters. To date, over $20 million has been obligated, providing financial assistance to thousands of qualified Nebraskans for past-due and future rent payments and past-due utility and internet payments. NIFA officials said they hope to get at least 75% of the $48 million spent by the end of 2024. Once 75% of the funds are obligated, remaining funds will be directed toward the development of affordable housing. 'These are hard-working Nebraskans going through a tough time, and without the burden of past-due rent, they've been able to take care of medical bills, get their cars fixed or get caught up on childcare bills,' said Andy Marsh, owner of Keystone Properties.

Despite this, the state's behavioral health care system is facing budget cuts, with $15 million cut from the budget in the last legislative session and more cuts expected. Providers and stakeholders are concerned that these cuts will worsen the strain on the system, which already has a shortage of behavioral health providers, with 88 of 93 counties having a shortage in 2023. Tiffany Gressley, regional administrator for Region 3 Behavioral Health Services, said, 'We're being fiscally conservative by serving these people early; as early as we can. We're saving money and we're saving, on top of that, the human cost that goes along with untreated mental health conditions.'

Approximately 190,000 families are struggling due to the dry spell, which has affected both daily life and the local economy. The main rivers in the region, such as the Rio Negro, are at critical levels. In Manaus, the Ponta Negra beach has been closed, and river transportation has been disrupted by the formation of sandbanks. Ribeirinho communities, like Getúlio de Castro, are reporting difficulties with navigation and transportation by canoe, as well as increased fuel costs. The Felipe Lopes shipyard has also been severely affected, with a decrease in demand and the need for layoffs. The regional gastronomy sector is also suffering losses, according to information from Portal G1. In other cities in Amazonas, the situation is equally concerning. Tabatinga is experiencing its worst drought in history, with the Rio Solimões at -1.99 meters. Cities like Coari, Parintins, and Itacoatiara are also recording very low levels in the Rio Amazonas, compromising navigation and commerce. In Itacoatiara, the operation of the floating port, essential for the transportation of goods, has also been disrupted. To mitigate the effects of the drought, the government has been implementing humanitarian assistance actions, including the distribution of food and water purifiers. Medicines, oxygen cylinders, and oxygen generators have also been sent to affected areas. According to experts, the drought is the result of a combination of climatic factors. Renato Senna, a researcher at the National Institute of Amazonian Research (Inpa), explains that the El Niño phenomenon, combined with the warming of the North Atlantic Tropical, altered atmospheric circulation, making it difficult to form clouds and reducing rainfall in the region, as he said, 'The combination of these factors has led to a severe drought in the Amazon region.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 04, 2024 09:50 PM\nSource:[ig.com.br](https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/meioambiente/2024-10-04/defesa-civil-comunica-pessoas-afetadas-amazonas.html)\n\n**\"Severe drought\" hits highest level in Colorado since February**\nAs fall begins in Colorado, over 43% of the state is experiencing 'abnormally dry' or worse conditions, affecting around 3.1 million people.

Despite three consecutive seasons of average to above-average rainfall supporting gradual recovery among households badly impacted by the 2020-2022 drought, high food assistance needs persist due to ongoing conflict, severe flooding, high food prices, and limited income-earning opportunities. Humanitarian partners provided food assistance to an average of less than 1.3 million people monthly from June to August 2024, but this assistance covered only approximately 35-40 percent of FEWS NET's estimated population in need of food aid. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in settlements have minimal income-generating opportunities, limited access to food, and depleted coping capacity, with decreasing humanitarian assistance. All settlements hosting displaced populations are expected to face either Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes. The below-average deyr rainfall forecast for the upcoming October to December season is likely to contribute to a fourth consecutive season of below-average crop production, exacerbating food insecurity. Revised analysis indicates that the crop-dependent Sorghum High Potential and Bay Bakool Low Potential livelihood zones are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with most other agropastoral areas expected to continue facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. In northern and central pastoral areas, improved rangeland conditions, higher livestock birth rates, and increased milk production due to above-average gu rainfall are expected to improve food security for poor households through December. However, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to persist in the Addun and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones of the central regions, which were badly impacted during the 2020-2022 drought.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 11:23 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-key-message-update-pafter-disrupted-gu-production-season-below-average-deyr-rainfall-likely-august-2024)\n\n**La Niña: Anticipatory Action and Response Plan, September–December 2024 - Mitigating the expected impacts of La Niña‑induced climate extremes on agriculture and food security**\nThe 2023-2024 El Niño event significantly impacted over 60 million people globally, causing devastating droughts, heatwaves, and floods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated anticipatory actions in 24 at-risk countries, followed by emergency response efforts in some of the hardest-hit areas. With the current El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral state, La Niña is anticipated to develop between September and November, with probabilities ranging from 55 to 71 percent, and is expected to persist through January to March 2025. La Niña can increase the likelihood of extreme weather and climate hazards such as droughts, floods, excessive rainfall, and cyclones, which can have severe consequences on food security, particularly for the 282 million people already facing acute food insecurity worldwide. FAO's La Niña Anticipatory Action and Response Plan requires USD 318 million to deliver immediate support to the most at-risk and affected populations, reaching approximately 10.5 million people through the end of 2024. The Plan aims to protect vulnerable people from La Niña-induced disaster impacts, capitalize on the positive spillover effects of La Niña, and deliver early response where La Niña causes devastation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 01:40 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/la-nina-anticipatory-action-and-response-plan-september-december-2024-mitigating-expected-impacts-la-nina-induced-climate-extremes-agriculture-and-food-security)\n\n**Drought conditions expand in Lincoln and statewide, but relief could be on the way**\nDrought conditions in Nebraska have worsened, with nearly 35% of the state now in at least a moderate drought, including nearly 9% in severe drought.

Three Dow stocks that have advanced this year and are set to soar in 2025 and beyond are Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Nvidia (NVDA). Amazon has seen its stock soar 35% this year due to double-digit quarterly revenue growth and efficiency improvements, and a lower-interest-rate environment is expected to increase consumer buying power. Apple's solid moat has helped its iPhone stay on top, and the company is generating a new source of growth through services. Nvidia has reported triple-digit earnings growth quarter after quarter and is expected to benefit from the growth of the AI market, which is forecast to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade. According to The Motley Fool, 'All of this should help Amazon's shares continue to march higher.' 'Apple has a long track record of growth and offers investors dividends.'

Analysts have been mixed in their ratings, with some increasing their price targets and others lowering them. Tigress Financial increased their price objective on Apple from $245.00 to $295.00 and gave the stock a 'strong-buy' rating, while Jefferies Financial Group lowered shares of Apple from a 'buy' rating to a 'hold' rating and lifted their target price for the company from $205.00 to $212.92. The company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.51, a current ratio of 0.87, and a quick ratio of 0.83.

Nvidia Corp. led the decline among megacaps, while Apple Inc. sank after a closely followed analyst said iPhone 16 orders were cut by about 10 million units from the fourth quarter through the first half of 2025. Investors are cautious ahead of several key events, including big tech earnings, the US election, and the Fed meeting, which could be contributing to the market's skittishness.

Apple's revenue has not increased since 2022, and the recent release of the iPhone 16 has not met expectations, causing Wall Street analysts to lower their earnings per share (EPS) projections from $1.60 to $1.55. Apple's stock is trading at a premium of 35 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings, which is higher than most investors realize. According to the article, 'over the long haul, stock price movements are heavily correlated to earnings growth.' With Apple's EPS growth at 10% last quarter and expected to be 14% in the fourth quarter, the company's premium valuation may not be justified, and a correction in the stock price is possible.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 11:56 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The company's fundamentals don't support its current stock price, and the pressure on Apple's business is high.

The company's aggressive share buyback program and upcoming iPhone 16 launch are expected to drive revenue growth and margin expansion.

The valuation picture is a bit rich, with a forward 12-month earnings multiple of 30.5X, but the company's consistent earnings growth and strong cash-generating abilities make it a desirable investment. As one analyst noted, 'the stock continues to deserve a spot in any investor's portfolio.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2024 03:41 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Investors should monitor key overhead levels at $237 and $270, and crucial support levels at $233, $225, and $218. The stock has gained over 20% this year, but has traded sideways for three months due to concerns about the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence. A bullish golden cross signal in June led to a continued uptrend, and the price broke above the ascending triangle's upper trendline on high volume. Investors should watch for follow-through buying to test $237, a decisive breakout above the all-time high to reach $270, and support levels during retracements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 01:36 PM\nSource:[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-apple-price-levels-as-stock-trades-near-record-high-8728791)\n\n**Apple Stock Awaits Next Move After Breaking Through Resistance**\nApple's stock was able to break through the short-term resistance at $233.09 on Tuesday, reaching new all-time highs.

If the stock closes above $237.23, it would confirm the start of a new upward impulse. Without any resistance, the stock could potentially extend its gains to $260.

However, the gains were limited to 1.1% at the close of the session, with the stock price settling at $233.85. Over the past six months, Apple's stock has risen by over 35%, more than twice the growth of the Nasdaq 100 index. The company's new iPhone 16 models are expected to be in high demand, with some features of Apple Intelligence becoming available to US users in late October and expanding in December. Outside the US, clients will not have access to these features until March 2025. Analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that the waiting times for iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models are shorter than their predecessors, but have increased slightly in recent days. The overall waiting times for ordered iPhone 16 models are approximately one week shorter than those for iPhone 15 models at a similar stage in the market cycle. Experts attribute this to Apple's desire to quickly saturate the market with its new smartphones, unlike in previous periods. As Bloomberg notes, 'the company's capitalization briefly exceeded $3.6 trillion, setting a new historical high.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 05:06 AM\nSource:[3DNews - Daily Digital Digest](https://3dnews.ru/1112526/kursu-aktsiy-apple-vchera-udalos-obnovit-istoricheskiy-maksimum)\n\n**Apple stock hits record intraday high on bullish Wall Street outlooks, positive iPhone sales data**\nApple's stock hit a record intraday high of $237.49 on Tuesday, surpassing its previous record of $237.23. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Bernstein, and Evercore ISI have reiterated their Buy ratings on Apple stock. Positive preliminary iPhone shipment data from International Data Corporation (IDC) showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models, with sales also boosted by the rollout of the iPhone 16. IDC's Nabila Popal said, 'Despite the staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence in markets outside the U.S., Apple will continue to grow in the upcoming holiday season.' Morgan Stanley noted that Apple's supply chain checks suggest that the company has asked its suppliers to prepare component inventories earlier than typical patterns to avoid supply constraints. Apple will begin its rollout of Apple Intelligence on Oct. 28, with more significant updates expected in December and March 2025.

However, it's worth noting that reaching an intraday high does not guarantee that the stock will close at that level by the end of the session. As Apple has significant weight in indices like the Nasdaq and S&P 500, this could potentially boost them.

However, other stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have the potential to bring substantial profit to their investors, possibly allowing them to turn an investment of $100 into $1,000 in 2025. Microsoft's significant investments in artificial intelligence and its vast product portfolio have led BMO Capital Markets to raise its price target to $500. Amazon's diversified income flows and recent launch of Project Amelia, an AI-backed selling assistant, make it a strong contender. Currently, MSFT stock stands at $418.16, while AMZN stock is at $184.55.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is undergoing a period of transition as it prepares for a change in financial leadership and positions itself for an anticipated wave of artificial intelligence-driven upgrades. The company's CFO, Luca Maestri, will step down on January 1, 2025, and be succeeded by Kevan Parekh. Analysts expect continuity in Apple's capital allocation strategy, which has prioritized share buybacks and dividends. The company's revenue is forecasted to grow at a 5.8% CAGR from fiscal year 2023 to 2025, with gross and operating margins expected to improve. Apple's near-term prospects are closely tied to the upcoming iPhone 16 launch and the integration of AI features into its ecosystem. Analysts are particularly focused on the potential for AI to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle for iOS devices. However, the initial reception of the iPhone 16 has been mixed, with some reports indicating muted demand for both pro and base models. Apple's stock closed at $229.00 on August 30, 2024, with a market capitalization of approximately $3.5 trillion.

Apple's stock decline also affected the market. The S&P 500 index fell by 0.17%, while the Nasdaq composite index fell by 0.83%, and the Dow Jones index rose by 0.44%. Apple's shares fell by 3.23% after analysts, including Bank of America and J.P. Morgan, indicated that shipping times may indicate lower demand for the iPhone 16 Pro compared to the previous year. The S&P 500 index is within 1% of its highest level in July and is expected to reach its highest level ever this week. After a difficult start to the weak historical month of September, the three main US indices ended last week's trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices recording their best week of 2024. The Federal Reserve meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, and it is widely expected to be the first interest rate cut since March 2022. This week's cut is a critical step, as many investors hope it will lead to lower borrowing costs for companies and improved overall profit growth, boosting economic growth. The current borrowing rate is between 5.25-5.5%. Market participants are divided on whether the central bank will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points, according to the FedWatch tool from CME. Brian Belsky, a senior investment strategist at BMO Capital, said, 'Stocks tend to record strong gains during cycles, where initial rate cuts can support economic expansion.' He added in a note released on Friday, 'As long as nothing breaks in the economy, US stocks remain stable within an advancing market, but with significantly strong performance over a full year before the first interest rate cut, future gains are likely to be more subdued compared to historical standards, in our view.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 02:02 PM\nSource:[صحيفة الخليج](https://www.alkhaleej.ae/2024-09-16/%D9%88%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%AD-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B9-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A8-%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A/%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Martinez notes that a sustained close above $0.20 could be a key indicator of this trend. Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.161, having gained over 0.8% in the last 24 hours. Martinez is also optimistic about other large-cap altcoins, including Polkadot (DOT/USD) and Solana (SOL)-based memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF/USD).

At that time, social media buzz, Google Trends spikes, and new exchange listings fueled its rapid rise. Dogecoin opened for trading on Jan. 1, 2021 at $0.00468 and hit a high of $0.005685 on that day. A $1,000 investment at the time could have purchased 175,901.50 DOGE based on the highest price that day. Elon Musk's tweets would often result in heightened trading activity and a rise in Dogecoin's price, with the coin peaking at $0.7376 in May 2021. However, investors who bought Dogecoin shortly before the SNL episode aired or in the latter part of 2021 may be down on their current position.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 11:35 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

However, if DOGE fails to climb above the $0.1780 level, it could start another decline. The main support sits at $0.1630, and a downside break below this level could lead to a decline toward the $0.1500 level or even $0.1420 in the near term.

By 2030, Dogecoin's price could potentially reach a maximum of $4.06, surpassing the $1 milestone. The long-term projection for 2040 shows a minimum price of $14.38 and a maximum of $98.71. The predictions are speculative and subject to various market factors, including market sentiment, adoption and utility, technological advancements, regulatory environment, and competition in the crypto space. The Dogecoin community's enthusiasm and the token's elasticity are expected to contribute to its growth.

Despite predictions that 2025 may see the next bull market, DOGE's inflationary supply model, which generates over 5 billion new tokens yearly, makes it difficult for the coin to recover. Analysts predict DOGE may hit $1 in 2025, but it would need to fight with other well-established and up-and-coming cryptocurrencies for investor interest. Rexas Finance (RXS), on the other hand, offers a simpler approach to generating value by tokenizing real-world assets, a market predicted to expand greatly as blockchain technology develops.

This indicates a growing interest in Dogecoin. The surge in active addresses, reaching 133,880, suggests that more traders are using Dogecoin, creating a foundation for further price fluctuations. Despite increased activity, the DOGE price has remained relatively stable, ranging between $0.101 and $0.115 in the last few weeks. The continuous rise in network activity, typically associated with higher transaction volumes, has led to speculation that Dogecoin is on the verge of a price increase. However, the market remains cautious, with investors waiting for a clear breakout above the critical resistance of $0.116. If Dogecoin surpasses this level, it could trigger a more robust upward trend. On the other hand, if it falls below, support levels near $0.098 or $0.088 could lead to a stronger decline. The increase in active addresses may indicate growing dynamics, pointing to Dogecoin's enduring attractiveness, especially considering the recent surge in short-term trader activity on the meme currency market. Additionally, whale investors have accumulated 2.07 billion DOGE, the largest amount since January 2024, demonstrating increasing interest from key holders and providing hope for a longer run of the coins. Furthermore, the number of new Dogecoin addresses has increased by 72%, reflecting the growing popularity of the token in recent weeks.

This reflects the growing interest in the network. The unexpected increase in active addresses points to a larger number of operators using Dogecoin, setting the stage for new price fluctuations. Although activity has increased, the price of DOGE has remained relatively stable, ranging between $0.101 and $0.115 over the past few weeks. The continuous increase in network activity has led to speculation that Dogecoin could be about to surge. However, the market remains cautious. Investors are eagerly awaiting a clear breakout above the crucial resistance level of $0.116. If Dogecoin surpasses this level, it could trigger a more solid bullish trend, but if it falls short, nearby support levels around $0.098 or as low as $0.088 could lead to a more severe decline. Despite the price's subdued behavior, the increase in active addresses could indicate a bullish impulse. This trend points to Dogecoin's continued attractiveness, given recent reports of the surge in short-term traders' activity in the meme-coin market. In terms of participation in trading, it remains at the forefront among meme-coins, far ahead of other available tokens. Apart from the increase in active addresses, other notable changes have occurred. As we previously highlighted, whale investors have accumulated 2.070 million DOGE this month, the highest amount since January 2024. This broad buying behavior shows the growing interest among major holders and gives hope for the expansion of the coin's circulation. Additionally, the creation of new Dogecoin addresses has increased by 72%, reflecting the token's growing popularity over the past few weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE is trading around $0.1126 at the time of writing, and has increased by 1.22% in the last 24 hours.

Additionally, large Dogecoin holders have accumulated around 2.07 billion DOGE in the past week, the highest level since January 2024.

Dogecoin whales, holding over $10 million in DOGE, have increased their holdings by 1.25%, strengthening the bullish outlook.

Experts predict that DOGE will close at around $0.30 in 2024, which is still far below the desired $1 goal. PEPE, a new token based on the meme craze, has been rapidly capturing the market and attracting investors away from DOGE. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, offers tokenization of physical assets and has promised a $1 million giveaway to its participants in the presale. The project has already shown a 66% return to early backers and is projected to reach $11.2 by 2025.
