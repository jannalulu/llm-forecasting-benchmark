**Can We Schedule an Intercity Taxi in Advance?**
Intercity ride-sharing has emerged as a flexible and contemporary alternative to traditional taxi services, allowing passengers to set and negotiate prices with drivers. This approach provides a dynamic pricing structure, enabling passengers to influence their travel costs actively. By booking an intercity ride in advance, passengers can secure guaranteed availability, lower prices, and more precise travel planning. However, it's essential to consider factors such as cancellation policies, reliability, and flexibility when choosing a ride-sharing platform. Intercity ride-sharing services offer a more personalized approach than traditional taxis, allowing passengers to negotiate fares and customize their travel experience according to their needs.

**Waymo Launches Autonomous Ride-Hailing Service in Los Angeles**
Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, announced on Tuesday that its autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, is now available to the general public in Los Angeles, marking a rapid growth and adoption of the technology. The company raised $5.6 billion in funding last month, as automakers and tech companies are betting big on autonomous driving technology, despite facing strict regulatory scrutiny. Waymo said that nearly 300,000 people have joined its waitlist since it began commercial operations in Los Angeles earlier this year, indicating strong demand. 'Our service has matured quickly, and our passengers are adopting the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,' said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo. Waymo, based in Mountain View, California, is a pioneer in autonomous driving technology and launched its first driverless taxi service in the US in 2020, more than a decade after it was born as a project within Google. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, said in October that the electric vehicle manufacturer will launch autonomous ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas next year, indicating growing competition in the autonomous ride-hailing market. Cruise, a General Motors subsidiary, is testing cars with safety drivers after an accident last year forced it to remove all vehicles from the roads. Meanwhile, Zoox, an Amazon subsidiary, is expanding tests of its wheel-less and pedal-less vehicles.

**Independence to suspend bus services in 2025, citizens concerned with IRIS replacement**
The city of Independence will discontinue its free bus service on December 31, 2024, due to a lack of federal COVID-19 relief funding. The city plans to implement IRIS micro-transit, a ride-sharing program, within city limits, charging a flat rate of $5 per ride. However, daily riders are concerned that the proposed five cars with IRIS will not meet the demand of nearly 300,000 bus rides provided annually. The city will pay $420,000 for the six-month trial program, while riders will contribute $60,000 through the $5 fare. Independence city leaders will evaluate the program's efficiency after June 30, 2025. 'Introducing those fares, it does keep our transit costs within our budgeted amounts,' said Tom Scannell, community development director. 'I don't understand at all how it's going to soak up demand from all these folks who have to get places day in and day out,' said Anthony Cunningham, a daily rider. 'We have the ability to scale up if all of a sudden the city of Independence decides they undershot with five cars; we can add four, five, 10 more cars the next day,' said Terry O'Toole, president of KC operations with WHC Worldwide, the company which owns IRIS.

Tesla has started testing its ride-hailing service with employees in the Bay Area, using a safety driver behind the wheel. CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the service is available for Tesla employees, who can request a ride through the development app. The service is currently limited to the Bay Area, but Tesla plans to expand it to the public in 2025, starting in Texas and California. Musk said that the company is using the employee-only beta to test new features in the app, including ride progress and profile syncing. David Lau, Tesla's VP of Software Engineering, noted that the company has been preparing for this service for a long time, and has been building an app-centric approach to its cars from the start. The rider's Tesla profile will sync across ride-hailing cars, allowing for seamless access to media, navigation, and comfort features. However, the timeline for the public-facing beta is ambitious, and Tesla still needs to solve the problem of self-driving before the service can be fully implemented.

**GM's Cruise has shared a loose timeline for re-launching autonomous tests**
Cruise, a General Motors-run driverless ride-hailing company, has announced plans to re-launch autonomous tests in California, after losing its permit to operate self-driving vehicles last year following an accident. The company has been working on re-booting driverless ride-hailing services throughout this year, and has already deployed manual mapping vehicles in Sunnyvale and Mountain View. 'Resuming testing in the Bay Area is an important step forward as we continue to work closely with California regulators and local stakeholders,' Cruise wrote in a post. The company aims to re-launch supervised testing of five autonomous vehicles later this fall, and has been working to regain the trust of regulators and consumers after the accident. According to Cruise, the company has not been generating revenue since halting driverless operations last year. 'This will allow our local employees to engage directly with our product as they refine and improve our tech through R&D,' Cruise added.
