**Bears Predicted to Make Unpopular Decision on Future of Matt Eberflus**
According to sources, Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is expected to keep his job despite the team's 4-4 record this season. General manager Ryan Poles has a five-year contract with Eberflus and is reportedly committed to giving him a real shot with the current roster. Poles wants to avoid a repeat of the situation with former quarterback Justin Fields, who was traded after Poles took over as GM. The team has a solid defensive unit and skill position talent, but the offensive line has struggled with injuries. Despite the challenges, Poles is expected to stick with Eberflus, at least for now, and give the team a year to mature and create continuity. As Adam Rank said, 'Matt Eberflus actually has a five-year contract and that he might be more locked in... I talked to some people within NFL circles, people who are close to Ryan Poles, and they indicated to me that regardless of what happens... Matt Eberflus is coming back.'

**Matt Eberflus likely to return as Bears’ head coach in 2025, according to report**
According to NFL insider Adam Rank, Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is likely to return in 2025, despite the team's poor performance this season. Rank stated, 'They indicated to me that regardless of what happens at all, Matt Eberflus is coming back.' The Bears are currently 4-4 and have been plagued by consecutive ugly losses, with some players expressing concerns about Eberflus' ability to prepare the team. However, Rank's sources close to Ryan Poles indicate that Eberflus will be retained through at least next season. This news may be a bitter pill to swallow for Bears fans, who are eager for a change in leadership.

**This Bears team deserves better than Matt Eberflus: Silvy**
Silvy believes that the Chicago Bears deserve a better head coach than Matt Eberflus. He lists several reasons why, including Eberflus' inability to have his team ready to play after a bye week, allowing the Commanders to get into Hail Mary range, and not taking responsibility for his mistakes. Silvy also criticizes Eberflus for not being accountable, unlike players like Tyrique Stevenson and Caleb Williams. He suggests that GM Ryan Poles should fire Eberflus and hire a new head coach, citing the team's poor performance on the road and their inability to close games. Silvy argues that Eberflus is not a good head coach and that the Bears deserve better.

**Is Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus losing his locker room?**
The Chicago Bears' recent loss to the Washington Commanders has sparked concerns about head coach Matt Eberflus' grip on the locker room. Players have publicly questioned coaching decisions, with some calling for more discipline and better communication. Defensive players reportedly felt that Eberflus' 'positive spin on the day registers as very, very tone deaf' after the loss. Wide receiver DJ Moore expressed frustration with a goal line play-call, while cornerback Jaylon Johnson called for improvement in 'operation throughout the week.' Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams and tight end Cole Kmet also spoke about the need for more discipline, citing multiple teachable moments during the game and practice. The team's lack of discipline was evident on the final play, as cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was seen taunting Commanders fans and failing to follow his assignment. With more than half of the season remaining, the Bears' struggles have put a bad look on the team.

**Bears' Matt Eberflus finally takes some accountability after ruthless bashing**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has finally taken accountability for the team's poor execution in their loss against the Washington Commanders. Eberflus said, 'The game didn't finish the way we wanted it to, and it starts with me.' Players Jaylon Johnson and Cole Kmet also shared their thoughts on the game, with Kmet saying, 'I think it’s a really good lesson for everybody to learn from in terms of how to respect the game.' Johnson agreed, stating, 'We’re not redoing plays or we’re kind of, if somebody messes up, we’re not correcting it in that moment.' The players' comments suggest that the team needs to improve their attention to detail and correct mistakes in real-time.

**Matt Eberflus finally took responsibility for Bears' Hail Mary loss after 3 press conferences and 1 job rumor**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus finally took responsibility for his questionable late-game coaching decisions after the team's Hail Mary loss to the Washington Commanders. However, many are skeptical of his sincerity, as he initially blamed the players for their 'execution' and only admitted fault after several players, including tight end Cole Kmet and cornerback Jaylon Johnson, criticized the team's culture. Eberflus' timing is also seen as suspicious, as he may have been trying to do damage control after the players' comments. The article suggests that Eberflus' job security is at risk, as the team is in win-now mode and he has a poor record on the road. The possibility of Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson taking over as head coach is also mentioned, which may have been a factor in Eberflus' sudden change of heart.

**Top NFL offensive coordinator wanted to join Chicago Bears in 2024**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus was reportedly on shaky ground within the organization before the team drafted Caleb Williams as their franchise quarterback. However, the team's improvement from three wins to seven in 2023 and their current 4-3 record has given Eberflus a third season in Chicago. According to sources, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, widely regarded as a top-five playcaller in the NFL, had expressed interest in joining the Bears as their head coach. Johnson's expertise would have been a significant boost to the Bears' offense, which ranks 16th in scoring, despite having a star receiving corps and a 'generational' talent in Caleb Williams.

**Matt Eberflus' Replacement as Bears Head Coach is Clear Following Latest Report**
The Chicago Bears are on pace for a 10-win season, but their difficult remaining schedule may hinder their chances. If they fail to make the playoffs, head coach Matt Eberflus could be fired. According to NFL insider Albert Breer, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson was interested in coaching the Bears last season, but ultimately stayed with the Lions. Johnson, 38, has been instrumental in the Lions' success, leading their offense to a league-best 33.4 points per game this season. He could be a top candidate to replace Eberflus if the Bears decide to fire him, but they may face stiff competition for his services.

**Chicago Bears coaching job eyed by top NFL coordinator: Report**
Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Poles retained Matt Eberflus as head coach despite a 10-24 record in his first two seasons. However, Eberflus is now on the hot seat due to mixed results in the first seven games of the 2024 season. According to Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer, Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson wanted the Bears head coaching job in the 2024 offseason. Johnson has been credited with helping revive Jared Goff's NFL career and has a top-ranked offense in Detroit. The Lions are 6-1 this season and lead the NFC North in points. Breer's report raises questions about why Poles didn't replace Eberflus with Johnson in the same offseason he knew Chicago would draft a quarterback.

**Every time Matt Eberflus declined to take accountability in Bears' Week 8 loss**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus has been criticized for his lack of accountability in the team's Week 8 loss to the Washington Commanders. Throughout the game, Eberflus failed to take responsibility for key moments, including a Hail Mary defense that was 'beyond embarrassing.' When asked about the play, Eberflus said his focus was on the last play, not the second-to-last play where the Commanders gained 13 yards, giving them better field position. He also declined to use three timeouts, saying everyone was in the correct position, despite defensive back Tyrique Stevenson yelling at the crowd on the final play. Eberflus' lack of accountability has raised concerns about his ability to lead the team, with some questioning whether he will be retained beyond this season. As he has only three total road wins in his three years as head coach, his reputation as a coach is being damaged by his refusal to take responsibility for the team's performance.

**Matt Eberflus has some explaining to do after Bears' Hail Mary meltdown**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is facing criticism after a late-game coaching and team execution meltdown in an 18-15 loss to Washington. The Bears had a chance to win the game but made several mistakes, including rushing only three defenders, having a spy on Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels, and poor positioning. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was seen taunting Washington fans before the play, and Eberflus was confused about how the coverage broke down. Eberflus needs to address these issues and make sure the final two plays of the loss don't define his coaching career. He said, 'Our guys believe in each other, trust in each other, have faith in each other,' but the team's performance suggests otherwise.

**Hail Mary! 3 miracle Matt Eberflus replacements Bears should have on speed dial**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is under pressure, despite the team's surprising performance in 2024. The defense's lack of discipline and Eberflus's philosophy are to blame for the team's struggles. The Bears should consider replacing Eberflus with one of the following candidates: Brian Flores, who has head coaching experience and has turned the Minnesota Vikings defense into a force; Bill Belichick, who has expressed admiration for the late Buddy Ryan and has been a successful analyst this season; or Ben Johnson, who has a creative offensive mind and has been involved in the coaching cycle for two straight offseasons. Johnson would be a great fit for the Bears, as he is familiar with the division and could hire his own staff to mold quarterback Caleb Williams into one of the best young quarterbacks in the NFL.

**Matt Eberflus looked like a fired coach in aftermath of Bears Hail Mary loss**
Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus' job security is in question after a last-second loss to the Commanders. Despite the team's 4-3 record, Eberflus' coaching has been criticized, with some calling for his firing. The Bears' rookie quarterback Caleb Williams has been performing above expectations, but Eberflus' reaction to the loss, which included a Hail Mary touchdown, looked like a man ready to be fired. As one writer noted, 'Eberflus can hardly be blamed for such a failure, as the Bears secondary ought to have, ya know, actually knocked the ball down rather than lobbing it in the air for an alley-oop to Brown.' However, football fans in Chicago may not see it that way, and Eberflus' future as head coach is uncertain.

**Chicago Bears: Report shows Matt Eberflus is a weak head coach**
A report has surfaced that Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus is struggling to lead the team. The offense has been struggling, and the play-calling has been criticized by the national media. Tight end Marcedes Lewis and other players expressed their frustration with offensive coordinator Shane Waldron's conservative play-calling, saying he treats the offense like a 'Pop Warner' team. The players had a 'private meeting' with Waldron, but the results were not fruitful, and the offense continued to rely on the screen game. This has led to questions about Eberflus' ability to develop a young quarterback, Caleb Williams, and whether he is the right person to lead the team. Three team captains have reportedly scolded Waldron for not coaching, and Justin Fields has vented about his previous coordinator, Luke Getsy. Eberflus has made several disastrous coaching hires since 2022, and it seems that Waldron may be the next to go.

**Bears' Retention of Matt Eberflus Could Bite Them**
The Chicago Bears' GM, Ryan Poles, has made some excellent moves, but the team's poor start to the 2024 season, with a record of 1-2, has raised questions about his ability to choose a head coach. The Bears have never fired a coach midseason, but with Mike Vrabel available, it could be a consideration. Poles' talent evaluation skills, particularly in the offensive line, have been questioned, as the team's line has been 'terrible' and the signing of Nate Davis has 'not aged well.' The Bears' upcoming game against the Rams is crucial, and the team's ability to cobble together a decent offensive line will be key to their success. The question of what to do about head coach Matt Eberflus looms large, and Poles' future as GM may depend on it. 'Rather than resign themselves to another lost season, maybe a quick change of head coach could help salvage the situation,' says the article.

**Biggest loser in Bears' Week 3 loss vs. Colts**
The Chicago Bears suffered a 21-16 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 3 of the 2024 season. Head coach Matt Eberflus is taking a lot of heat for his poor game management and playcalling. Despite Caleb Williams' improved performance, throwing his first career touchdown and nearly 400 passing yards, Eberflus' decision-making was questionable. He burned two timeouts at critical times, including right before a two-point conversion attempt, and the playcalling was criticized for relying too heavily on passing plays. Eberflus' seat is not cold, but he and offensive coordinator Shane Waldron are the biggest losers from this game. As one Bears fan might say, 'It's on Eberflus if Waldron doesn't work out because he did the hiring.'

**Lincoln Riley Possibility for Bears Merely Cheap Name Dropping**
Colin Cowherd, a Fox Sports 'shock jock,' has stated that if the Chicago Bears lose three of their next four games, they will hear rumors about Lincoln Riley, the USC coach, potentially taking over the Bears. Cowherd believes that the Bears need to succeed over the next four games, and that Matt Eberflus, the current head coach, needs to prove himself. However, Cowherd also thinks that Eberflus and his staff may not have the right experience and coaching ability to handle a quarterback like Caleb Williams. Cowherd argues that Williams is an improvisational quarterback who needs strong coaching to get structure, and that the Bears may not be able to provide that. Despite Cowherd's comments, the Bears' ownership has been supportive of Eberflus, and it's unlikely that they would fire him mid-season. The Bears have a challenging schedule ahead of them, but they also have a chance to get on a roll and prove themselves.
