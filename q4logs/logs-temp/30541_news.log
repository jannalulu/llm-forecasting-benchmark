**Nolte: Biden's Approval Hits All-Time Low While Trump's Hits All-Time High**
According to a recent poll by Emerson College, Joe Biden's job approval rating has hit an all-time low of 36%, while Donald Trump's favorability rating has reached an all-time high of 54%. Despite four years of negative media coverage, Trump's rating has increased by six points since the pre-election period. The poll also found that Trump will enter office with a 'normal and customary honeymoon period', indicating that the people are with him and want him to implement his campaign issues. In contrast, Kamala Harris leads the 2028 presidential pack with 37% support, while Vice President-elect JD Vance leads the Republican pack with 30% support. Four of Trump's cabinet picks also enjoy a plurality of support, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Director of Health and Human Services, Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence, and Dr. Mehmet Oz as the head of Medicare and Medicaid.

**Harris fared better against Trump than any other potential Dem nominee, poll finds**
A recent poll found that Vice President Kamala Harris performed better against Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election than any other potential Democratic nominee. The Say24 / YouGov survey of 5,136 registered voters found that 46 percent said they cast their ballot for Harris, while 44 percent said they'd vote for Trump. Harris outperformed other potential Democratic candidates, including Joe Biden, Josh Shapiro, and Gretchen Whitmer, in hypothetical matchups against Trump. The poll suggests that it would have taken an extraordinary candidate to convince voters to stick with the Democratic Party, and that Harris still has a strong foundation to run as a candidate in 2028.

**There's Been Another Poll Released on the 2028 Democratic Field**
A recent poll from Emerson College shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading the Democratic field for the 2028 presidential nomination, with 37% of support. However, the margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points, putting Harris' lead within the margin of error. The poll also found that 35% of Democrats are undecided, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom has 7% support. The poll's results are consistent with a previous poll from Echelon Insights, which also showed Harris in the lead. The poll also examined Republican preferences, with 51% of Republicans saying they are undecided, and 30% supporting Vice President-elect JD Vance. Additionally, the poll found that President-elect Donald Trump's favorability has increased since the election, with 54% of voters viewing him favorably, compared to 48% before the election. Trump's favorability varies significantly by gender, race, and age, with his strongest age cohort being among voters 40-59. 'Trump's favorability varies significantly by gender, race, and age,' said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling. 'Trump's strongest age cohort is among voters 40-59, with 60% viewing him favorably, compared to 48% among those over 70. Notably, his favorability has risen among younger voters, with 55% of those under 30 expressing a favorable opinion.'

Additionally, 37% of voters believe aliens have visited the Earth, a 12-point increase from 2022.

**Kamala Harris Considers 2028 Presidential Run and Governorship of California**
US Vice President Kamala Harris is considering her options for continuing her political career, including running for governor of California and participating in the 2028 presidential election. According to Politico, Harris has instructed her aides and close associates to explore all possible options, including running for president and governor of California. Harris has told her aides that she 'will continue to fight', and plans to discuss her future plans with her family during the winter holidays. Harris became a presidential candidate less than 100 days before the election, after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. 'There's no one, no one, who really understands what she's been through over the last four months,' said sociologist Paul Maslin. Harris received 226 electoral votes, while Republican Donald Trump received 312. Some Democrats have expressed skepticism about her potential candidacy in 2028, but acknowledge that she has gained popularity and strengthened her position in the Democratic Party. A recent Echelon Insights poll shows that Harris has a 41% approval rating, significantly higher than other potential Democratic candidates.

**Kamala Harris instructs allies to keep options on table for possible comeback bid after disastrous ‘24 campaign: report**
Vice President Kamala Harris has reportedly been instructing allies to keep her options open for a possible political comeback, sparking speculation about a 2026 California gubernatorial run or a 2028 repeat bid for the presidency. Harris, 60, has been adamant with her close confidants that she is 'staying in the fight' and plans to mull over her political future with family during the holidays. According to former campaign aide Brian Brokaw, Harris could run for governor, president, or other offices, but would face skepticism due to her past electoral losses. Betting markets have mused that Harris could be viable in the 2028 presidential race, but she is lagging behind other Democrats such as Michelle Obama and Gavin Newsom. Harris' favorability ratings have been low, with 49% of registered voters expressing a negative view of her in a June 2023 NBC News poll. However, one post-election poll from Echelon Insights pegged Harris at 41% in a hypothetical 2028 Democratic primary, trouncing the likes of Newsom (8%), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (7%), and others.

**Donald Trump's Election Victory, in 6 Charts**
The 2024 presidential election results can be explained by several 'iron laws of politics' that were in place. Vice President Kamala Harris faced an unpopular administration with a 39% approval rating, which has historically led to a loss in elections. Additionally, consumer sentiment was low, with a 70.1 rating, which has also been a predictor of election losses. Despite these challenges, Harris improved upon Biden's performance in 2020 in a few areas, but Trump improved with a wider range of demographics, including Latino men, voters aged 18-29, and suburban voters. However, the election was not a 49-state victory, and the popular vote difference between Trump and Harris will be within a few percentage points. The outcome may not be a lasting realignment, as voters have proven to be finicky in recent election cycles.

**Democrats’ three big mistakes**
The US election results may seem to fit a global trend of voters rejecting incumbent leaders, but Kamala Harris could have bucked the trend. The US economy is performing well, with strong employment, rising wages, and decreasing inflation. Additionally, Donald Trump's weaknesses as a political figure, such as his low approval ratings, could have been exploited. According to a CNN poll, Trump's approval rating was as low as 34% after the January 6, 2021, incident, and his favorable rating sank to 31% in a CNN poll after the 2022 midterms, with an unfavorable rating of 60%. As a result, Republicans were disillusioned with him, and Ron DeSantis was outpolling Trump among Republicans in a Wall Street Journal poll in December 2022.

**Signs Kamala Harris could win are "clear as day" -- election forecaster**
CNN data analyst Harry Enten believes that Vice President Kamala Harris will win the 2024 presidential election, citing her higher favorability rating and the importance of abortion as a key issue.

He also pointed out that in 16 out of the past 17 elections, the more popular candidate won, with the exception of Donald Trump in 2016. Additionally, Enten reviewed special elections in 2023 and 2024, finding that Democrats have surpassed Joe Biden's 2020 margin by 2 points on average.

**Biden proposed her name as Democratic Party candidate for U.S elections, but Kamala Harris repeatedly snubs his requests to campaign**
US Election 2024 is heating up as President Joe Biden's attempts to rally support for Vice President Kamala Harris face unexpected resistance. Harris has been consistently declining Biden's requests for joint campaign appearances, leaving many to speculate about the tension between the two leaders. Harris has emphasized, 'My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency,' during a recent interview, aiming to show voters her distinct vision for the future. Despite this, the White House has stated that they remain in close communication with Harris' campaign to determine how Biden can assist. Harris faces pressure from both Democratic strategists and voters to separate her image from Biden's, asserting her independence. According to RealClearPolitics, Biden's approval rating is struggling, sitting at 40.8% approval and 56.6% disapproval. Harris has consistently defended Biden in public, but behind the scenes, there is speculation that if she wins on November 5, she may overhaul her staff, which has led to some Biden loyalists feeling uneasy about their roles.

**US Presidential Election: Harris and Trump in a Close Race**
The upcoming US presidential election on November 5, 2024, will feature Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as the main candidates. According to national polls, Harris is currently leading by a small margin, but analysts warn that this advantage is within the margin of error, making it unclear who the favorite is. In the US, the electoral system is indirect, meaning that citizens do not directly elect the presidential candidates, but rather electors who will form the Electoral College, where the future President will be determined. According to FiveThirtyEight, as of October 21, 2024, Harris has a 48.1% approval rating in the US, while Trump has a 46.4%. The Hill shows a similar trend, with a 1.3-point difference, with 49.1% for Harris and 47.8% for Trump. Recent polls show a similar trend, with Suffolk University and Quantus Insights indicating a 0.8-point difference between the two candidates. However, some recent polls anticipate a narrow victory for Trump, with a margin of one to three points. Experts note that national polls are not always a precise way to predict the election outcome, as the US uses a system of Electoral College to determine the President.

**What are the challenges Kamala Harris might face in the 2024 election?**
US Vice President Kamala Harris faces several challenges in the 2024 election, including low approval ratings for the Biden administration, difficulty in differentiating herself from Biden's policies, loss of support among key voter groups, biases related to her gender and racial identity, and potential election result challenges. According to a recent NBC poll, President Biden's approval rating stands at 43 per cent, and only 25 per cent of Americans believe his policies are beneficial for their families. Harris must navigate these obstacles to connect with voters looking for change or new ideas, particularly in swing states like Michigan, where her support among Arab Americans is nearly on par with Donald Trump's. As the first Black, South Asian, and female vice-presidential candidate, Harris faces heightened expectations to represent minority communities, which can be difficult to satisfy across diverse interests. 'Without strong support for Biden's record, Harris may find it challenging to present the administration's policies as positive,' said a recent NBC poll. 'Regaining trust with these voters will be essential for success in these critical regions,' added the article. A Harris victory may encounter resistance from Trump and his supporters, who could spread claims of election fraud, leading to confusion and eroding public trust in the election process. 'The potential for renewed false narratives could lead to confusion and erode public trust in the election process, especially if the race is close,' warned the article.

**Headwinds for Kamala Harris**
Analysts from the US confirm that the approval ratings of Vice President Kamala Harris have drastically changed. Initially, Harris was leading Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election polls, but now she is losing support. According to Steve Kornacki, an expert from NBC-News, Harris' 5-point lead from previous polls has disappeared, and Trump is now leading in six out of seven key states, albeit narrowly. The public perception of Harris has significantly declined: only 43% now view her positively, compared to 48% a month ago. In contrast, Trump's positive rating has increased to 43%. This is a surprising result, considering that most media outlets have reported positively about Harris and negatively about Trump.

**WATCH: MSNBC breaks down Kamala's plunge in popularity as Election Day approaches * WorldNetDaily * by Joe Kovacs**
According to a recent poll, Vice President Kamala Harris' popularity has declined significantly ahead of the 2024 election. Her positive rating dropped from 48% in September to 43% in October, while her negative rating increased from 45% to 49%. This shift has led to a tie with Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has a 43% positive rating and a 51% negative rating. The poll also found that Trump's retrospective approval rating is 5 points higher than President Joe Biden's, indicating that Harris is being weighed down by being part of an unpopular administration. As Kornacki said, 'The shift is here, it's with Harris, 43% positive, 49% negative. When we took that last poll a month ago, she was actually above water. She had a 48% positive rating and a 45% negative rating. There was a clear advantage for her a month ago on basic image, basic likability, basic perception over Donald Trump. That advantage, in our poll at least, has gone away in a month for her.'

**Here's Some More Bad News for Kamala**
A new NBC News poll shows the 2024 presidential race is now tied at 48 percent, with Donald Trump pulling ahead by five percentage points. The survey also found that more Americans view the Trump Administration more favorably than the Biden Administration. Kamala Harris, who saw a significant boost in approval ratings following President Joe Biden's exit from the race, is now hemorrhaging votes as Americans shift away from her campaign. 'As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,' Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt said. 'The race is a dead heat.' Harris is losing momentum among voters significantly, as experts say she needs a six-point lead to win the election. Trump takes the lead on critical issues most important to voters, such as the economy, inflation, immigration, and handling the conflict in the Middle East. Only 43 percent of Americans view Harris positively, while 49 percent view her negatively.

Harris' favorability rating is at 47.2%, compared to Trump's 43%. Political pundit Steve Schier notes that Harris' lead is within the margins of error in most polls and that she has yet to effectively introduce herself to many voters. Harris has narrow leads in the Rust Belt swing states and Nevada, while Trump is performing slightly better in the Sun Belt swing states.

**Kamala Harris Hits Best Approval Rating in Two Years**
A new opinion poll has revealed that Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris has her highest approval rating in over two years, with 44.9% of Americans approving of her and 47.6% disapproving. This is a significant improvement from her previous ratings, which had dropped to 37.4% in January of this year. Harris' approval rating has been steadily increasing since she took over the Democratic campaign this summer, and she now has a narrow lead in the race. In contrast, her Republican rival Donald Trump has seen his approval rating remain relatively stable, with 42.9% of Americans holding a favorable opinion of him and 52.6% holding an unfavorable one. President Joe Biden's popularity rating has seen a significant decline, with only 40.4% of Americans viewing him favorably and 54.5% viewing him unfavorably.

**Kamala Harris' Approval Rating Reaches New High**
A recent survey by 'Project 538' shows that a majority of Americans now have a positive opinion of Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate. This is a first for Harris, who had a negative image among 53.8% of Americans in July, while only 37.1% had a positive view of her. Harris' approval rating is now higher than that of her rival Donald Trump, who had a 45.7% positive rating. The survey was conducted after a TV debate between Harris' running mate Tim Walz and his Republican opponent J.D. Vance. Walz and Vance criticized each other's Iran policies, with Walz accusing Trump of being 'wankelmütig' (unreliable) and Vance defending Trump's record. 'It comes down to solid leadership,' Walz said. 'Donald Trump is unreliable. He will turn to whoever flatters him the most or where it suits him.' Vance responded that Trump had 'actually provided stability in the world through a effective deterrence.'
