**Bluesky's Momentum Rolls on, as Daily Users Surge 45% Since Thanksgiving**
Bluesky, an alternative social app to X, has seen its daily active user count in the U.S. more than triple since the day before the election, from 240,000 to 900,000 DAUs. The app's growth has held strong into December, with a 45% increase in daily users since the week of Thanksgiving. Bluesky's head of 'trust and safety', Aaron Rodericks, aims to create a 'safe space' for users, differing from X's approach to content censorship. Rodericks stated, 'I think what I learned from my experience at Twitter under previous leadership is that a number of users appreciate a safe and welcoming environment.'

**The French Open Unveils Official 2025 Roland-Garros Poster**
The French Open has unveiled the official 2025 Roland-Garros poster, created by artist Marc-Antoine Mathieu. The poster, inspired by comic book art, features a unique perspective of a tennis court from above, with 10 panels of different shapes that can form a comic book page. Mathieu explained, 'From the moment I realized that a tennis court seen in plan (with its tramlines and service boxes) resembles a comic strip, I had fun transforming the layout of a tennis court and marrying it with the grid pattern of a comic.' The artist aimed to recreate the color of clay as faithfully as possible, using a hybrid production method that combined his talent with digital assistance. Mathieu's main objective is to allow the audience to create their own story by inviting them to reconstruct the order of events in the 10 panels. He said, 'There's this obvious idea of a passage of time, which I signal by going from a sky-blue color to a nighttime blue. The court has fallen asleep, maybe the match continues, we don't really know... What happens at Roland-Garros at night when everyone has left? We can have many hypotheses, and that's what I find interesting in an image.' The French Open will take place from May 19 to June 8, 2025.

A giant Christmas ball has been installed in the Victory Park on Poklonnaya Hill, and the Theatrical Square and Patriarch's Bridge have been decorated with lace arches and Christmas star-shaped structures, similar to last year.' We have accumulated a sufficient stock of festive elements in Moscow over the past few years, which allows us to fully decorate the city,' Biryukov said. He added that the light and decorative structures have become multifunctional, allowing for multiple use and changes in their design.

**Trends of 2024: The year in social**
2024 has been a chaotic year for social media, with trends like Charli XCX's 'Brat' album campaign and the rise of X, formerly known as Twitter, dominating the headlines. However, the latter has seen a mass exodus of users, particularly after Elon Musk's divisive support for Donald Trump during the US election. Meanwhile, rival platform Bluesky has gained nearly 2.5 million users in recent months. TikTok's future remains uncertain in the US, where a federal court has ruled to ban the platform unless its parent company, ByteDance, sells its assets to a non-Chinese owned company. ByteDance and TikTok are holding out hope for a favourable ruling, with CEO Shou Zi Chew reportedly meeting with the President-elect. As one commentator noted, 'it's safe to say that 2024 has been one of social media's most unhinged years yet.'

**#BlueskyForValencia: A Solidarity Project for the Victims of the Dana**
The #BlueskyForValencia project is a solidarity initiative aimed at raising funds for the victims of the dana that devastated Valencia in October. The project was created by artists from the BlueSky social network, who came together to create a song. The song was composed by Aitor Sorginak, who is the head of Aro Berria Producciones, and features a group of musicians who have never met in person. The song will be released on December 22 and will be sold as a digital pack for 5 euros, with all proceeds going to the victims. The project is unique in that it was entirely composed, recorded, mixed, and mastered remotely, using telematic technology.

**Cognac Blues Passions Unveils 2025 Poster and Collector's Album**
The 32nd Cognac Blues Passions festival, organized by Belle Factory, has unveiled its 2025 poster, designed by Hugo Marchais. The poster features a psychedelic design reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s, with a 'sunset with cognac-inspired colors' and a 'luth africain, a bass, and guitars, as a nod to the roots of blues and Afro-American music', according to Samuel Vincent, director of Belle Factory. The festival will take place from July 2 to 5, 2025, a reduction from the previous five-day format, due to the 'economic context' and the 'mixed results' of the previous edition, which attracted 21,000 spectators. The organizers have not announced any headlining acts yet, but a collector's album, in partnership with Rolling Stone, has been released. 'We are adapting to the local economic context', said the organizers, who are also considering the impact of the previous edition's 'anxious atmosphere' during the legislative elections. 'It's a great poster, and we're happy to present it', said Samuel Vincent. 'The sunset with cognac-inspired colors is a nice touch', he added.

**Is Bluesky the Killer App That Will Kickstart the Web3 Revolution in 2025? | The Motley Fool**
Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, is gaining popularity and may be the 'killer app' that starts the Web3 revolution in 2025. With 24 million users and a growing user base, Bluesky's open-source code and community-driven development process make it an attractive alternative to traditional social media platforms. While it doesn't use cryptocurrencies or blockchain tokens, its Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT) supports Web3 ideas such as decentralized operation and public-but-secure message transfers. According to The Motley Fool, Bluesky's success could give the Web3 vision the adrenaline shot it needs, and its soaring user engagement could light a lasting fire under Web3 investments like Polkadot and Block. As one author notes, 'One 'killer app' can start a massive sea change.'

**Altmetric Adds Bluesky as New Social Media Tracking Source**
Altmetric, a service that measures the impact of scientific research papers online, has added Bluesky as a new social media tracking source. This is the first time Altmetric has included a social media platform like Bluesky in its analysis. Altmetric will track the number of mentions and views of research-related posts on Bluesky, in addition to other metrics such as citation counts and Altmetric scores. According to Altmetric, there were 395,000 posts on Bluesky as of October 25, 2024, including mentions of research papers. The platform will also consider factors such as the frequency of posts from individual accounts and whether they are focused on specific academic journals. With Bluesky's user base exceeding 20 million as of November 2024, and many scientists migrating from X to Bluesky, the platform is expected to provide new insights into the impact of scientific research papers.

**New social media updates and features to know this week**
Bluesky has gained 20 million users, a fraction of major social media platforms, but attracting a highly engaged and influential group, including journalists. Bluesky's unique feature of not throttling link reach has led to significant traffic and conversions. In contrast, Threads, owned by Meta, has grown to 275 million users but lacks engagement and interaction. Threads is now copying some of Bluesky's features, including swipeable feeds and user-curated lists. Instagram is also making updates, including new DM features and limited duration location sharing. Meanwhile, Australia is implementing a ban on social media use for users under 16, with penalties for companies that fail to keep kids off their platforms.

**The X-odus to Bluesky: Will it be another false start?**
The recent exodus from Twitter (now X) to platforms like Threads and Bluesky has sparked hopes of a new era in social media. With 35 million new users joining Threads in November and a 500% rise in Bluesky's user base after the US election results, the current migration carries a unique momentum. While X still has a massive 588 million active users, the concerns surrounding its toxic environment, inconsistent moderation, and erratic policy changes have driven users to seek alternatives. The timing of this migration is crucial, with Meta's Threads launching with Instagram's massive user base and Bluesky's decentralised protocol offering a technical foundation for a more independent and data-portable social network. However, technical features alone don't guarantee success, and the challenges facing this migration include Twitter's real-time nature, historical conversations, and integration into third-party services. Financial sustainability is also a concern, but the change in user expectations and the flexibility to innovate rather than imitate might just make this migration more promising than previous ones.

**Bluesky Social: What You Need to Know About the Latest X and Meta Rival**
Bluesky Social has gained 23 million users by October 2024, driven by the recent political turmoil in X and the drama surrounding the 2024 US presidential elections. Despite X's 300 million active users, its popularity has declined due to ongoing issues like harassment and hate speech, especially after Elon Musk's takeover in April 2022. This has led to a mass migration to alternatives like Bluesky and Threads, which are the only two platforms that meet the growing demand for a better social media experience. According to an article by Interesting Engineering, Bluesky Social has expanded its user base rapidly, driven largely by a influx from North America and the UK, increasing its user base to nearly 15 million worldwide, up from 9 million in September. This growth is attributed to various factors, including dissatisfaction with X. As reported by The Financial Times, 'The site has been boosted where academics, journalists, and left-leaning politicians have abandoned X, whose owner, the billionaire, is a prominent supporter of the elected president.' Bluesky also received a significant boost from Taylor Swift's fans, who migrated en masse after the 2024 US presidential elections, contributing to the platform's growth. Bluesky was launched by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in 2021 as an independent initiative, different from the changes made by Elon Musk in X. Dorsey presented the project in 2019 to create a decentralized standard for social media. Although he funded the initiative and oversaw its early development, Dorsey stepped back, and as of May 2024, he is no longer a member of the company's board. Since then, the leadership has passed to CEO Jay Graber, who previously worked on the cryptocurrency Zcash and founded the event planning platform Happening.

**Bluesky's Rapid Rise in the Social Media World**
Bluesky, 20 million active users as of November 2024, has solidified its place in the social media ecosystem and is a significant indicator of its future potential. Founded in 2022 by Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter's co-founders, with a vision that prioritizes free speech and user control, the platform is based on the AT Protocol, a decentralized technology that allows users to manage their data and interactions according to their preferences. The mission is to provide an alternative to the traditional social media platforms' criticized algorithmic manipulation and centralized structure. The platform's success is attributed to several unique features, including: * Decentralization and user control: Bluesky's AT Protocol allows users to manage their data and privacy settings entirely on their own, providing a solution to the frequent privacy breaches in traditional platforms. * Simple and ad-free interface: The platform offers a clean design, prioritizing a chronological feed over algorithmic content sorting, resulting in a distraction-free user experience. The absence of ads is also a significant advantage. * Community and exclusivity: By initially accepting users only through invitations, Bluesky created a sense of curiosity and community, helping users develop a sense of belonging. * Influential support: The platform's growth was also facilitated by the support of many high-profile users and influencers who left X due to dissatisfaction. This migration helped increase Bluesky's visibility and attracted a wider audience. Initially struggling to find its place in a saturated market, Bluesky began to gain momentum with Elon Musk's controversial changes to X, which led to criticism of user experience, moderation policies, and excessive advertising. Bluesky, offering a more transparent, free, and minimalist experience, attracted users seeking alternatives.

**Why Bluesky is different: The freedom to choose content vs the dictatorship of the algorithm**
Bluesky, a micro-messaging social network similar to Twitter, has surpassed 21 million users since its public launch in February 2024. The platform's growth is attributed to its unique features, such as user control over content and the ability to create moderation systems. Unlike X, where the algorithm dictates what users see, Bluesky allows users to tailor their content to their preferences. Users can also create and subscribe to filters of posts, such as blocking churches, porn, or gore. The platform has gained traction in various countries, including Spain, where it reached the top 3 in downloads. Researchers believe that Bluesky's features, such as block lists and verification of identity, could offer new models for studying echo chambers. While it's unclear whether Bluesky will become the new X, it's likely to create new dynamics that will make it distinct from Twitter. 'It is the same service, but with very different things,' says Ignacio Castro, professor at Queen Mary University of London. 'Bluesky offers users more control over tailoring content to their preferences, without being subject to the whims of the platform's owner.'

**Bluesky hits 20 Million users, rapidly closing gap with threads**
Bluesky, a decentralized social network, has reached 20 million users, closing the gap with Instagram Threads. According to Similarweb, Bluesky's daily active users (DAU) in the U.S. are now just 1.5 times behind Threads, a significant decrease from earlier. Bluesky has also surpassed Threads in daily website visits in the U.S. and the UK. The platform's mobile app usage has surged, with a 519% increase in usage following the U.S. mid-November elections. Several factors contributing to this growth include X's controversial decisions, such as selling user data and altering blocking features. Bluesky's growth momentum began in February 2023, with its user base growing from 9 million to 20 million in November. Since the U.S. elections, Bluesky has been gaining 100,000 new users daily. The platform's unique features, such as custom algorithms and personalized domain names, are helping it attract users seeking 'real' human connections and a more intimate experience.

Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, has seen a surge in users following the US presidential election, with 19.8 million users and a million new users per day. The platform, founded by Jack Dorsey, offers a unique approach to social media, with users having more control over their data and content. While it still lags behind X and Threads in terms of user base, Bluesky's CEO Emily Liu says the platform is focused on providing a better user experience and is developing tools to tackle moderation challenges. However, some experts warn that decentralization can lead to less accountability and that Bluesky still has a long way to go to compete with established platforms. Bluesky has announced plans to introduce advertising, but for now, it remains ad-free. The platform's success is still uncertain, and it remains to be seen if it will be able to sustain its growth and maintain its unique community vibe.

**Bluesky Sees Another Major User Boost, Competes With Threads, X**
Bluesky has added over 1 million new users in the past 24 hours, marking another major boost for the social-media company as it competes with X and Threads in the microblogging app space.

According to Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, the platform currently holds a spot at the top of the free apps chart on the App Store in the U.S. and has a higher percentage of posters than most social sites, with around 30% of users actively posting content.

**Bluesky is courting the Swifties | TechCrunch**
Bluesky has seen a 15% growth in users since Donald Trump's election win, reaching 2 million new users. A community of Taylor Swift fans, or 'Swifties,' has emerged on the platform, with almost 13,000 users signing up with the 'swifties.social' domain name. This growth is attributed to a tool created by Bluesky developer Samuel Newman, which allows users to claim subdomain handles from a domain they own. Newman said, 'It's taken off in ways I didn't expect... The handle is a great signal for what kind of account you are, and stan accounts absolutely love being able to self-identify themselves like that.' The tool went viral after X was temporarily banned in Brazil, and again after the election, with the Swifties.social domain growing from 2,000 to 12,800 users. Other fandoms, such as BTS and Beyoncé fans, have also emerged on the platform. Bluesky CEO Jay Graber noted, 'We... have a higher percentage of posters than most social sites, which follow a 90-9-1 pattern of lurkers-commenters-posters. We haven't dipped below ~30% posters.'

**Bluesky Sees Surge in Registrations as Users Flee X**
The migration from X (formerly Twitter) to Bluesky has gained momentum, with users fleeing the platform's new policies, such as invisible posts based on the poster's relevance, invasive advertising, and Elon Musk's active support for Trump in the US elections. Bluesky, a social network 'daughter' of Twitter, has seen a surge in registrations after being accessible only by invitation. According to its creator, Jack Dorsey, the concept is a microblogging platform with a 300-character limit, similar to Twitter. Dorsey and his team developed Bluesky as an experiment to decentralize the social network, but Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter put the project on hold. Now, users can register on Bluesky by downloading the app or accessing the website, clicking on 'Register user', and completing their profile information.

**As users flee Elon Musk’s X, Bluesky firms as the new home for posters**
Bluesky, a Twitter clone founded by Jack Dorsey, has gained over 15 million users since its public launch in February 2024, with over 2 million people joining since the US election. Dr. Naomi Smith, a digital sociologist, attributes the decline of Elon Musk's X to his 'continued hijinks in both business and politics' making it 'unappealing for people to socialise on.' Users are fleeing X due to Musk's actions, including backing Donald Trump's bid for the White House and promoting hate speech. Simon Katterl, a mental health advocate, said he switched to Bluesky because he didn't want to support Musk and wanted a space for 'deeper dialogue rather than a feral cesspit.' Other users cited Musk's artificial pushing of his own posts and 'wall-to-wall hate, disinformation and enabling fascist trolls' as reasons for leaving. The Guardian has also announced it will no longer post to X due to its 'often disturbing content.'

**How the US election result is pushing social media users away from X and onto Bluesky**
Following the US election, a mass exodus of users is underway on X, with many turning to alternative platforms like Bluesky. According to Bluesky's COO Rose Wang, the platform gained 700,000 new users in the week after the election. Politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Taylor Swift are also joining Bluesky, with Swifties reportedly making up a significant portion of the exodus. The departure of users is attributed to Elon Musk's increasingly close relationship with Donald Trump and the platform's shift towards 'free speech' and hate speech. X has the largest proportion of disinformation among six big social media networks, according to a study by Trustlab. The Berlin Film Festival has also announced that it will no longer be on X from December 15.

Bluesky has seen a surge in users, growing from 9+ million in September to 14.6+ million as of Tuesday, with a daily increase of around 100,000 users. According to Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, engagement on Bluesky is higher than on X, with a higher percentage of 'posters' (those who actively engage) compared to lurkers. Graber recommends posting into relevant feeds, commenting on others' posts, and using hashtags to increase engagement. The shift in user adoption follows changes made by Elon Musk since buying X in 2022, which have been criticized for promoting right-wing views and suspending accounts at a higher rate.

Following the U.S. presidential election, X, formerly Twitter, has seen a significant exodus of unhappy users moving to Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform. Bluesky has grown from 9+ million users in September to 14.6+ million as of Tuesday, with a surge of 700,000+ users in the past week. According to Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, engagement on Bluesky is higher than on X, with a higher percentage of 'posters' (those who actively engage) compared to 'lurkers' and 'commenters'. Graber recommends posting into relevant feeds, commenting on others' posts, and using hashtags to increase engagement. The shift in user adoption follows changes made by Elon Musk since buying X in fall 2022, which have led to concerns about the platform's neutrality. Bluesky's decentralized nature and user customization options make it less likely to become a partisan platform, and interest in the app has been growing for some time.

**What is Bluesky? 700,000 new users sign up to X rival after Trump's election win**
Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform, has gained 700,000 new users, bringing its total user base to 14.5 million worldwide. This growth is attributed to the chaos at X (formerly Twitter) since Elon Musk's takeover in 2022. Bluesky's CEO, Jay Graber, said, 'It's very playful and chaotic. Especially over the past year, we've had a very high poster-to-lurker ratio.' The platform has a unique design, with an interface similar to X's, and a feature called 'skeets' for posts. Bluesky operates off multiple servers, giving users more control over their data. However, the platform has faced criticism for temporarily allowing racist slurs in user accounts and its moderation policies. Graber has stated that Bluesky will introduce ads at a slow rate and will not 'enshittify' the network.

**What We Know About Claim Some PA Trump Voters Won't Get Christmas Bonus Due to Tariffs**
A viral social media story claimed that Pennsylvania workers who voted for Donald Trump would not receive Christmas bonuses in 2024 due to his proposed tariffs. However, despite widespread sharing, there was no evidence to support the claim. The story was shared as a screenshot with an unnamed 'small manufacturing company' and an unidentified original poster. After conducting a thorough search, we were unable to find the original post or comment on social media platforms Bluesky or YouTube. As a result, we have rated this claim as 'unfounded' and will update the story if evidence is found to support the claims. 'This is the level of ignorance voting against their own interests here in PA, where we failed American women and children last night,' the original poster claimed, but their statement remains unsubstantiated.
