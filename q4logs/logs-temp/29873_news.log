**US oil drilling costs may reach $67-$70 per barrel by 2026 under Trump**
A report by Ventura Securities suggests that US oil drilling costs may reach $67-$70 per barrel by 2026 under a Trump presidency. The report notes that increased US oil production through aggressive drilling policies could lead to shifts in global supply dynamics, influenced by factors such as Middle East tensions, sanctions on countries like Iran, and trade tensions. The report also mentions that trade uncertainty and frictions remain a headwind to crude prices, and that a resurgence of sanctions on Iran could lead to a potential loss of supply from the oil market. Currently, market prices stand at $70 for WTI Crude, $74 for Brent, and Rs 6,024 for MCX November Futures. The report suggests that the Trump regime may bring comfort to the oil industry by investing in pipeline infrastructure, thereby increasing crude oil output.

**US Oil Production: Standard Chartered Says Growth Will Slow Down Under Trump**
Standard Chartered has stated that the US oil production, particularly shale oil, has changed significantly since Donald Trump took office in 2017. The bank notes that US oil production reached a record high of 13.40 million barrels per day (mb/d) in August 2024, surpassing the previous record of 3.31 mb/d set in December 2023. However, the growth rate has slowed down, with a 0.4 mb/d increase over the pre-pandemic level of November 2019, equivalent to an annual growth rate of just 80,000 barrels per day (kb/d). StanChart predicts that the growth rate will continue to slow down in 2024 and 2025. The bank also notes that the dynamics of US shale oil production make it difficult to maintain long-term increases in supply, as the industry is dominated by major companies, independent producers, and private companies, rather than a national oil company like those in OPEC. These companies have largely moved away from easy drilling and have adopted a strict capital discipline, prioritizing dividend payments and share buybacks over rapid production increases. StanChart also highlights the significant activity in mergers and acquisitions in the sector, which has reduced the number of operating companies and transformed the landscape from a mosaic of small production areas to larger contiguous areas. This new approach enables complex drilling and completion techniques, including multi-pad wells with extremely long lateral sections that can optimize spacing and associated infrastructure. These efficiency gains in drilling and completion have allowed production to continue growing despite the decline in the number of drilling rigs. Goldman Sachs has also predicted that US oil production will increase by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, a slower growth rate than the over 1 million bpd increase seen last year. However, the US will account for 60% of non-OPEC production growth, with the Permian expected to grow by 340,000 bpd, down from Goldman's initial-year forecast of 520,000 bpd. According to GS, technological and efficiency gains have accounted for almost all the growth in the Texas and New Mexico shale since 2020; however, the bank has warned that 'the Permian is maturing and its deteriorating geology will weigh on oil production in the future.' The number of drilling rigs in the Permian has fallen by nearly 15% from its peak in April last year, standing at 309 and is down 30% from the 2018-2019 average, Goldman Sachs has revealed. GS has predicted that the number of drilling rigs in the Permian will be below 300 by the end of 2025. StanChart has also highlighted that shale oil has a different production profile than conventional oil, with production ramping up quickly but then declining rapidly, often within a couple of months. The decline rate is determined by various factors, including the characteristics of the reservoir, completion techniques, and extraction practices, but can be as high as 80%. These high decline rates and short production profiles mean that new production must be brought online continuously, the so-called 'Red Queen effect.' If managed effectively, StanChart has predicted that the US supply will stabilize at current prices. However, high tariffs imposed by Trump in 2018 on some steel imports and aluminum have discouraged large increases in production. The steel used in all phases of drilling and production, including treated steel for drilling equipment, pumps, pipes, and conduits, has become a significant cost pressure for US oil producers, as cited in various recent industry surveys. Finally, it is likely that Trump will open federal lands to exploration and production. However, StanChart has noted that the times required for license release, exploration, evaluation, and potential production are multi-year, meaning that any production from federal lands will likely occur after the end of his four-year term.

**US Oil and Gas Rig Count Holds Steady for Record Third Week – Baker Hughes**
The US oil and gas rig count has remained steady for a record third week in a row, according to Baker Hughes' data. The total rig count was 585 in the week to November 8, with oil rigs holding at 479 and gas rigs at 102. This is 31 rigs, or 5%, below the count at this time last year. The decline in rig count is attributed to a decrease in oil and gas prices, higher labor and equipment costs, and companies focusing on debt repayment and shareholder returns. US oil futures are down 2% so far in 2024, while US gas futures are up 6%. US crude output is expected to rise to 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 and 13.5 million bpd in 2025, while US gas output is expected to slide to 103.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 bcfd in 2023.

**U.S. drilling rigs rise for first time in five weeks, Baker Hughes says (NYSEARCA:USO)**
According to Baker Hughes, the number of active rigs drilling for oil and gas in the U.S. increased by 8 to 590, marking the first weekly gain in five weeks and the largest increase in a year. This growth was driven by a 5-rig increase in crude oil drilling to 488 and a 3-rig increase in gas rigs to 97. However, the total count remains 51 rigs, or 8%, lower than this time last year. The Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions saw no change in oil rigs, with 303 and 42 rigs respectively.

**US drillers add oil and gas rigs for first time in five weeks,...**
US energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs for the first time in five weeks, with the total rig count rising by eight to 590, according to Baker Hughes. This increase was the biggest in a year, returning the count to mid-June levels. However, the total count is still down 51 rigs, or 8%, below this time last year. Oil rigs rose by five to 488, while gas rigs rose by three to 97. Despite a decline in oil prices, drillers are on track to boost US crude output from 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023 to 13.7 million bpd in 2025, according to the EIA. On the gas side, output is expected to slide to 103.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2024, down from a record high of 103.8 bcfd in 2023. 'The increase was the biggest since the week to Sept. 15, 2023,' Baker Hughes said. 'Despite this week's rig increase, the total count was still down 51 rigs, or 8%, below this time last year,' the company added.
