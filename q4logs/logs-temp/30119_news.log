**The Green Wooden Snake: What to Expect and Hope for in 2025**
The year 2025 is expected to be marked by the Green Wooden Snake, a symbol of wisdom, flexibility, and change in the Eastern zodiac. According to astrologers, this year will be full of challenges and tests, particularly in the first and third quarters, when it's essential to focus on health and finances. However, despite the difficulties, 2025 may also bring opportunities for significant changes, making it an ideal time for marriage, childbirth, career changes, or buying a home. As the Eastern wisdom says, 'wait until your enemy's corpse floats by,' in 2025, patience and calmness will be key to success. The Green color associated with the Wooden Snake represents growth, development, and optimism. People born in the year of the Snake should avoid pushing others, as they may unleash destructive power. To attract good fortune and prosperity, astrologers recommend preparing the space for the Snake's arrival by decorating with tropical plants and Eastern elements, such as fountains or Chinese coins. A wooden or ceramic snake figurine, along with green accents, will create the right atmosphere for the New Year's celebration. The New Year's table should feature a minimalist color scheme with gray and green tones, and the menu should focus on vegetable appetizers and dishes made with grains. Meat should be light, such as poultry or pork. Gifts for the year should be ornaments, with women receiving snake-themed jewelry, such as a necklace or bracelet, and men receiving accessories for work or hobbies, like a wallet or cufflinks.

**The Symbol of 2025: The Green Wooden Snake**
According to the Eastern tradition, each year is controlled by one of the 12 zodiacal animals. In 2025, the symbol will be the Green Wooden Snake, which is associated with changes and updates, as reported by the newspaper 'Izvestia'. The new year in the Eastern calendar begins on the first day of the lunar calendar, which will be January 29, 2025, marking the start of the year of the Green Wooden Snake. Although many people fear snakes, perceiving them as predators, in Eastern culture, these creatures symbolize wisdom and flexibility. In Chinese mythology, snakes often appear as companions of gods and assistants of heroes. They are associated with changes and renewal, as they can shed their skin. The snake adapts calmly to new conditions, but does not tolerate pressure. Combined with green color and wood elements, it symbolizes growth, harmony, and continuous development. It is best to celebrate the year with close people. Snakes do not like crowds, and what is important is coziness and a warm atmosphere. For clothing, it is worth choosing strict styles and single-colored fabrics. Green, brown, beige, and gray tones will suit the snake, while it is better to avoid red color. In home decoration, it is recommended to use green, gray, and white shades with golden accents. Live plants will help create a 'tropical' atmosphere. The festive table should feature meat dishes - chicken, turkey, rabbit, as well as vegetables, as advised by the Moscow Komsomol newspaper.

**The Year 2025: A Time of Transformation and Change**
According to astrologer Marina Romanova, the year 2025 will be the year of the Green Wooden Snake. This year will be a time of transformation, and people and countries will undergo significant changes. The combination of the wooden element and the green color of the snake's energy will bring a sense of calm and tranquility, which is necessary for the world in a time of crisis. However, this energy can only be achieved through conscious growth and a re-evaluation of one's values, especially for those who hold the fate of nations in their hands. In 2025, we will see the seeds of a new world, both in our families and in the country, and this will happen as a result of radical changes in all areas of life on a global scale. These changes will not always be easy. The year 2025 will be a time of great transformation, and it will be influenced not only by the snake but also by the planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, which will change the signs of the zodiac. This will be a year of great change in societies, communications, government, and leadership. The beginning of 2025 will be quite challenging, as it will force us to change our activities. The year will start with retrograde Mars, retrograde Venus, and retrograde Mercury. By the middle of the year, humanity will be faced with the need to change its value orientations. It is essential to pay attention to spiritual growth and transition from egoism to altruism. The astrologer warns that 2025 may be a difficult year in the medical field, with an increased risk of epidemics. It is essential to pay attention to one's health, lead a healthy lifestyle, and engage in disease prevention. The most favorable periods in 2025 are from April 14 to June 8, from June 26 to July 17, from August 12 to September 1, from September 25 to November 8, and from November 30 to December 31. According to the expert, in these periods, it is desirable to be socially active and not afraid of changes. For Ukraine, 2025 will be a year of great changes at the level of power. The year will start with a 'royal degree' - a period of success and transformation for the better. In the next year, Ukraine will attract positive energies from Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury. Important agreements will be signed, and we will meet with true benefactors. It is worth waiting for the expansion of borders and the strengthening of ties with partners. This is a year that will prepare an updated Ukraine. As for what not to do in 2025, it is not recommended to rush, manipulate people, or use outdated methods. The universe will progress, and we must keep pace with it. Everything will be new, so we need to grow beyond ourselves. During the retrograde period of Mars (December 6, 2024 - February 24, 2025), it is not recommended to be socially active. During the retrograde period of Venus (March 2-27), it is not recommended to get married. Every three months, there is a period of retrograde Mercury, during which it is not recommended to sign contracts. As for what to do in 2025, it is considered a favorable year for spiritual growth, re-evaluation of one's place in life, and determination of new perspectives. It is recommended to meditate more often and engage in self-analysis. It is also not necessary to be afraid of changes. If you have long wanted to change something in your life, this is your chance. Astrologer Marina Romanova advises, if possible, to switch to a plant-based diet and work on your body. The body, like a tree, should be flexible and resilient. This year is very favorable for professional growth. You can start learning something new, engage in construction, reconstruction, or create a family.
