**Luke Bryan Is 'In Awe' of Morgan Wallen: Here's Why**
Luke Bryan, a two-time CMA Entertainer of the Year winner, believes that Morgan Wallen has a strong chance of winning the award this year. Bryan says, 'When I look at what Morgan Wallen's doing out there, selling out multiple [stadiums], and I know Luke Combs is doing that too, and obviously, they're just both great entertainers.' Bryan has been impressed by Wallen's growth from touring with him to putting on 'Garth Brooks-like stadium shows.' Bryan thinks that Wallen is 'certainly worthy' of the award and predicts that he may win it in the next couple of years. The nominees for Entertainer of the Year include Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen, and Lainey Wilson, with Wallen leading the pack with seven nominations.

**Lainey Wilson Shares Her Pick to Win Entertainer of the Year at the 2024 CMA Awards**
Lainey Wilson, who won Entertainer of the Year at the CMA Awards last year, is not counting on winning again this year. Instead, she's predicting that Jelly Roll and Morgan Wallen will take home the award. Wilson, who is up against big names like Luke Combs and Chris Stapleton, said, 'I've worked my butt off this year to prove to the folks that thought I didn't deserve Entertainer of the Year, to show them why the people in this town chose me.' She added, 'So if it don't happen, that's alright. There's so many people in this town that deserve to win all these awards who have never even been nominated.' Wilson is one of only eight women to have won the Entertainer of the Year award since 1967, and she's hoping to prove herself again this year.

Morgan Wallen leads the 2024 Country Music Association Awards nominations with seven, including top prize entertainer of the year and male vocalist categories.

Post Malone and Lainey Wilson are tied with four nominations, while Jelly Roll, Luke Combs, Kacey Musgraves, and Megan Moroney have three nominations each. Notably, Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' was snubbed for a nomination, despite being a landmark country album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard country albums chart earlier this year, making her the first Black woman to top the chart since its 1964 inception. 'It was an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed … and it was very clear that I wasn't,' Beyoncé said, likely referencing a 2016 CMAs performance that resulted in racist backlash.

**Texans Post Malone, Kasey Musgraves among 2024 Country Music Association award nominees**
The 2024 Country Music Association award nominations have been announced, featuring a number of artists with Texas ties. Post Malone and Kasey Musgraves are among the nominees, but Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' album was surprisingly snubbed. Morgan Wallen leads the nominations with seven, including top prize and male vocalist categories. Wallen's hit 'I Had Some Help,' featuring Post Malone, is a major reason for his lead. Other notable nominees include Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton, and Lainey Wilson. Stapleton and Cody Johnson have five nominations each, and could take home seven trophies if they sweep their categories. The 2024 CMA Awards will air on Nov. 20 on ABC at 8 p.m. Eastern, and can be streamed the next day on Hulu. 'It was a great day,' said no one, as Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' album was left out of the nominations. 'I Had Some Help,' which features Wallen, is up for single, song, musical event and music video of the year, and is the main reason why the country singer leads the pack this year. 'Man Made a Bar,' a collaboration with Eric Church, is also up for musical event of the year. 'Fathers & Sons,' 'Deeper Well,' and 'I'm Not Pretty' are also among the nominated albums and music videos. 'I did not feel welcomed … and it was very clear that I wasn't,' said Beyoncé, likely referencing a 2016 CMAs performance that resulted in racist backlash. The CMA Awards are nominated and voted on by members of the Country Music Association, which includes music executives, artists, publicists, songwriters and other industry professionals.
