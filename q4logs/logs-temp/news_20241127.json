Denver may see only a couple inches of snow, but it could delay flights and slow travel. The storm is expected to move east, impacting the Appalachians and potentially causing significant disruptions for tens of millions of travelers. Cold temperatures will also add to the travel woes, with 196 million Americans waking up to below-freezing temperatures by Saturday morning. According to AAA, 79.9 million people will travel 50 miles or more from their homes for Thanksgiving, a 1.7 million increase over last year. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18.3 million people from Tuesday through Dec. 2, its busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record. 'Track and intensity (will be) the keys to where the rain and snow line will set up and the amount of snow that will fall in the Midwest and Northeast,' said AccuWeather Meteorologist Bernie Rayno. 'We anticipate that trend to continue,' said TSA Administrator David Pekoske, referring to the 10 busiest travel days in the TSA's history all occurring in 2024.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2024 01:09 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/storms-snow-threaten-chaos-thanksgiving-130239281.html)\n\n**What a weak La Niña could mean for Connecticut’s winter weather**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its forecast for La Niña this winter, predicting a weak and short-lived event. According to NOAA, there is a 57% chance of La Niña emerging in October-December 2024 and persisting through January-March 2025. A weak La Niña is expected to have a minimal impact on weather conditions this winter. However, previous research suggests that weak La Niña events are often associated with snowier winters in the Northeast, particularly in northern New England and portions of New York. A close inspection of Connecticut on the map from NOAA shows most of the state has seen more snowfall than average during weak La Niña events. Additionally, weak La Niña events tend to keep temperatures near normal for Connecticut. However, many other factors influence a long-range forecast, and a forecast based solely on typical weather seen during weak La Niña events contradicts the consensus of most forecasts, which are calling for less snowfall than average and warmer temperatures than average for this winter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2024 10:00 AM\nSource:[thehour.com](https://www.thehour.com/weather/article/ct-weather-la-nina-forecast-19940675.php)\n\n**Colorado mountain snow expected to interfere with Thanksgiving travel this week**\nA winter storm system is expected to bring heavy mountain snow to Colorado, impacting travel during Thanksgiving week. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for the high country, with significant travel impacts expected. The storm will bring 10-20 inches of snow to the mountains, with the heaviest snowfall occurring Tuesday. Rain will switch to snow in the Denver metro area on Tuesday night, with only a trace amount of snow expected. The Colorado Department of Transportation warns drivers about increased DUI enforcement during the holiday rush, and advises travelers to check their tires before leaving. The best travel times for motorists are before 1 p.m. on Sunday and before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on Monday. Denver International Airport anticipates more than 844,000 passengers during the travel period, with the busiest days expected to be Nov. 22, Nov. 30, and Dec. 1. Officials recommend getting to the airport two hours before boarding time, especially during peak times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 08:30 PM\nSource:[denver7.com](https://www.denver7.com/weather/weather-news/thanksgiving-travel-forecast-what-to-expect-on-colorados-roads-and-in-the-sky)\n\n**New winter forecast shows chances of rain, snow for Tennessee, other states**\nA new winter forecast from the Climate Prediction Center shows that La Niña is favored to take hold over the next month and strengthen as we head into winter. This could lead to drought conditions in the southern states, but bring in lots of moisture to the Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley. The updated winter outlook shows the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes region, and Ohio Valley leaning toward seeing a wetter-than-average winter. Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming have the highest chance of above-average rain or snow, but other states such as Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, and Ohio are also leaning that way. However, it's hard to say whether the precipitation will come down as rain or snow, as it depends on how cold it is when the storms move in. Additionally, this year's La Niña is expected to be weak and short, which can change its impact on snowfall. Meteorologist Alex Libby notes that Tennessee receives less snow than average during weak La Niña winters, but his analysis of data from the Nashville International Airport shows above-average snowfall in the majority of weak La Niña winters. Meanwhile, much of the country is favored to be warm this year, with the Southwest and Gulf states having a 50% to 60% chance of above-average winter temperatures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2024 12:40 AM\nSource:[wkrn.com](https://www.wkrn.com/weather-headlines/new-winter-forecast-shows-chances-of-rain-snow-for-tennessee-other-states/)\n\n**Colorado Springs breaks heat record Saturday, Nov. 23**\nColorado Springs broke its heat record on Saturday, November 23, with an official high of 71 degrees, surpassing the previous record of 70 degrees set in 2021.

The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains.

Daytime highs are expected to be in the 20's and lows in the teens, with a possibility of single digit lows overnight due to expected snowfall around Thanksgiving. The weather service has placed southern Missouri in the slight risk area as well.

Temperatures on Thanksgiving Day are predicted to be in the upper 30s, with a high of 40 degrees. National Weather Service meteorologist Ricky Castro said, 'It's a little too early to say' whether there will be precipitation, but there is 'pretty high confidence' that the area will be in a colder pattern for Thanksgiving. The week of Thanksgiving will bring a 'return to colder conditions' after milder weather on Sunday, with a cold front expected to come through the Chicago area on Monday. A 'pretty cold start to December' appears likely, with even colder air coming into the region, and 'occasional chances for accumulating snow' expected.

What it means for Chicago area**\nThe National Weather Service has released an updated winter outlook for December through February, predicting a 'weak' La Niña pattern. According to the Climate Prediction Center, La Niña is expected to develop and last through winter, which could lead to a wetter winter with more numerous storm systems moving across the Great Lakes region. However, temperatures are more difficult to predict, with an equal chance of being above or below average. Historically, La Niña winters have been mixed, with five colder-than-normal, six warmer-than-normal, and three near-normal winters in Chicago since 1996. The average snowfall is 38.4 inches, but Chicago only had around 20 inches in the past two years, making it likely that this winter will be wetter than average but not as mild as the past few winters. As noted by the National Weather Service, 'it's likely not going to be as mild as the past few winters have been in Chicago.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2024 05:40 PM\nSource:[nbcchicago.com](https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/noaa-releases-new-outlook-for-winter-2024-25-what-it-means-for-chicago-area/3607786/)\n\n**Chicago Thanksgiving weather: chilly and possibly wet**\nChicagoans can expect a chilly Thanksgiving holiday weekend with a chance of rain or snow overnight on Wednesday.

Typically, the city sees its first snowfall before November, but this year's warm temperatures have pushed back the event. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the city has not yet experienced its first measurable snowfall this year, and the warm weather may continue to delay the event. The NWS predicts a 70-80% chance of above-average temperatures in Illinois, including Chicago, from November 14-22, which reduces the likelihood of snow in the next few weeks. The last time Chicago took this long to register its first snowfall was in 1999, when the first snowfall occurred on December 5. The city's last significant snowfall was on December 28, 2021, three days after Christmas. The warm temperatures for November are also unusual, with highs expected to reach 16°C (61°F) in some areas, which is uncommon for this time of year. While this warm trend may reduce the chances of snow, it does not rule it out. An increase in precipitation is projected for late November, which could bring a rapid drop in temperatures and the first snowfall. However, the type of precipitation will depend on how temperatures fluctuate in the coming weeks. The NWS indicates that Chicago has a higher probability of experiencing rain than snow in the short term.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2024 02:13 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/illinois/se-demora-la-primera-nevada-en-chicago-y-este-es-el-nuevo-pronostico-para-su-llegada-nid11112024/)\n\n**When will Chicago see its first snow? Extended forecasts shed light on wintry weather**\nChicago has not yet seen its first trace of snowfall this year, despite passing the typical date for the city's first snow on October 31. According to the National Weather Service, there is a 70-80% chance that the city will see above-average temperatures between November 14-22, and a 60-70% chance of above-average temperatures through the beginning of December. The Climate Prediction Center notes that temperatures are expected to remain in the upper-50s this week, with a chance for a 60-degree day, and that all models are leaning toward above-average precipitation for the Chicago area during this time. As a result, any dip in temperatures could be accompanied by precipitation, whether that be rain or snow. 'For context, the average high temperature in Chicago will dip below 50 degrees on Wednesday, and by the end of the month, the average high in the city will be around 41 degrees,' according to NWS historical data. The latest Chicago has gone without a trace to snow to begin the season was December 5, 1999, and the latest first measurable snowfall of the year occurred in December 2021, when the city didn’t see one-tenth of an inch of snow or more until three days after Christmas.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2024 07:11 PM\nSource:[nbcchicago.com](https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/when-will-chicago-see-its-first-snow-extended-forecasts-shed-light-on-wintry-weather/3596789/)\n\n**Days getting shorter; winter solstice 7 weeks away**\nNovember has begun in Chicago with 10 hours and 22 minutes of daylight, which will decrease to 9 hours and 23 minutes by the end of the month. The winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, is 7 weeks away on December 21, 2024. According to the ancient Druids and Celts, this time of year, known as 'Yule', marks the promise of longer days ahead. On average, November sees 2.5 inches of rain and almost 2 inches of snow. The month is also the fastest cooling period of the year, with the average high temperature dropping from the mid-50s to the low 40s by the 30th, and the average low temperature dropping from 40 to 29 degrees. 'Yule' celebrations often started on or around the winter solstice and could last for several days, marking the beginning of longer days ahead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 04:55 AM\nSource:[WGN-TV](https://wgntv.com/news/days-getting-shorter-winter-solstice-7-weeks-away/)\n\n**Weather | It’s almost Halloween, but this week will feel like summer just ahead of trick-or-treating**\nChicago is experiencing an unusual warm spell ahead of Halloween, with temperatures forecast to reach the high 70s to low 80s on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gino Izzi, senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Chicago, said, 'We’re really looking at a pretty unprecedented warm spell.' The warmth will only last until Wednesday night, when a cold front and widespread showers will pass through. The warm weather has raised concerns about grass fires and wildfires, but the rain on Wednesday may provide some relief from a moderate drought affecting central and northern Illinois. However, a real fall treat will come Thursday night, with temperatures cooling down to 45 to 50 degrees in the evening, just in time for trick-or-treating. According to climate scientists, fall temperatures have warmed by 2.5 degrees on average across the United States since 1970, with Chicago's October nights getting hotter by 3 degrees in the same timespan.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 10:00 AM\nSource:[chicagotribune.com](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/10/28/halloween-warm-weather-chicago/)\n\n**Chicago Weather Forecast for October 28, 2024**\nOn October 28, 2024, Chicago is expected to experience a warm day with a high temperature of 70 °F (21 °C) and a low of 52 °F (12 °C). The day will start with clear skies and rain at night. Winds will be moderate, reaching speeds of up to 11 mph (20 km/h), contributing to a pleasant feeling of warmth. As the day progresses, dry conditions and high temperatures will prevail, making it suitable for outdoor activities. The sunrise will be at 7:18 am and sunset at 5:49 pm, providing approximately 11 hours of sunlight. The relative humidity will be around 70%, a typical level in Chicago during October. Additionally, the UV index is expected to be moderate, reaching a maximum of 5, suggesting caution for those exposed to the sun for extended periods. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the temperature in Chicago is expected to be around 70 °F (21 °C) and 52 °F (12 °C), with a feeling temperature of around 63 °F (17 °C). In Illinois, a mostly sunny day with a possibility of light rain at night is forecasted in major cities. Chicago's climate is generally warm and humid in the summer, with frequent precipitation, and cold in the winter, with frequent snow and strong winds. Throughout the year, the sky tends to be partially cloudy, with temperatures ranging from -6 °C to 28 °C, rarely dropping below -15 °C or exceeding 33 °C. October brings a seasonal transition, causing significant changes in temperatures. Some days can be warm, while others experience sudden drops. This time of year is ideal for the Chicago Marathon, as the weather is usually pleasant and suitable for competition. However, in recent years, temperatures during the marathon have been unusually high, resulting in hospitalizations for several runners. Interestingly, three years ago, snow was recorded in October. Despite this, strong winds are a constant during this season, with temperatures typically ranging from 6 °C to 17 °C. The United States has a notable variety of climates due to its vast geographical extent. In the eastern region, two main types of climate predominate: the humid subtropical and the continental humid, which vary according to temperature and precipitation conditions throughout the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 08:07 AM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/estados-unidos/2024/10/28/clima-en-estados-unidos-hoy-pronostico-del-tiempo-en-chicago-este-28-de-octubre-segun-national-weather-service-lrtmusc-814536)\n\n**A La Niña winter is expected, scientists say.

This is a significant change from the previous winter of 2023-24, which was the fourth warmest on record. Kevin Jeanes of NBC 5 Storm Team said that the predictions are a welcome change, as the area has been experiencing a moderate drought. 'We need it,' Jeanes said. The NOAA predicts above-average snowfall for the Chicago area, with 18.5 inches of snow recorded in the 2023-24 winter season, 11.1 inches below the normal. However, it's unclear whether the temperatures will make the precipitation fall as rain or snow. Jeanes said that it's possible that the temperatures could be colder, but only compared to the extremely warm temperatures of the previous winter. 'If the temperatures are closer to average, it will feel colder than last year,' Jeanes said. The NOAA predicts 'the same possibilities' of temperatures being above or below average.

Latest winter weather predictions**\nAccording to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) latest winter weather outlook for 2024-25, a 'La Niña' winter is expected, which would result in a 'wetter than normal' winter in the Great Lakes, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. Kevin Jeanes, a meteorologist, said that this would be beneficial as the region has been experiencing a moderate drought. The winter precipitation outlook for the Chicago area is expected to be above average, with 18.5 inches of snow recorded during the 2023-24 meteorological winter, 11.1 inches below normal. However, the big question is whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall in the form of rain or snow. Jeanes noted that it could be colder than last year, but only compared to the extremely warm temperatures recorded in 2023-24. NOAA predicts 'equal chances' of temperatures being above or below average. A much colder winter is expected across the Northwest, while a La Niña event typically leads to cooler springs if the pattern persists.

While immediate forecasts do not predict snow, the city is preparing for the first signs of winter. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the first light snows typically occur by the end of October, marking the beginning of winter. Estimated snowfall dates are as follows: light snows (less than 2.54 cm) are expected on average by October 31, significant snowfall (2.54 cm or more) is expected to occur from November 18, and snowfall of one inch or more is expected on December 7. However, it is possible that snow could occur earlier. This winter may be influenced by La Niña, a weather pattern that could lead to a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the La Niña event is expected to strengthen during the winter months. This forecast also predicts that more storm systems will hit the Chicago area, with a 50/50 chance of precipitation being rain or snow. However, the University of Illinois notes that stronger La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 02:59 PM\nSource:[2001online.com](https://2001online.com/usa/servicios/illinois-sepa-para-cuando-se-estima-que-empezara-a-nevar-en-chicago-2024102310240)\n\n**Chicago weather: A cold front will usher in cooler air for the rest of the week**\nA cold front is expected to bring cooler air to the Chicago area for the rest of the week.

Although the phenomenon will be weaker than usual, residents should be prepared. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) estimates a 60% chance of La Niña establishing itself in the region, which could last until March. This could lead to a colder and wetter winter, although the intensity of the phenomenon is expected to be weaker than usual. Zachary Yack, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, warns that, although the chances of cold snaps are high, there could also be periods of warmer temperatures. 'When La Niña is weak, the behavior of the climate can become atypical,' he said. The Old Farmer's Almanac predicts that, unlike the rest of the country, Chicago could face a colder winter due to the combined influence of La Niña and the Australian Oscillation of El Niño. 'Chicago does not necessarily follow the same rules as the rest of the United States,' said Sarah Perrault, editor-in-chief of the almanac. According to their predictions, the coldest periods would arrive at the beginning and end of November, the beginning of December, and between the end of January and the beginning of February. Although the forecasts point to the possibility of temperatures below average in Chicago, the predictions about precipitation are mixed. The weakening of La Niña could reduce the number of significant winter storms, but residents are advised to stay alert and prepared for the winter weather, as even a weak phenomenon can trigger intense storms at certain times.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 03:53 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/como-sera-el-invierno-en-chicago-si-se-instala-la-nina-nid21102024/)\n\n**How will winter be in Illinois: the amount of snow that will fall in the prairie state**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter climate forecast for 2024-25.

This may lead to some unexpected weather patterns in the state. The NOAA indicates that the 'La Niña' pattern is expected to strengthen during the winter season, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and may direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, leading to more storm systems hitting the Chicago area. According to AccuWeather, Chicago is expected to receive between 76 and 114 cm of snow this winter, which is significantly more than the 56.4 cm received in 2023 and even exceeds the average of the past decade, which was 97.5 cm. AccuWeather's meteorologist, Paul Pastelok, notes that a less intense 'La Niña' allows other climate variables to take center stage, which could result in a more variable winter. In Chicago, this could mean warmer-than-usual temperatures and less heating demand in the northern half of the state. Although there is a possibility of a polar vortex in February, the certainty of its arrival is low. This could influence the appearance of intense cold air in the United States. The University of Illinois notes that stronger 'La Niña' patterns tend to produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average,' with more snow and winter storms during those seasons.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 05:58 AM\nSource:[El Comercio Perú](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/como-sera-el-invierno-en-illinois-la-cantidad-de-nieve-que-caera-en-el-estado-de-la-pradera-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**Chicago winter weather outlook; how will La Niña affect snow and temperatures?**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its annual Winter Weather Outlook, covering meteorological winter from December 2024 to February 2025. For the Chicago area, the outlook predicts a wetter-than-normal winter with average temperatures. The developing La Niña weather pattern is expected to influence precipitation predictions, with above-average precipitation anticipated due to La Niña positioning the jet stream over the Great Lakes. This leads to a wetter-than-average pattern for parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes, while the southern United States is expected to be drier-than-average. According to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of the Climate Prediction Center, 'This winter, an emerging La Niña is anticipated to influence the upcoming winter patterns, especially our precipitation predictions.' Officials with the Chicago National Weather Service added, 'La Niña conditions across the tropical Pacific Ocean may play a role in the weather pattern across North America this winter (leading to more storm systems in the central US). With that said, the ultimate seasonal snowfall and temperatures on a local basis will depend on storm tracks.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 08:22 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-winter-weather-outlook-2024-2025/)\n\n**NOAA Releases Winter Weather Forecast for Chicago Area**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter weather forecast for the Chicago area, and residents may need to prepare for what's to come. According to NOAA officials, a 'slow-developing' La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean will likely strengthen the dominant weather pattern in the Great Lakes, resulting in a 'wetter-than-normal' winter, especially in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. The La Niña pattern is expected to intensify during the meteorological winter, which runs from December 1 to February 28, and will likely direct the prevailing jet stream more to the north, causing more storm systems to hit the Chicago area. The question remains whether temperatures will cause precipitation to fall as rain or snow. At this point, NOAA says there is 'equal probability' of temperatures above or below average, which could have a significant impact on whether it rains or snows in the region. According to NOAA, they have implemented several improvements to their forecasting tools, including an experimental model called the 'Winter Storm Severity Probability Index'. These data were used to help with this year's projections after it was first implemented at the end of 2023, according to officials. According to the University of Illinois, the strongest La Niña patterns can produce winters that are 'warmer and wetter than average', with more snow and winter storms during those seasons. A La Niña event also tends to cause colder springs if the pattern persists. In a La Niña event, the trade winds are stronger than usual and push warm water away from the Americas and towards Asia, allowing a process known as 'upwelling' to occur, which brings cold water to the ocean's surface. These cold waters cause polar jet streams to form more to the north, leading to droughts in the southern United States and more precipitation in the Midwest and the northwest Pacific.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 06:13 PM\nSource:[telemundochicago.com](https://www.telemundochicago.com/noticias/local/noaa-publica-sus-proyecciones-del-tiempo-inviernal-para-el-area-de-chicago/2499000/)\n\n**Chicago’s Winter Will Be Colder And Snowier Than Last Year, AccuWeather Predicts**\nAccuWeather predicts a colder and snowier winter for Chicago, with 30-45 inches of snow forecast, a significant increase from last year's 22 inches. According to senior meteorologist Paul Pastelok, a La Niña weather pattern developing in the Pacific Ocean is the main reason for this forecast. Pastelok expects a weak and short-term La Niña, lasting from December to early January, which can cause jet streams to shift northward and bring winter storms to Chicago. He recommends Chicagoans check their power generator batteries in case of unexpected outages, especially as ice builds up mid-season. 'Be prepared here in the late fall and watch for some early systems, especially north and west of Chicago,' Pastelok said. 'I'm concerned about January, where there could be a lot more mixed [precipitation] events and then falling back to more of a snow pattern going into February.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2024 12:20 PM\nSource:[blockclubchicago.org](https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/10/16/chicagos-winter-could-be-colder-and-snowier-than-last-year-accuweather-predicts/)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Known as the most northern location in the US territory, the municipality last saw the sun in the past week and will not see it again until the end of January. The sun set for the last time on November 18 at 13:27 local time and will return on January 22, 2025, at 13:15 in the south, but will disappear again just 48 minutes later. Until the sun's return, the sky can take on shades of blue or violet, like an eternal twilight, before plunging back into darkness. The city, previously known as Barrow, has a population of around 5,000 people and is located in the North Slope region, near the Arctic Ocean. At 71.17 degrees north latitude, more than 500 km north of the Arctic Circle, the city experiences a unique phenomenon. For about two months, the sun does not rise above the horizon, giving rise to a prolonged 'polar night.' The two months of darkness contribute to a sharp drop in temperatures: about a quarter of the days in Utqiagvik have negative temperatures. The darkness also favors the development of the polar stratospheric vortex, a cold air whirlwind over the North Pole that influences the climate. Due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, regions near the Arctic Circle can remain far from the sun for days, weeks, or even months. The duration of the phenomenon expands according to proximity to the poles. At the North and South Poles, there is only one sunrise and sunset per year: it rises at the spring equinox and sets at the autumn equinox. In the North Pole, this means daylight between March and September. The remaining months are completely dark. 'It's a unique experience,' said a resident, 'but it can be challenging for some people.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 27, 2024 07:14 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/epoca/noticia/2024/11/27/cidade-mais-ao-norte-dos-eua-no-alasca-vai-passar-64-dias-sem-luz-do-sol-entenda-fenomeno.ghtml)\n\n**Douglas: Cold air but no snow for Thanksgiving**\nOld Man Winter is warning of a cold snap for Thanksgiving, with temperatures expected to be 10 to 20 degrees below average from Wednesday into the first week of December.

This phenomenon occurs due to the Earth's tilt, which prevents the sun's rays from reaching a sufficient height above the horizon. According to National Geographic, the polar night occurs in Barrow, a community of around 4,900 inhabitants, located at the northernmost tip of Alaska, due to the Earth's axis tilt. This results in weeks and even months of total darkness in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The polar night also brings extremely cold temperatures, with an average temperature of around -20°C in January. Despite the harsh conditions, the residents of Barrow continue their daily lives, but spend more time indoors, wrapped in blankets. Interestingly, Barrow is not the only place where the polar night lasts for over a month, as it also occurs in Murmansk, a city in Russia with over 300,000 inhabitants, where the phenomenon lasts from early December to early January, around 40 days without sunlight. As said by the residents, 'Achis, achis...

The website, unveiled on Tuesday, provides real-time information on which roads, sidewalks, and neighborhoods have been cleared or not yet handled. Mayor Suzanne LaFrance's administration aims to improve communication and preparedness for winter weather, a key campaign promise. The site is a work in progress, but it already offers features such as reporting blocked bus stops and requesting driveway berm removals for elderly and disabled residents. The city plans to add GPS devices and monitoring systems to its graders in December, allowing residents to track the fleet's deployment. This effort is a response to criticism of the previous administration's handling of winter weather, which led to delays in clearing residential streets after significant snowfalls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 10:40 PM\nSource:[adn.com](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2024/10/29/amid-seasons-first-snowfall-anchorage-stands-up-city-website-for-tracking-plow-progress/)\n\n**When Is The Best Time To Visit Alaska?**\nAlaska is a year-round destination for travelers, with each season offering unique experiences and activities.

According to NOAA, there is a 57% chance of La Niña emerging in October-December 2024 and persisting through January-March 2025. A weak La Niña is expected to have a minimal impact on weather conditions this winter. However, previous research suggests that weak La Niña events are often associated with snowier winters in the Northeast, particularly in northern New England and portions of New York. A close inspection of Connecticut on the map from NOAA shows most of the state has seen more snowfall than average during weak La Niña events. Additionally, weak La Niña events tend to keep temperatures near normal for Connecticut. However, many other factors influence a long-range forecast, and a forecast based solely on typical weather seen during weak La Niña events contradicts the consensus of most forecasts, which are calling for less snowfall than average and warmer temperatures than average for this winter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2024 10:00 AM\nSource:[thehour.com](https://www.thehour.com/weather/article/ct-weather-la-nina-forecast-19940675.php)\n\n**New York's First Snowfall Expected on December 13: Preparing for Winter Conditions**\nAccording to meteorological experts, the first snowfall of the season in New York is expected to occur on December 13, following historical climate trends.

Meanwhile, other areas of the state have already experienced winter conditions, with no snowfall recorded until November 22, the latest start to the season since the 1880s. However, meteorologists warn that these conditions will not last, as a 'polar cross-flow' atmospheric pattern could channel arctic air from Canada into the northeastern United States, causing a drastic drop in temperatures and triggering the 'lake-effect snow' phenomenon. The Thanksgiving holiday, on Thursday, November 28, which is one of the busiest in the US, could be affected by the winter conditions, as stated by meteorologists.

According to AccuWeather, the storm could dump 'multiple' feet of snow in the Midwest and Northeast, with the rain-snow line setting up in the Midwest and Northeast. Bernie Rayno, AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist, said, 'There are many variables we are still analyzing with this storm with track and intensity being the keys to where the rain and snow line will set up and the amount of snow that will fall in the Midwest and Northeast.' Central New England could see 3 inches of snow in areas of higher elevation, while other parts of the Northeast may see fragmented snowfall. New York City is expected to see 'heavy downpours can reduce visibility and cause ponding on streets and highways,' with temperatures dropping to 48 degrees. Southern New England's higher elevation areas are also expected to see snow mix in with rain, with the possibility of accumulating snow at elevations above 1,000 feet.

Vance, and Vice President Kamala Harris emerging as top contenders for the 2028 presidential race. According to the poll, Vance garnered 37% of Republican votes, while Harris topped the Democrat side with 41%. The poll also highlights the ascension of Vance as the face of 'Trumpism without Trump' and the lack of moderate candidates on the Democrat side, with most of the top contenders being unelectable progressives or Biden-Harris apparatchiks. As one author notes, 'The GOP under Trump isn't just different, it's more dynamic and more resilient. Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that getting trounced wasn't a referendum on their policies or their people, the voters just made a mistake which absolutely won't happen again.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2024 11:44 AM\nSource:[The Western Journal](https://www.westernjournal.com/trumps-legacy-will-live-new-poll-shows-top-contenders-2028/)\n\n**Trump's Support Grows Significantly in 2024 Election**\nDonald Trump received 2.5 million more votes than he did in 2020, according to an analysis by the Associated Press.

Trump won a higher percentage of votes in all 50 states, as well as Washington D.C., compared to his previous election. He also received more actual votes in 40 states. The analysis notes that the decline in votes for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, which was over 7 million votes compared to Joe Biden's 2020 performance, was a significant factor in her loss, particularly in urban areas of swing states that were considered Democratic strongholds. 'The decline in votes for Harris was a major factor in her loss,' said the analysis.

Look at the Exit Polls**\nDonald Trump's decisive victory in the 2024 election can be attributed to several key factors, including his strong favorability among parents, married voters, and working-class individuals. Exit polling data reveals that Trump won the working-class vote decisively, with 60% of voters in this demographic favoring him. He also held a strong advantage among voters without a bachelor's degree, with double-digit leads among those who never attended college and voters with an associate degree. Additionally, Trump's pro-life stance was a stronger motivator than the pro-choice platform, with 91% of voters who oppose legal abortion casting their vote for him. Harris, on the other hand, lost ground among female voters, dropping 4% from Biden's 57% to 53%, and faced a devastating loss among Latina women, with support slipping from 69% in 2020 to 60% in 2024.

In Georgia, Trump is leading by 6 points, while in Texas, he is leading by 8 points. In New Hampshire, Harris is leading by 9 points. The outcome of Ohio's Senate race is crucial for control of the Senate, with Democrat Sherrod Brown leading Republican Bernie Moreno by 2%. In North Carolina, the presidential race is too close to project, with Trump slightly favored to win. Democratic Senate candidates have often overperformed their party's presidential candidate in polling this cycle. Recent history suggests that this overperformance is a good sign for them, but it's not a sure thing.

According to 538's election forecasting model, Trump has a 52-in-100 chance of winning the White House, while Harris has a 48-in-100 chance. The model estimates that the average polling error in competitive states will be 3.8 points on the margin, which is similar to the error in 2020. However, the direction of polling error is impossible to predict in advance, and polls have overestimated Republicans plenty of times in the past. If the polls are off, it could benefit either candidate, and the outcome could be a blowout win for either Trump or Harris. The model reckons Harris needs to win the popular vote by 2.1 points to be favored to win the election, while Trump would be favored to win in a blowout if he wins the popular vote by 1-2 points. However, the news is not all good, as pollsters are still reporting difficulty reaching voters at all, and Trump supporters may still be less likely to respond to polls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 05:40 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-harris-normal-polling-error-blowout/story?id=115283593)\n\n**US Election Poll: Trump Leads by Two Percentage Points**\nAccording to the latest poll results, Donald Trump is leading the US elections with 47% of the vote, followed by Kamala Harris with 45%.

The polls also show a significant age divide, with voters under 50 favoring Harris and voters over 50 favoring Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 06:53 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13998269/trump-harris-pennsylvania-polls-voting-issue-2024-election.html)\n\n**U.S. Presidential Race: Gallup Poll Reveals Historic Unpopularity of Trump and Harris**\nA recent Gallup poll has revealed that both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have historic unpopularity, with 50% and 48% favorability ratings respectively. This is the lowest level of favorability for any presidential candidate in the past 70 years. Despite this, Trump's favorability has risen significantly from 36% in 2016, while Kamala's rating is comparable to some of the lowest in history. The poll suggests a shift in voter sentiment and widespread discontent, with both candidates struggling to gain trust beyond their core base. The implications for the 2024 election are significant, with low participation and a surge in 3rd-party interest possible. As Jeffrey M. Jones, Senior Writer at Gallup, noted, 'the majority of past presidential candidates scored 60% favorability even when they did not win.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 11:53 AM\nSource:[timesofcasino.com](https://www.timesofcasino.com/us-presidential-race-gallup-poll-updates-on-their-unofficial-poll/)\n\n**Shock poll reveals leader in 2024 race with just 12 days to go**\nA recent poll by the Wall Street Journal shows Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by 47% to 45%, just 12 days before the election. Harris' favorability ratings have collapsed, with 53% of voters viewing her unfavorably and only 45% viewing her favorably. Trump, on the other hand, has seen a significant improvement in his favorability ratings, with 52% approving of his presidency and 48% disapproving. Harris is only favored on issues such as abortion and protecting social security and medicare, while Trump is seen as the more trusted candidate on issues like immigration, the economy, inflation, and Israel's war against Hamas. Harris called Trump a 'fascist' and dodged questions on the effectiveness of a border wall during a CNN town hall, while Trump referred to John Kelly, his former Chief of Staff, as a 'degenerate' and a 'lowlife' after Kelly said Trump fit the bill of a fascist. Trump also campaigned in the Bible Belt and spoke about his faith, saying that it is a 'big advantage' over people who don't have it. Harris received more bad news when it was revealed that billionaire Warren Buffett will not be endorsing her or Trump for president in 2024.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2024 05:41 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13995301/Shock-poll-reveals-leader-2024-race-just-12-days-go.html)\n\n**Election polls 2024 live: Three experts make shocking final predictions in the election**\nWith 13 days until the election, three experts have made final predictions on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will win. Allan Lichtman, known as the 'Nostradamus' of election forecasting, still believes Harris will be victorious. Nate Silver, a polling guru, says it's a 50/50 dead heat, but his 'gut' tells him Trump will triumph. James Carville, a veteran political strategist, is now 'certain' Harris will win. Early voting is already in full force, with nearly 19 million Americans having cast their ballots. Harris will participate in a CNN town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper tonight at 9 p.m. ET in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Harris has a huge fundraising advantage over Trump, with her campaign raising over $1 billion since she entered the race. Trump's Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, said Trump 'certainly' has fascist 'inclinations.' The Quinnipiac University poll shows Harris leading Trump in Michigan, 49-46, and tied in Wisconsin. Harris's favorability rating is now dead-even in Michigan, 48-48, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll. In neighboring Wisconsin, she is slightly underwater, with 46 percent viewing her favorably compared to a 48 percent unfavorable rating. Trump, who has long been underwater nationally, has a respectable 47 to 48 favorability rating in Wisconsin, essentially the same as Harris. In Michigan, where Harris is performing slightly better, 46 percent view Trump favorably compared to a 52 percent majority who view him unfavorably. The Rust Belt numbers follow a Gallup poll showing Harris hitting a near record low on favorability nationwide. She began her campaign with positive favorables after stepping in for Joe Biden. She has a 48 percent favorability, below Joe Biden's 54 percent four years ago. Trump has a 50 percent favorability rating in the poll. Kamala Harris is getting support on the prediction site Kalshi. The site said there has been a 'massive' influx of backing for the Vice President today. But Donald Trump is still the clear favorite on the site. Harris warned that Trump was 'increasingly unhinged and unstable.' In a second term, people like John Kelly will not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there. And no longer be there to rein him in. Harris warned that Trump wanted 'unchecked power' if elected president again. 'The question in 13 days will be what do the American people want?' she concluded. Harris did not take questions from the press. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2024 08:08 PM\nSource:[expressdigest.com](https://expressdigest.com/election-polls-2024-live-three-experts-make-shocking-final-predictions-in-the-election/)\n\n**Trump reaches new popularity heights during third run for White House - Washington Examiner**\nA Gallup poll has shown that 50% of adults rate Donald Trump favorably, compared to 48% who rate him unfavorably, marking a higher favorability rating than in 2020 and 2016.

However, looking at the candidates' favorability numbers may provide a clearer picture. Historically, a presidential candidate's favorability rating is highly correlated with their ultimate share of the vote. In 2016, Trump won the 'double haters' - those who disliked both him and Hillary Clinton - by a 17-point margin. In 2020, Trump lost because almost everyone liked one of the two nominees. The 2024 election is shaping up to be similar, with Trump having a 45% favorability rating and Harris having a 49.3% rating. However, head-to-head polling numbers show a Harris lead of only 2.4 percentage points. This suggests that Harris is losing the 'double haters' and that Trump needs to drive anti-Harris sentiment up. The October polls also suggest that Trump needs to change the composition of the voter pool by driving turnout higher. If Trump can bring Harris' favorability down and energize his low-engagement voters, he can build coattails that could boost Senate and House Republican numbers significantly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 11:40 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/opinion/how-double-haters-could-send-trump-back-to-the-white-house/)\n\n**How America’s ‘double haters’ could send Trump back to the White House**\nPundits are looking at head-to-head polling numbers to predict the outcome of the 2024 presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

Historically, a presidential candidate's favorability rating is highly correlated with their ultimate share of the vote. In 2016 and 2020, almost all voters who had a favorable opinion of a candidate voted for that person. Trump won the 2016 election by carrying the 'double haters' - those who disliked both him and Hillary Clinton - by a 17-point margin. However, in 2020, Trump lost the popular vote by only 4.5%, suggesting that he again won the 'double haters' but on Election Day there were too few of them to matter.

However, head-to-head horserace numbers show a Harris lead of only 2.4 percentage points, suggesting that Trump is losing the 'double haters' by a significant margin.

However, a few good polls for Harris could easily put her back in the lead. A new East Carolina University poll in Georgia finds Trump leading among likely voters, 49% to 46%. A new TIPP poll also shows Trump ahead 49% to 48%. A Generation Lab poll found that 43% of people between 18 and 34 would have a more negative view of a date if they voted for Trump, while 17% would have a more positive view. In contrast, 19% would have a negative view of a date who voted for Kamala Harris, 32% would view it positively, and 49% would be indifferent. Gallup reported that Americans continue to register record-low trust in the mass media, with 31% expressing a 'great deal' or 'fair amount' of confidence in the media to report the news 'fully, accurately and fairly.' The article also discusses various Senate and House races, including the Virginia 10th District, where Democrat Suhas Subramanyam has the endorsement of Barbara Comstock, a former Republican. Additionally, the article mentions the Oregon Referendum, where supporters of ranked-choice voting have outraised their opponents $4 million to $1,000. In the Washington Land Commissioner race, Democrat Dave Upthegrove is leading Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler 41-35.

According to CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten, this is the lowest level of undecideds seen in polling at this point in the 21st century. The article argues that the election has become a turnout election, and the side that outworks the other will win.

They are expected to return to Earth in February 2025, aboard the Crew-9 mission Dragon capsule. However, there are concerns about their health after spending so long in zero gravity. Pulmonologist Vinay Gupta has expressed concerns about Williams' weight loss, suggesting that she may not be consuming enough calories to match her increased energy expenditure. Gupta stated, 'What you're seeing... is somebody that I think is experiencing the natural stresses of living at a very high altitude, even in a pressurized cabin, for extended periods.' Astronauts face a range of health risks in space, including muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and increased exposure to cosmic and solar radiation. However, it appears that Williams' weight loss is the only significant health concern at present. Williams and Wilmore will have spent around 250 days in space by the time they return, but this is not the longest time an astronaut has been in space.

The process of voting from space involves encrypted ballots flowing from satellites to a ground antenna before being received by county clerks to be tallied. As NASA explains, 'It's a very important role that we all play as citizens, to be included in those elections, and NASA makes it very easy for us to do that,' said Wilmore. 'Looking forward to being able to vote from space, which is pretty cool,' added Williams. This process has been in place since 1997, when astronaut David Wolf became the first American to cast a ballot from space. Since then, several astronauts have voted from orbit, including Kate Rubins, who voted in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. The process involves filling out an electronic absentee ballot and using unique credentials to access the ballot and cast their votes from the space station.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2024 04:27 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/remember-those-starliner-astronauts-still-161702452.html)\n\n**Two Astronauts Are Still Stranded in Space.

Originally, their stay was supposed to be 8 days, but it has been extended to 8 months after deciding to return the Starliner to Earth without crew on board. Although a SpaceX Crew Dragon arrived with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov on board, Wilmore and Williams will not be able to return home until Hague and Gorbunov's return in February 2025. The arrival of the backup space suits The backup space suits for Wilmore and Williams were transported to the ISS by the Crew Dragon capsule, whose launch was originally scheduled for last Thursday, then postponed to Saturday. This delay in the launch of the Crew Dragon explains why the capsule arrived at the space station later than planned. Despite the presence of the backup suits, Wilmore and Williams will still have to remain on board the ISS until the completion of Hague and Gorbunov's mission, extending their stay in space far beyond the initial expectations and schedule. The SpaceX and private players' space race The possibility for astronauts to have more options for returning from the ISS demonstrates the significant progress made by both private space programs and government programs. Companies like SpaceX, the leader in the private aerospace sector, regularly launch weekly rockets and have perfected the technology for recovering the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket, the most used. Other private companies like Rocket Lab are also advancing rapidly in this field, while Chinese realities are aiming to reach SpaceX's milestones.
