**Swiggy's $1.3 Billion IPO May Face Lukewarm Retail Interest**
Swiggy's $1.3 billion IPO is opening to the public, but there are concerns over retail interest. Despite Asian markets trading higher and US shares rallying overnight, Nifty futures are hinting at a slight dip. Chiranjivi Chakraborty, an equities reporter in Mumbai, notes that concerns over slowing earnings and persistent withdrawals by foreign investors may cap any gains in India. 'The verdict of the US presidential election looms large over Wednesday's session,' Chakraborty said. 'Some nerves over retail interest' are also present as Swiggy's IPO opens to the public.

**NielsenIQ Considers an IPO at a Valuation Close to $10 Billion**
NielsenIQ is considering an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the consumer intelligence firm at around $10 billion, according to sources. The company, backed by Advent International and KKR & Co., has begun discussing a listing with potential advisers for 2025. However, no final decision has been made, and NielsenIQ could opt to remain private. The IPO would come amid a rebound in US IPOs and rising consumer confidence, with this year's IPOs on US exchanges up 64% to almost $40 billion compared to the same period last year. As Bloomberg reported, 'the Conference Board's gauge of consumer confidence jumped to its highest level since the start of 2024 on optimism about the broader economy and the labor market.'

**Nasdaq CEO Expects IPOs to Pick Up Steam in 2025 | PYMNTS.com**
Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman expects initial public offerings (IPOs) to regain momentum in 2025. According to TechCrunch, Friedman stated that companies want to have 12 months of strong performance before going public, and the current cost of capital environment has made it difficult for companies to go public. However, recent public offerings in the biotech sector have demonstrated an appetite for younger companies, such as Tempus AI and Bicara Therapeutics. Some startups, including Stripe, OpenAI, and SpaceX, have chosen to remain private longer and conduct secondary share sales instead of going public. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon argued that regulators are holding back startups that want to go public in the U.S. and Great Britain, citing increasing expenses from litigation and regulatory filings. Dimon suggested that it would be easier and cheaper to go public if regulators made it more accessible.

**SEC Approves Options on Bitcoin Spot ETFs, Stripe Acquires Bridge, and Thailand Launches Stablecoin Transfer Service**
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to offer options on Bitcoin spot ETFs, a month after giving the green light to the Nasdaq. This decision allows for greater access to Bitcoin trading for institutional investors. Several Bitcoin spot ETFs, including those from Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity, will be affected. Although the SEC has approved this initiative, it will still need to obtain authorization from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), with a planned launch by the end of 2024 or early 2025. Stripe has acquired Bridge, a startup specializing in international payments in stablecoins, for $1.1 billion, marking the largest acquisition in the crypto ecosystem. The Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) in Thailand is launching an international transfer service in stablecoins in partnership with the fintech Lightnet. The service aims to provide fast, 24/7 cross-border payments at a lower cost. The adoption and speculation of Bitcoin by individual and institutional investors have led to over $20 billion in net inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs in less than a year, with institutions like Goldman Sachs and the State of Michigan integrating these ETFs into their portfolios. The crypto industry has faced numerous obstacles in recent years, including aggressive regulatory actions by the SEC under Gary Gensler, which has targeted several major platforms, including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. The outcome of the US presidential election could change the regulatory landscape and potentially pave the way for a new wave of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the sector.

**Stripe announces $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin start-up Bridge**
Stripe has announced the acquisition of stablecoin start-up Bridge for $1.1 billion. Stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to the value of fiat-currency like the dollar, have emerged as a key way to settle international payments using blockchain. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison called stablecoins 'room-temperature superconductors' for financial services, while Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams said they built the company to 'solve our most vexing global financial challenges' and 'give everyone more economic choice.' The acquisition is the largest crypto acquisition by a major payments company and will give Bridge the resources and expertise to advance stablecoin infrastructure.

The acquisition is part of Stripe's efforts to advance its crypto offerings, which have included partnerships with Circle's USDC stablecoin. Stripe was valued at $70 billion U.S. earlier this year and is expected to have a significant initial public offering (IPO) in the future.

**Stripe Acquires Bridge, a Stablecoin Infrastructure Provider**
Stripe, a fintech giant, has announced that it will acquire Bridge, a startup that provides stablecoin infrastructure. According to Forbes, the deal is worth $1.1 billion. Stripe, founded by billionaires John Collison and Patrick Collison in 2010, was valued at $65 billion at the beginning of this year and is one of the highest-valued private companies in the US. The interest in digital currencies has increased after the US Securities and Exchange Commission allowed bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the beginning of this year, making it easier for cryptocurrency to be accepted by large companies. PayPal was the first major financial technology company to introduce a US dollar stablecoin for payments and transfers last year.

**Stripe Acquires Bridge, a Startup Providing Stablecoin Infrastructure**
Stripe, a fintech company founded by John and Patrick Collison in 2010, has announced that it will acquire Bridge, a startup that provides stablecoin infrastructure, without disclosing the transaction amount. According to Forbes, the deal is valued at $1.1 billion. Stripe, which was valued at $65 billion in January, is one of the most valuable private startups in the US. The acquisition comes as cryptocurrencies gain traction, following the SEC's decision to allow cash-settled bitcoin futures in January, easing regulation and paving the way for large companies to accept digital currencies. Last year, PayPal launched a US dollar-backed stablecoin, becoming the first major tech finance company to adopt cryptocurrencies for payments and transfers.

**Stripe Buys Bridge for $1.1B in the Largest Crypto Acquisition – Great News for Stablecoins**
Stripe has acquired Bridge, a stablecoin platform, for $1.1 billion, marking the largest crypto acquisition in history. This move is expected to boost the stablecoin market and position Stripe as a major player in the industry. Stripe's Head of Crypto, John Eagan, stated, 'We're always looking for ways to make it easier and cheaper for businesses to accept payments from their customers worldwide.' The acquisition is seen as a bullish signal for the industry, with Ronak Dayas, Head of Product at Paxos, saying, 'stablecoins are the future of payments and money movement.' The stablecoin market is expected to grow, with $USDT recording a $5.2 billion profit in the first half of 2024 and Circle reporting a 59% year-over-year increase in $USDC wallets.

**Bitcoin's Trump Bump, Stripe Makes Big Crypto Play**
Stripe is considering a $70 billion deal to buy Bridge, a startup that enables businesses to accept cross-border payments made with stablecoins. This move comes after Stripe reentered the crypto industry in October after a multiyear absence. The deal would provide a backbone for Stripe to venture more deeply into stablecoins, which have a collective market cap of over $170 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price has surged 12.8% this month, with its current price of $68,885 being its highest since July. This 'Trump Bump' is likely due to growing expectations of a Donald Trump victory in the presidential election next month, with investors placing a 60% likelihood of his retaking the White House. A unified government could benefit crypto in 2025 by making the passage of key legislation that would regulate stablecoins and settle turf wars between the SEC and CFTC more likely.

**'ДОМ.РФ' Plans to Go Public with IPO in 2025**
The state corporation 'ДОМ.РФ' has confirmed its plans to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) in 2025, with the Ministry of Finance supporting the plan. According to Anton Siluanov, Minister of Finance, there is a possibility of privatizing the state corporation through an IPO. Vasily Mutko, head of 'ДОМ.РФ', noted that the placement of shares may take place in the second half of 2025. Artem Fedorov, head of the subsidiary bank 'ДОМ.РФ', emphasized that for further growth, the company needs to consider going public and did not rule out the possibility of conducting an IPO next year. Alexei Moiseev, Deputy Minister of Finance, confirmed these plans, adding that the placement of shares will be a significant event for the Russian market. He noted the company's high financial performance and good dividends, but expressed regret about the need for partial sale. To successfully implement the IPO, several procedural issues need to be resolved, including the conversion of the company into a public joint-stock company and changes to the legislation that currently requires 100% state ownership of 'ДОМ.РФ'. The volume of the planned IPO has not been determined yet, and Moiseev noted that the desire to place a large package may face limitations on the Russian market. The decision on the size of the shares to be placed will depend on market capacity and demand. Moiseev also noted that the question of distributing the funds from the placement - whether to the budget or for the company's recapitalization - remains open. He confirmed that the task of conducting an IPO in the second half of 2025 is set for 'ДОМ.РФ'.

**Stripe Eyes $1B Acquisition of Stablecoin Startup Bridge**
Stripe is in talks to acquire crypto stablecoin startup Bridge for $1 billion. This move comes after Stripe cofounder John Collison declared 'crypto is back' and would mark the fintech unicorn's largest acquisition to date. Bridge provides infrastructure for stablecoins and has processed over $5 billion in annualized payments. Regulatory issues, such as licenses and compensation for founders Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, are potential obstacles. Stripe's president, Will Gaybrick, said, 'One thing we say internally is [that] it turns out the killer app for crypto is just money.' The acquisition would strengthen Stripe's position in the stablecoin market, which has a market cap of $170 billion.

**Japan payments company Infcurion says planning IPO in 2025**
Japanese payments company Infcurion is planning an initial public offering (IPO) in Tokyo in 2025, aiming to accelerate its growth through mergers and acquisitions. The company, which expects to be profitable in the current financial year, has secured a valuation of over 30 billion yen following an 8 billion yen investment from Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. Infcurion's CEO, Hiroki Maruyama, said the company could use IPO proceeds to buy other financial technology firms to broaden its services. Maruyama added that the company sees large room for growth in business-to-business payments, which still rely heavily on bank transfers, and is considering expansion in Asia. 'Instead of developing everything in-house, we're at a point where we can add offerings to our platform through M&amp;A,' Maruyama said. Infcurion's global competitors include Marqeta and Stripe.

**US Venture Capital Deals Decline Amid Economic Uncertainty**
According to the latest PitchBook-NVCA report, venture capital investors in the US are being cautious in the face of economic uncertainty. The total value of venture deals in the third quarter, which ended on September 30, was approximately $37.5 billion, a significant 32% drop from the previous quarter. This cautious approach is occurring despite the stock market rally, which would normally encourage investment activity. The report notes that the current economic conditions are leading to limited liquidity, causing investors to impose stricter terms on startups. As a result, many startups are delaying their fundraising efforts, hoping for more favorable conditions in the future. Despite this trend, artificial intelligence companies continue to attract significant attention and investment in the venture capital sector. Emily Zheng, a venture capital analyst at PitchBook, said, 'A 50-basis-point rate cut will not be enough to accelerate venture capital, but it is a step in the right direction.' An increase in initial public offerings (IPOs) could potentially catalyze an increase in venture deals by providing investors with additional exit opportunities. However, many leading startups, such as Stripe, OpenAI, and SpaceX, prefer to remain private for extended periods. Instead, they opt to provide liquidity to their employees through secondary stock sales, allowing them to cash out their shares while avoiding public markets.

**Stripe Reintroduces Cryptocurrency Support for US Businesses**
Stripe, a leading payment platform, has reactivated its support for cryptocurrencies in the US, allowing businesses to accept payments in the stablecoin USDC through networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. This move comes after a six-year hiatus, and more than 150 countries can now receive dollars from cryptocurrency payments. According to Stripe's product director, Jeff Weinstein, this feature is available for US-based companies. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, praised the launch as a milestone for cryptocurrencies and expressed his enthusiasm for the impact this new tool will have on businesses. Stripe plans to expand USDC support to more countries in the coming months. Argentina has surpassed Brazil as the leader in cryptocurrency inflows in Latin America, with users depositing an estimated $91 billion in cryptocurrencies between July 2023 and June 2024, according to a Chainalysis report. OpenAI, a leading developer in artificial intelligence, is facing significant financial challenges, with projections showing it will not reach profitability until 2029, despite its ambitious plans to generate $100 billion in revenue. The company has experienced rapid growth, but high costs associated with infrastructure and AI research continue to generate losses. In 2024, OpenAI could record losses of up to $5 billion, increasing to $14 billion in 2026. World Liberty Financial, a DeFi initiative promoted by Donald Trump, has announced its intention to launch on the Ethereum mainnet through Aave v3. This move aims to offer liquidity for assets like Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, and stablecoins, as well as expand to other digital assets.

**Venture capital investors wary of dealmaking despite stock market momentum, report says**
Despite a rally in public markets, venture capital investors in the US remain cautious about dealmaking due to economic uncertainty, according to a PitchBook-NVCA report. The report states that $37.5 billion of deals were clinched in the third quarter, a 32% decrease from the previous quarter. Limited liquidity has led investors to negotiate tougher terms for startups, causing many to postpone funding until conditions improve. However, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve may stimulate activity, and a revival of the IPO market could further accelerate VC deals. Leading startups like Stripe, OpenAI, and SpaceX are choosing to stay private for longer, offering employees liquidity through secondary share sales. 'Secondaries are the best of both worlds,' said Emily Zheng, VC analyst at PitchBook. 'Companies can stay private for longer and investors that want liquidity can get it.' The rising appeal of private assets may also be encouraging some to delay their IPOs, with Howe Ng, head of analytics and investment solutions at private marketplace Forge Global, stating, 'The democratization is going to come. The private market will continue to open and this new asset class is here to stay.'

**Companies Postpone IPOs Until 2025 Amid Low Interest Rates**
Several companies have announced plans to go public in 2024, but the low interest rates and high demand for fixed income investments have discouraged others from doing so. According to analysts, the current context invites companies to postpone their initial public offerings (IPOs) until 2025. 'We thought that in this exercise there would be more IPOs than those that have taken place. It has been an exercise in which much has been bet on fixed income. Many portfolios have bet more on fixed income than on variable income,' says Sara Hernández, director of analysis at Norbolsa. Javier Cabrera, an analyst at market, adds that 'the market has already discounted three interest rate cuts in the next four meetings of the European Central Bank.' Cirsa, Tendam, Astara, Cosentino, Volotea, and Ibercaja are among the companies that have explored plans to go public, but it is unlikely that there will be new incorporations before the end of the year. 'It seems that now the situation is somewhat better than other years. It's good news for a market that in the last year has lost many companies that have left the market,' explains Juan José Fernández-Figares, analyst at Link Securities.

**The Stock Market Is Roaring Back. Why Isn't the IPO Market?**
The U.S. IPO market is experiencing a decline in 2024, with only 151 listings so far. Despite the stock market reaching record highs, Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, attributes the lack of IPO activity to the changing nature of IPOs. In 2021, only 30% of companies that went public were profitable, and 26% had a dual-class share structure. Ritter notes that the market has shifted from being retail-oriented to institutional investor-driven, with companies often offering dual-class shares to maintain control. Additionally, massive unicorns like SpaceX and Stripe have no plans to go public, instead selling shares in secondary markets. This has led to a surge in secondary market funds, which can raise huge sums from private investors. However, retail investors may not benefit from the IPO market, as they often have to buy at a marked-up price and have limited access to promising startups.

**IPO Edge's Jannarone: How to Predict IPOs by ‘Hectocorns' Like SpaceX, OpenAI**
IPO Edge's Jannarone believes that hectocorns like OpenAI and SpaceX, valued at over $100 billion, are unlikely to go public in the short term due to their ability to access private capital and robust secondary markets. According to Jannarone, these companies will go public when their senior executives consider it best, not due to typical pressures. He also mentioned that the IPO market is expecting milestones like interest rate cuts before fully opening to companies like Klarna and Stripe. Jannarone predicts that the IPO window will improve in 2025 and recommends clean corporate governance, profitability, and a credible growth story for private companies looking to go public.
