**Preparing for holiday season air travel**
As the holiday season approaches, airports are expecting a surge in travelers from December 20 to 24. According to Luxury Link, some airports will see a significant increase in daily passengers. To ensure a smoother experience, Ralph Hennessey, the Executive Director of England Air Park, advises passengers to arrive at the airport 1.5 to 2 hours before their flight, as there will likely be longer lines at ticket counters and security checkpoints. Hennessey also notes that passengers must be aware of the higher volume of travelers. For those checking bags, it is essential to know the airline's deadlines, such as American Airlines' 10-minute pre-departure check-in and Delta Airlines' 30-minute pre-departure check-in.

**Holiday flights are cheaper this year  --  here's how to book smart**
This year's holiday airfares have decreased by 6% for Thanksgiving and 9% for the December holidays compared to last year, according to Kayak's holiday travel report. To book smart, consider traveling on the holiday itself, such as Thanksgiving Day (November 28) or Christmas Eve (December 24), to save up to 34% on airfare and avoid crowds. Kayak's data suggests booking at least two months in advance for affordable domestic airfare, while Hopper recommends booking during the final two weeks of October for Christmas flights. Conversely, departing on Friday, December 20, or Saturday, December 21, and returning on Saturday, December 28, or Sunday, December 29, may result in higher prices. As travel expert, 'It's wise to book sooner rather than later' to snag reasonably priced seats, especially in the last three to four weeks before the holiday arrives.

**This Will Be the Busiest Travel Day During the 2024 Holiday Season**
A survey of 2,000 Americans found that December 23 will be the busiest travel day during the 2024 holiday season. The most popular destinations for Thanksgiving and December holidays are Florida and New York, respectively. The least popular destinations are North Dakota and Vermont. The survey also found that 56% of travelers are looking forward to seeing family, while 29% are dreading the cost of travel. Additionally, 27% of travelers have blackout dates during the holiday season, with Gen Z being most likely to have them. 'We're all looking forward to having some downtime this holiday season,' says Connor Smith, vice president of masterbrand strategy and awareness at IHG Hotels & Resorts. 'Whether you're traveling near or far to spend time with loved ones or squeezing in a little 'you time,' we have options that suit all types of travelers.'

**IATA September 2024 data shows global passenger demand surge**
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported a 7.1% increase in global passenger demand for September 2024 compared to the same period last year, reaching an all-time high. The growth in demand was driven by a 9.2% increase in international demand and a 3.7% increase in domestic demand. However, the association warned that the air travel success story is bringing challenges, including a potential capacity crunch in some regions. IATA Director General Willie Walsh said, 'The year’s peak travel season ended with demand at an all-time high. This is good news not just for passengers but also for the global economy. But the air travel success story is bringing challenges. We will soon face a capacity crunch in some regions which threatens to curtail these economic and social benefits.' The association also reported regional breakdowns, with Asia-Pacific airlines achieving an 18.5% year-on-year increase in demand, and European carriers seeing a 7.6% year-on-year increase in demand.

**Column: South suburban travel agents say book now to get the best winter holiday travel deals**
Travel experts advise booking flights and hotels for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season now to get the best deals. According to Hayley Berg, lead economist with Hopper, airfare prices will start to rise in the next couple of weeks. For Thanksgiving, airfare is averaging $273 per domestic roundtrip ticket, up 9% from last year, while Christmas airfare is averaging $379 per domestic roundtrip ticket, up 8% from last year. To save money, try booking the return portion of a trip several days after the holiday, and be flexible with travel dates. 'It's important to book at the right time, but what's even more important is to travel on the least expensive days,' said Berg. Travelers can also save money by booking flights on off-peak days, such as early Monday morning or Black Friday, and by avoiding Saturday to Saturday or Sunday to Sunday trips. Additionally, experts recommend applying for TSA PreCheck and Global Entry to reduce the time it takes to get through airport security.

**Election anxiety is scrambling Americans' travel plans**
The upcoming 2024 US election is causing anxiety among Americans, leading some to rethink their travel plans. According to a recent poll, 64% of US adults would avoid traveling in the US due to concerns about unrest, depending on the election outcome. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian expects a 'pause' in travel around the election, as consumers prefer to stay home during this time. Businesses are also on alert, with domestic flight bookings down 19% for the week of the election. However, bookings for the following week are expected to be higher than usual. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is tightening security at polling places and airports, but some travelers are still choosing to stay home. 'I have a toddler now and I’m worried about being in a potentially volatile situation,' said Emily Reeve, who usually spends Thanksgiving in Hawaii or Florida but is staying put this year. 'People like to be home during the election period. They don’t want to be out traveling,' said Bastian. 'I don’t think they want to be spending money until they understand what’s going to happen.'

**Experts share their best advice for booking cheap holiday flights**
Airfare expert Scott Keyes advises booking holiday flights during the 'off-season' or now, as prices are expected to rise. According to Google's 2024 analysis, the best prices for Thanksgiving flights should appear 26 to 59 days before departure, while Christmas travel prices are expected to be lowest in the second half of October. Keyes also recommends considering international flights, as prices are lower than last year. Additionally, experts suggest setting up price alerts, booking flights with delays in mind, and stalking prices after booking to potentially save more. Furthermore, travelers should know their rights for cancellations and disruptions, including compensation for airline cancellations or delays.

**Global Air Traffic Sees 8.6% Increase in August 2024, IATA Reports**
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported an 8.6% increase in global air traffic in August 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The Asia-Pacific region saw the highest growth at 19.9%, while Europe ranked fourth with a 9.1% increase, still far from the 2019 levels. The total demand, measured in revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK), increased by 8.6% compared to August 2023, while the total capacity, measured in available seat-kilometers (ASK), increased by 6.5% year-over-year. The load factor in August was 86.2% (+1.6pp compared to August 2023), a new record according to IATA figures. 'The air travel market is booming, and airlines are doing well to respond to the growing demand. Efficiency gains have led to record load factors, while the 6.5% increase in capacity demonstrates resilience in the face of persistent supply chain and infrastructure problems,' said Willie Walsh, IATA's director general. International demand increased by 10.6%, while regional demand increased by 5.6% compared to August 2023 figures. All regions saw an increase in air traffic, with Asia-Pacific airlines recording a 19.9% increase in demand year-over-year. The region maintains a robust growth and is now just 8 percentage points away from pre-pandemic volumes. Latin America saw a 13.6% increase in demand year-over-year, and Africa +10.1%. In Europe, demand increased by 9.1% year-over-year, with capacity up 8.5% and a load factor of 87.2% (+0.5pp compared to August 2023). 'For the future, the strong and sustained growth in demand indicates that we may quickly approach a shortage of capacity in infrastructure, which would limit connectivity and choices for passengers and businesses. If governments want to optimize the benefits of aviation, they must take bold decisions to ensure sufficient infrastructure capacity,' added Willie Walsh.

**Avoid Flying On These Days During the 2024 Holiday Season to Save on Airfare**
Travelers can save on airfare by avoiding flights on certain days during the 2024 holiday season. According to Going.com, the Tuesday or Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and the Sunday and Monday before Christmas, are the priciest days to fly. Instead, consider flying on the actual holidays, such as Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, which could save up to 25% off the overall ticket cost. Scott Keyes, founder and chief flight expert at Going, recommends booking flights at least 21 days in advance and monitoring prices to take advantage of no-change fee policies. Additionally, returning on Dec. 31 for New Year's will save travelers money and reduce airport crowds.

**The Best and Worst Days to Fly Around Thanksgiving**
According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the best days to fly around Thanksgiving are Saturday, November 23, Monday, November 25, and Thursday, November 21 before the holiday, and Wednesday, December 4, Tuesday, December 3, and Black Friday, November 29 after the holiday. If possible, flying on Thanksgiving Day itself may also be a good option, as it tends to be the least crowded day. Sally French, NerdWallet's travel expert, recommends booking flights early, ideally in early October, as prices tend to be lower during this time. She also advises against waiting for last-minute deals, as flights often sell out quickly during the Thanksgiving travel period. The worst days to fly are Wednesday, November 27, Tuesday, November 26, Sunday, December 1, and Saturday, November 30, with Sunday, December 1 being the busiest day of the year in most years.

**Demand for Air Travel Expected to Break All Records in 2024: IBA**
According to a recent report by IBA, a leading market intelligence and aviation consulting company, global air travel demand is expected to exceed 9 trillion passenger kilometers (RPKs) for the first time in 2024, representing a 4.2% increase from the previous record of 8.6 trillion RPKs set in 2019. This growth is driven by a constant increase in GDP in various regions, combined with a reduction in unit costs and improved fuel efficiency, resulting in increasing profitability for airlines worldwide. However, IBA noted that the global political and economic scenario, along with supply chain challenges and labor strikes, will affect aircraft deliveries, reducing them compared to 2023. The recovery of delivery levels to pre-pandemic levels in 2018 is not expected before 2026. The issue related to GTF engines has impacted aircraft availability, and the percentage of narrowbodies out of contract has fallen to levels not seen since before the pandemic. Many operators are extending their aircraft leases, resulting in fewer transitions and retirements. Currently, airlines like IndiGo and Viva Aerobus are facing high rates of GTF engine failures, leading to extremely low retirement rates, with less than 200 retirements expected in 2024. Despite the decline in transaction volumes between 2021 and 2023, IBA predicts a stabilization in 2024. New narrowbodies from Airbus, such as the A321neo, have stood out in leasing negotiations, showing a growth in value of up to 8.4% per year, although engine values have grown at even higher rates, reaching 49.2%. Narrowbody leases have increased by up to 25% since last year. Meanwhile, older aircraft have maintained their values, with some types, such as the Airbus A319 and the Boeing 737 NG, showing growth of 40% to 60% over the past 12 months. There has also been a significant increase in leases for these types of aircraft. IBA predicts a 9.2% increase in global airline capacity from 2023 to 2024. The largest expansion in capacity in seats in the third quarter of 2024 was observed in the Asia-Pacific region, with a growth of 12%, while North America shows a more modest increase of only 3%. However, operational performance in Q2 decreased in Europe and North America, with EBIT margins falling between 3% and 6%. IBA also identified a slight improvement in the average risk classification in the global market, although specific segments, such as cargo and ACMI operators, have seen a significant decline. Despite the absolute increase in emissions returning to pre-pandemic levels, carbon intensity has stabilized, indicating an improvement in fuel efficiency. This shows that, although demand and activity are growing, there is also a movement towards more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. Although IBA predicts a general decline in yields in various global regions in 2024, the most substantial growth was identified in full-service airlines in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by suppressed international demand. On the other hand, the situation in the low-cost segment in North America represents a high risk, with potential bankruptcies due to sustained inflation and overcapacity.

Industry officials are advising travelers to book flights, rental cars, and accommodations as soon as possible for the best pricing and availability during the Thanksgiving and year-end holidays.

**4 Reasons Why Airline Stocks Could Soar by Year-End**
According to a new report by Bank of America, airline stocks could see a significant increase by the end of the year. Despite the challenges faced by the aviation industry in recent years, including pandemic-related restrictions, extreme weather events, and rising fuel costs, the conditions are now improving. Decreasing fuel prices and regained pricing power are indicators that it may be an ideal time to reevaluate the sector. The Bank of America highlights four key factors that could lead to outperformance in the aviation industry in the coming months. These developments are particularly relevant for those who may have prematurely written off the sector. Firstly, TSA data shows that demand for air travel remains stable at a high level despite reduced airline capacity. This is crucial as it signals that passengers continue to fly in large numbers despite reduced available seating capacity, leading to improved pricing power, which can positively impact airline revenue. Currently, the TSA checks over 2.5 million passengers daily, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. A new record was reached in July, with over 3 million passengers checked on a single day. As the following graph shows, passenger traffic in the US is now regularly above pre-pandemic levels. US airlines are adjusting their domestic flight capacity. The reason for this is the oversupply of seats during the summer months, which led to a price drop and reduced margins, despite robust air travel demand. By reducing capacity, airlines can increase ticket prices without risking significant passenger decline. This reflects the classic dynamics of supply and demand. With stable demand, airlines, particularly in the context of the autumn season, could benefit from a significant increase in revenue. Fuel is one of the largest cost factors for airlines, making up 20-30% of their total costs. After a period of rising fuel prices, we now see a certain relief, which is good news for the aviation industry. The BofA has increased its profit forecasts for several airlines, including United and Alaska Airlines, due to the recent decline in fuel prices. Lower fuel costs combined with higher ticket prices could help airlines stabilize their profitability and possibly exceed earnings expectations in the 4th quarter. Historically, airlines tend to perform better in the autumn. According to an analysis by the BofA of the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index since 2000, the second half of the year has been the stronger half. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in three of the last six months of the year, namely September, October, and November. If one looks at the development of the past, investors who enter the market now could achieve attractive returns by the end of the year. The aviation industry is positioning itself strategically for sustainable success beyond the short-term upswing. Airlines are using their strengthened cash flows to make essential investments, including expanding their workforce, modernizing their fleets, and implementing new IT systems. At the same time, debt repayment is being accelerated. According to a report by the Bank of America, US airline debt stood at $143 billion at the end of 2023, down from $168 billion at the end of 2021. Although the level remains above pre-pandemic levels, this decline signals a serious commitment to balance sheet repair. Furthermore, airlines are driving forward the modernization of their fleets by replacing older, less efficient aircraft with new, fuel-efficient models, which should further reduce operational costs. American Airlines announced in March the order of 260 new aircraft from Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer to meet the growing demand. Prior to this, United Airlines had announced the purchase of 110 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus in October 2023. While air travel may appear to be a purely passenger transportation service at first glance, a closer look reveals a much more complex business. Airlines must strike a delicate balance: on the one hand, providing sufficient capacity to meet demand, on the other hand, setting prices that enable solid profitability. Delta Air Lines has, despite a challenging start to the year, including the CrowdStrike issue, moderately increased its forecast for earnings per share to $5 to $7. Similarly, the Alaska Air Group has adjusted its earnings forecasts upwards due to robust summer demand and lower fuel costs. Even budget airlines like Frontier Airlines are recording surprisingly strong margin improvements through capacity adjustments. In my opinion, the aviation industry is currently characterized by a remarkable adaptability, making it an interesting investment opportunity. Airlines that efficiently manage their capacity, keep costs under control, and maintain their pricing power will position themselves as winners. For investors who prioritize valuable investments, the aviation industry presents itself as a potentially promising option. Airlines are traded at attractive price-to-earnings ratios, and with a view to the forecasted earnings growth in the fourth quarter and beyond, this may be a good time to review an allocation in this sector. As always, timing is crucial. Stabilizing high passenger numbers according to the Transportation Security Administration, decreasing domestic capacity, declining fuel prices, and seasonal factors all speak in favor of a strong development of the aviation industry in the second half of the year, which could mark the ideal time to build positions in this market.

**Why Jet Fuel Demand Soared This Summer**
Gasoline demand in the US surged to 9.4 million barrels per day in July, its highest levels since 2019, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Jet fuel production also increased to 1.9 million barrels per day, an 8% rise from the previous year. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reported a 6.2% increase in passenger travel numbers from January to July 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Airlines for America projected an additional 26,000 scheduled flights per day to meet the higher demand for air travel. Despite the hurricane season, gasoline prices in the Gulf Coast remained steady after a Category 1 storm reached landfall in Texas. The price of gasoline is predominantly underpinned by crude oil, accounting for approximately 60% of the cost. Gasoline prices are expected to remain relatively flat with slower but consistent economic growth, according to the EIA. Jet fuel is a significant component of the economy, contributing about 1.3% of GDP, $535 billion in economic activity, and 2.6 million jobs, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

**Air travel could break Labor Day weekend record**
The Labor Day weekend is expected to be the busiest travel period ever for U.S. airlines, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipating over 17 million passengers to be screened between Thursday and next Wednesday. Additionally, the American Automobile Association (Triple-A) predicts a significant increase in highway travel, coinciding with the opening weekend of the college football season. The Georgia State Patrol will have a majority of its troopers on duty throughout the weekend, with a notable statistic from last Labor Day weekend being 358 arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to Sgt. Christopher Jewell of the Georgia State Patrol Post 40, who noted, 'That's a very significantly high number. It's higher than it's been in previous years.'
