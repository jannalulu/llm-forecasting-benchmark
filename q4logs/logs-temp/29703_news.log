**US Drought Affects Over 318 Million Acres of Farmland, 150 Million People**
A report by the 'US Drought Monitor' has highlighted a severe drought affecting over 45% of the land in the United States and Puerto Rico. The drought has also affected 54% of the land in the contiguous 48 states. Despite the onset of autumn, the drought continues to worsen, with over 150 million people in the US and 149.8 million in the contiguous states suffering from its consequences, a 34% increase from last week and a 150% increase from last month. The drought has had a significant impact on the agricultural sector, with over 318 million acres of farmland affected, a 57% increase from last month. According to Dr. Living Lu, a professor of environmental science at Michigan State University, 'climate change is causing extreme weather events in both directions; when it rains heavily, the soil can't absorb the water properly, leading to surface runoff and flooding.' Local efforts to combat the drought have been made, with some leaders acknowledging the issue and taking measures to mitigate its effects. However, Dr. Lu notes that these efforts are limited in their impact. The drought has also led to an increased reliance on groundwater, which accounts for over 40% of agricultural and household water usage. According to the US National Integrated Drought Information System, this increased groundwater usage can lead to reduced water supplies in the future. California, which relies heavily on agriculture to support its economy, suffered losses of $1.7 billion in crop revenue in 2022 due to the ongoing drought. The drought has also led to decreased water levels in rivers, reducing the efficiency of water transportation and increasing shipping costs, which ultimately affects food and product prices.

**WFP seeks additional funding for humanitarian response as drought looms in Somalia**
The World Food Programme (WFP) urgently requires 261 million US dollars to expand its humanitarian and resilience programs in Somalia, aiming to alleviate the impacts of a predicted drought through March 2025. Currently, 3.6 million Somalis are facing crisis-level hunger, projected to increase to 4.4 million by December. The WFP said, 'To avert further deterioration of food security and nutrition outcomes across the country, sustained humanitarian assistance, including anticipatory action, is urgently needed.' The appeal follows findings from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, which highlights that 1.6 million children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition until July 2025. The WFP noted a 14 percent increase in global acute malnutrition and a 21 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition compared to the same season last year. The IPC report aligns with global forecasts indicating an 80 percent probability of La Nina conditions, which could lead to drought in Somalia. The WFP said, 'This is due to anticipated below-average rains, localized flooding in the riverine and urban areas of Hiran, Gedo, Middle Shabelle, and Lower Shabelle, ongoing conflict, high food prices, and diseases contributing to acute food insecurity and malnutrition.'

**Despite recent rain, farmers in Virginia struggle with effects of summer drought**
Despite recent rain, farmers in Virginia are still struggling with the effects of summer drought. Morgan Slaven, a sheep farmer in Augusta County, said she was grateful for her 'off-farm job' to generate income after drought conditions presented back-to-back years of challenges ahead of this year's harvest season. 'What if I lost my job?' Slaven said. 'The only reason I have this place right now is because I have an off-the-farm income.' The drought, which was exacerbated by temperatures reaching 99 degrees and no rain in the Lynchburg area, has impacted profits in the largest economic sector in the state, with agriculture contributing about $82.3 billion annually to the economy. According to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture employs over 381,800 people. Assistance programs are available, but some farmers may be reluctant to use them, and they may only allow farmers to break even. 'People have a lot of pride, they don’t want to take donations, but it’s there, because your tax dollars are paying for it,' Slaven said. The drought has hurt sheep farmers, corn, and bean commodities, with corn yields estimated to be 36.1 million bushels, down 38% from the 2023 level. 'It’s a half a crop at best, and it’s highly damaged,' said Robert Harper, a grain marketing specialist at the Virginia Farm Bureau. 'It’s a year of extremes. It seems like we’re just getting these cyclical weather patterns, and we get stuck in them.'

**New winter 2024-2025 outlook for WV, KY & OH**
According to the NOAA NWS Climate Prediction Center, the winter 2024-2025 season for WV, KY, and OH is expected to be average in terms of precipitation, with even odds for above or below normal amounts of rain or snow. However, the forecast suggests a better than average chance of warmer temperatures. In contrast, the Old Farmer's Almanac predicts a cold and snowy winter for the region. Despite the potential for normal precipitation, the area remains in Exceptional Drought, with ground water conditions expected to remain drier than normal. 'Whether or not you subscribe to either variety of seasonal forecast,' the latest Drought Monitor shows that much of the area is still experiencing Exceptional Drought.

**NOAA releases 2024-25 winter weather outlook: Here’s what West Virginians can expect**
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), West Virginia can expect a 'slowly-developing' La Niña to influence the upcoming winter patterns, leading to warmer-than-average temperatures and above-average precipitation in some areas. Temperatures are predicted to be 33-40 percent above average, with some southern counties seeing temperatures 40-50 percent above average. However, snowfall is expected to be fairly normal, with only a sliver of the northern panhandle expected to have higher-than-average precipitation. The seasonal drought outlook suggests that while drought conditions are expected to remain across most of the state, they are also expected to improve or dissolve entirely. Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes regions are more likely to get above-average precipitation, while the South and Southwest are expected to experience drier-than-normal conditions.

**Southern Africa Drought: WFP Appeals for Urgent Funding**
The drought in southern Africa is having a devastating impact on the region, with over 27 million people affected and 21 million children suffering from malnutrition. The situation is expected to worsen in the coming months, with the harvest season in March and April next year expected to be particularly challenging. The World Food Programme (WFP) has launched an appeal for emergency funding to support those affected, but has so far only received 25% of the $369 million needed. The WFP has warned that if more funding is not provided, millions of people will face severe risks during this drought season, which could be the worst in decades. 'The drought is having a catastrophic impact on the lives of millions of people in southern Africa,' said Tomson Ferri, spokesperson for the WFP in the region. 'We need urgent action to address this crisis, which is one of the worst in decades.' The drought has been exacerbated by the El Niño phenomenon, which has led to significant changes in the region's climate, including a 80% reduction in rainfall and a 5°C increase in temperature above the normal average.

**Leonhardt: Money from state surplus funds will help drought-stricken farmers**
West Virginia State Agriculture Commissioner Kent Leonhardt says a $10 million relief package will help drought-stricken farmers. The money, from state budget surplus funds, will be used to reseed and restore damaged pasture, as well as manage invasive weeds. Commissioner Leonhardt stated, 'This is the worst drought that we have seen in my lifetime.' Del. Darren Thorne, a farmer from Hampshire County, added, 'We’re in a bad situation here that we’ve got to get ahead of.' The drought has already caused significant challenges for farmers, with many feeding their winter supply of hay to livestock and selling livestock early due to the lack of grass and water. The relief package is expected to help farmers recover from the drought, which is expected to continue into next year.

**Global Water Resources in Alarming State: Report**
According to a new report, 2023 has been the driest year globally in the past three decades, with rivers experiencing below-average flow and water levels in reservoirs decreasing. The report, 'The State of Global Water Resources', was released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and highlights the alarming situation of water resources worldwide. The report states that 3.6 billion people globally face water scarcity for at least a month every year, and this number is expected to rise to 5 billion by 2050. The report also notes that glaciers are shrinking at an alarming rate, with 6 million gigatons of ice melted, mostly into the oceans and some rivers. The report warns that climate change is causing extreme weather events, including droughts and floods, which have a significant impact on lives, ecosystems, and economies. The report emphasizes the need for immediate action to address water-related challenges, improve data quality, and enhance global cooperation. The United Nations has launched a global effort to establish early warning systems for water-related hazards, with the goal of including all people in these systems by 2027.

**WMO Warns of Worsening Water Scarcity and Hydrological Stress Worldwide**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned of the worsening of water scarcity and hydrological stress worldwide. According to the WMO, the world's rivers reached their lowest level of drought in 33 years in 2023, the hottest year on record. The organization reports that 3.6 billion people do not have access to sufficient water for at least a month a year, and this number could increase to over 5 billion by 2050. The WMO also notes that glaciers have suffered the largest mass loss in 50 years, with a loss of over 600 gigatonnes of water in two consecutive years. The organization's secretary-general warned that 'the melting of glaciers and ice threatens the long-term water security of millions of people.' The WMO report aims to promote better monitoring, data sharing, and collaboration to address the situation, and the organization's secretary-general urged 'we need to act with urgency.'

**UN Warns of Intense Droughts and Extreme Floods as a Preview of the Future**
The United Nations (UN) has warned that intense droughts and extreme floods are a preview of the future, according to Celeste Saulo, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). 'Water is becoming increasingly unpredictable' and the warning signs are impossible to ignore', she said in a press conference. The WMO presented a new report on water resources, which points to a worsening of water scarcity worldwide. Analyzing 33 years of data, the organization found that the world's rivers reached a record low level of drought last year. 'In the context of climate change, water is giving us a sample of the changes that are approaching', Celeste Saulo also stated in a statement. The report highlights that the signs of warning are multiplying: we are witnessing an exacerbation of extreme precipitation, floods, and droughts, which are having a heavy cost for lives, ecosystems, and economies. With 2023 being the hottest year on record, high temperatures and generally low precipitation contributed to prolonged droughts. The extreme hydrological phenomena were encouraged not only by natural climate factors, such as the transition from La Niña to an El Niño episode in mid-2023 (related to changes in the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean), but also by human-induced climate changes, according to the WMO. 'The increase in temperature accelerated the hydrological cycle, which also became more irregular and less predictable', explained Celeste Saulo. A warmer atmosphere can retain more humidity, so global warming increases the risk of strong precipitation, but accelerated evaporation and soil drying exacerbate droughts. As a result, 'we are faced with increasingly difficult situations, where water is too abundant or insufficient', she said. Currently, 3.6 billion people do not have access to sufficient water for at least a month a year, and it is predicted that this number will exceed 5 billion in 2050, according to the UN. The report reveals that the flow of about 50% of the world's rivers was below normal last year. Glaciers are also on the front line of global warming: according to preliminary data from September 2022 to August 2023, they lost more than 600 gigatons of water, the worst loss in 50 years of observation. 'Deglaciation and glaciers threaten the long-term water security of millions of people. However, we are not taking the urgent measures that are necessary', warned the WMO Secretary-General. According to the WMO, it was the African continent that suffered the most last year with the water-related meteorological phenomena and that recorded the most deaths.

**WMO: 3.6 Billion People Face Water Scarcity Issues**
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) released a report on the global water resources, stating that 2023 was the driest year for rivers in the past 30 years. The report highlights the critical changes in water availability, particularly during periods of increasing demand. It notes that the amount of water in rivers has decreased over the past five years, and the amount of usable water has decreased. The report also states that glaciers have experienced the largest mass loss in the past 50 years. According to the report, 2023 was the second consecutive year where glacier loss was reported in all regions where glaciers are found. The report attributes the high temperatures and widespread drought to the recorded hottest year on record, which led to prolonged droughts. It also highlights the significant number of floods and other natural disasters that occurred worldwide due to human-induced climate change. The report states that, according to UN data, 3.6 billion people worldwide are currently facing water scarcity issues, with this number expected to rise to 5 billion by 2050. The report also notes that the world is far from achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said, 'We are getting very disturbing warnings about extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. This is a harbinger of the climate disaster. Melting glaciers and ice sheets threaten the long-term water security of millions of people. Yet, we are not taking the necessary urgent action.' Saulo also stated that the increasing temperatures are accelerating the hydrological cycle, leading to more problems with water. He noted that a warmer atmosphere will lead to more moisture, which will cause more evaporation and drying of the soil. Saulo emphasized the need for urgent action, saying, 'We don't know much about the real situation of the world's freshwater resources. We can't manage what we don't measure. This report aims to contribute to improved monitoring, data sharing, transboundary cooperation, and assessment. We need it urgently.'

**Drought conditions remain, but storm remnants bring relief to parts of parched West Virginia**
Severe drought conditions persist in parts of West Virginia, but recent precipitation from the remnants of Hurricane Helene brought relief to some areas. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, moderate to heavy rain fell in the Northeast Region, with totals near or exceeding 3 inches in Western Maryland and most of West Virginia. Excessive totals of 5 to 8 inches soaked Southeastern West Virginia, leading to widespread improvements. However, Central and Northern West Virginia and the Maryland Panhandle saw little or no improvement, remaining entrenched in extreme to excessive drought. The southern portion of McDowell County is now the state's only county without drought conditions. Exceptional drought conditions remain in parts of Jackson, Roane, Wirt, Calhoun, Gilmer, Braxton, Clay, and Webster counties.

**Local Farmers: Drought May Dry Up Next Year's Harvest**
A statewide drought in West Virginia has negatively impacted local food production, including produce and livestock farmers. Farmers are hoping for substantial rain before the first winter freeze to ensure the soil will have enough moisture to produce next year's crops. Eric Freeland, a Wellsburg-based farmer, stressed that 'time is of the essence' to replenish the water table, which is currently 'exceptionally low' due to the drought. Dale Sampson, owner of Dale Sampson Feed Store, noted that a 'steady rain' is required to replenish the water table before the ground freezes. The drought has already resulted in significant crop losses for Freeland next year, and Jerry Ebbert, owner of Ebbert Farm Market, said he was 'blessed' to have a full pumpkin patch this year despite the drought. The drought has also impacted farmers who sell animal products, with Jeff Miller, owner of Miller Farms, struggling to keep his Angus beef cows well-fed and hydrated. Miller estimates he will have to keep cows off the pasture until June when they can typically begin grazing again in April. The price of hay used to supplement the diet of livestock has 'doubled or tripled,' according to Sampson. Local farmers are facing a hardship due to the drought, and feed dealers and hay dealers are also affected. 'This drought has put a hardship on farming families, feed dealers and hay dealers,' Sampson said. 'It puts a hardship on everybody.'

**West Virginia's drought will last until 2025, NOAA predicts**
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), West Virginia's drought is expected to persist through the end of the year, despite a predicted La Niña that is expected to bring more moisture to the region. NOAA officials have stated that the increase in precipitation will not be enough to alleviate the drought, which has been ongoing since May 30. The drought has had a significant impact on West Virginians, particularly those in agriculture, and has also affected the state's fall color change, which officials have described as 'unexpectedly slow' this year. Gov. Jim Justice has launched a drought relief grant program to assist water suppliers across the state.

**Drought relief being sought for West Virginia**
West Virginia leaders are seeking federal aid due to the ongoing drought. All 55 counties have been under a state of emergency since July 26. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito stated, 'Declaring a State of Emergency automatically kicks in some relief funding. In this case that hasn't occurred.' Emergency loan applications are available from the Small Business Administration, and additional aid may be requested from FEMA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sen. Capito has been touring the state, visiting farms and communities affected by the drought, which has led to high fire danger and devastating conditions for farmers and their livestock.

**Francine rains stay away**
The ongoing drought in West Virginia has reached severe levels, with drying streams, early changing leaves, and farmers struggling to provide hay for cattle. To alleviate the drought, prolonged soaking rains are needed, but these are typically not expected until the second half of meteorological fall. A forecast for light showers on Friday is possible in Eastern Kentucky, but other areas are uncertain. Next week, a southeast US rain storm may develop in the coastal Carolinas, which could potentially bring rain to the region. 'The need for rain seems to reach new levels every week,' said the article, highlighting the severity of the drought. 'Soaking rains lasting a day or longer will be needed to break or at least dent the drought.'

**‘5,3m people suffering from acute food insecurity'**
According to the World Food Programme (WFP) Food Security and Markets Monitoring Report, at least 5.3 million people in Zimbabwe are suffering from acute food insecurity due to the severe drought caused by El Niño weather conditions. The report states that the number of people facing insufficient food consumption is estimated at 5.3 million during the last week of July 2024, with 5.9 million rural people and 1.7 million people in urban areas facing hunger. The drought has led to poor harvests after the 2023/24 agricultural season, with 46% of the rural population estimated to be food insecure. The WFP survey also found that 8.1 million people are resorting to crisis and above food-based coping strategies, with 52% of the population estimated to be food insecure in July 2024. President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared the drought a national disaster in May, extending a US$3 billion begging bowl for humanitarian assistance.
