According to Zhang Ming, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Finance and Banking, China's economy may slow in early 2025, but is expected to pick up momentum later in the year to achieve the annual growth target. Zhang warned that the tariff shock from Trump's inauguration will have a significant negative impact on China's export growth in 2025, as exports account for around 20% of China's total gross domestic product, with the United States being one of its biggest trading partners.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 03:00 AM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/economy/policy/article/3285676/china-stick-around-5-gdp-target-2025-despite-trump-tariff-threat-economist)\n\n**China's Exports Surge, but Imports Decline Amid Trade Uncertainties**\nChina's exports have increased by 12.7% in October compared to the previous year, exceeding expectations of a 5% growth. However, imports have decreased by 2.3% in the same period. Experts attribute the export growth to possible catch-up effects after previous disruptions at Chinese ports due to storms. Additionally, companies in the US may have stockpiled goods in anticipation of a Trump presidency and subsequent trade tensions. The decline in imports suggests that consumer spending in China remains sluggish. The Chinese economy has been struggling due to factors such as the ongoing housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. To boost the economy, the central bank has lowered interest rates for mortgage loans. Observers hope for further measures, which could be announced this week. A potential Trump presidency could bring new uncertainties for Chinese trade, as he initiated a trade war with China during his first term by imposing high tariffs, leading to significant tensions. Experts fear that an escalation of the trade conflict could harm the economic recovery in China and globally. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment on hypothetical questions about new US tariffs, stating that there would be no winner in a trade war, which would not benefit the world. German companies in China may further increase local production in response to new tariffs, according to the German Chamber of Commerce in China. Companies that invested in costly diversification and localization since the start of the US-China trade conflict are now seeing their efforts confirmed, as further trade barriers are expected. 'We assume that German companies will continue to localize their global production sites and supply chains,' said Maximilian Butek, executive board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China. The trade between China and Germany was sluggish in October, with Chinese exports to Germany increasing by 5.2% below average, while imports decreased by 11.2%. 'The declining imports from Germany can be explained by the weak domestic demand and the fact that customers increasingly prefer Chinese products, which are improving in quality and becoming more price-competitive,' said Butek.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 08:47 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/nachrichten/Chinas-Exporte-legen-deutlich-zu-Aber-Sondereffekte-moglich-48286663/)\n\n**China's Exports Surpass Expectations, But Uncertainty Looms with Trump's Potential Return**\nChina's exports in October exceeded expectations, increasing by 12.7% compared to the same period last year, according to the Beijing Customs Administration. Analysts had predicted a 5% increase. In contrast, Chinese imports were weaker than expected, decreasing by 2.3% in the same period. The Chinese economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. To boost the economy, the central bank has lowered interest rates for mortgage loans. Observers are hoping for further measures, which could be announced this week. However, a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House could bring new uncertainties to Chinese trade. Trump's previous trade war with China, initiated during his first term, led to significant tensions. Experts fear that a renewed trade conflict could harm China's economic recovery and the global economy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 05:06 AM\nSource:[ad-hoc-news.de](https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/wirtschaft/die-chinesischen-exporte-sind-im-oktober-staerker-als-erwartet-gestiegen/66067714)\n\n**Why China's economy would be more vulnerable to Trump tariffs this time**\nA potential 60% tariff on Chinese goods by Donald Trump, who has been elected as the next US president, poses significant growth risks for China's economy. Unlike his first term, the economy is now in a more vulnerable position due to a property market crisis, unsustainable debt, weak domestic demand, and deflationary pressures. The property market downturn has saddled local governments with debt, while low wages and pensions, high youth unemployment, and a feeble social safety net have left household spending below 40% of GDP. China's ability to respond to external growth shocks is limited, and the yuan's depreciation may not fully offset the tariff impact. Other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have provided unexpected opportunities for China, but these are unlikely to be repeated. 'China may be able to boost external sales in areas where its economy is extremely competitive, but has little control on external demand,' according to the article. 'The burden is huge, limiting China's ability to respond to any external growth shocks,' it adds.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 04:29 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/automakers-brace-for-new-tariffs-ev-changes-under-trump-presidency-124110700223_1.html)\n\n**China’s factory output appears to be growing again**\nChina's factory output appears to be growing again after five consecutive months of contraction. The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) reached 50.1 in October, beating expectations, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, said that readings above 50 typically indicate expanding economic activity. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, noted that while 50.1 is the smallest possible expansion, it is a positive sign. Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, attributed the figure to the early impact of higher fiscal support, enabled by an acceleration in government bond issuance. Other signs of the stimulus measures taking effect include the non-manufacturing PMI rising to 50.2 and an easing of the youth unemployment rate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 11:30 PM\nSource:[macaonews.org](https://macaonews.org/news/greater-china/china-factory-output-growth/)\n\n**China's Manufacturing Sector Sees Optimism Amid Economic Challenges**\nChina's manufacturing sector is looking more optimistic about its business, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in October was 50.1 points, 0.3 points higher than the previous month, marking the first time since April that the indicator has exceeded 50 points. This suggests an expansion of industrial activity. A Bloomberg survey had predicted the PMI to be below 50 points. The non-manufacturing sector, including construction and services, also saw an increase in activity, with the PMI rising to 50.2 points from a neutral 50. Experts hope that the government's announced measures to boost the economy will continue, as the country aims to achieve a 5% economic growth rate this year. However, the economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. The People's Bank of China has already lowered interest rates for mortgage loans to stimulate spending. Further measures are expected to be announced in the coming week.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 05:47 AM\nSource:[Ad Hoc News](https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/wirtschaft/chinas-produzierendes-gewerbe-blickt-wieder-etwas-optimistischer-auf-seine/66020127)\n\n**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Drops to 17.6% in September**\nThe unemployment rate among young people in China aged 16 to 24 years old decreased to 17.6% in September, down from the peak of 18.8% in August, when millions of university graduates entered the job market, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday (22).

This slight improvement brings relief to authorities after two consecutive months of soaring youth unemployment. However, officials remain cautious due to factory owners' continued hesitancy to hire, with the last positive employment report for producers dating back to February 2023. According to the data, individuals aged 25 to 29 reported a jobless rate of 6.7%, while those aged 30 to 59 reported a rate of 3.9%, both figures excluding college students.

This rate, which does not include high school students and university students, is still high but lower than the 18.8% recorded in August, the highest level since the beginning of 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China. The increase in the number of university graduates in June, with nearly 12 million students obtaining their diplomas, has added to the competition on the already difficult job market, which explains the sharp rise in unemployment this summer and its slight decline last month as some hiring took place. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, had declared in May that fighting youth unemployment should be considered an 'absolute priority'. The unemployment rate for 25-29 year olds has also decreased from 6.9% in August to 6.7% in September, and the overall unemployment rate for the country has decreased from 5.3% to 5.1%.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 07:41 AM\nSource:[Le Figaro.fr](https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/chine-le-taux-de-chomage-des-16-24-ans-baisse-a-17-6-en-septembre-20241022)\n\n**Youth Unemployment Rate in China Decreases to 17.6%**\nAccording to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the youth unemployment rate for those aged 16-24, excluding students, decreased to 17.6% in September.

The rate, which affects people between 16 and 24 years old, rose significantly during the summer, from 13.2% in June to 17.1% in July and 18.8% in August, a record high after the authorities revised the methodology of the indicator at the end of last year to exclude students. The poor employment data for young people in the summer was due to the entry of a record number of graduates into the labor market - an estimated 12 million this year - and increasingly bleak job market prospects, affected by the slowdown in the recovery of the world's second-largest economy, reported local media. The Chinese government has made youth employment a top priority, both due to the negative impact on consumption of potential income decline and the risks to social stability, a vital issue for Beijing. Chinese authorities expressed confidence on Friday that the world's second-largest economy 'will continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery', after announcing a stimulus package with measures to support the financial and real estate sectors and the stock market, in order to relaunch the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Analysts stated that the package of measures is 'a step in the right direction', but 'insufficient' to relaunch the economic recovery of China, unless accompanied by an increase in public spending, a question that may collide with concerns about the sustainability of the debt. Low domestic and international demand, associated with risks of deflation, insufficient stimuli, housing crisis, and lack of confidence from consumers and the private sector are some of the causes pointed out by analysts to explain what is happening in the world's second-largest economy.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 05:48 AM\nSource:[RTP - Rádio Televisão Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/taxa-de-desemprego-jovem-na-china-desce-ligeiramente-apos-dois-meses-de-subida_n1609429)\n\n**China's youth unemployment rate falls after climbing for 2 months**\nChina's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data.

This is in contrast to the previous generation, who often spent more than they earned and accumulated debt. According to Shaun Rein, CEO of the China Market Research Group, 'the Chinese youth has a Revenge-Saving mentality.' Experts attribute this behavior to the economic uncertainty in China, with young people feeling the impact of a slowing economy. Christopher Beddor, deputy director of China research at Gavekal Dragonomics, said, 'young people probably feel the same thing as everyone else: the economy is just not doing well.' The Chinese government's data shows that household deposits grew by 11.8% in the first quarter of 2024, but the International Monetary Fund predicts a further slowdown to 4.5% in the coming year. The youth unemployment rate in China is also high, at 14.2% in May 2024, and many young people are struggling to find jobs or increase their income. As a result, they are adopting a more frugal lifestyle, with some even eating in community kitchens for older people to save money. This trend is in stark contrast to the global Generation Z, who are more likely to take on debt to improve their quality of life. A study by Intuit found that 73% of Gen Z in the US would prioritize a higher quality of life over saving money.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 06, 2024 10:35 AM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/warum-junge-chinesen-jetzt-revenge-saving-betreiben_id_260365969.html)\n\n**China Youth Unemployment Hits 18.8%, Highest This Year**\nChina's youth unemployment rate reached 18.8% in August, the highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students. The summer months are a time when young graduates are preparing to enter the workforce, which is why the youth unemployment rate is often high during this period, said the NBS.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 02:18 PM\nSource:[Dünya](https://www.dunya.com/ekonomi/cinde-genc-issizlik-orani-agustosta-yeni-rekor-seviyeye-ulasti-haberi-746871)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Surges to 18.8% in August**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has surged to 18.8% in August, its highest level this year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONE). This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55. This change will be implemented over the next 15 years, starting from 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 20, 2024 12:08 PM\nSource:[Diario Siglo XXI](https://www.diariosigloxxi.com/texto-ep/mostrar/20240920140806/paro-juvenil-china-dispara-agosto-188-mayor-nivel-ano)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Crisis: A Complex Problem with Multiple Causes**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has reached a record high of 21.3% in May 2023, prompting the government to stop publishing statistics. After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

Analysts had predicted a 5% increase. In contrast, Chinese imports were weaker than expected, decreasing by 2.3% in the same period. The Chinese economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. To boost the economy, the central bank has lowered interest rates for mortgage loans. Observers are hoping for further measures, which could be announced this week. However, a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House could bring new uncertainties to Chinese trade. Trump's previous trade war with China, initiated during his first term, led to significant tensions.

The rate, which affects people between 16 and 24 years old, rose significantly during the summer, from 13.2% in June to 17.1% in July and 18.8% in August, a record high after the authorities revised the methodology of the indicator at the end of last year to exclude students. The poor employment data for young people in the summer was due to the entry of a record number of graduates into the labor market - an estimated 12 million this year - and increasingly bleak job market prospects, affected by the slowdown in the recovery of the world's second-largest economy, reported local media. The Chinese government has made youth employment a top priority, both due to the negative impact on consumption of potential income decline and the risks to social stability, a vital issue for Beijing. Chinese authorities expressed confidence on Friday that the world's second-largest economy 'will continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery', after announcing a stimulus package with measures to support the financial and real estate sectors and the stock market, in order to relaunch the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Analysts stated that the package of measures is 'a step in the right direction', but 'insufficient' to relaunch the economic recovery of China, unless accompanied by an increase in public spending, a question that may collide with concerns about the sustainability of the debt. Low domestic and international demand, associated with risks of deflation, insufficient stimuli, housing crisis, and lack of confidence from consumers and the private sector are some of the causes pointed out by analysts to explain what is happening in the world's second-largest economy.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 05:48 AM\nSource:[RTP - Rádio Televisão Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/taxa-de-desemprego-jovem-na-china-desce-ligeiramente-apos-dois-meses-de-subida_n1609429)\n\n**China's youth unemployment rate falls after climbing for 2 months**\nChina's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data.

The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:59 AM\nSource:[Market Business News](https://marketbusinessnews.com/chinas-youth-unemployment-crisis-rising-challenges-amid-economic-slowdown/398653)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**\nChina is facing a growing unemployment crisis, with the youth unemployment rate reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since the beginning of the year.

This is despite the government's efforts to revitalize its struggling economy. The unemployment rate among young people aged 16-24 who are not in education increased to 17.1% in July, from 16.4% in June. The expected unemployment rate in June 2023 was 21.3%, but the authorities stopped publishing it and are working on revising their approach by no longer counting students. The graduation of around 12 million students from Chinese universities in June 2024 has increased competition in the Chinese job market, making it difficult for job seekers. This explains the sharp increase in unemployment rates in July. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that combating youth unemployment should be a 'top priority'. The unemployment rate among people aged 25-29 increased from 6.5% in July to 6.9% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

The youth unemployment rate has reached its highest level since the new calculation method was introduced in December 2023. The NBS had previously stopped releasing youth unemployment data by age group after it reached a record high of 21.3% in July 2023. The new calculation method excludes students who are still in education, including high school and university students.

This rate, which refers to registered unemployment among citizens aged 16-24, excluding university students, is more than three times higher than the overall unemployment rate, which rose to 5.3% in the eighth month of the year. The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55.

After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

The poor employment data for young people in the summer was due to the entry of a record number of graduates into the labor market - an estimated 12 million this year - and increasingly bleak job market prospects, affected by the slowdown in the recovery of the world's second-largest economy, reported local media. The Chinese government has made youth employment a top priority, both due to the negative impact on consumption of potential income decline and the risks to social stability, a vital issue for Beijing. Chinese authorities expressed confidence on Friday that the world's second-largest economy 'will continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery', after announcing a stimulus package with measures to support the financial and real estate sectors and the stock market, in order to relaunch the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Analysts stated that the package of measures is 'a step in the right direction', but 'insufficient' to relaunch the economic recovery of China, unless accompanied by an increase in public spending, a question that may collide with concerns about the sustainability of the debt. Low domestic and international demand, associated with risks of deflation, insufficient stimuli, housing crisis, and lack of confidence from consumers and the private sector are some of the causes pointed out by analysts to explain what is happening in the world's second-largest economy.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 05:48 AM\nSource:[RTP - Rádio Televisão Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/taxa-de-desemprego-jovem-na-china-desce-ligeiramente-apos-dois-meses-de-subida_n1609429)\n\n**China's youth unemployment rate falls after climbing for 2 months**\nChina's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data.

This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023.

The rate increased from 17.1% in July and 13.2% in June. The NBS also reported a 6.9% unemployment rate for young people aged 25-29, a 0.4 percentage point increase from July. The NBS changed its methodology in January to exclude students from the youth unemployment rate, which previously reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. The new methodology aims to provide more accurate employment services and policies for young people. 'The calculation of the unemployment rate by age group, excluding students, reflects better the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society,' said the NBS. The population of people aged 16-24 includes around 62 million students, over 60% of this age group. The exclusion of students from the unemployment rate allows authorities to provide more precise employment services and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies.' The global urban unemployment rate in China was 5.3% in August, a slight increase from 5.1% in July.

The influx of new graduates and economic deceleration are major contributing factors. Liu Aihua, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the surge in unemployment to the graduate season. The economic slowdown has exacerbated the crisis, with many young people forced to accept low-wage jobs or remain unemployed. The Chinese government's restructuring of key sectors, including technology and private education, has also had unintended consequences, such as stifling innovation and leading to layoffs. The labor market faces structural challenges, with emerging sectors like AI and green energy not creating as many jobs as traditional industries. Many Chinese youths have adopted new coping strategies, including the 'tang ping' or 'lying flat' movement, where young people reject societal pressures to achieve conventional success. The government has made job creation a top priority, but experts believe that more comprehensive reforms are needed to address the underlying structural issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2024 12:59 AM\nSource:[Market Business News](https://marketbusinessnews.com/chinas-youth-unemployment-crisis-rising-challenges-amid-economic-slowdown/398653)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits Record High**\nChina is facing a growing unemployment crisis, with the youth unemployment rate reaching 18.8% in August, the highest level since the beginning of the year.

The publication of youth unemployment data was suspended for most of the second half of last year after the ONE announced a revision to its calculation method to exclude the weight of university students. Before that, in June 2023, the rate reached 21.3%. Additionally, in August, inactivity among people aged 25-29, excluding those in higher education, increased by 0.4% to 6.9%, while the rate for those aged 30-59 remained stable at 3.9%. The Chinese government has announced plans to raise the retirement age for the first time since 1978, allowing men to retire at 63 and women in physically demanding and skilled jobs to retire at 58, up from 55.

After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

This move is aimed at stimulating the sluggish economy. The plan was approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The Minister of Finance, Lan Foan, stated that additional measures to boost the economy are being prepared, but provided little detail. The move was largely in line with market expectations, as Reuters had reported that authorities were considering a plan of over 10,000 billion yuan (1,400 billion dollars) to stimulate growth and help local governments cope with debt risks. However, investors had hoped for more measures to boost consumer and business demand, which is lagging. Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING, Hong Kong, stated, 'We were expecting a more prudent or more progressive plan. We had in mind a figure of 2,000 billion yuan, and I think it's more or less in line with expectations if you consider the timeline.' Xing Zhaopeng, Principal Strategist for China at ANZ, Shanghai, stated, 'The absence of direct fiscal stimulus suggests that policymakers will leave room for the impact of Trump 2.0 later. The 2025 GDP target could be lowered to 4.5%.' Huang Xuefeng, Director of Research at Shanghai Anfang Private Fund Co, Shanghai, stated, 'I don't see anything that exceeds expectations. It's not enormous if you consider the fiscal deficits due to the economic slowdown and land sales collapse. The money is used to replace hidden debts, which means it does not create new work flows, so the support to GDP growth is not so direct.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 11:19 AM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/actualite-bourse/La-Chine-releve-les-plafonds-d-endettement-des-gouvernements-locaux-pour-relancer-l-economie-48305263/)\n\n**China to stick with 'around 5%' GDP target in 2025 despite Trump win: economist**\nChina is expected to maintain its economic growth target of 'around 5%' in 2025, despite the potential trade shock from increased tariffs under Donald Trump's second term as US president. According to Zhang Ming, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Finance and Banking, China's economy may slow in early 2025, but is expected to pick up momentum later in the year to achieve the annual growth target. Zhang warned that the tariff shock from Trump's inauguration will have a significant negative impact on China's export growth in 2025, as exports account for around 20% of China's total gross domestic product, with the United States being one of its biggest trading partners.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2024 03:00 AM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/economy/policy/article/3285676/china-stick-around-5-gdp-target-2025-despite-trump-tariff-threat-economist)\n\n**China's Exports Surpass Expectations, But Uncertainty Looms with Trump's Potential Return**\nChina's exports in October exceeded expectations, increasing by 12.7% compared to the same period last year, according to the Beijing Customs Administration.

The Chinese economy has been struggling due to a housing market crisis, weak domestic demand, and high youth unemployment. To boost the economy, the central bank has lowered interest rates for mortgage loans. Observers are hoping for further measures, which could be announced this week. However, a potential return of Donald Trump to the White House could bring new uncertainties to Chinese trade.

Chinese authorities expressed confidence on Friday that the world's second-largest economy 'will continue on a trend of stabilization and recovery', after announcing a stimulus package with measures to support the financial and real estate sectors and the stock market, in order to relaunch the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Analysts stated that the package of measures is 'a step in the right direction', but 'insufficient' to relaunch the economic recovery of China, unless accompanied by an increase in public spending, a question that may collide with concerns about the sustainability of the debt. Low domestic and international demand, associated with risks of deflation, insufficient stimuli, housing crisis, and lack of confidence from consumers and the private sector are some of the causes pointed out by analysts to explain what is happening in the world's second-largest economy.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 22, 2024 05:48 AM\nSource:[RTP - Rádio Televisão Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/taxa-de-desemprego-jovem-na-china-desce-ligeiramente-apos-dois-meses-de-subida_n1609429)\n\n**China's youth unemployment rate falls after climbing for 2 months**\nChina's youth unemployment rate fell to 17.6% in September, down from 18.8% in August, according to official data.

This is a concern for economists, as it indicates the nation's economic woes are far from over. The rate of urban youth unemployment has been a commonly-cited gauge of the country's financial stability. The government has amended the data points to exclude students, releasing a lower urban youth unemployment rate, but this figure is on the rise again. Some of the reasons for China's youth unemployment include an economic slowdown, growing numbers of people pursuing higher education, and weak consumer and employer confidence. According to Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, 'People that entered university four years ago may have planned for a future in finance or app development, but now need to get a job in manufacturing.' The youth unemployment rate in China is notably worse than in other nations, with the International Labour Organization reporting a 13.9% youth unemployment rate for Asia and the Pacific in 2023. Economists and analysts look to youth unemployment rates for insight because they are more prone to fluctuations that can hint at corporate confidence and hiring trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 02:35 PM\nSource:[NewsBreak](https://www.newsbreak.com/los-angeles-times-521565/3608608080295-china-s-rising-youth-unemployment-signals-the-nation-s-economic-woes-are-far-from-over)\n\n**China's Youth Unemployment Rate Hits New Record of 18.8% in August**\nChina's youth unemployment rate has risen to a new record of 18.8% in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

The NBS changed its methodology in January to exclude students from the youth unemployment rate, which previously reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023. The new methodology aims to provide more accurate employment services and policies for young people. 'The calculation of the unemployment rate by age group, excluding students, reflects better the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering society,' said the NBS. The population of people aged 16-24 includes around 62 million students, over 60% of this age group. The exclusion of students from the unemployment rate allows authorities to provide more precise employment services and formulate more effective and targeted employment policies.' The global urban unemployment rate in China was 5.3% in August, a slight increase from 5.1% in July.

After excluding students from the survey, the unemployment rate among young people decreased by almost a third in December. However, the problem persists, and in July 2024, the number of young unemployed people increased by a third to 17.1%. Analyst Jiayu Li notes that the official numbers do not accurately capture the situation, as they exclude millions of rural workers who face greater challenges in finding full-time employment. The government's repression of the technology, real estate, and private education sectors in 2020/21 has also contributed to the problem. The sectors have lost over $1 trillion in market value, and the private education sector, which offered part-time jobs to around 75 million students, has been decimated. Many of those affected were young workers. The government's focus on emerging sectors such as AI and electric vehicles, which do not require many new workers, has also stifled innovation and technological progress. The continuous tensions with the West have also put pressure on China's export sector, which needs to substitute high-value and low-risk orders from the West with lower-value orders from the Global South. This has an impact on employment. The rise of the 'tang ping' movement, where young people reject social pressures and opt for a more relaxed life, has also contributed to the problem. Many young people are choosing to become 'professional children or grandchildren' to care for their elderly relatives, a function in high demand due to the aging population and increasing care costs. The government's strict regulations have also made entrepreneurs and venture capitalists 'extremely cautious' and unwilling to take risks, leading to a 97% decline in new startups in the past six years. Economist Diana Choyleva notes that this is a 'serious contradiction with the government's agenda.' The high youth unemployment rate reduces productivity and will make it difficult for China to compete globally. It will also prevent young people from entering the middle class, which will have implications for consumption and social stability.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 18, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/aposta-tecnol%C3%B3gica-da-china-deixa-jovens-sem-emprego/a-70251310)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**US Drought Affects Over 318 Million Acres of Farmland, 150 Million People**\nA report by the 'US Drought Monitor' has highlighted a severe drought affecting over 45% of the land in the United States and Puerto Rico. The drought has also affected 54% of the land in the contiguous 48 states. Despite the onset of autumn, the drought continues to worsen, with over 150 million people in the US and 149.8 million in the contiguous states suffering from its consequences, a 34% increase from last week and a 150% increase from last month. The drought has had a significant impact on the agricultural sector, with over 318 million acres of farmland affected, a 57% increase from last month. According to Dr. Living Lu, a professor of environmental science at Michigan State University, 'climate change is causing extreme weather events in both directions; when it rains heavily, the soil can't absorb the water properly, leading to surface runoff and flooding.' Local efforts to combat the drought have been made, with some leaders acknowledging the issue and taking measures to mitigate its effects. However, Dr. Lu notes that these efforts are limited in their impact. The drought has also led to an increased reliance on groundwater, which accounts for over 40% of agricultural and household water usage. According to the US National Integrated Drought Information System, this increased groundwater usage can lead to reduced water supplies in the future. California, which relies heavily on agriculture to support its economy, suffered losses of $1.7 billion in crop revenue in 2022 due to the ongoing drought. The drought has also led to decreased water levels in rivers, reducing the efficiency of water transportation and increasing shipping costs, which ultimately affects food and product prices.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 06:43 PM\nSource:[Albawaba](https://www.albawabhnews.com/5101062)\n\n**Rain is what we need and rain is what we have in the forecast!**\nBridgeport, W.Va is expecting drought relief with rain forecasted in the area over the next 7 days.

The WFP said, 'To avert further deterioration of food security and nutrition outcomes across the country, sustained humanitarian assistance, including anticipatory action, is urgently needed.' The appeal follows findings from the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, which highlights that 1.6 million children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition until July 2025. The WFP noted a 14 percent increase in global acute malnutrition and a 21 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition compared to the same season last year. The IPC report aligns with global forecasts indicating an 80 percent probability of La Nina conditions, which could lead to drought in Somalia. The WFP said, 'This is due to anticipated below-average rains, localized flooding in the riverine and urban areas of Hiran, Gedo, Middle Shabelle, and Lower Shabelle, ongoing conflict, high food prices, and diseases contributing to acute food insecurity and malnutrition.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2024 04:56 PM\nSource:[newkerala.com](https://www.newkerala.com/news/2024/68620.htm)\n\n**WFP Zambia Country Brief, September 2024 - Zambia**\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) assisted 28,546 people in Zambia through various interventions in September 2024.

Morgan Slaven, a sheep farmer in Augusta County, said she was grateful for her 'off-farm job' to generate income after drought conditions presented back-to-back years of challenges ahead of this year's harvest season. 'What if I lost my job?' Slaven said. 'The only reason I have this place right now is because I have an off-the-farm income.' The drought, which was exacerbated by temperatures reaching 99 degrees and no rain in the Lynchburg area, has impacted profits in the largest economic sector in the state, with agriculture contributing about $82.3 billion annually to the economy. According to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture employs over 381,800 people. Assistance programs are available, but some farmers may be reluctant to use them, and they may only allow farmers to break even. 'People have a lot of pride, they don’t want to take donations, but it’s there, because your tax dollars are paying for it,' Slaven said. The drought has hurt sheep farmers, corn, and bean commodities, with corn yields estimated to be 36.1 million bushels, down 38% from the 2023 level. 'It’s a half a crop at best, and it’s highly damaged,' said Robert Harper, a grain marketing specialist at the Virginia Farm Bureau. 'It’s a year of extremes. It seems like we’re just getting these cyclical weather patterns, and we get stuck in them.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2024 09:27 AM\nSource:[fredericksburgfreepress.com](https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/21/despite-recent-rain-farmers-in-virginia-struggle-with-effects-of-summer-drought/)\n\n**Not much help in the forecast over the next 7 days for the ongoing drought**\nA high-pressure system is bringing sunshine to north-central West Virginia, but it's not providing much relief from the ongoing drought.

The report, 'The State of Global Water Resources', was released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and highlights the alarming situation of water resources worldwide. The report states that 3.6 billion people globally face water scarcity for at least a month every year, and this number is expected to rise to 5 billion by 2050. The report also notes that glaciers are shrinking at an alarming rate, with 6 million gigatons of ice melted, mostly into the oceans and some rivers. The report warns that climate change is causing extreme weather events, including droughts and floods, which have a significant impact on lives, ecosystems, and economies. The report emphasizes the need for immediate action to address water-related challenges, improve data quality, and enhance global cooperation. The United Nations has launched a global effort to establish early warning systems for water-related hazards, with the goal of including all people in these systems by 2027.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 08:22 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/hi/story/2024/10/1080006)\n\n**WMO Warns of Worsening Water Scarcity and Hydrological Stress Worldwide**\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned of the worsening of water scarcity and hydrological stress worldwide.

The organization reports that 3.6 billion people do not have access to sufficient water for at least a month a year, and this number could increase to over 5 billion by 2050. The WMO also notes that glaciers have suffered the largest mass loss in 50 years, with a loss of over 600 gigatonnes of water in two consecutive years. The organization's secretary-general warned that 'the melting of glaciers and ice threatens the long-term water security of millions of people.' The WMO report aims to promote better monitoring, data sharing, and collaboration to address the situation, and the organization's secretary-general urged 'we need to act with urgency.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 07:53 PM\nSource:[ardina.news/](https://www.ardina.news/article/2024_10_07_2058430915_onu-alerta-para-agravamento-da-escassez-de-agua-e-do-stress-hidrico-a-nivel-mundial)\n\n**UN Warns of Intense Droughts and Extreme Floods as a Preview of the Future**\nThe United Nations (UN) has warned that intense droughts and extreme floods are a preview of the future, according to Celeste Saulo, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). 'Water is becoming increasingly unpredictable' and the warning signs are impossible to ignore', she said in a press conference. The WMO presented a new report on water resources, which points to a worsening of water scarcity worldwide. Analyzing 33 years of data, the organization found that the world's rivers reached a record low level of drought last year. 'In the context of climate change, water is giving us a sample of the changes that are approaching', Celeste Saulo also stated in a statement. The report highlights that the signs of warning are multiplying: we are witnessing an exacerbation of extreme precipitation, floods, and droughts, which are having a heavy cost for lives, ecosystems, and economies. With 2023 being the hottest year on record, high temperatures and generally low precipitation contributed to prolonged droughts. The extreme hydrological phenomena were encouraged not only by natural climate factors, such as the transition from La Niña to an El Niño episode in mid-2023 (related to changes in the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean), but also by human-induced climate changes, according to the WMO. 'The increase in temperature accelerated the hydrological cycle, which also became more irregular and less predictable', explained Celeste Saulo. A warmer atmosphere can retain more humidity, so global warming increases the risk of strong precipitation, but accelerated evaporation and soil drying exacerbate droughts. As a result, 'we are faced with increasingly difficult situations, where water is too abundant or insufficient', she said. Currently, 3.6 billion people do not have access to sufficient water for at least a month a year, and it is predicted that this number will exceed 5 billion in 2050, according to the UN. The report reveals that the flow of about 50% of the world's rivers was below normal last year. Glaciers are also on the front line of global warming: according to preliminary data from September 2022 to August 2023, they lost more than 600 gigatons of water, the worst loss in 50 years of observation. 'Deglaciation and glaciers threaten the long-term water security of millions of people. However, we are not taking the urgent measures that are necessary', warned the WMO Secretary-General. According to the WMO, it was the African continent that suffered the most last year with the water-related meteorological phenomena and that recorded the most deaths.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 07, 2024 04:00 PM\nSource:[sapo.pt](https://www.sapo.pt/noticias/atualidade/secas-intensas-e-inundacoes-extremas-sao_6704079ffdd584423cbc5d95)\n\n**WMO: 3.6 Billion People Face Water Scarcity Issues**\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) released a report on the global water resources, stating that 2023 was the driest year for rivers in the past 30 years. The report highlights the critical changes in water availability, particularly during periods of increasing demand. It notes that the amount of water in rivers has decreased over the past five years, and the amount of usable water has decreased. The report also states that glaciers have experienced the largest mass loss in the past 50 years. According to the report, 2023 was the second consecutive year where glacier loss was reported in all regions where glaciers are found. The report attributes the high temperatures and widespread drought to the recorded hottest year on record, which led to prolonged droughts. It also highlights the significant number of floods and other natural disasters that occurred worldwide due to human-induced climate change. The report states that, according to UN data, 3.6 billion people worldwide are currently facing water scarcity issues, with this number expected to rise to 5 billion by 2050. The report also notes that the world is far from achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said, 'We are getting very disturbing warnings about extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. This is a harbinger of the climate disaster. Melting glaciers and ice sheets threaten the long-term water security of millions of people. Yet, we are not taking the necessary urgent action.' Saulo also stated that the increasing temperatures are accelerating the hydrological cycle, leading to more problems with water. He noted that a warmer atmosphere will lead to more moisture, which will cause more evaporation and drying of the soil. Saulo emphasized the need for urgent action, saying, 'We don't know much about the real situation of the world's freshwater resources. We can't manage what we don't measure. This report aims to contribute to improved monitoring, data sharing, transboundary cooperation, and assessment.

Eric Freeland, a Wellsburg-based farmer, stressed that 'time is of the essence' to replenish the water table, which is currently 'exceptionally low' due to the drought. Dale Sampson, owner of Dale Sampson Feed Store, noted that a 'steady rain' is required to replenish the water table before the ground freezes. The drought has already resulted in significant crop losses for Freeland next year, and Jerry Ebbert, owner of Ebbert Farm Market, said he was 'blessed' to have a full pumpkin patch this year despite the drought. The drought has also impacted farmers who sell animal products, with Jeff Miller, owner of Miller Farms, struggling to keep his Angus beef cows well-fed and hydrated. Miller estimates he will have to keep cows off the pasture until June when they can typically begin grazing again in April. The price of hay used to supplement the diet of livestock has 'doubled or tripled,' according to Sampson.

    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Top Republican privately backing Thune to succeed McConnell in GOP leader race**\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Steve Daines is privately urging Senate Republicans to vote for Senate Minority Whip John Thune to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as the head of the party. Daines had previously considered running for the position but confirmed in October that he would not seek it. The leader position is also being sought by Sens. John Cornyn and Rick Scott. McConnell, who is retiring, will not be endorsing a successor. President-elect Trump has not publicly weighed in on the matter, but had previously expressed support for Daines to run for the position. Only three senators have made public endorsements, with Sens. Markwayne Mullin and Mike Rounds supporting Thune, and Sen. Ron Johnson backing Scott.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 09:41 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-republican-privately-backing-thune-succeed-mcconnell-gop-leader-race)\n\n**Republicans brace for Mitch McConnell succession fight with Senate won**\nWith Republicans regaining control of the Senate, a leadership succession fight is brewing. Three contenders are vying to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): Minority Whip John Thune, John Cornyn, and Rick Scott. The leadership vote is scheduled for Nov. 13. McConnell, who announced his departure in February, has refrained from meddling in the race. Trump has declined to publicly endorse a contender, but his influence is still significant. Thune said, 'The president obviously has tremendous influence, if he chooses to use it.' Cornyn and Scott have both vowed to help enact Trump's agenda, with Cornyn stating, 'It is critically important that the Senate is prepared to enact his pro-growth agenda from day one.' Scott's spokesperson declared that he 'will bring Florida's winning conservative record to Washington and be a true ally to President Trump to execute his agenda and fundamentally change the direction of this country.' McConnell, who is widely seen as a member of the traditional wing of the Republican Party, is set to leave office at the start of 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 10:54 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/11/06/us-news/republicans-brace-for-mitch-mcconnell-succession-fight-with-senate-won/)\n\n**Who will replace Mitch McConnell as Senate GOP leader?**\nWith Mitch McConnell stepping down as Senate GOP leader, a trio of candidates has emerged as possible successors: South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, and Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso. All three have pledged to work closely with Trump to get his agenda through Congress. Thune, the Senate minority whip, defines himself by the party's traditional values and has at times defied Trump's wishes. Cornyn has been actively campaigning with Trump, attending rallies and fundraising events. Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon and former state lawmaker, has risen to the third-ranking GOP position in the U.S. Senate and is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 08:40 PM\nSource:[wavy.com](https://www.wavy.com/news/national/who-will-replace-mitch-mcconnell-as-senate-gop-leader/)\n\n**Who will replace Mitch McConnell? Race to be next GOP Senate leader**\nSenators John Thune, John Cornyn, and Rick Scott have announced their intentions to replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate Republican leader. The internal vote will take place on November 13. According to Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the U.K.'s University of Surrey, the race 'realistically' comes down to Thune and Cornyn. Shanahan said, 'At this stage, Thune probably has the upper hand. As Republican Whip, he's de facto number two in the GOP pecking order in the Senate, and is seen as both a strong and active campaigner and fundraiser.' Cornyn would bring 'considerable Texan wealth' to GOP coffers if he was to land the role. Scott is a top ally of Donald Trump and a frequent critic of McConnell. The winner of the leadership contest will be Senate majority leader after the election, and thus will fulfill a crucial role. Neither Thune or Cornyn is close to Donald Trump, and may have to act as a necessary brake on some of his more outlandish proposals if he returns to the White House.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 08:13 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/replace-mitch-mcconnell-senate-gop-leader-1977337)\n\n**Daines signals privately he will back Thune in GOP leadership race**\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chair Steve Daines has privately signaled to colleagues that he will support Senate Republican Whip John Thune in the race to become next Senate Republican leader. Daines's public support would be a promising development for Thune, who is locked in a tough race with Sen. John Cornyn to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader next year. Thune is expected to carve out a special leadership position for Daines if he wins the race. Republican senators expect Thune to win the leadership post, but the race remains too close to call as many Republican senators are waiting on the outcome of the 2024 election before committing to either Thune or Cornyn.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 03:43 PM\nSource:[localsyr.com](https://www.localsyr.com/hill-politics/daines-signals-privately-he-will-back-thune-in-gop-leadership-race/)\n\n**With McConnell MIA, his potential replacements step in to bolster battleground Republicans**\nAs Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell steps down, his potential replacements, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, South Dakota Sen. John Thune, and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, are vying to fill the vacuum. They are dumping big sums of money into key Senate races to help the GOP win back the majority. According to sources, Cornyn has raised nearly $850,000 for Scott and more than $715,000 for Ted Cruz's races, while Thune has raised six figures for Cruz and Scott through his Joint Fundraising Committees. The next Senate leader will need to have strong fundraising ability and a good relationship with former President Donald Trump, who has yet to weigh in on the election. Trump's endorsement is highly coveted, and the three contenders have publicly backed him against Kamala Harris. However, their voting records resemble McConnell's, and some Republicans worry that they may continue to sabotage the party.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 03:16 PM\nSource:[The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2024/10/31/senate-leadership-fundraising-thune-cornyn-scott-mcconnell/)\n\n**Can the GOP reclaim the U.S. Senate?

McConnell, who has access to polling conducted by the Senate Leadership Fund, feels 'great' about the GOP's chances in Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He considers the West Virginia seat nearly secure and sees Montana as their second-best opportunity, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is facing a tough challenge in a state that will likely vote for Donald Trump. McConnell declined to say who he would support to succeed him as GOP leader, stating that both John Cornyn and John Thune are 'terrific' and will do an outstanding job.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[arcamax.com](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3468996)\n\n**Mitch McConnell Exits Senate Leadership in November, John Thune Will Likely Replace - The Last Refuge**\nMitch McConnell is stepping down as Senate Majority Leader in November, and John Thune is likely to replace him. Thune has been groomed by McConnell and has the support of the Republican establishment. However, President Trump has leverage in the situation, as he has met with Thune and discussed his expectations. Trump is focused on getting the right people into Senate committees, particularly the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), where Marco Rubio is the vice chair. Trump is looking for a chairman who will give him the opportunity for success, and Rubio is seen as a compromise candidate. The article argues that the focus should be on getting the right people into Senate committees, rather than trying to stop Thune from becoming the next Senate Majority Leader. 'I think we have an understanding, and it's professional,' Thune said of Trump in a recent interview, calling the Mar-a-Lago visit important in establishing a personal rapport.

The news is not new, as he first announced his decision in February. The focus now is on who will replace him, with candidates such as Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Ted Cruz being mentioned. Senator Tommy Tuberville has stated that he will not support anyone who opposes President Trump for the role, and has spoken to potential candidates John Thune and John Cornyn. Meanwhile, some are questioning McConnell's health and ability to continue serving, citing incidents where he appeared to 'freeze' in public.

Three candidates, John Cornyn, Rick Scott, and John Thune, are vying for the position. Senators are looking for a leader who can move legislation through the chamber, listen to members, and forge strong ties with the incoming administration. Some key characteristics mentioned by senators include being a 'workhorse', being able to negotiate bipartisan deals, having the ability to get along well with President Trump, and being willing to test assumptions against critics' arguments. The next leader will face challenges such as navigating a divided government, confirming executive branch nominees, and potentially a Supreme Court nominee.

Mitch McConnell's decision to vacate his seat in January 2027 has sparked a leadership race among Republican senators. Sens. John Cornyn and John Thune are the front-runners, with Thune being seen as a strong contender due to his policy and political experience, as well as his widespread support within the conference. An anonymous former Senate GOP aide said, 'Sen. Thune sticks out as someone with the policy and political chops and widespread support inside the conference to get the job.' However, some analysts believe that a Trump election win could lead to a third candidate being endorsed by the former President, or a public pledge of loyalty being extracted from Cornyn and Thune. Jason Cabel Roe attributed the outcome to the presidential election, saying, 'I think it will come down to who the caucus thinks can effectively coexist with a President Trump, if he wins, or who will be better prepared to stop a [Kamala] Harris agenda, if she wins.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 01:25 AM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/politics/senate-majority-leader-mcconnell-thune/2024/10/27/id/1185621/)\n\n**The intense election race that no one's paying attention to**\nSenator John Cornyn and Senator John Thune have emerged as the frontrunners to replace Mitch McConnell as the Republican leader in the Senate. According to a former senior GOP Senate aide, Thune 'sticks out as someone with the policy and political chops and widespread support inside the conference to get the job.' McConnell, who has led his party in the Senate since 2007, is stepping down. Political analysts find the choices of Cornyn and Thune 'conventional' options, but are unable to name alternatives that could factor into the contest. Gregory Koger, a political scientist, believes that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, he may try to support a third candidate or extract a public pledge of personal loyalty from Cornyn and Thune. Koger notes that the election to replace McConnell will be 'critical to the future of the Senate as a legislative body.' Jason Cabel Roe, a political and communications strategist, calls McConnell 'one of a kind' and notes that Thune and Cornyn have decades of experience in the Senate and are better prepared to lead the caucus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2024 07:30 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/intense-election-race-that-no-ones-paying-attention-1975597)\n\n**Lame-Duck McConnell Lashes Out at Trump as Senate Turns Away From His Leadership Style**\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has lashed out at former President Donald Trump and other Republicans, calling Trump a 'sleazeball' and the MAGA movement 'completely wrong' in a new biography. McConnell's comments have sparked a backlash from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who is demanding that the three declared candidates for Senate GOP leadership - Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla., John Thune, R-S.D., and John Cornyn, R-Texas - weigh in on McConnell's remarks. Lee said that McConnell's attacks on Trump and Scott are 'indefensible' and that the Senate GOP leader is supposed to help Republicans, not undermine them. Scott responded to McConnell's comments, saying that he believes in supporting Republican candidates and that McConnell's attacks are 'shocking.' Thune, meanwhile, focused on electing a strong Senate Republican majority. McConnell's comments have been seen as a possible impetus for his possible successors to distance themselves from his style of leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 06:41 PM\nSource:[dailysignal.com](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/10/25/mcconnell-lashes-out-at-trump/)\n\n**McConnell attacked Trump.

Scott strongly criticized McConnell, saying he was 'shocked' by the 'attack' on Trump and expressing his support for Trump's 'dramatic change' agenda. Thune, on the other hand, reaffirmed his support for Trump while focusing on winning the Senate. Cornyn withheld a response, directing readers to his previous endorsement of Trump. 'While Leader McConnell and I have fundamental disagreements, I am shocked that he would attack a fellow Republican senator and the Republican nominee for president just two weeks out from an election,' Scott said in a statement. 'I believe we should be talking about solutions, he doesn't,' Scott continued. 'I support Donald Trump and his work to fundamentally change the way Washington operates, he doesn't. I believe we could support the candidates Republican voters choose, he doesn't.' Thune stated, 'Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States, which is why I'm focused on electing a strong Senate Republican majority that can hit the ground running and work with him to secure our borders, create more opportunities for families, and strengthen American businesses.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 25, 2024 03:30 PM\nSource:[TheBlaze](https://www.theblaze.com/news/mcconnell-attacked-trump-here-s-how-his-potential-successors-responded)\n\n**McConnell, Tillis lead charge against Republican leadership overhaul**\nSenate GOP leader Mitch McConnell is set to leave his position after nearly 18 years, and one of his final tasks will be to prevent what he sees as a weakening of the job. McConnell believes that the majority leader's ability to shut down an open amendment process on the floor is necessary due to individual senators' power in the unanimous consent-based Senate. He warned potential successors against making concessions to win votes, referencing former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's downfall. The three candidates vying to succeed McConnell - Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. John Cornyn, and Senate Minority Whip John Thune - are proposing varying degrees of changes to the leadership structure that would empower rank-and-file senators. McConnell stated, 'You've watched it over and over again: One senator has an objection. The majority leader says we're open for amendments. That doesn't mean you're open for amendments.' He also said, 'I want whoever has this job to have some clout. When you have narrow majorities, you've seen in the House what could happen. Take all the power away from the leader and what happens?

Lee's ideas are seen as a roadmap for winning the support of conservative senators, who are believed to be a key bloc in the race to succeed McConnell. While Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is seen as the most solicitous of conservatives, Lee's proposals may be an attempt to exert leverage in a second-ballot race involving Sens.

In California, the Republicans have made gains in several key districts, including the 13th and 22nd congressional districts. In the 13th district, John Duarte, a Republican farmer, is leading his Democratic opponent Adam Gray by a narrow margin. In the 22nd district, David Valadao, a Republican farmer, is also leading his Democratic opponent Rudy Salas. The outcome of these races will determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, in the Senate, the Republican Michelle Steel is leading her Democratic opponent Derek Tran in the 45th district. The elections in California have been marked by a high turnout of voters, with over 9 million ballots cast so far. The results are still too close to call in several key races, and the outcome will depend on the remaining votes to be counted.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 12:34 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN ÉPOCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/las-elecciones-en-california-ponen-en-aprietos-a-los-democratas-mientras-republicanos-dominan-en-el-senado-1317329.html)\n\n**2024 California Congressional District 13 election results: Adam Gray vs. John Duarte**\nRepublican incumbent John Duarte and Democratic challenger Adam Gray are competing for the office of Congressional District 13 in the 2024 California General Election.

Will Rollins, a Democrat running against incumbent Republican Ken Calvert, has made housing a central theme in his campaign, proposing policies such as cracking down on corporations buying up housing stock and passing a tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Rollins' opponent, Calvert, has responded with his own housing-inflected messaging, warning that Rollins would 'rubber stamp' the failed policies of California Governor Gavin Newsom. The issue of housing costs has become a key concern for voters, with the median mortgage payment for new homes in the district increasing by 90% since 2019 and the median rent swelling by nearly 40%. Democrats have put more emphasis on housing supply, following in the footsteps of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has promised to build 3 million new units. Republicans, on the other hand, have focused on the threat of a rollback of Proposition 13, a voter-approved measure that limits reassessments on property taxes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 01:17 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/land-million-dollar-starter-home-125600470.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cDovL3Jzcy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9yc3MvdXM&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFJMHG0rB8emNh4hiqnH5V7zZ0CM0XdG4HVBcVsCHeweVNSvjncWLXUBGfQk_3jc3S_wPyvr5_v8gwBAl9bxL41OfYi5FV5W_vqG3i0KvHuDnLwcDW011biIZzUbWmMUNNywbqV35bdokelZ07LZxYCxevTxIuSDEp6WjHCrU54-)\n\n**Q&A: Challenger Adam Gray in home stretch of battle for California's 13th congressional district**\nDemocratic challenger Adam Gray is in the final stretch of the battle for California's 13th congressional district.

Duarte said fiscal prudence is a foundation of his legislative decision making and challenged some of the climate-related agenda. On how best to lower gas prices, the candidates differed in their plans, with Duarte blaming the state's gas taxes and strict regulations, and Gray calling for more federal action.

FiveThirtyEight's House forecast shows the race as a dead heat, with Democrats and Republicans winning their simulation 50 times each. Democrats could take back a slight majority by sweeping the competitive races in New York and California, two solidly Democratic states where Republicans outperformed expectations in 2022. In New York, there are five competitive races, including the 22nd Congressional District, where Republican Brandon Williams is facing a challenge from Democrat state Senator John Mannion.

In California, there are five toss-up seats currently held by Republicans and two seats classified as 'Lean Democrat.' Democrat Adam Gray is challenging Representative John Duarte in a Central Valley-based seat, a rematch of the race two years ago, in California's 13th District.

In the Central Valley, Orange County, and East Los Angeles, the most competitive districts are located. Among the 10 most competitive districts, the Republicans hold seven seats. In the 13th district, Representative John Duarte (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Adam Gray in a rematch of the 2022 election.

In the 22nd district, Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Rudy Salas in the San Joaquin Valley, a region known for its agricultural production. In the 27th district, Representative Mike García (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat George Whitesides, a former NASA administrator. In the 45th district, Representative Michelle Steel (R-Calif.) faces off against Democrat Derek Tran, a veteran, entrepreneur, and consumer rights lawyer. In the 47th district, the news is still developing. The candidates are vying for the support of voters in the north of Los Angeles County, including the cities of Lancaster, Palmdale, and Santa Clarita, as well as parts of Los Angeles. Steel, a Korean immigrant, has been a strong advocate for reducing taxes and spending, while Tran has emphasized the need to protect the rights of consumers and workers. 'I am in touch with the problems of the district and have a lot of credibility with a lot of people,' Duarte said. 'The message is clear: bring water to farms, drill American oil, and control the cost of living.' 'I am running for Congress because politicians have created more problems than they have solved,' Whitesides said. 'I will use my business experience to solve problems, not play politics.'

College-educated voters are moving to Democrats, while non-college-educated voters are shifting to Republicans. Latinos are also showing a rightward shift. The 13th and 22nd Congressional Districts have high populations of non-college-educated voters and a growing no-party-preference bloc. To win, campaigns need to actively reach out to key issues and earn the votes of Latino voters, who lack trust in either party.

Former Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray is running against Rep. John Duarte (R-CA), who won the seat by under 600 votes two years ago. Political analysts view Duarte as vulnerable due to his narrow margin of victory and status as a first-term congressman. 'Anything that's good for Democrats is going to have an outsized effect on Duarte simply because he's the less-tested candidate,' said Jacob Rubashkin, a deputy editor of Inside Elections. Erin Covey, a House analyst and editor at the Cook Political Report, added that Duarte 'can also be more easily roped into the national Republican Party because he hasn't had as much time to show voters that he's not like other Republicans.' Pundits rate the race as a toss-up, with some predicting a single-digit gain for either party. 'In this particular election, the factors are beyond anybody's control,' said Mike Lynch, a longtime Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Gray. 'It's a coin-toss difference.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 11:15 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/3156247/democrats-look-flip-toss-up-california-district-in-bid-for-house-control/)\n\n**Democrats look to flip ‘toss-up' California district in bid for House control**\nThe California 13th Congressional District is a key battleground in the fight for control of the House. Former Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray is running against incumbent Rep. John Duarte (R-CA) in a rematch of their 2022 race. Duarte won by a narrow margin of under 600 votes, but analysts say his status as a first-term congressman makes him vulnerable. 'Anything that's good for Democrats is going to have an outsized effect on Duarte simply because he's the less-tested candidate,' said Jacob Rubashkin, a deputy editor of Inside Elections. Erin Covey, a House analyst, added that Duarte 'can also be more easily roped into the national Republican Party because he hasn't had as much time to show voters that he's not like other Republicans.' The National Republican Congressional Committee has urged members to focus on defensive fundraising efforts, but the Democratic Party's recent fundraising surge, fueled by Vice President Kamala Harris, has made the GOP's task more challenging.

John Duarte, R-Modesto, and former Assemblyman Adam Gray, D-Merced, in California's 13th Congressional District is a tossup, according to nonpartisan analysts. Gray lost to Duarte by 564 votes in 2022, and analysts say Duarte will have a tougher time in November due to being a first-term congressman. Gray has fundraised well against Duarte recently, but the Republican retains an edge in overall funds. The district is a Latino-majority voting-age district with a large population of young people, and legislative issues concern affordability, water access, health, immigration, and public safety. Gray emphasized the need for Congress to invest in water infrastructure and renewable energy, while Duarte emphasized the importance of drilling American oil and developing natural gas. 'Congress can make investments in water infrastructure,' Gray said. 'Congress can make investments in renewable energy and new opportunities to take advantage of the biocircular economy here in the Valley.' Duarte said, 'We've got to drill American oil. We've got to continue to develop natural gas and welcome it as a key energy resource for the future.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 07:29 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://news.yahoo.com/news/john-duarte-vs-adam-gray-192909562.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."

These 3 Growth Stocks Are Trading Near Their 52-Week Lows. | The Motley Fool**\nThe Motley Fool suggests three growth stocks that are trading near their 52-week lows: Dollar General (DG), Nike (NKE), and Merck (MRK). These stocks have seen better days, but investors shouldn't count them out in the long run. Dollar General is down 43% this year due to a 'financially constrained' core customer, but it has over 20,000 stores and could scale back its business to improve profitability. Nike is struggling due to inflation and a change in leadership, but it remains a popular brand with potential for growth. Merck is undervalued at just 10 times its estimated future profits, despite a 6% decline this year. The company has been investing in research and development and pursuing acquisitions to bolster its growth prospects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 02:49 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/07/got-5000-these-3-growth-stocks-are-trading-near-th/)\n\n**Is MRK Stock Undervalued At $100?**\nMerck's Q3 results exceeded street estimates, with revenues and earnings of $16.7 billion and $1.57 per share, respectively. The growth was driven by higher sales of Keytruda, but the company lowered its full-year earnings outlook due to a one-time charge. Despite this, analysts estimate Merck's valuation to be $130 per share, reflecting a 25% upside from its current market price of $102. The company's recent acquisitions are expected to bolster its growth in the coming years. MRK stock has underperformed the broader markets this year, but has increased its value in each of the last three years. However, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period, providing better returns with less risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 06:53 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/07/is-mrk-stock-undervalued-at-100/)\n\n**Merck & Co., Inc.

The pharmaceutical giant's cancer medicine, Keytruda, has been a major contributor to its sales, but its patent protection will lapse in 2028, leading to competition from biosimilars. While Merck has a pipeline of programs in phase 3 clinical trials, none of them have a similar addressable market to Keytruda. However, the company has a strong balance sheet with $11.3 billion in cash and $13.1 billion in trailing-12-month free cash flow, allowing it to invest in R&D and potentially acquire biotechs with promising programs. As a result, Merck may be able to provide decent returns to its shareholders up to the patent expiry and beyond, making it a good purchase for investors willing to hold the stock for at least six years or more.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2024 11:45 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/01/is-merck-stock-a-buy/)\n\n**Merck Stock: Slight Negative Signal at the Start of the Trading Day**\nThe Merck KGaA stock started the trading day with a slight negative signal, down 0.48% compared to yesterday.

According to estimates, Keytruda's sales will continue to grow until 2028, when it will hit peak sales above $30 billion. However, Merck will lose patent exclusivity for Keytruda in 2028, which will lead to a decline in sales. To mitigate this, Merck is developing a subcutaneous version of Keytruda, which could extend its patent exclusivity beyond 2028. Additionally, the company has a new therapy, Winrevair, which could hit sales of $3.9 billion by 2029, and a deep pipeline with over 80 programs in phase 2 studies and over 30 in phase 3 trials.

Despite this, the company boasts six blockbuster drugs, including Keytruda, which accounts for 50% of pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda's sales are gaining from rapid uptake across earlier-stage indications, and Merck is working on strategies to drive long-term growth. The company has made regulatory and clinical progress across areas like oncology, vaccines, and infectious diseases, and has executed strategic business moves like acquisitions and collaborations. However, Merck is heavily reliant on Keytruda and should look to diversify its product lineup. The company's second-largest product, Gardasil, is seeing grim sales in China. Merck's valuation appears attractive relative to the industry, and the company has a strong pipeline of new products, including Capvaxive and Winrevair, which have the potential to generate significant revenues.

Keytruda's sales make up about 45% of Merck's revenue, but it may face stiff competition from Summit Therapeutics' ivonescimab, which has shown better results in a phase 3 study in China. However, ivonescimab still needs to undergo U.S.-based phase 3 studies before it can challenge Keytruda in the U.S. market. Additionally, Keytruda will lose patent exclusivity in the U.S. in 2028, which could lead to a significant decline in sales. Merck plans to mitigate this by launching a subcutaneous formulation of Keytruda, which could generate up to $8 billion in revenue by 2030. The company also has a pipeline of new medicines, including Winrevair, which was approved in March.

This will be the only official act of the campaign before the final vote, which will take place in March during the 143rd Extraordinary Session of the COI in Greece.

Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., the son of the former IOC president, is also a candidate. The seven candidates are: Sebastian Coe, David Lappartient, Kirsty Coventry, Morinari Watanabe, Johan Eliasch, Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., and Prince Feisal al Hussein. They will have to submit a formal list by January, three months before the election meeting on March 18-21 in Greece.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 07:37 PM\nSource:[A Bola](https://www.abola.pt/modalidades/noticias/sete-candidatos-ao-comite-olimpico-internacional-2024091619212802142)\n\n**IOC Presidential Election: Seven Candidates Announced, Including Surprise Candidate Johan Eliasch**\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced seven candidates for the presidency, with elections set to take place in March 2025. The current president, Thomas Bach, will not be re-elected. The candidates are: Sebastian Coe (head of World Athletics), Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. (IOC vice-president), David Laparte (head of the International Cycling Union), Faisal bin Hussein (prince of Jordan and IOC executive board member), Kirsty Coventry (IOC executive board member and two-time Olympic champion in swimming), Johan Eliasch (head of the International Ski Federation), and Moriarty Watanabe (head of the International Gymnastics Federation). Johan Eliasch, a Swedish-born British businessman, is a surprise candidate. He has been the head of the International Ski Federation for only three years and has a net worth of around £4 billion, making him one of the richest people in the UK. Eliasch's candidacy has been met with skepticism, particularly due to his decision to ban Russian athletes from international competitions, including the Olympics. Coventry is seen as the front-runner, with the support of Thomas Bach and a strong reputation in the Olympic community. However, the election process is strictly regulated, and candidates are not allowed to engage in personal travel or meetings with IOC members to avoid financial inequality. The official campaign will begin on January 20-24, 2025, in Lausanne, where each candidate will have the opportunity to present their platform to all IOC members. Despite the election, Thomas Bach will remain president until June 24, 2025, as per the IOC's constitution.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 04:41 PM\nSource:[Sports.ru](https://www.sports.ru/others/blogs/3266731.html)\n\n**Seven Candidates Announced for IOC Presidency**\nThe seven candidates for the presidency of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have been announced. They are Juan Antonio Samaranch (Spain), Sebastian Coe (UK), David Lappartient (France), Morinari Watanabe (Japan), Feisal al Hussein (Jordan), Johan Eliasch (Sweden), and Kirsty Coventry (Zimbabwe). The election will take place in March 2025, and the winner will succeed Thomas Bach, who has been in the position since 2013. Bach has stated, 'Los nuevos tiempos exigen nuevos líderes. Sé que con esta decisión estoy decepcionando a muchos de vosotros. Sólo puedo pediros que respetéis el hecho de que estoy convencido de que esto es lo mejor para nuestro querido Movimiento Olímpico.' He also announced that he will step down on June 24, 2025, and will ensure a smooth transition to his successor.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 16, 2024 11:36 AM\nSource:[La Nueva](https://www.lanueva.com/nota/2024-9-16-8-36-0-siete-candidatos-comenzo-la-sucesion-de-thomas-bach-en-el-comite-olimpico-internacional)\n\n**Thomas Bach to Step Down as IOC President, Sebastian Coe Emerges as Strong Contender**\nThomas Bach, the current president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has announced that he will step down in 2025 after serving the maximum 12 years in the position. This decision has sparked a debate about who will succeed him, with Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), being a strong contender. Coe has expressed his interest in the position and has the necessary qualifications, but he may face challenges due to the IOC's rules and the opposition from other candidates. The IOC's ethics committee has sent a letter to its 111 members, including the Norwegian representatives, Kristin Kloster Aasen and Astrid Uhrenholdt Jacobsen, outlining the rules for the election and highlighting restrictions that may affect Coe's eligibility. The letter, signed by Ban Ki Moon, the former UN Secretary-General and current chair of the IOC's ethics committee, is seen as a move to undermine Coe's candidacy. The election is expected to take place in January 2025, and the outcome will be determined by the 111 IOC members. The process is likely to be complex and may involve several challenges, including the nomination of candidates, the presentation of their platforms, and the voting process.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: September 15, 2024 08:02 PM\nSource:[NRK](https://www.nrk.no/sport/ioc_-slutt-pa-den-olympiske-fred-1.17042660)\n\n**Who Will Succeed Thomas Bach as IOC President?**\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) will hold an election in March 2025 to choose a new president, as Thomas Bach has announced his resignation. The IOC has released guidelines for potential candidates, which include the requirement that they be an IOC member for the duration of their candidacy. This poses a problem for several high-profile candidates, including Sebastian Coe, the head of World Athletics, who is also an IOC member by virtue of his position. According to a letter from former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, candidates in this situation would need to change their IOC membership status in a separate vote. This is seen as an 'uncomfortable' and 'telling' development, particularly for men like Coe and others who may be affected. The letter is seen as an 'invitation' to women to run for the position.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 13, 2024 03:50 PM\nSource:[FAZ.NET](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/sportpolitik/ioc-praesidentschaft-wer-wird-thomas-bachs-nachfolger-19982855.html)\n\n**Tito Hernández Announces Candidacy for ANPA Presidency with 'Vamos por más' Slogan**\nTito Hernández, a veteran agronomist and former secretary of Agriculture, has announced his candidacy for the presidency of the National Association of Agricultural Professionals (ANPA) with the slogan 'Vamos por más' (Let's go for more).

His team includes Robinson Cuevas as secretary of organization, Manuel Velázquez as secretary of finance, and Julio César Feliz in education, among others.

Activists from the Antifa movement clashed with Portland police in Oregon, while a large crowd of protesters gathered in Chicago, Illinois, chanting slogans like 'Not my president' and 'Free Palestine.' The Chicago Police Department requested additional units to control the crowd and maintain order. Similar protests were held in Philadelphia and New York, with many Americans taking to social media to express their opposition to Trump's win and support for women's reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and gun control laws. According to Portland Police Chief Bob Day, officers are conducting patrols in the area to prevent any further disturbances. He noted that while the situation may seem clear now, the election season is not yet over, with the presidential inauguration scheduled for January 6, 2025.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 07, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[kitabat.com](https://kitabat.com/news/%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A8/)\n\n**US Election 2024: The 'Civil War' Fears Were Not Hysteria**\nThe US authorities had prepared for all possible attacks on the integrity of the electoral system, including extreme violence. Was this just hype? The counting center in Phoenix, Arizona, was a major concern, with a thick metal fence, sharpshooters, and drones securing the area. However, on election night, there were no major incidents or manipulation allegations reported in Arizona or elsewhere. Trump's camp had been particularly aggressive in challenging the 2020 results, and this time they were prepared for all possible objections and threats. Trump had claimed weeks before the election that the vote would be 'stolen', and Republicans filed dozens of lawsuits against alleged irregularities. However, most of these would have likely failed, like in 2020. Trump and his supporters were not trying to win in court, but to discredit the democratic process, sow doubt, and incite anger and violence. Some states also took the opportunity to address real weaknesses in the electoral system, modernizing and speeding up the counting process. As Süddeutsche Zeitung notes, preparing for potential attacks and minimizing the attack surface was a reasonable strategy. 'It was not hysteria, but a justified fear,' said the article, referencing the real-life attacks on election officials in 2020 and the January 6th Capitol storming. 'The fear of riots or even a civil war after a Trump defeat was as real as the physical attacks on election workers four years ago.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 06, 2024 01:57 PM\nSource:[Süddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/us-wahl-2024-gewalt-buergerkrieg-lux.RUWuE753GxVMHegrziCvbN)\n\n**Protests Are Inevitable After the Election**\nSecurity measures are in place around major cities, including the White House, as authorities anticipate potential protests and riots following the election.

Gonzalez notes that the groundwork for civil disorder has already been laid, and that the situation is not just about a few angry protesters, but a larger trend fueled by a radical ideology that seeks to undermine institutions and promote unrest.

According to the Guardian, the US is heading towards an explosive situation. Stephen Marche, author of The Next Civil War, claims that the country is entering a phase of unprecedented political danger. Ray Dalio, a renowned investor, shares this view, describing society as 'on the brink of collapse.' A survey reveals that an increasing number of Americans are anticipating the possibility of an imminent civil war. Jim Rickards, a former CIA advisor, Pentagon, and White House advisor, adds weight to this prophecy. After correctly predicting the 2008 Great Recession, Trump's 2016 election, and the COVID crisis, he is now alarmed by the explosive climate of the 2025 election. Even if Trump wins against Kamala Harris, Congress could use legal maneuvers to prevent him from accessing power. This refusal of peaceful transition would trigger a devastating chain reaction, leading to a market crash, a dollar collapse, and a surge in social tensions. Rickards now exposes the sinister plan of Democrats to keep Trump out of the White House even if he wins the election. Imagine January 6, 2025: Trump wins, but he is prevented from taking office. With all the political uncertainty, the stock market is plummeting, with some stocks crashing by up to 50%. Countries around the world are getting rid of the US dollar like never before... Triggering a historic crash that annihilates the purchasing power of millions of Americans. Political and economic discontent leads to massive riots in the streets... American division has finally reached a breaking point. Thug units begin to organize to support their candidates... If you think this sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory... You should know that a popular member of Congress also predicts a possible civil war in January 2025. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin publicly admitted that Democrats will try to prevent Trump from taking power... When he said: 'It will be us, on January 6, 2025, announcing to the Trump mobs that he is disqualified, and we will then need bodyguards for everyone in a civil war situation.' The stakes couldn't be higher... And all hell breaks loose. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, in a statement without ambiguity, said that strict measures could be considered to counter a Trump victory, and that guards would be needed to protect elected officials from potential insurrection. Rickards urges Americans to prepare, insisting on five essential steps to protect their families in this troubled period. As a former lawyer and economist, he has worked at the highest levels of Wall Street and government, including in geopolitical crisis situations.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 02, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[qactus.fr](https://qactus.fr/2024/11/02/usa-un-conseiller-de-la-cia-met-en-garde-cest-le-debut-de-la-guerre-civile-de-2025/)\n\n**Washington D.C.

The city is expecting large crowds and has taken extensive security measures to prevent any violence. According to Chris Rodriguez, the deputy mayor of Washington, the security measures will be in place from the election day until January 6th and on the day of the inauguration. Pamela Smith, the police chief of Washington, stated that the Metropolitan Police Department and all authorities in D.C. are planning for these events and will not tolerate any violence or destruction of property. She emphasized that they will support the peaceful exercise of constitutional rights, but will take action against those who engage in violence or destruction.

Experts warn of a polarized country bracing for post-election upheaval, with Trump's refusal to accept defeat and claims of electoral fraud being major factors. A recent poll found that nearly two-thirds of Americans think there will be violence after the election, and over a quarter believe a civil war could break out. The situation has inspired some to call for military intervention to quell potential unrest. A declassified report suggests that foreign actors can boost and mobilize incitements for violent demonstrations, making the situation even worse. Security has been increased in Washington, D.C. to prevent a repeat of the 2021 riot, but analysts remain wary. The 2024 election stakes transcend policy debates and partisan politics, speaking to the very essence of America's democratic norms. 'He'll stop at nothing to overturn the election,' says Binghamton University political analyst Donald Nieman. 'If I lose, I'll tell you what, it's possible because they cheat,' Trump said at a rally in Michigan last month. 'That's the only way we're going to lose — because they cheat.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[samaa.tv](https://www.samaa.tv/2087323296-could-a-trump-loss-in-us-election-2024-trigger-civil-unrest)\n\n**DPS conducting riot training ahead of Election Day in case of civil unrest**\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is conducting riot training in preparation for potential civil unrest on Election Day. According to Sgt. Bryan Washko, 'We don't know what will happen, no matter who wins, there's going to be opposition and we hope they are peaceful, but if not we're prepared.' The DPS uses a Civil Disturbance Management Team (CDMT) and 13 Clydesdales to separate protesters from the crowd and make arrests if necessary. Sgt. Washko stated, 'It is an effective tool. It's intimidating to stand by a two thousand-pound horse.' The DPS has been using the horses since 2015 and is looking to buy more to keep up with the state's growing population.

However, according to Jean-Éric Branaa, a professor at the University of Paris II-Assas, there is no real risk of a civil war. 'I've seen people buying ammunition and food in preparation for a possible civil war. I was shocked, so I also bought some, but it's hard to find,' said one American. Another person stated, 'It's going to be ugly. Really ugly. Look at all the riots that happened last time, the buildings burned... this time it will be worse. But if someone is looking for me, I have a family to protect.' Branaa believes that the situation is not as dire as it seems, 'The America has gone through difficult times before or after elections, and even at other moments. Political violence is at its peak, as we've seen with several attempts on Donald Trump's life. I understand that there is anxiety among some people, but it's based on a reality.' He also notes that there are very few 'go-to-war' pro-Trump individuals, 'You'll find them on extreme right groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. In reality, they are very limited. More than 900 people belonging to these neo-fascist groups have been condemned by the American justice system following the Capitol attack.' Branaa also tempers the situation, 'Donald Trump may contest the election results if he loses, but the situation is not the same as it was four years ago. He's no longer the president, he's no longer the figurehead that people can rely on. He's now in opposition, he's just a regular citizen.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 03:25 PM\nSource:[RTL.fr](https://www.rtl.fr/actu/international/presidentielle-americaine-y-a-t-il-un-risque-reel-de-guerre-civile-aux-etats-unis-7900434385)\n\n**Risks of Violence around the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: A Primer**\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is approaching, with Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate. The election is expected to be extremely close, with polls suggesting that a small number of votes in a handful of 'battleground states' could decide the outcome. Trump's actions during the 2020 campaign, including encouraging a mob to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021, have raised concerns about his potential to foment election-related violence. Despite facing federal charges related to the Capitol riot, Trump remains unapologetic, describing January 6 as a 'day of love' and refusing to commit to peacefully concede if Harris wins. President Biden has warned that Trump could again encourage election-related violence, and while some mitigating factors are in place, such as the prosecution of Capitol rioters and legislative reforms, the risk of subversion remains. Trump's lack of incumbency status means he cannot command state powers or use the bully pulpit to foment unrest, but he may still attempt to encourage supporters to sow chaos around vote counting and certification processes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[crisisgroup.org](https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states/united-states/risks-violence-around-2024-us-presidential-election-primer)\n\n**US Presidential Election: Will it be Calm or Chaos?**\nThe 2024 US presidential election is generating as much suspense about the outcome as it is about the aftermath. Will we see a major judicial battle, violent protests in the streets, or a country refusing to tear itself apart further? The answer depends on the ability of the candidates to accept their potential defeat, which is likely to be a close call. However, it's Donald Trump who is causing the most concern. The 78-year-old Republican continues to claim that the only way he could lose is if his opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, rigs the election results. He has refused to say that he would support a peaceful transfer of power and continues to claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, a central element of the federal charges against him for his alleged attempt to overturn the result. 'If he loses, I'm sure he'll cry foul, try to overturn the results, and refuse to attend Harris's inauguration,' predicts Donald Nieman, a politics professor at Binghamton University in New York. Harris, on the other hand, is expected to accept defeat, with 95% of her supporters believing she will do so, but only 48% of Trump's supporters think so, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Two-thirds of Americans fear a violent eruption after the election, according to an Ipsos poll. The two candidates are accusing each other of fueling tensions. Harris has called Trump a 'fascist,' while Trump has directly linked the attempts on his life to Harris's rhetoric, which he says has created a 'bloodbath' in the US. In Washington, authorities have been preparing for the sensitive period from election day to January 20, 2025, when the new president will be inaugurated. Metal barriers are already being erected near the White House, and more will surround the Capitol building. The Capitol Police, where Congress is located, has increased its staff to 2,100 officers, about 300 more than on January 6, 2021, when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the building. The critical day of January 6, 2025, when the election results will be certified, will have the same level of security as the inauguration ceremony. The hundreds of severe convictions handed down to the January 6 rioters may have a deterrent effect. The 2020 election was held on November 3, but the result was not known until November 7. Trump declared himself the winner on election night and immediately began denouncing supposed irregularities, trying to rally his vice president and attorney general to his cause, but in vain. If the Republican candidate were to cry victory prematurely again, 'we have the resources and expertise' to respond, Harris said on Tuesday. And this time, the former president will not be in charge of the federal administration and will not be able to use the courts or the military to exert pressure. In 2020, he filed lawsuits all over the place, but got no favorable judgments, with the judges telling him he should have acted earlier. But the Republicans have learned from this judicial fiasco. They have recruited an army of 100,000 volunteers and thousands of lawyers to monitor the integrity of the election and have filed over 130 lawsuits in at least 26 states. The Democrats have retaliated with around 35 lawsuits, making the 2024 election known as 'the litigation election.' Finally, note that electoral disputes are ultimately resolved by the US Supreme Court, which has been solidly conservative since Trump appointed three justices.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 28, 2024 07:19 AM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/fr/infos/international/lapres-presidentielle-americaine-le-calme-ou-limmense-chaos--2423441.html)\n\n**My January 6 Story – Part II**\nThe author recounts their experience and emotions during the 2020 US presidential election, particularly the events surrounding January 6, 2021.

Here's what to know**\nFormer President Donald Trump suggested using the military to quash 'chaos' on U.S. soil, specifically citing the 'enemy within,' referring to the 'radical left-lunatics.' However, only the president of the United States has control over the military, and President Joe Biden remains the commander-in-chief until January 20, 2025. The National Guard serves both state and federal functions but is largely under the control of state governors. The Insurrection Act, dating back to 1792, outlines three scenarios for authorizing force in cases of civil unrest. The law is meant to be an exception to the principle that the military should not be involved in civilian affairs. Trump has previously suggested using the Insurrection Act to tamp down protests and riots, but was met with pushback from his own administration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2024 06:17 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-forces-used-quash-enemy-181222704.html)\n\n**Risk of US civil unrest highest level since BLM – Verisk Maplecroft**\nAccording to Verisk Maplecroft's Strikes Riots and Civil Commotion (SRCC) predictive model, the risk of civil unrest in the US is at its highest level since the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. The model forecasts a 12-month risk of damaging civil unrest in 198 countries, with the US ranked as the fifth highest risk country in the world. Verisk Maplecroft warned that the US is on a par with the conditions just before the BLM protests, which cost approximately $3bn in insured losses. Public opinion polls suggest that political polarisation has continued to rise in the country, with around three-quarters of supporters of Democratic contender Kamala Harris and four-fifths of Trump supporters profoundly disagreeing with the other side's core values. The report noted that elections are not necessarily good predictors of civil unrest, but the volatile political landscape in the US provides an environment that could spark violent protests and riots. Data from the SRCC predictive model showed that 755 counties are placed in its 'very high or high-risk' categories, with New York topping the list of the 10 highest risk counties. Verisk Maplecroft warned that the potential for local events to turn nationwide is significant, particularly in the event of violence at polling stations or a contested election outcome.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2024 08:55 AM\nSource:[globalreinsurance.com](https://www.globalreinsurance.com/home/risk-of-us-civil-unrest-highest-level-since-blm-verisk-maplecroft/1453276.article)\n\n**White House Concerned About Possibility of Unrest During Upcoming US Presidential Elections**\nThe White House is concerned about the possibility of unrest during the upcoming presidential elections in the United States.

She said, 'It's clear that we're always concerned.' Meanwhile, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev criticized the US administration for hypocrisy, accusing them of interfering in elections while President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine helped Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in her presidential campaign.

According to a report in The Washington Post, the US Congress will convene on January 6, 2025, to certify the results of the presidential election on November 5. Eric Ranaghan, an agent responsible for the US Secret Service's Protective Division, stated that security will be increased on January 6, 2025, to prevent the repetition of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The head of the police force responsible for protecting the US Capitol, J. Thomas Manger, stated that he is working in coordination with the National Guard to determine how to respond to any potential threats. Manger noted that there are 2,200 law enforcement personnel stationed at the Capitol, 250 more than there were four years ago. He emphasized that plans are in place to mobilize thousands of police officers if needed, saying, 'We're better equipped and better trained than we were in 2021. We have a better operation plan.' To prevent bureaucratic delays, Manger has requested that the National Guard be able to respond more quickly. Other measures being taken to counter potential threats include fencing around the Capitol, the deployment of the National Guard, and the assignment of additional police officers to work in the capital. In January 2021, far-right groups and supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building, where a joint session of Congress was being held to certify the results of the presidential election. Five people, including one police officer, were killed in the violence. Trump was later acquitted in the Senate on a charge of inciting a riot.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: September 12, 2024 09:51 AM\nSource:[Cumhuriyet](https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/dunya/baskinin-tekrar-yasanmamasi-icin-abdde-guvenlik-onlemleri-2246792)\n\n**Due to 2021 Capitol riot, Jan. 6, 2025 will be designated as special security event**\nThe Department of Homeland Security has designated January 6, 2025, as a 'national special security event' due to the 2021 Capitol riot.

The partnership will make Lyft's scaled rideshare platform available to all vehicles with Mobileye's self-driving technology. May Mobility will directly deploy autonomous vehicles to the Lyft platform in Atlanta starting in 2025.

This move comes as Tesla gears up to enter the autonomous ride-hailing market, with plans to start an autonomous ride-hail service in Texas and California next year. However, Tesla's vehicles may not all operate as driverless robotaxis initially, as some states demand a safety driver until certain milestones are reached.

While leaving a tip can reduce the difference, the estimated arrival time for Waymo trips was 121% longer than for traditional ride-hailing services. The study concluded that self-driving taxis are not yet a viable option, as they are more expensive and take longer to arrive.

Waymo currently operates fully autonomous rides for the general public in the San Francisco and Phoenix areas, as well as for select members of the public in Los Angeles. The company says it provides more than 100,000 trips each week across those cities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 07:10 PM\nSource:[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/waymo-is-opening-up-driverless-rides-in-austin-heres-everywhere-you-can-hail-the-robotaxi)\n\n**Waymo begins offering robotaxi rides via Uber in Austin**\nWaymo has expanded its fully autonomous ride-hailing service to certain members of the public in Austin, Texas, as part of its ongoing partnership with Uber. The service, which will be available via the Uber app across 37 square miles of the city, marks the second city after Phoenix where Waymo is offering its robotaxis. According to Waymo, the service will initially be available to a select group of users, and it is unclear whether customers who sign up to the waitlist will be charged for initial rides. The company has stated that it usually offers free rides at first. Waymo is also working on a purpose-built autonomous vehicle with Chinese automaker Zeekr and has announced plans to test its 6th-gen Waymo Driver on the Zeekr platform in its Waymo One cities this fall.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2024 04:14 PM\nSource:[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/waymo-begins-offering-robotaxi-rides-via-uber-in-austin)\n\n**Waymo's Self-Driving Taxis Now Available in San Francisco**\nWaymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., has made its self-driving taxis available to the public in San Francisco since June 2024. The service allows users to order a ride through an app and travel to their destination without a human driver. The Waymo taxis, which are electric Jaguar I-PACE models, are equipped with 29 cameras, four LiDAR sensors, and six radar units, providing a 360-degree view of the surroundings. The service has been tested by Trending Topics, who found that the taxis can navigate through the city's streets with ease, but may struggle with stopping at pedestrian crossings. The price of a Waymo ride is currently higher than that of a traditional Uber ride, but is expected to decrease as the service becomes more popular. Waymo has also announced a partnership with Uber, which will allow the two companies to offer autonomous ride-hailing services through the Uber app in Austin and Atlanta starting in 2025. 'The Waymo-Robotaxis have already performed over 100,000 paid rides per week,' according to PCMag UK. 'You can order a Waymo and it will arrive within a few minutes,' said a spokesperson for Waymo. 'Just don't touch the steering wheel.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 25, 2024 09:16 AM\nSource:[Trending Topics](https://www.trendingtopics.eu/waymo-autonome-autos-sind-in-san-francisco-ganz-normal)\n\n**Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and Atlanta**\nUber is expanding its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, beginning in early 2025. This expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, particularly ahead of Tesla's planned robotaxi event. Uber riders in Austin and Atlanta can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips through the Uber app. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, 'We've been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can't wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.' Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi added, 'We're thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix.'

Waymo, a self-driving startup, continues to be the leader in the field, with its sixth-generation system featuring a more cost-effective sensor setup and enhanced resolution. The system allows for swapping out sensing components to adapt to specific environmental conditions. Waymo has started testing robotaxi services on highways in San Francisco and has expanded its operations to include Dallas and Houston. However, US regulators are investigating Waymo incidents related to potential for crash and property damage. GM's Cruise Automation has also resumed operations in the US, but has faced setbacks, including a pedestrian accident in 2023. Tesla continues to develop its automated driving assist system, but has delayed the reveal of its robotaxi to October 2024. Despite challenges, investment and expansion in 2024 are encouraging in the US market, with sales of autonomous vehicles forecasted to reach 230,000 units in 2034.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 09, 2024 01:07 PM\nSource:[S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/self-driving-cars-gain-momentum-in-us.html)\n\n*Generated by AI at [AskNews](https://asknews.app), check out the [API](https://docs.asknews.app) for more information*."
