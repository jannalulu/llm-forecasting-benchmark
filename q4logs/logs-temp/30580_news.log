**No. 1 Tesla Rival Prepares For Sharper Price War; EV Sales Due**
Tesla's Chinese rival BYD is expected to report a record 520,000 EV sales for November, up 72% from last year, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Wang Bin. BYD is likely to top 4 million sales for 2024, including hybrids. The company is set to launch its next-gen Blade battery in 2025, which will last longer and improve vehicle driving range. Meanwhile, Li Auto, Nio, XPeng, and Zeekr are also due to release their November EV sales, following a robust October for China EV sales. BYD's huge size and massive in-house operations give it strong leverage over suppliers, and the company has avoided new incentives in recent months amid strong orders. However, Li Auto and Tesla have announced recent China discounts and other incentives. The China EV price war is expected to continue in 2025, with BYD signaling a brutal two-year price war won't let up.

**Tesla Stock Finished Black Friday on a High Note**
Tesla's stock finished Black Friday up 3.7%, leaving it nearly 40% ahead for the year, with a market capitalization of around $1.07 trillion. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives maintained an outperform rating and a $400 target price on the stock, citing the incoming Trump administration's potential to clear the way for Tesla's self-driving car and artificial intelligence aspirations. Ives believes a formal federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles would be a significant tailwind for Tesla, potentially worth $1 trillion to its market value, and predicts the stock could reach $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in value over the next 12 to 18 months. 'The next step the Street awaits is a formal federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles as one of the Transportation Department's first key priorities,' Ives wrote. 'This would be a huge step forward in easing US rules for self-driving cars and be a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025.'

**Tesla China Shortens Payment Cycle To 90 Days In 2024: Report - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)**
Tesla China has shortened its payment cycle to 90 days for supply chain partners in 2024, down from 100 days in 2023, according to Grace Tao, Tesla's vice president of External Affairs. This improvement is part of Tesla's efforts to streamline operations and enhance supplier relationships. Meanwhile, Tesla has revamped its referral program across North America, offering enhanced discounts and rewards, including specific incentives for the Cybertruck. The company has also started offering unlimited overnight charging via the Tesla Electric service, down from $15 a month, and is offering discounts of up to $4,000 on select Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to boost fourth-quarter deliveries. Despite these efforts, analysts predict that Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries will set new records but may not prevent a yearly sales decline, due to the potential removal of the $7,500 EV tax credit by the incoming Trump administration, as warned by Gary Black. Tesla shares are trading higher by 2.51% to $341.18 at publication Friday.

**Tesla Sets New Quarterly Delivery Record, Expects 20-30% Increase in 2025**
Tesla has officially announced that the company delivered 463,000 electric vehicles worldwide in the third quarter of 2024, setting a new quarterly delivery record. In China, the Model Y was the best-selling model from January to September. In Europe, the Model Y was the best-selling car in September. In Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland, the Model Y was the best-selling car of the year. In the US, the Model Y, Model 3, and Cybertruck were among the top three best-selling electric vehicles in the third quarter. Elon Musk said, 'We expect Tesla's electric vehicle deliveries to increase by 20-30% in 2025. We believe that clean electric vehicles are the best choice for consumers.' Additionally, Tesla rolled out its 7 millionth vehicle worldwide on October 22 and its 1 millionth Model Y from the Fremont factory on October 27.

**Tesla Shares Surge on Delivery Forecast. Is It Time to Buy the Stock?**
Tesla's stock surged after its third-quarter earnings report, with shares recouping negative returns from the first half of 2024. Deliveries increased by 6% in Q3, with Model 3/Y deliveries rising 5% to 43,668 vehicles and other models seeing a 43% spike to 22,915 vehicles. Total vehicle production climbed 9% to 469,796. Tesla's automotive revenue edged up 2% to $20 billion, driven by a 33% surge in automobile regulatory credit revenue. The company's overall gross margins jumped 195 basis points to 19.8%. Looking ahead, CEO Elon Musk said his 'best guess' is that the company would increase deliveries by 20% to 30% next year, powered by more affordable models starting in the first half of 2025. However, Musk did not provide details on these models. 'Preparations are being made to begin launching them,' he said. 'We're very optimistic about 2025,' Musk added. 'We think we can deliver a lot more vehicles than we did this year.'

**Tesla Sees Modest Delivery Growth in 2024, Exceeds Profit Margin Expectations**
Tesla announced a modest increase in vehicle deliveries for 2024, despite economic challenges and a decline in investments in electric vehicles (EVs) by other companies. The company's third-quarter results showed a record number of vehicle deliveries and the second-highest regulatory credit revenue. Excluding credits, Tesla's profit margin on vehicle sales increased to 17.05%, surpassing the 14.9% margin expected by analysts. The company also noted a significant decrease in the cost of goods sold per vehicle, with a total of $35,100, the lowest level in history. The decline in the prices of materials used in EV batteries was cited as a contributing factor to the reduced costs, but it was also noted that the benefits of these savings would gradually decrease. Despite a 2% decline in the stock price during the regular trading session, the after-hours surge added approximately $50 billion to Tesla's market value. Tesla previously announced in October that deliveries in September had increased by more than 6% compared to the previous year, indicating a recovery after the decline in the first half of the year. Last year, Tesla had implemented strategic price cuts that led to a sharp decline in profit margins. However, this year the company has focused on offering more favorable financing options and discounts, which analysts believe will help stabilize margins in the future. Additionally, Tesla has recently introduced new products such as the Cybercab robotaxi and a 20-person autonomous minibus, as part of its efforts to advance autonomous driving technology. The company's third-quarter revenue was $25.18 billion, slightly below the $25.37 billion predicted by LSEG, but an increase from the $23.35 billion in the same period of 2023. The adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was 72 cents, exceeding the 58 cent consensus estimate. The company's general profit margin for the July-September quarter was 19.8%, surpassing the 17.3% estimate by LSEG analysts and exceeding the 18% margin in the second quarter. 'We are committed to expanding our product lineup, reducing costs, and investing in artificial intelligence (AI) projects and production capacity,' said Tesla. 'Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results.'

**Tesla Exceeds Expectations, Projects Slight Growth in Deliveries for 2024**
Tesla exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates for the third quarter and projected a slight increase in deliveries for the current year, reflecting a surge in demand for its electric vehicles. The company reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share for the quarter, above the average analyst estimate. Tesla reiterated its plans to start producing more affordable models in the first half of 2025 and said it expects a 50% growth next year compared to its 2023 production volumes. Tesla's shares rose 9.9% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, after closing regular trading down 14% for the year. 'Despite current macroeconomic conditions, we expect a slight growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024,' Tesla said in a statement. The company said it expects another solid quarter in terms of deliveries after a record third quarter, and said it anticipates higher volumes for the full year. However, it will not be easy, given the slowdown in deliveries Tesla recorded in the first half of the year, and the automaker will need to significantly increase sales in the fourth quarter to surpass or match 2023 sales. Tesla's Cybertruck, which was first delivered at the end of last year, achieved profitability for the first time, thanks in part to increases in production of the futuristic pickup truck. The company's automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, was 17.1% in the third quarter, a significant increase from the previous quarter, when it was 14.6%.

**Tesla (TSLA) predicts a record Q4, stock jumps 8%**
Tesla (TSLA) has predicted a record fourth quarter, with a 6% increase in deliveries year-over-year and an 11% increase quarter-to-quarter, according to its Q3 2024 financial results. The automaker's stock jumped 8% in aftermarket trading, not due to higher-than-expected profits, but because Tesla released guidance for Q4, which is rare. The company expects to deliver 515,000 vehicles in Q4, which would be a significant increase from the previous quarter. As reported earlier this week, Tesla is already offering deep discounts to boost sales early in the quarter. 'Considering we know how many vehicles deployed last year and how many it did so far this, we know exactly how many vehicles it needs to deliver in Q4 to still manage to achieve growth in 2024,' said Tesla, in a statement.

**Tesla Q3 2024 Earnings: Will Results Exceed Expectations?**
Investors are awaiting Tesla's third-quarter 2024 report, which is expected to be released after market close. The company delivered 462,890 vehicles, a 6.4% increase from last year. Although this number is below Wall Street's expectations, it marks the first annual increase in deliveries in 2024, following two quarters of decline. Analysts predict revenues of $25.4 billion, an 8% increase from last year, with earnings per share estimated at $0.59. Tesla's deliveries have increased due to incentives and new models, with China remaining a key driver, supported by subsidies, and the US seeing a boost from the Cybertruck and favorable financing options. However, supply chain pressures and declining energy storage sales are hindering the company's goal of 50% growth. Additionally, a lack of charging stations and declining resale values may deter some buyers, as the electric vehicle market appears to be plateauing with decreasing demand.

**Tesla Goes All-In On Q4 Vehicle Deliveries With Latest Round Of Incentives**
Tesla has increased U.S. inventory discounts by up to $4,000 on certain Model Y and Model 3 vehicles and is now offering 0% financing for up to 60 months on these models without requiring the purchase of full self-driving. The company aims to deliver 1.8 million vehicles globally in 2024, which would require a record-breaking fourth quarter. Analysts predict Q4 deliveries to reach 487,000, with a total of 1.78 million deliveries in 2024. Despite this, Tesla's stock has dropped 0.7% to $217.23 on Tuesday, following a 0.8% decline on Monday. The company reports third-quarter earnings and revenue after the market close on Wednesday.

**Electric shock as Tesla faces its first fall in annual car deliveries**
Tesla reported a 6% increase in quarterly electric car sales, selling almost 463,000 vehicles in the three months to the end of September. This was a 'mini step in the right direction' according to analysts at Wedbush Securities, but they noted that 'more heavy lifting is clearly ahead' as Tesla faces challenges in reaching its 1.8 million sales target for 2024. Despite the rise, shares fell around 3.8% in early trading, and the company will need a record fourth quarter to avoid its first annual fall in deliveries.

**Tesla's Quarterly Sales Increase, But Fall Short of Analysts' Expectations**
Tesla Inc. reported a 6.4% increase in quarterly vehicle sales this year, but fell short of analysts' expectations. The company delivered 462,890 vehicles to customers in the last three months, a slight improvement from the same period last year. However, the sales did not meet the 463,900 units predicted by analysts. 'We will see some pressure on the stock today, as investor expectations diverge from delivery numbers,' wrote Daniel Ives, Wedbush analyst, in a report. Tesla's stock price dropped 6.4% to $10:30 a.m. in New York. The company received a boost during the quarter due to China's doubling of an incentive for consumers to trade in old cars for electric models, which fueled demand in the world's largest electric vehicle market. This optimism was also fueled by the upcoming event on October 10 near Los Angeles, where Elon Musk will present prototypes of self-driving vehicles. 'It will be a historic event,' Musk wrote on X last week. Tesla's stock has had a tumultuous 2024, recovering from a decline of over 40% in mid-April, largely due to the anticipation of Musk's long-promised robotaxis. The company started the year warning that it might expand at a notably slower pace until it begins producing cheaper models in the first half of 2025. Tesla needs a strong performance in the coming months to grow in 2024, as deliveries fell more than 2% in the first nine months of the year.

**Tesla posts quarterly increase in deliveries, but falls short of expectations**
Tesla's quarterly vehicle deliveries rose by 6.4% to 462,890 vehicles, according to the company's third-quarter delivery numbers. While this increase is a welcome sign for the company, investors were underwhelmed as the results were more or less in line with analysts' expectations. Tesla sales fell early in 2024 due to increased competition in the electric vehicle market, but a Chinese government incentive program helped boost sales this quarter. Analyst Dan Ives described the deliveries as 'good and a step in the right direction,' but cautioned that there would be pressure on the company's stock due to investors' high expectations. Ives stated, 'Overall, this is a clear improvement from the first half and we believe getting in the range of 1.8 million for the year is still the key and important bogey.'

**Tesla Missed Its Quarterly Delivery Target Again**
Tesla has missed its quarterly delivery target for the third time this year, handing over 462,890 vehicles in Q3 2024, a 6.4% increase from July to September, but short of analysts' estimates of 470,000 vehicles. The company's sales are at risk of declining for the first time in its history, as more competition emerges in China and Europe. To maintain its 2023 delivery level, Tesla would need to deliver a record-breaking 516,344 vehicles in the fourth quarter, which seems unlikely. The majority of Q3 deliveries were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers, with 443,668 units built and 439,975 delivered. Tesla will release its full Q3 financial report on October 23, and the company's Robotaxi reveal on October 10 could be a crucial turning point for the company's success.

**Tesla Fails to Meet Expectations with Third Quarter Delivery Data**
Tesla released its vehicle production and delivery data for the third quarter of 2024. According to the data, the company produced 469,796 vehicles in the third quarter of 2024, up from 430,488 in the same period last year. The number of vehicles delivered by Tesla in the third quarter of 2024 also increased by 6.4% year-over-year to 462,890. However, this fell short of market expectations of 463,310 deliveries. Tesla's stock price declined by more than 3% after the disappointing delivery data. 'The company's inability to meet expectations is a concern for investors,' said an analyst. 'Tesla's growth has been slowing down, and this data suggests that the company is facing challenges in meeting its production targets.'

**Tesla Misses Delivery Expectations in Q3 Amid Increased Competition**
Tesla fell short of delivery expectations in the third quarter due to increased competition, causing its stock to drop in New York. The electric vehicle manufacturer delivered 462,890 vehicles in the three months leading up to September 30, a 6.4% increase from the previous quarter. However, analysts predicted that the company, led by Elon Musk, would deliver 469,828 vehicles during the period. Tesla's stock lost 4.95% of its value at 2:40 PM GMT. To meet its annual delivery target of 1.81 million units in 2023, Tesla must deliver a record 516,344 vehicles in the fourth quarter. If this target is not met, the company will experience its first annual decline in deliveries. Tesla faces increased competition in the US, reduced European subsidies, and slowing consumer spending in China, the world's largest car market, where local players are rapidly growing.

**Tesla Surpasses Wall Street Expectations with Increased Vehicle Deliveries**
Tesla exceeded Wall Street's expectations for vehicle deliveries between June and September, partly due to the increased popularity of the Cybertruck. The company delivered 439,975 compact Model 3 and SUV Model Y vehicles between April and June, surpassing the 436,000 expected by analysts, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. This represents an improvement compared to the previous year, when Tesla delivered 435,059 vehicles. Tesla also delivered 22,915 electric vehicles more than expected, a 43% increase year-over-year. Although the company does not provide a breakdown of those deliveries, they include the SUV crossover Model X, the sedan Model S, and the Cybertruck, a electric pickup truck launched by Tesla in November last year that recently became the best-selling vehicle over $100,000. In total, Tesla delivered 462,890 electric vehicles to customers in the last quarter, a 6% increase compared to the 435,059 units delivered in the third quarter of 2023. Wall Street expected deliveries of around 462,000 units, according to FactSet estimates. The company also manufactured 443,668 units of the Model Y and Model 3, as well as 26,128 units of all other models. This totals 469,796 units, compared to the 435,059 units manufactured in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in sales comes after Tesla introduced a series of incentives in China in the midst of growing competition, declining spending, and economic growth. This has included interest-free loans of up to five years and discounts on paint selections. Sales also benefited from Beijing's initiative to provide subsidies for electric vehicles and the Model Y approved for government purchases. Tesla will hold its third-quarter earnings conference call on October 16, just under a week after the highly anticipated presentation of the robotaxi event, which was delayed after CEO Elon Musk demanded 'a significant design change'.

**Tesla Analysts Expect 6.5% Increase in Electric Vehicle Deliveries for Q3**
Analysts expect Tesla to report a 6.5% increase in electric vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, with a total of 463,310 vehicles delivered, including 435,900 Model 3 and Model Y units. This would be a significant improvement from the 430,488 vehicles produced and 435,059 delivered in the same quarter last year. According to Wells Fargo analysts, Tesla is expected to deliver 1.63 million vehicles for the year, with 440,000 units delivered in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs analysts believe that Tesla's position on the Chinese market is still strong enough to increase sales. 'The return to positive dynamics should have a positive impact on investor sentiment,' said analysts. 'Tesla's results for the whole year are not yet predicted, but the company has previously stated that it expects to deliver fewer vehicles this year than in previous years.'
