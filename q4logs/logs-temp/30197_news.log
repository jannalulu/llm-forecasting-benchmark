**Northvolt reportedly exploring US bankruptcy protection**
Swedish battery maker Northvolt is reportedly considering US bankruptcy protection as a strategy to address its financial challenges, according to a report by Reuters. The company, which has secured approximately €10bn in funding since its inception in 2016, is focusing on survival by reducing its operations due to production issues, the loss of a key customer, and difficulties in securing additional funding. Northvolt spokesperson said, 'Since the beginning of the strategic review, we have constantly been discussing different options and that hasn't changed throughout the process.' Despite recent difficulties, the company is close to securing a financing package exceeding $300m to strengthen its financial stability. However, the company's subsidiary, Northvolt Ett Expansion AB, filed for bankruptcy in October 2024 following a restructuring effort.

**Spirit Airlines Files for Bankruptcy Amid Financial Restructuring**
Spirit Airlines, a low-cost airline operating routes between Colombia and several US cities, has filed for bankruptcy as part of a financial restructuring process, according to the company's official website. Despite this, operations, including reservations and ticket sales, continue normally. The airline has reached a voluntary agreement with a majority of its bondholders to reduce its debt and gain financial flexibility, aiming to strengthen its position in the low-cost flight market and ensure long-term sustainability. Spirit plans to sell 23 Airbus A320ceo and A321ceo aircraft to GA Telesis for approximately $519 million, with deliveries expected between October 2024 and February 2025. The airline also plans to reduce its annual costs by $80 million, including a reduction in staff to adjust to next year's flight projections. Spirit's financial crisis began in January 2024, following the collapse of a $6.6 billion acquisition deal with JetBlue due to US Department of Justice objections under antitrust laws. The airline faces a debt of over $1 billion, with refinancing postponed until the end of December this year. Spirit operates several routes between Colombia and US cities like Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, so travelers flying with this airline should be aware of any changes to their itinerary, although the company has not announced that they will be affected.

**Debts with the Tax Authority: Which Ones Will Be Canceled in 2025?**
Debts with the tax authority will be canceled after a certain period of time. The period varies depending on the type of outstanding charge. For example, for debts related to the payment of IRPEF, IVA, IRES, Irap, or stamp duty, the cancellation occurs after 10 years. However, in this period, sanctions and interest are also calculated on the debt. For these, the cancellation occurs after 5 years. Many debts in 2025 will be canceled automatically due to the reform of the cancellation period. Specifically, debts considered uncollectible after 5 years due to the debtor's death, company bankruptcy, or debtor's nullity will be canceled automatically. For other debts, it is necessary to send a self-help request after receiving a payment reminder. As of January 1, 2025, the following debts will be canceled: tax notices issued from January 1, 2020, for local taxes; tax and duty notices issued from January 1, 2015; and car toll notices that expired before January 1, 2022. Additionally, from January 1, 2025, no more sanctions and interest will be applied to debts prior to 2021, but the debt itself must still be paid.

The company's service division, which was previously thought to be safe, has also been affected. Johan Zachrisson, a union representative, said, 'It's chockartat (shocking).

The company's financial struggles have been ongoing, and the employees were not given any warning about the bankruptcy. The union is planning to provide more information to the employees, including details about their a-kassa (unemployment benefits).

**TGI Fridays Files for Bankruptcy Protection**
TGI Fridays, a chain of casual dining restaurants, has filed for bankruptcy protection in a Texas federal court. The company, based in Dallas, cited the COVID-19 pandemic and its capital structure as the main drivers of its financial challenges. According to CEO Rohit Manocha, 'the principal driver of our financial challenges resulted from the covid-19 and our capital structure.' The chain has faced broader challenges in recent years, as customers opt for takeout or visit upscale fast-food chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack. TGI Fridays' popularity peaked in 2008 with 601 locations in the US and a $2 billion business, but its sales in the US dropped to $728 million in 2023, a 15% decrease from the previous year. The company now operates 163 locations in the US, down from 269 last year, and has closed 36 locations in January and dozens more last week.

**STJ Clarifies Application of New Bankruptcy Law to Old Cases**
The Brazilian Supreme Court (STJ) has clarified the application of the new bankruptcy law (Lei 14.112/2020) to cases of bankruptcy declared before its entry into force. The law introduced a three-year deadline for late creditors to file their claims, but there was uncertainty about how this deadline would apply to bankruptcies declared before the law's implementation. The STJ recently ruled that the new law should be applied to avoid immediately eliminating the right of creditors to file previously acquired debts. As a result, the starting point for the three-year deadline is now January 23, 2021, allowing creditors to file claims that were previously pending. This decision has significant implications for the administration of old bankruptcies, providing a window for creditors with acquired rights under the previous regime to exercise their rights. The STJ's position avoids the immediate extinguishment of acquired rights under the previous legislation. The benefits of this decision include the protection of acquired rights, legal certainty, and the increase in the efficiency of the bankruptcy process.
