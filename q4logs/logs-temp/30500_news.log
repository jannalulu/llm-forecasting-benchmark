**Storms, snow threaten chaos for Thanksgiving holiday travelers: Live updates**
A storm is expected to bring snow and rain to millions of Americans traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday, causing potential disruptions to flights and road travel. Denver may see only a couple inches of snow, but it could delay flights and slow travel. The storm is expected to move east, impacting the Appalachians and potentially causing significant disruptions for tens of millions of travelers. Cold temperatures will also add to the travel woes, with 196 million Americans waking up to below-freezing temperatures by Saturday morning. According to AAA, 79.9 million people will travel 50 miles or more from their homes for Thanksgiving, a 1.7 million increase over last year. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18.3 million people from Tuesday through Dec. 2, its busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record. 'Track and intensity (will be) the keys to where the rain and snow line will set up and the amount of snow that will fall in the Midwest and Northeast,' said AccuWeather Meteorologist Bernie Rayno. 'We anticipate that trend to continue,' said TSA Administrator David Pekoske, referring to the 10 busiest travel days in the TSA's history all occurring in 2024.

**What a weak La Niña could mean for Connecticut’s winter weather**
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its forecast for La Niña this winter, predicting a weak and short-lived event. According to NOAA, there is a 57% chance of La Niña emerging in October-December 2024 and persisting through January-March 2025. A weak La Niña is expected to have a minimal impact on weather conditions this winter. However, previous research suggests that weak La Niña events are often associated with snowier winters in the Northeast, particularly in northern New England and portions of New York. A close inspection of Connecticut on the map from NOAA shows most of the state has seen more snowfall than average during weak La Niña events. Additionally, weak La Niña events tend to keep temperatures near normal for Connecticut. However, many other factors influence a long-range forecast, and a forecast based solely on typical weather seen during weak La Niña events contradicts the consensus of most forecasts, which are calling for less snowfall than average and warmer temperatures than average for this winter.

**Colorado mountain snow expected to interfere with Thanksgiving travel this week**
A winter storm system is expected to bring heavy mountain snow to Colorado, impacting travel during Thanksgiving week. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for the high country, with significant travel impacts expected. The storm will bring 10-20 inches of snow to the mountains, with the heaviest snowfall occurring Tuesday. Rain will switch to snow in the Denver metro area on Tuesday night, with only a trace amount of snow expected. The Colorado Department of Transportation warns drivers about increased DUI enforcement during the holiday rush, and advises travelers to check their tires before leaving. The best travel times for motorists are before 1 p.m. on Sunday and before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on Monday. Denver International Airport anticipates more than 844,000 passengers during the travel period, with the busiest days expected to be Nov. 22, Nov. 30, and Dec. 1. Officials recommend getting to the airport two hours before boarding time, especially during peak times.

**New winter forecast shows chances of rain, snow for Tennessee, other states**
A new winter forecast from the Climate Prediction Center shows that La Niña is favored to take hold over the next month and strengthen as we head into winter. This could lead to drought conditions in the southern states, but bring in lots of moisture to the Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley. The updated winter outlook shows the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes region, and Ohio Valley leaning toward seeing a wetter-than-average winter. Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming have the highest chance of above-average rain or snow, but other states such as Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, and Ohio are also leaning that way. However, it's hard to say whether the precipitation will come down as rain or snow, as it depends on how cold it is when the storms move in. Additionally, this year's La Niña is expected to be weak and short, which can change its impact on snowfall. Meteorologist Alex Libby notes that Tennessee receives less snow than average during weak La Niña winters, but his analysis of data from the Nashville International Airport shows above-average snowfall in the majority of weak La Niña winters. Meanwhile, much of the country is favored to be warm this year, with the Southwest and Gulf states having a 50% to 60% chance of above-average winter temperatures.

**Winter 2024: Countries to be Covered by Snow and Reach Freezing Temperatures**
The National Center for Atmospheric Prediction (CPC) expects a 60% chance of a phenomenon called 'nina' to occur in the United States from December 2024 to February 2025, which can cause significant temperature fluctuations and precipitation in the upper Mississippi River Valley. The CPC also predicts that the phenomenon of 'nina' will continue until March 2025, making it more likely for the world to experience colder temperatures than usual. The CPC notes that the shift from the 'nino' phenomenon to the 'nina' phenomenon will bring changes to the global climate, with some regions experiencing more variability than others. In the United States, 17 states have been issued winter weather warnings, with parts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and South Dakota expected to experience cold temperatures. Heavy snowfall is expected in the Oregon Cascades, with up to 2 feet of snow, and 15-18 inches of snow in the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming and the Colorado Mountains. Temperatures are expected to drop below freezing in areas affected by freeze warnings, with temperatures reaching as low as 21°F in parts of New Mexico and 22-23°F in parts of Colorado.
