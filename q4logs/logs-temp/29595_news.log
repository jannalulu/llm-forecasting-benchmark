**Nvidia Surpasses Apple in Market Capitalization, Awaits Quarterly Results**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple in market capitalization, becoming the largest listed company before releasing its quarterly results. 13 investment banks expect its capitalization to exceed $4 billion, with some even predicting a price target of $200 per share, which would put its market value at over $4.9 billion. Nvidia is set to join the Dow Jones index on November 8, replacing Intel, and its stock has risen over 100% (180% in total) compared to Intel's decline of over 50%. The company's quarterly results will be released on November 20, and experts expect it to report net profits of $17.495 billion, the highest in its history, and an 89% increase from the same period last year. JP Morgan analysts predict a significant increase in the company's stock price, driven by strong demand for PC games and data centers, as well as growth in the automotive and enterprise segments. For 2024, they expect net profits to reach $68.616 billion, a 144% increase from the previous year, and predict that the company will exceed $100 billion in profits in just two years, making it one of the top five companies in the world by 2026. 'We expect Nvidia to continue delivering good results across all segments, with solid demand for PC games driving revenue growth, compensating for the decline in original equipment manufacturers. We also expect the data center segment to grow strongly as hyperscale clients continue to adopt accelerated learning by GPU for processing large datasets,' said JP Morgan analysts.

**NVIDIA Stock Soars to All-Time Highs Driven by AI Boom and Strong Q3 Earnings**
NVIDIA's stock price has reached an all-time high of $140.52, driven by the AI boom and strong Q3 2024 earnings. The company reported a quarterly revenue of $30 billion, a 122% year-over-year increase, and earnings per share of $0.68, surpassing analyst estimates. NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment generated $26.3 billion in revenue, a 154% year-over-year jump. Analysts are optimistic about NVIDIA's future, with some projecting $272 billion in AI computing revenues by 2030. However, concerns about customer concentration and emerging competition from AMD and Intel exist. Despite these challenges, NVIDIA maintains a competitive advantage through its CUDA software platform.

**Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Before Nov. 20?**
Nvidia shareholders have had a great year, with the stock soaring over 180%. The company is expected to announce its fiscal year 2025 third-quarter results on Nov. 20. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran notes that Nvidia has consistently beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates, with one possible reason being the growing demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). CFO Colette Kress said that demand for Hopper GPUs will continue to grow in the second half of the year. Analysts expect Q3 revenue of $32.9 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.74 per share, but Nvidia projects Q3 revenue of $32.5 billion, which is lower than expected. Damodaran thinks that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has accelerated more quickly than Wall Street projected, and that the company may be able to top Wall Street's estimates again. 'The demand for Nvidia's GPUs unequivocally has accelerated more quickly than Wall Street projected in the past because analysts have said so themselves,' Damodaran said. 'I think Damodaran's second scenario is more compelling,' said the article, 'Nvidia might have enough wiggle room with accounting rules to sometimes manage an earnings beat. However, such manipulation wouldn't realistically enable the company to exceed expectations consistently for nearly every quarter over five years.'

**Nvidia Surpasses Apple to Become World's Most Valuable Company**
Nvidia has surpassed Apple to become the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.53 trillion. The company's stock price has reached a new high of $144.13 per share, a 2% increase from the previous day. Nvidia's success is attributed to the growing demand for artificial intelligence, which has led to a rally in technology stocks. Bank of America has raised its price target for Nvidia to $190 per share, citing the company's leadership in the AI market and its potential for significant growth. The analysts at Bank of America estimate that Nvidia's AI-related revenue could reach $272 billion in 2030, and that the company's valuation is 'convincent' compared to other tech giants. Nvidia will present its third-quarter earnings in the coming weeks, which will be closely watched by investors after the company's previous earnings disappointment. According to a Bloomberg survey, 45% of respondents believe that Nvidia's earnings will drive the stock price up, even after the significant gains it has made due to AI demand. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has described the demand for the company's new Blackwell chip as 'crazy', and analysts expect the chip to generate $10 billion in additional revenue before the end of the year.

**One Company Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia Next Year, Analysts**
Analysts predict that Microsoft will surpass Nvidia as the most valuable S&P 500 company within the next 12 months, with an estimated value of $3.7 trillion.

Nvidia's earnings are expected to grow by 294% in 2024 and 119% in 2025, but analysts are not putting big price targets on the stock.

**Prediction: Nvidia Stock Could Hit $200 in 2025**
Nvidia's stock has seen volatility since July, but its solid fiscal 2025 second-quarter results and bullish guidance suggest its growth is here to stay. Analysts expect the stock to regain its mojo, with a median 12-month price target of $150 and a Street-high price target of $200. Constellation Research points out that Nvidia's dominance in AI chips, high barriers to entry, and robust product roadmap make it a leader in the market, with a technology lead of 24 months over its rivals. Nvidia's recent quarterly results show it is the go-to supplier of graphics cards for companies and governments, with revenue up 122% year over year to $30 billion. CEO Jensen Huang noted that demand for the company's graphics cards remains solid, with shipments expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. With its outstanding moat in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market and healthy pricing power, Nvidia is likely to maintain its dominant position in the AI chip market. As a result, the company's adjusted earnings jumped 152% year over year to $0.68 per share, prompting analysts to increase their earnings projections. The stock could exceed $200 in 2025, with earnings potentially hitting $4 per share and the stock price jumping to $220.

**NVIDIA Is Still Poised for Greatness**
NVIDIA is a compelling investment opportunity despite its large market capitalization of $2.9 trillion. The company's projected earnings of $4.50 per share in 2025 make it a good value at a price of $120 per share, with a valuation of 25 times next year's earnings. This is on the lower end of the 30-35x forward earnings multiple band observed among large tech companies, suggesting potential upside. The investment strategy involves initiating a core holding in NVIDIA and adjusting based on market trends and performance. While acknowledging potential risks, such as reduced capital expenditures from major customers, the company's position in the current market cycle and ongoing demand for its products justify its inclusion. The anticipated Blackwell cycle with strong growth rates is expected to allow NVIDIA to perform well over the next year, making it a valuable asset in a diversified investment portfolio.

The New York stock exchange closed on Wednesday, September 11, with gains, thanks to the surge in Nvidia and related stocks, which helped to offset the losses recorded after the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Dow Jones index closed up 0.31%, at 40,861.71 points. The S&P 500 rose 1.07%, closing at 5,554.13 points, and the Nasdaq marked a gain of 2.17%, at 17,395.53 points. Initially, the opening of the New York stock exchange was negative, with declines of over 1%, following the August CPI, which indicated that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would not have space to initiate its monetary easing cycle more aggressively next week. However, investors returned to buying, mainly in search of technology stocks. Nvidia stood out, with gains of 8.80%, while Amazon rose 2.77% and Microsoft advanced 2.13%. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, said at a Goldman Sachs event that there is high demand for the company's new semiconductors, exceeding what the company has been able to deliver. Investors are also analyzing rumors that the US may allow the negotiation of chips with Saudi Arabia, according to sources revealed to Semafor. John Higgins, chief economist at Capital Economics, projects that the S&P 500 may surge around 500 points in the remaining months of 2024 and that a possible bubble in the technology sector has not burst. Higgins wrote, 'So far, there is not much evidence that AI adoption profits are waning,' highlighting Nvidia's latest earnings report. 'It's true that there has been a lot of talk about Nvidia having a perfect pricing. But the fact is that the company has continued to exceed analysts' expectations for revenue and earnings per share.'

**Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now? | The Motley Fool**
Nvidia's stock has dropped 22% from its June 2024 high, partly due to concerns that the AI bull market may be over. Despite this, analysts estimate Nvidia will earn $2.84 per share this year and $4 per share next year, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26. However, there are risks to consider, such as Nvidia's revenue being propped up by a few large customers, and the potential for pricing pressure as the AI market evolves. Analysts have noted that traffic to ChatGPT has dropped in recent months, and Amazon's management has stated that its AI customers want better value. Nvidia's gross margins are currently in the mid-70s, but this could revert to long-term averages, which would be disastrous for investors. As such, long-term investors should consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to accumulate shares slowly, and be aware of the potential risks and volatility of the stock.

**Could Nvidia Stock Double in the Next Year?**
Nvidia's stock has risen significantly in the past two years, with a 240% increase in 2023 and a 108% increase so far in 2024. The company's success is tied to the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) computing, and its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand. However, for Nvidia's stock to double, the company would need to be worth $5.2 trillion, which is a tall task in just a year. Analysts have already baked in 33% earnings growth into the stock, and the current valuation metrics are expensive, with a price tag of 50 times trailing earnings and 37 times forward earnings. While Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) rose 168% in Q2, it will face tough comparisons in the coming quarters. One analyst projects EPS of $5.45 for fiscal 2028, which is still short of the required $7.08 for the stock to double. Nvidia's growth trajectory suggests it will reach this mark around fiscal 2029, about four and a half years away. While a double in a year is unlikely, Nvidia's performance could still beat the broader market, which tends to double about every seven years.
