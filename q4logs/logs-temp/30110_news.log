**Bitcoin Forecast: Is the Rally Losing its Steam?**
Bitcoin's rally may be losing steam as it approaches the 100k target, which has been widely set by analysts and investors. The current trajectory has surpassed expectations, especially after the US elections in November, but caution arises around possible reversal volatility near 100k. Market trends are closely tied to expectations for Trump's policy agenda, with momentum likely to recharge through the Christmas holidays and into early 2025. Technical analysis suggests that a decisive close below 66,000 could pull the trend further toward the lower boundary of the upper channel near the 50,000-mark. Additionally, significant volatility may occur around the 100k mark, given its psychological impact and potential for profit-taking.

**Bitcoin's Price Continues to Rise: Could it Reach $100,000 by the End of the Year?**
Bitcoin's price continues to rise, and analysts believe it could reach its maximum value of $100,000 before the end of the year. According to Ryan Lee, chief analyst of Bitget Research, 'if history repeats itself and Bitcoin's prices grow as projected, a 14.7% increase from the current price will take the currency far above $100,000 by the end of the month. The post-halving cycle trend is also very positive when projecting the future of Bitcoin.' Lee also notes that Bitcoin has already surpassed the $90,000 record, a week after Donald Trump's election win in the US. The cryptocurrency has risen over 20% in November, which historically averages monthly returns of over 44%, according to CoinGlass data. Other analysts, such as those from Bitfinex, also predict a positive trajectory for Bitcoin's price, with some even expecting it to reach $100,000 in the coming months. 'Predicting the price is a difficult bet, but we expect Bitcoin to have a limited decline now given the bullish momentum, as well as the fact that we avoided a recession, which at the time seemed highly plausible,' said the Bitfinex analysts. 'We expect Bitcoin to stay within a range and accumulate a bit, and in our opinion, a $100,000 target in a few months doesn't seem too far-fetched.'

**Bitcoin Breaks Through $93,000, Reaches New Historical High**
Bitcoin broke through the $93,000 mark, reaching a new historical high of $93,265 on November 13, 2024, according to TradingView. The cryptocurrency's market capitalization exceeded $1.84 trillion, pushing it to seventh place in the global ranking. The daily trading volume exceeded $716 million. As of the time of writing, the price of bitcoin has retreated below $90,000. The cryptocurrency's market capitalization and dominance have increased, with the former reaching $1.84 trillion and the latter reaching 61.38%. As a result, bitcoin temporarily surpassed Saudi Aramco in the global ranking. However, the cryptocurrency's market capitalization has since fallen to $1.77 trillion, pushing it back to eighth place. The author notes that the increase in market capitalization and dominance is a positive trend, but also mentions that the cryptocurrency's price has retreated. The article also mentions that the index of fear and greed remains at 67 points, indicating a dominance of accumulation over selling. The article references a separate material that discusses the reasons behind the current bitcoin rally and expert predictions for the future.

**US Inflation: Bitcoin Faces the November CPI Data**
The recent change in US politics, with the new economic policy, has significant implications for inflation. The upcoming CPI data for November will be crucial in determining the direction of Bitcoin (BTC) in the near future, especially considering the potential changes to interest rate cuts. Analysts had expected a 2.6% annual inflation rate, up from 2.4% in September, and a stable core CPI of 3.3%. However, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has been cautious, opting for a gradual decrease in interest rates. Jerome Powell's goal of a 2% inflation rate is still in question. For the Fed to consider cutting interest rates in December, the results must be in line with expectations, confirming a continuous disinflationary trend.

**Altcoin Season: When Will It Begin?**
The cryptocurrency market has seen a 28.24% growth since November 5, with nearly all top cryptocurrencies showing positive momentum and Bitcoin increasing by 29.08%. Popular analyst Miles Deutscher believes that the current Bitcoin cycle is similar to previous ones and that it is currently in its third phase. According to Deutscher, the current cycle is likely to follow the same pattern as previous ones, with the market reaching its peak in the second or third quarter of 2025. Deutscher also notes that the current Bitcoin dominance is stable and that the altcoin rally is likely to occur before the decline of Bitcoin dominance. However, Deutscher also points out that the speculation index, which was over 90% in previous cycles, is currently at 21%, indicating a more cautious market. Overall, Deutscher believes that the Bitcoin market cycle will reach its peak in the middle of next year, providing a strong environment for altcoin growth. 'The current Bitcoin cycle is similar to previous ones,' Deutscher said. 'It's currently in its third phase, which usually starts at least 200 days after the halving.' Deutscher also noted that the current market is 'more cautious' than previous ones, with the speculation index at 21% compared to over 90% in previous cycles. 'The current market is more cautious, but it's still a good environment for altcoin growth,' Deutscher said. 'The altcoin rally is likely to occur before the decline of Bitcoin dominance,' Deutscher added. 'The current Bitcoin dominance is stable, and it's a good foundation for altcoin growth.'

**Dollar Dominance and Bitcoin Boom: A Trump-Era Economic Upswing**
The U.S. dollar reached a near four-month high, while bitcoin hit new peaks as investors bet on favorable trade policies under President Trump. The euro and yuan weakened amid expectations of U.S. economic strength and aggressive trade measures, leading to inflationary concerns and changing interest rate forecasts. The U.S. dollar index increased by 0.16% to 105.59, closing in on its strongest point since July, while bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $89,637, reflecting market optimism. Market forecasts of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December were reduced, factoring in potential inflationary pressures from trade and immigration policies targeting Europe and China.

**ETH, XRP, and DOGE Recover: Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon?**
The beginning of an altcoin season is suggested by recovery signals from major altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin, despite Bitcoin's market capitalization not decreasing. Some analysts believe that the change with large increases in altcoins could mean that altcoins will perform better than Bitcoin. ETH, XRP, and DOGE have seen huge increases after a significant breakout. ETH has just surpassed the important resistance level of $3,000 and if the momentum continues, higher levels can be seen. XRP has also joined this rally and is making strong upward movements with room to grow. The question now is whether XRP can surpass the next resistance level of $0.60. Dogecoin is also on the rise, with the price surpassing the resistance level of $0.18 and showing the ability to continue the bullish trend. The altcoin rally is supported by several indicators. Benjamin Cowen, a well-known analyst, stated that the dominant level of 60% for Bitcoin often serves as a benchmark for the strength of altcoins. Historically, the attention of investors has shifted to altcoins in search of higher returns when Bitcoin's dominance reaches this level. Cowen also highlights trends from the past, speculating that altcoins may rise in November before falling in December, similar to the trends in 2020. The ETH/BTC pair will be crucial to monitor as the altcoin rally continues. However, macroeconomic factors and regulatory forces still have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market, and a change in monetary policy can cause significant volatility. To determine if the altcoin rally can continue, investors should closely monitor ETH, XRP, and DOGE, as well as Bitcoin's dominance patterns.

**'Alt Season' Begins With Massive ETH, DOGE and XRP Pumps**
The 'alt season' rally may have begun, with Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP showing recovery signals. Analyst Benjamin Cowen suggests that Bitcoin's 60% market share could mark a shift towards altcoins outperforming Bitcoin in terms of percentage gains. Ethereum has broken through the $3,000 mark and is aiming for higher levels, while Dogecoin has climbed past $0.18 and XRP is making a strong upward move. Cowen notes that a 60% Bitcoin dominance level frequently precedes a shift in investor attention to altcoins, which may rise through November before declining in December, similar to past trends. The ETH/BTC pair will be a crucial indicator to monitor if the altcoin rally continues.

**Bitcoin Reaches New Historical High, Expert Predicts $100,000 by End of November**
The cryptocurrency market's total capitalization reached $2.83 trillion, with Bitcoin's dominance index at 58.9%. The total volume of positions liquidated by traders in a day was $385 million, with $280 million of that being short positions. Cardano and Dogecoin saw the largest gains among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by capitalization, with increases of 32.1% and 10.4%, respectively. The surge in cryptocurrency prices and investor optimism follows Donald Trump's election as US President, who has expressed support for digital assets. While Bitcoin has not yet reached its 2021 peak value, when one coin was equivalent to 37 ounces of gold, it is now worth 28.43 ounces. According to expert Michaël van de Poppe, Bitcoin is showing an upward trend, with a key support level formed at $70,000, and the price may reach $100,000 by the end of November.

**3 Cryptos That Outperformed Bitcoin This Week**
Bitcoin's market dominance has surged to 60.62% by Nov. 4, 2024, its highest level since April 2021, but recent signs of slowing momentum and a dip below 60% suggest a potential shift in market dynamics that could favor altcoins. The altcoin index is rising, indicating potential strength for non-BTC assets. NEIRO, RAY, and GOAT outperformed Bitcoin with strong gains, with NEIRO leading at a 46% BTC gain, followed by RAY with 32%, and GOAT at 29%. These gains were even more significant in USD, highlighting strong momentum in these altcoins. The structure of Bitcoin's dominance suggests a potential topping phase, which indicates a more favorable period for altcoins.

**Bitcoin holds key support levels amid election week volatility as Altcoins and meme coins surge**
Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, finding support at Fibonacci levels, despite Election Day volatility. Primary support levels to watch are around $64,550 and $60,000, while a bullish push could aim as high as $77,000. Stablecoin dominance is hitting resistance, while Bitcoin dominance remains strong, with a daily RSI overbought for eight days. Altcoins and meme coins are seeing robust gains, with notable performers including MOG, MEW, POPCAT, BONK, and DOGE. Traders are advised to hold off on new positions until the dust settles, given the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and elections.

**Renowned Analyst Benjamin Cowen: We Are Ready for the Big Finale in Altcoins**
Renowned analyst Benjamin Cowen stated that the expected rise in altcoins may begin now, while the crypto market focuses on the US elections. Cowen, who made a brief market analysis via X, pointed to December 2024 and January 2025. Cowen, who warned about the significant increase in Bitcoin's dominance and its potential to lower altcoins, especially in the BTC pair, said: 'We are now ready for the big finale in altcoins. The expected deadline has arrived. I expect the declines to end by December 2024 or at the latest by the second week of January 2025. It was a long journey. Many people gave up, but I always said this would happen.' Cowen has been warning about the risks of altcoin investments for approximately two years, and has regularly mentioned it in his publications. He pointed out that the dominance warning he made has come true, and that Bitcoin's power has been proven once again with the recent increase in dominance. The dominance of Bitcoin has increased by over 39% in the last three years, reaching over 60%. Every movement in Bitcoin has particularly affected altcoins this year, and the most followed ETH/BTC pair has fallen to as low as 0.04. Cowen had also predicted a short-term recovery in this pair. At the time of writing, Bitcoin's dominance is above 60.2%.

**Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Hits 60 Despite Major Price Reversal By U.Today**
Bitcoin's market dominance has reached 60%, a significant shift in market dynamics, after a prolonged altcoin season. Despite altcoins losing value on their BTC pairs, Bitcoin's price surge has allowed it to surpass smaller coins. According to chart analysis, Bitcoin's recent decline from the $70,000 mark illustrates selling pressure at higher levels, but does not necessarily indicate a breakdown in the cryptocurrency's bullish trend. Key support levels to watch are $67,000, $64,000, and $62,000. To maintain its momentum and advance higher, Bitcoin must recover and hold above $70,000. The current dominance cycle suggests that Bitcoin will continue to dominate altcoin performance until it establishes a stable base near its recent highs, potentially giving altcoins a chance to recover.

**Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Hits 60 Despite Major Price Reversal**
Bitcoin's market dominance has reached 60%, a significant change in market dynamics and a reversal of trends that have shaped the industry for years. This has happened despite a major price reversal, with Bitcoin's recent surge allowing it to surpass numerous smaller coins in performance. According to chart analysis, the price of Bitcoin recently reversed from the $70,000 mark, failing to hold onto its position above this crucial level. However, this decline does not necessarily portend a breakdown of the cryptocurrency's overall bullish trend. The $67,000, $64,000 and $62,000 key support levels are worth keeping an eye on, as they might act as stabilizing points for Bitcoin if it continues to retract. In order to maintain its bullish momentum and possibly advance higher, Bitcoin must recover and hold above $70,000. As a result, altcoins are likely to continue to struggle on their BTC pairs as long as Bitcoin is strong, making riskier altcoin wagers less alluring.

**Bitcoin Likely to Enter New Bull Market If This Happens: CryptoQuant**
According to CryptoQuant's analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) may not be entering a new bull market yet, despite recent gains. The reason is that Bitcoin's dominance is increasing, not decreasing, which is a sign that investors are not diversifying their funds into alternative coins (altcoins). Historically, major bull runs have coincided with declines in Bitcoin dominance. Woominkyu, the author of CryptoQuant Quicktake, said, 'Looking at this chart, we can see that, historically, major bull runs across the market have coincided with declines in Bitcoin dominance. If this pattern repeats, we might anticipate the beginning of a new crypto bull market as Bitcoin dominance decreases.' However, Bitcoin's dominance has been increasing, reaching 58.2% as of November 1, up from 54.7% on October 24. The launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has driven a huge capital inflow into the Bitcoin network, making it less likely for Bitcoin's dominance to decrease in the near future.

**Will Bitcoin Dominance Prevent a Stronger Altcoin Market?**
The Bitcoin dominance is currently at 60%, with only 40% of the 2.42 billion dollar crypto market invested in altcoins. This could be the reason why altcoins like Ethereum and Solana are not seeing the same level of growth as Bitcoin. However, according to crypto analyst Evca Wolf, this will change once Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high and enters a consolidation phase. Many investors will then liquidate their Bitcoin holdings and move to altcoins, which will receive increased attention and investment. Wolf advises investors to be patient and wait for the altcoin market to react to the Bitcoin surge. Additionally, the upcoming US presidential election on November 5th could have a significant impact on the crypto market, with Donald Trump being more favorable to Web3 technologies and cryptocurrencies. FreeDum Fighters, a project that allows users to profit from the election outcome, is currently in presale and offers high staking returns.

**Bitcoin Breaks Through $71,000 Level**
On October 29, 2024, Bitcoin broke through the $71,000 level and stabilized at it. Other cryptocurrencies also showed a positive trend. An expert explained this by positive expectations of a potential decrease in the Federal Reserve's interest rate in early November. According to TradingView, the daily increase in Bitcoin's price is almost 2%. At the time of writing, the price is $71,251. The Bitcoin dominance indicator also increased, reaching 59.79%. Other major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization also showed significant growth, with Dogecoin's price increasing by over 15%: 'The rise in Bitcoin is supported by several factors, including the expected decrease in the Federal Reserve's interest rate on November 7, 2024. The market expects the regulator to lower the rate by 25 basis points, which reflects the need for adjustments to support economic growth,' said Ryan Lee, an analyst at Bitget Research in an interview with The Block.

**US Election Fuels Bitcoin Volatility as Options Traders Eye $80,000 Target - Decrypt**
As the US election approaches on November 5, Bitcoin traders are bracing for increased volatility, with estimates for price swings as high as 20%. According to Derive, a DeFi derivatives platform, there is a high concentration of bets around an $80,000 Bitcoin strike price and a strong presence of short-term call sales. Derive founder Nick Forster said, 'The overwhelming dominance of calls being sold suggests a strategic premium collection by traders, while the focus around the $80,000 strike highlights a potential pivotal point for Bitcoin.' Forster also mentioned that traders are paying more for options, signaling protective moves, or 'hedging,' as the election approaches. This added cost, known as the volatility risk premium, shows traders anticipate larger price shifts and are willing to pay to manage their risk. Forster added, 'There's a one in three chance that BTC could see a swing greater than 10% on election day, with a more volatile scenario of 20% movement sitting at a 5% likelihood.'

**BTC dominance nears 60% — Will November’s rate cuts and election push Bitcoin past $100K?**
Bitcoin's market dominance is nearing 60%, a level last reached in April 2021. This surge in dominance, combined with upcoming events such as the US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy review, may lay the groundwork for Bitcoin's next major move. The US presidential election on November 5 could be monumental for crypto, with Republican Donald Trump leading with a 66.1% chance of winning. The Federal Reserve's potential 25 basis point rate cut on November 7 could inject fresh liquidity into the market, potentially boosting Bitcoin's upward momentum. Additionally, Russia is set to lift its ban on Bitcoin mining on November 1, reflecting a broader trend of governments easing crypto restrictions. Experts predict that Bitcoin could reach new all-time highs if this momentum persists through November, with some analysts forecasting a potential price of $90,000 to $100,000 by the end of the year.

**Altseason 2025 Under Threat? Why 60% Bitcoin Dominance is Not a Good Sign**
The price of Bitcoin has surpassed $68,000, sparking talk of the upcoming altseason. However, analysts at Hashkey Capital believe that for a new altseason to begin, Bitcoin's market dominance must reach 62-70%. According to their optimistic scenario, an altseason is more likely if the price of Bitcoin exceeds $80,000. Additionally, the ratio of Bitcoin to gold must increase above its current level of 23, and altcoin premiums must return. Cryptoanalyst Willy Woo believes that approaching a 60% market dominance by Bitcoin may signal the weakening of altseasons. He predicts that future cycles will see reduced returns from altcoins, changing the approach of traders. Woo notes that altcoins with lower capitalization will be 'pumped' after Bitcoin's price surge to $68,000, as investors seek higher returns on riskier assets. He also believes that the current 3rd altseason is focused on meme coins, which he calls 'a joke in the crypto space.' According to PlanB's preliminary forecast, if Bitcoin reaches $70,000 in October and Donald Trump wins the presidential election in November, it could be a turning point.

**Altcoin Season Unlikely in November as Bitcoin Prepares for New ATH**
The likelihood of an altcoin season in November remains low as Bitcoin's dominance grows, with its price rising from $53,000 to $67,000 since mid-September. According to QCP, 'Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, reaching highs of 59.75% for the week...We believe that the uptrend in bitcoin dominance is likely to persist in the near term as bitcoin approaches its ATH levels.' If Bitcoin reaches its all-time high of $73,078, its market dominance could surge to 60%, potentially delaying the altcoin season. Currently, only seven altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day period, suggesting that altcoins lack the momentum needed for a breakout.

**Bitcoin Dominance Likely to Persist in Near Term: QCP Capital**
QCP Capital reports that Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market has increased to 59.75% for the week, with a current share of 59.30%. This rise in dominance suggests Bitcoin's growing strength in the market. In contrast, ETHBTC broke its key support level and declined by 5.85%. QCP predicts that Bitcoin's dominance will continue to rise as it approaches its all-time high levels. Despite fluctuations in the market, Bitcoin attempted to break through the local high of $69,500 but failed to move further up. Institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with BTC ETF net inflows of $997.7 million this week. Other market incidents include the US government probing into Tether, which led to a decline in USDT before it rose again. Geopolitical factors, such as Israel's retaliatory attacks on Iran, also affected the markets, causing selling pressure. The week's focus turns to the non-farm payroll figures, which will give insight into the Federal Reserve's future actions. Market expectations remain stable, with a 95.1% probability of a 25bp rate cut in November.

**Bitcoin Maintains Bullish Trend and Strengthens Dominance Over the Market**
The bitcoin (BTC) continues to rise, reaching above $67,000 after a 0.5% increase in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has surpassed $68,000 in the last session and its weekly appreciation is around 10%. Ethereum (ETH) also maintains its value above $2,600 after a slight increase in the last day. The panorama is mixed for 'altcoins', with some tokens like Solana (SOL), Toncoin, and Cardano (ADA) losing value moderately, while others like XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are experiencing moderate gains. According to TradingView, the bitcoin's dominance, or its weight or capitalization relative to the rest of the market, has reached 59%, the highest level in the current bull cycle and the strongest reading since April 2021. This metric has been falling gradually since it surpassed 70% at the end of 2020 and hit bottom after the FTX collapse in November 2022. Since then, it has been rising steadily. The decline of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is behind much of the growing dominance of bitcoin. The ether/bitcoin ratio is around 0.0385, its weakest level since April 2021. Additionally, ether has only surpassed bitcoin in seven of the last 23 months, with May 2024 being the last month in which the second-largest cryptocurrency outperformed the bitcoin. These movements seem to indicate a clear preference for BTC in a time of uncertainty in the stock market, conditioned by the upcoming US elections on November 5 or the conflict in the Middle East, among other factors. According to experts, the rise of bitcoin in recent days corresponds to traditional movements of the cryptocurrency at this time of year. October is traditionally the most bullish month for the king cryptocurrency, but the increases usually come in the second half of the month, as explained by CryptoQuant analysts. According to these experts, the second week is usually a consolidation period and creates the basis for revaluations of up to more than 10% in the following weeks, as seems to be the case. 'It is necessary for the apparent demand to expand for the bitcoin prices to rise sustainably to a new historical maximum. In these cases, the apparent demand reached a maximum of 490,000-550,000 BTC,' explains Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant analyst. Manuel Villegas, Julius Baer analyst, highlights that the strong demand, as well as the high level of open interest in futures markets, is another factor that is reinforcing the bullish case for bitcoin. 'Regarding the supply, the most relevant factor to consider is the FTX case, where creditors are expected to receive a cash distribution and potentially reassign to cryptocurrencies, which could counteract the pending impact of Mt. Gox. We are waiting for the US elections and the next Fed meeting in less than a month, and in the meantime, volatility should remain high, in line with risk assets,' explains this expert. In this sense, the market seems to be leaning towards two more 25 basis point interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. It is worth noting that this Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) will decide whether to reduce or not the official interest rates, with the consensus betting on another new cut.

**Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Trade Like 'No Bear Market On The Horizon,' Trader Predicts All-Time High In The 'Next 3-4 Weeks'**
Cryptocurrency markets are trading higher, with 96% of Bitcoin holders in profit. Notable statistics include a 43.5% increase in large transaction volume and a 10.4% increase in daily active addresses. Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach 60% dominance before an altcoin season begins. Trader Michaël van de Poppe stated that Bitcoin is targeting a new all-time high, potentially reaching $90,000 by the end of the year. CryptoCon marks Bitcoin's next target at $109,000, which could be reached as early as December. According to BitQuant, Bitcoin might consolidate between $75,000 and $95,000, with $63,000 remaining a solid buying price. However, the trader does not recommend buying above $70,000.

**Bitcoin's Dominance Over Ethereum: A Turning Point?**
According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Bitcoin is not ready to give up its leading position, with its dominance in the market expected to rise to 60% from its current 57.64%. This means that Bitcoin is attracting more investors, while altcoins, including Ethereum, are losing ground. Cowen predicts that Ethereum's price will continue to fall relative to Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio potentially reaching a cycle low. However, he also suggests that Ethereum could stabilize and potentially rebound before other altcoins hit rock bottom. Cowen warns that the worst-case scenario is a temporary rebound followed by a new low in December. Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio is trading around 0.04125 BTC, or approximately $2,597. Investors are advised to remain cautious and closely monitor market developments.
