**Quad hearings in aid of ICC investigation**
Former President Rodrigo Duterte appeared before the 11th quad committee hearing, where he was questioned about extrajudicial killings (EJKs) during his administration's war on illegal drugs. Duterte stated, 'The ICC does not scare me a bit. If I go to hell, so be it. Ginawa ko para sa bayan, para sa anak natin.' (The ICC does not scare me at all. If I go to hell, so be it. I did it for the country, for our children.) The article argues that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has no jurisdiction to investigate Duterte due to the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC in 2019. The author claims that the ICC cannot issue a warrant for Duterte's arrest, as it would be an illegal arrest. The article also criticizes the quad committee for being a 'circus' and the House of Representatives under Speaker Martin Romualdez for being ineffective. The author predicts that former senator Antonio Trillanes IV's political career will end after May 2025.

**Lavrov to Lead Russian Delegation to G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will lead the Russian delegation to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, scheduled for November 18-19. This will allow him to meet with other international leaders who have criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Although Brazilian President Vladimir Putin is under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court and Brazil is obligated to enforce it, the Brazilian government had previously expressed openness to Putin's attendance. However, Maria Zajarova, the spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has confirmed that Lavrov will lead the delegation, and he plans to speak at several sessions and hold bilateral meetings. Zajarova did not provide further details. In previous instances, other governments have sought ways to express their political discontent with Russia during the summit, but Russia's presence complicates the possibility of issuing unified and strong statements on issues like Ukraine.

**Seeing Through the Fog of Justice in Israel and Palestine**
The conflict in the Middle East is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. This article aims to dispel false claims about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its investigation into the situation in Palestine. Contrary to claims by Israel, the United States, and others, the ICC has jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders. In 2015, Palestine became a member-state of the ICC, and in 2021, judges determined that the ICC Prosecutor has jurisdiction over Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. As a state recognized by 149 of 193 UN member states, Palestine has the right to have its citizens investigated by the ICC, regardless of where their atrocities are perpetrated. 'The Court also has jurisdiction over any atrocities committed on Palestinian territory, irrespective of the perpetrator's nationality,' according to the ICC's jurisdiction. Former Canadian Justice Minister Irwin Cotler's claim that the ICC has jurisdiction over Palestinian citizens but not Israeli ones is false. 'These claims are false,' the article states, emphasizing the ICC's jurisdiction over both Israeli officials and Palestinian leaders.

**Israel questions ICC judge's impartiality in Netanyahu arrest case**
Israel has questioned the impartiality of International Criminal Court judge Beti Hohler, who is reviewing a request for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others. The Office of the Attorney-General of Israel stated that Hohler had previously worked for the Office of the Prosecutor, and 'respectfully requests that judge Beti Hohler provide information to clarify whether there are (or are not) grounds to reasonably doubt her impartiality.' The court's chief prosecutor had filed a request in May for arrest warrants against Netanyahu and others, citing reasonable grounds to believe they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The case has been delayed due to several rounds of legal filings by Israel challenging the court's jurisdiction, and the replacement of Romanian magistrate Iulia Motoc with Hohler. The court has no set deadlines, but generally takes about three months to rule on requests for arrest warrants.

**Israel Raises Concerns about Judge's Impartiality in ICC Case**
Israel has raised concerns about the impartiality of a judge at the International Criminal Court, which is considering whether to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This could further delay the decision, which is related to a request filed by the ICC prosecutor in May to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and three leaders of Hamas, due to the Gaza war. The request requires the approval of ICC judges, but the decision has been delayed due to several reasons, including multiple appeals filed by Israel challenging the court's jurisdiction. Another reason for the delay is the request by Romanian judge Julia Motoc last month to step down from the three-judge panel considering the request due to health reasons, and Slovenian judge Bettina Holzer was chosen to replace her. The Israeli Attorney General's office said in a statement on November 11 that Holzer worked in the prosecutor's office at the ICC before being appointed as a judge in December last year. The statement said, 'Israel respectfully requests that Judge Bettina Holzer provide information to clarify whether there are any grounds, or no grounds, for reasonable suspicion of her impartiality.' The statement added, 'Israel does not imply that Judge Holzer's previous work in the prosecutor's office necessarily or automatically raises logical concerns about her impartiality. However, the judges of the court have acknowledged that holding previous positions in the prosecutor's office raises reasonable concerns about bias, depending on the circumstances.' In May, the ICC prosecutor filed a request to issue arrest warrants, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu, Galant, and the three Hamas leaders committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. Two of the Hamas leaders are now either dead or believed to be dead.

**Russian Court Issues Arrest Warrant for ICC Deputy President Reine Alapini-Gansou**
The Basmanny District Court in Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for Reine Alapini-Gansou, the deputy president of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, on the request of a prosecutor. Alapini-Gansou is accused of illegal detention and imprisonment (Article 301, Part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) for issuing an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the court's ruling, the arrest warrant for Alapini-Gansou is valid for two months, starting from the moment of her hypothetical detention on Russian territory. Alapini-Gansou, a Beninese national, has been a judge at the ICC since March 2018 and is set to complete her term in 2027. She has a strong background in human rights, having worked with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights and the United Nations. The ICC had previously issued an arrest warrant for Putin and children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova in March 2024. This is not the first time a Russian court has issued an arrest warrant for an ICC official, as the Basmanny District Court also issued a warrant for ICC judge Hailikul Bens Mahfoud in November 2024.

**Russia Targets ICC Judges Who Issued Arrest Warrants for Putin**
Russia continues to 'punish' International Criminal Court (ICC) judges who have issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin. In November, the Basmanny District Court in Moscow issued an arrest warrant for ICC Deputy President Reine Alapini-Gansou, citing charges of unlawful detention. The reasons for the decision were not publicly disclosed. Alapini-Gansou, a Beninese lawyer, became an ICC judge in 2018. This is not the first time Russia has targeted ICC judges. In 2022, the ICC issued arrest warrants for three former officials of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia, and in March 2024, Alapini-Gansou became the Deputy President of the ICC, succeeding Tomoko Akane, who issued an arrest warrant for Putin and authorized the detention of Russian children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova. The Russian government has also put ICC President Piotr Hofmański and Tomoko Akane on the wanted list, and the Investigative Committee has issued charges against the ICC prosecutor and judge who issued the arrest warrant for Putin and Lvova-Belova.

**Russian Court Issues Arrest Warrant for International Criminal Court Judge**
The Basmanny Court in Moscow has issued an international arrest warrant for International Criminal Court (ICC) judge Renee Alderida Sophie Alapini-Gansou, who is accused of allegedly illegally detaining individuals. According to reports, Alapini-Gansou was among the judges who issued an arrest warrant for Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu and Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov in the summer of 2024. Alapini-Gansou, a Beninese lawyer, has been a judge at the ICC since March 2018. The court has issued a warrant for her arrest, and she has been put on international wanted list. The arrest warrant will be effective from the moment of her extradition to Russia or her detention on Russian territory.

**Sergey Lavrov to Lead Russian Delegation to G20 Summit in Brazil**
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will lead the Russian delegation to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, according to a statement by Russian diplomat Marat Berdyev on his Telegram channel. President Vladimir Putin had previously announced that he would not attend the summit this year, stating, 'I don't want to disrupt the event.' Putin believed that his presence would have disrupted the normal functioning of the forum. He added that Russia would send someone who could represent the country's interests at the summit on a high level. Brazil, a participant in the Rome Statute, which grants jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court (ICC), issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023. The Kremlin stated that the warrant would not hinder Russia's relations with other countries. Brazil took over the G20 presidency on December 1, 2023, and the final summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. It is worth noting that the G20 parliamentary resolution previously 'forgot' to mention Ukraine.

**Arab-Islamic Summit Calls for International Arrest Warrants for Israeli Officials**
The Arab-Islamic Summit, held in Riyadh on Monday, called on the International Criminal Court to issue international arrest warrants for Israeli officials responsible for crimes against the Palestinian people, including the crime of genocide. The summit condemned the Israeli Knesset's approval of racist and illegitimate laws, including the 'Law of Withdrawal of Immunity' for UNRWA employees and the prohibition of their work in Palestinian territories. The summit aimed to follow up on the results and recommendations of the previous summit, continue efforts to stop the Israeli aggression, facilitate the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid, and discuss the ongoing escalation of Israeli aggression against Palestinian and Lebanese territories. This is the second Arab-Islamic Summit, following the one held in Riyadh on November 11, 2023, which was attended by leaders from over 50 Arab and Islamic countries.

**Russia Issues International Arrest Warrant for ICC Judge Haikel Ben Mahfudh**
The Russian justice system has issued an international arrest warrant for International Criminal Court (ICC) judge Haikel Ben Mahfudh, who had previously issued arrest warrants for Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valeri Gerasimov in June for possible war crimes related to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. According to Russian media, the Russian authorities requested the 'preliminary investigation and detention' of Ben Mahfudh, accused of violating Article of the Russian Penal Code related to 'illegal detention'. Ben Mahfudh, born in 1971 in Tunisia, has been an ICC judge since March 2024. He is known for his investigation into environmental protection in armed conflicts, victim rights, human rights, and democratic transitions in the Arab world, as detailed by the organization. This move comes after arrest warrants were issued in March 2023 against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Commissioner for Children's Rights, Maria Lvova Belova, for forcibly deporting Ukrainian children from occupied areas of the European country.

**International Criminal Court to Investigate Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague will begin an external investigation into the allegations of misconduct against Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, according to Reuters, citing two sources. The investigation was agreed upon at an assembly of member states on November 7. Khan is accused of harassment, and an internal document suggests that he should temporarily step down from his role. However, it is unclear who will conduct the investigation. Khan has denied the allegations, claiming they are part of a disinformation campaign against his office. Khan has previously issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's children's ombudsman, in March 2023, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders in May 2024, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, the ICC has not yet issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, as they have since been killed. The alleged victim is unsure about the independence of the internal organ, which is headed by a former Khan employee, due to leaks of information about the case.

**Lula defends end of conflict in Ukraine and wants Putin to regain 'right to walk around the world'**
Brazilian President Lula has expressed his desire for the conflict in Ukraine to end and for Russian President Vladimir Putin to regain 'the right to walk around the world in a civilized manner'. Lula made these statements in an interview with CNN Internacional, stating that it's not good for democracy for a country like Russia to be isolated from the world. 'What I think is that we need to work so that this war ends once and for all, and Putin regains the right to walk around the world in a civilized manner and participate in events,' Lula said. Brazil currently holds the presidency of the G20, and a summit of world leaders will be held in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. The Brazilian government had been working to make it possible for Putin to visit the G20 summit despite a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. Brazil submitted a document to the UN's Commission on International Law arguing in favor of Putin's visit, despite the warrant. The goal was to develop provisions on immunity for heads of state to ensure they are not prosecuted during international visits. The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest in March 2023 for the alleged 'illegal deportation' of Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia claims the children's lives were in danger, while presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Moscow does not recognize the court's decision.

**Craig Mokhiber – Turmoil at the ICC as fears rise over Israel and the U.S. interference**
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has faced significant delays and interference in its investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Israeli leaders Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. The ICC's Prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted a request for arrest warrants in May 2024, but the court has yet to issue a decision. The delay has raised concerns about the court's independence and the potential for external pressure to influence the outcome. Israeli and Western intelligence agencies and government actors have been accused of pressuring ICC judges and court officials to derail the investigation. The ICC's reputation is at risk, and a failure to deliver justice in this case could have serious consequences for the court's legitimacy and effectiveness. The article also highlights the risk of prosecution for crimes against the administration of justice, including impeding or corrupting the ICC's officials.

The British Ministry of Defence has revealed that the intelligence gathered by the Royal Air Force's surveillance planes over Gaza can be used as evidence against Israel in the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The planes, which conduct near-daily missions over the 25-mile-long Gaza Strip, are attempting to help Israelis identify the locations of hostages taken by Hamas over a year ago. According to the Ministry of Defence, if a formal request is made, the videos or images obtained by the planes can be handed over to the International Criminal Court as evidence of suspected war crimes committed by Israel or Hamas. The RAF's surveillance and monitoring missions began in December 2023, following Hamas's attack on the settlements known as the Gaza Envelope on October 7, 2023. Although the Ministry of Defence has not officially disclosed the type of planes or their number, the Shadow R1 plane, equipped with high-resolution electronic and visual sensors to collect data, is operating in the area. A British military source said that the Shadow R1 plane will not be able to 'monitor all of Gaza' but will be able to monitor convoys of vehicles, streets, and blocks of flats. He added, 'If the International Criminal Court comes to us and says, 'We believe there is a war crime in this area,' and asks if we have any footage, the government's response will be, 'Yes, we do, and we will provide it.' Between December 2023 and June 2024, the Royal Air Force conducted over 250 flights near Gaza. The International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, stating that there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe they are responsible for crimes against humanity and other crimes. Israel has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza and cut off vital aid. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said, 'In line with our international commitments, we will consider any formal request from the International Criminal Court to provide information related to investigations into war crimes.'

**Putin Proposes Way to Avoid ICC Arrest Warrants through Intergovernmental Agreement**
Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) can be resolved by signing a intergovernmental agreement. He made this comment in the context of a possible trip to Brazil for the G20 summit, according to RIA Novosti. Putin noted that 'decisions of this kind are very easy to circumvent, it's quite simple. All you need to do is sign an intergovernmental agreement, and the ICC's jurisdiction will be limited.' He emphasized that Russia and Brazil have had strong and stable relations for many years, creating conditions for signing necessary documents without creating complex situations for the parties involved. However, Putin announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil, citing the need to avoid disrupting the work of the summit. He added that the Russian authorities will determine who will represent the country at the summit at a high level. Since December 1, 2023, Brazil has taken over the presidency of G20, and the final summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19. Previously, the Federation Council commented on Ukraine's request to Brazil to arrest Putin.

**Vladimir Putin Declines G20 Summit Invitation Due to ICC Warrant**
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will not attend the G20 summit in Brazil on November 18-19 due to a warrant for his arrest issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) related to the war in Ukraine. Putin stated, 'We understand perfectly that, including or excluding the TPI factor, all the discussion will be only about that. And that would disturb the work of the G20. Why? We are adults!' The Brazilian government had been trying to provide guarantees for Putin's visit without being arrested, but the efforts were unsuccessful. Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira stated, 'I cannot limit or restrict a judge, nor imagine or guess what they will do. There may be other things that can happen.' Putin has been avoiding international travel since the ICC warrant was issued, limiting his trips to countries that do not recognize the ICC as a legitimate authority.

**Putin's Possible Attendance at G20 Summit: Kremlin Studies Invitation**
The Kremlin has stated that they are studying the possibility of Russian President Vladimir Putin attending the G20 summit in Brazil on November 18-19. According to presidential spokesperson Dmitri Peskov, 'We are still studying this question. As soon as a final decision is made, we will inform you.' Putin and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will discuss this and other matters at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, on October 22-24. Lula invited Putin to the summit in December 2023, but noted that he will have to face the consequences of the international arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Ukraine. 'If Putin travels to Rio de Janeiro, well, he will be invited. He will have to face the consequences' of the international arrest warrant, Lula said during a press conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. It is up to the Brazilian justice system to decide whether Putin will be arrested or not, Lula added. Recently, Putin proposed Brazil, China, and India as possible mediators in future peace negotiations, in contrast to the US and European powers, which Moscow believes are interested in prolonging the conflict. Putin and Lula discussed their bilateral relations and the Ukraine settlement during a recent phone call.

**Kremlin Works on Putin's Participation in G20 Summit**
The Kremlin is still working on the issue of Russian President Vladimir Putin's participation in the G20 summit in Brazil, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. 'We are continuing to work on this issue. And after the final decision is made, we will inform everyone,' Peskov said to journalists. Brazil has been chairing the G20 since December 1, 2023, and the final summit in Rio de Janeiro will take place on November 18. The Brazilian government has been working to make Putin's visit to the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro possible this fall, despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. According to Folha de S.Paulo, the Brazilian government submitted a document with legal arguments in favor of Putin's visit to the UN Human Rights Commission in November last year. The commission is currently working on developing provisions for the immunity of heads of state, which would guarantee that leaders of countries are not subject to prosecution during international visits. The International Criminal Court, which Russia does not recognize, issued an arrest warrant for Putin and children's ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing Russia of 'deportation' of children who were rescued from Ukrainian shelling and evacuated to safe areas. Peskov called the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin 'unacceptable,' saying that Moscow does not recognize the court's jurisdiction and considers its decisions to be null and void.

**Guinea Ecuatorial Invites Putin to Visit Despite Not Complying with International Criminal Court Decisions**
Guinea Ecuatorial's President Teodoro Obiang has invited Russian President Vladímir Putin to visit the African country, which has not signed the International Criminal Court's founding treaty and has not complied with its decisions, including the arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. 'We are willing to host the Russia-Africa summit in our modern city of Malabo. We have all the necessary infrastructure,' Obiang said during an intervention in the Russian Duma. The African leader, who is visiting Russia for the second time in less than a year, added that he would like to have the participation of Russian deputies if the event takes place, and particularly 'the excellence of Vladímir Putin, whose personal presence would be a great honor for our people.' Obiang noted that 'Guinea Ecuatorial has not signed any cooperation agreement with the International Criminal Court, so we have all the necessary conditions' for Putin to visit the country without risk of being detained. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023 for his alleged role in the systematic deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, which has imposed significant restrictions on Putin's ability to travel. Obiang will participate today alongside Putin in the plenary session of the Russian Energy Week (REN) being held in Moscow until Saturday. In November last year, Obiang met with Putin at the Kremlin leader's country house on the outskirts of Moscow (Novo-Ogariovo).
