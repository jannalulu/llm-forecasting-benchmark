**DON'T EAT THAT: Why food recalls are up this year**
According to the FDA, there have been 1,908 food and cosmetic recalls as of October 31, 2024, a significant increase from 1,563 recalls in 2023. Florida Atlantic University associate professor of supply chain management, Steven Carnovale, attributes the higher number of recalls to the complex and globally interconnected nature of the food supply chain. However, he notes that the added assurance of safety guardrails and regulations working is a positive outcome. Carnovale also points out that new advancements, such as savvier bar codes, are being fine-tuned to better pinpoint and track the source of contaminations. Additionally, grocery stores seem to be more proactive in reaching out to customers about recalls, allowing for faster public alerting. As Carnovale said, 'The nature of food supplies is so globally interconnected and it's so globally dispersed.'

**Costco Recalls Butter Due to Labeling Error**
Costco has recalled over 80,000 pounds of its 'Kirkland Signature' butter due to a labeling error that could put people with dairy allergies at risk. The FDA classified the recall as a Class II, indicating that while it is unlikely to cause severe harm, it could cause temporary adverse effects in those with a dairy allergy. According to the FDA, 'the absence of the 'contains milk' label is a sufficient reason for the product to be removed from the market.' The affected products include both 'with' and 'without' salt versions of the butter, manufactured by Continental Dairy Facilities Southwest and with expiration dates extending until March 2025. The FDA has not reported any adverse reactions, but recommends that customers who purchased these products return them to the store for a full refund or discard them as a precaution.

**Cheese sold at Aldi, Market Basket and more recalled due to listeria worries**
Soft ripened cheeses sold by retailers including Aldi and Market Basket are being recalled due to listeria concerns. According to the FDA, listeria infection can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections, and is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., with 1,600 people sickened and 260 killed annually. The recall involves seven types of ripened cheese produced at a facility in Lena, Illinois, where routine testing found equipment to be potentially contaminated. Consumers are urged to not eat the recalled products and to return to where they purchased it for a refund. 'Listeria are hardy germs, which can spread in food processing facilities, where they are difficult to fully remove,' health officials say. The recalled cheeses have best-buy dates of Dec. 24, 2024, and Jan. 13, 2025.

**Texas butter recall update as FDA sets risk level**
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified a butter recall as its second-highest risk level due to potential missing allergy statements on the packaging. Continental Dairy Facilities Southwest LLC is voluntarily recalling nearly 80,000lbs of butter, including Kirkland Signature Unsalted Sweet Cream Butter and Kirkland Signature Salted Sweet Cream Butter, which may be missing the allergen statement 'Contains Milk.' The recall applies to 46,800lbs of unsalted butter and 32,400lbs of salted butter with 'best by' dates between February 22, 2025 and March 23, 2025. Milk is one of the eight major allergens, and consuming the recalled butter may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences, such as digestive problems, itching, and anaphylaxis. However, the FDA's classification means the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote, presumably because it is well known that butter contains milk.

**Popular milk brand recalled in 27 states because it may cause 'life threatening' reaction**
HP Hood LLC has recalled five types of its 96oz containers of Lactaid Milk in 27 states due to the presence of undeclared almond, which can trigger a 'life-threatening' reaction in people with an almond allergy or sensitivity. The company discovered the issue during routine maintenance and no illnesses have been reported. The recalled products include Lactaid Whole Milk, Lactaid 2% Milk, Lactaid 1% Milk, Lactaid Fat Free Milk, and Lactaid 2% Calcium Enriched Milk, with expiration dates ranging from November 2024 to December 2024. The FDA warned that people with an almond allergy or severe sensitivity may experience serious or life-threatening allergic reactions if they consume these products. According to Allergy Insider, an allergy to almonds is reported in 9-15% of people with a tree nut allergy, which can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including an itchy mouth and throat, hives, stomach pain, vomiting, shortness of breath, and swelling of the mouth, tongue, and throat. In severe cases, people can go into anaphylactic shock, which is treated with epinephrine, supplemental oxygen, antihistamines, and steroids.
