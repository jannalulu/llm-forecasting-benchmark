The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is preparing for a record number of travelers on Thanksgiving Day, with over 18 million people expected to pass through airport security checkpoints, a 6% increase from last year. According to David Pekoske, TSA administrator, 'The volume of passengers is 17% higher than in 2022, and we are facing the most active Thanksgiving travel season on record.' The TSA has reinforced its staff to ensure that wait times at security checkpoints do not exceed 30 minutes for most passengers, and that PreCheck passengers do not have to wait more than 10 minutes.

'If we lack personnel, we will slow down traffic as needed to maintain the system's safety,' Whitaker said. As a result, travel has been more evenly distributed throughout the week, but people are still advised to avoid traveling on Wednesday and Sunday, the busiest days.
