**Idaho Secretary of State Approves 2026 Marijuana Decriminalization Initiative for Signature Collection**
The Idaho Secretary of State has approved a proposed measure to decriminalize marijuana, allowing organizers to begin gathering the 70,725 signatures needed to place it on the ballot in 2026. The measure, proposed by Kind Idaho, would decriminalize personal use and cultivation of marijuana for adults aged 21 and older. It would allow for the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana flower or 1,000 milligrams of THC in products, as well as home cultivation of up to 12 plants. Signature collection must be completed by April 2026, with volunteers already active in several counties. The measure explicitly exempts these activities from penalties under Idaho's Uniform Controlled Substances Act and Illegal Drug Stamp Tax Act, provided they meet specified conditions. If enacted, Idaho would join other states in significantly reforming its marijuana laws.

**Pharma-Grade Cannabis Could Hit Walgreens & CVS -- But Can The Industry Survive The FDA? - Ayr Wellness (OTC:AYRWF), Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF)**
The rescheduling of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III could have significant implications for the industry, including the potential for major pharmaceutical retailers like CVS and Walgreens to carry cannabis. Denise Pollicella, a cannabis attorney, notes that rescheduling is not just about new retail partnerships, but about overhauling how cannabis businesses operate, adapting to FDA oversight, meeting pharmaceutical-grade standards, and navigating stricter compliance requirements. Pollicella anticipates a system similar to the 2018 hemp legalization framework, where states submit regulatory schemes to meet federal guidelines. She also warns that rescheduling is far from guaranteed and that substantial lobbying will likely be needed to make progress. Despite the challenges, Pollicella is optimistic about the industry's potential under a rescheduled framework, believing that businesses with scalable production capabilities and strategic foresight will thrive.

**State announces intent to award 22 new medical marijuana licenses**
The state of Florida has announced its intention to award 22 new medical marijuana licenses, nearly 18 months after the applications were submitted. This decision will bring the total number of licenses to 47. However, rejected vendors have 21 days to appeal the decision, which may delay the licensing process for up to a year. Paula Savchenko, an attorney and cannabis industry consultant, stated, 'Pretty much anybody who received a denial of license letter is pretty much going to appeal the license.' The decision comes just weeks after Amendment 3, which aimed to allow recreational marijuana sales, failed to pass. Trulieve, a company that spent $140 million on the amendment, has welcomed the decision and expressed its desire to work with the governor and legislature to expand access to safe lab-tested cannabis for Floridians.

**Lawmakers Urge Biden to Take More Action on Cannabis Before Leaving Office**
More than a dozen lawmakers have sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to take additional steps on cannabis decriminalization before his term expires in mid-January. The letter, endorsed by Rep. Barbara Lee, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, among others, lauded the administration's work to transfer cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, but added that the transition should be finalized before January 20. The letter noted that the transition would not address the gap between federal and state cannabis policy, and that more action was needed to resolve the harms of criminalization. The lawmakers urged Biden to issue another round of clemency and an updated memorandum on prosecutorial discretion for marijuana offenses, and to encourage state governors to expand marijuana clemency and decriminalize low-level marijuana conduct under state law. However, some advocates have criticized the administration's plan, saying that rescheduling the cannabis plant to Schedule III fails to adequately address the conflict between federal and state cannabis laws.

**DEA Sets Stage For Marijuana Rescheduling With December 2 Hearing**
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will hold a hearing on December 2 to discuss the proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This move could ease cannabis research and federal tax deductions, but stops short of federal legalization. The proposal has sparked debate, with some questioning the DEA's commitment to the initiative and others criticizing the transparency and motivations behind the Biden administration's push for reform. The rescheduling process has drawn criticism from lawmakers, particularly from Republican members of Congress, and allegations of improper communications with prohibitionist groups. The outcome of the DEA's proceedings will have profound implications for the cannabis industry, research, and federal drug policy.

**DEA to hold hearing on plan to loosen federal marijuana restrictions**
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) plans to hold a formal hearing on December 2 to discuss its proposal to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act. This move, which was recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2023, would reclassify marijuana as a drug with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence. While this change may have limited effects on cannabis consumers, some cannabis businesses believe it could allow them to deduct more business expenses, resulting in lower prices. The hearing will serve as a procedural day to address legal and logistical issues and discuss future dates for the evidentiary hearing on the merits. According to the DEA, no witness testimony is expected.

**Prohibitionist Group Denies Collusion Ahead Of DEA Hearing - Village Farms Intl (NASDAQ:VFF)**
Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), a prohibitionist group, has denied allegations of improper communications with the DEA ahead of the cannabis rescheduling hearing. SAM's lawyers argued that the claims are unfounded and aimed at distracting from the proceedings. They stated, 'This motion is a transparent effort to smear both SAM and the DEA,' and urged the DEA's Administrative Law Judge to focus on the substance of the hearing. SAM acknowledged earlier social media posts by its president, Kevin Sabet, predicting that Attorney General Merrick Garland, rather than DEA Administrator Anne Milgram, would sign the NPRM, but argued that the post was made before the NPRM's issuance. The DEA hearing, scheduled to begin on December 2, will explore the Department of Justice's proposed rule to reschedule cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

**Lawmakers call for progress on marijuana law before end of Biden administration**
Progressive lawmakers have written a letter to President Biden, urging him to take additional steps on federal marijuana law before his term ends in January. They are calling for marijuana to be rescheduled from a Schedule I to Schedule III controlled substance, which would classify it as a less severe drug with some medical value. However, the lawmakers note that this move would not end federal criminalization or resolve its harms. They are also pushing for Biden to issue broader clemency, including pardons and commutations, for individuals convicted of other cannabis-related offenses. Additionally, they are calling for the Department of Justice to update the Obama-era 'Cole Memo' to deprioritize prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses that comply with state or Tribal law. The lawmakers argue that 'rescheduling marijuana and the prior round of pardons must not be the end of this Administration's historic work to use its executive authority to undo the damage of federal marijuana policy.'

**DEA Judge Blocks Researcher's Motion In Cannabis Case**
A DEA administrative law judge has denied MedPharm's motion to participate in the December 2 marijuana rescheduling hearing, citing statutory limits on his authority. MedPharm, a DEA-registered research firm, had criticized the exclusion of marijuana researchers and the inclusion of prohibitionist organizations, calling the process biased. Judge John Mulrooney acknowledged the value of wider input but noted that the DEA prioritizes participants who can demonstrate adverse impacts from the proposed policy change. Critics claim the DEA favors prohibitionist groups, undermining scientific integrity in the cannabis rescheduling debate. 'The deck appears to be stacked against those in favor' of rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), MedPharm noted. The upcoming hearing will allow cross-examination of witnesses from both sides, but critics warn the imbalance could skew outcomes. 'The Administrator exercised her discretion to fix the number of participants,' Mulrooney said, adding that expanding the list would exceed his role under the Administrative Procedures Act.

**DEA Judge Invites Prohibitionist Group To Explain Allegedly ‘Unlawful’ Talks With Agency Amid Marijuana Rescheduling Review**
A DEA judge has invited the prohibitionist group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) to explain allegations of 'unlawful' communications with the agency as it considers the Biden administration's cannabis rescheduling proposal. The judge has also denied a request to postpone an upcoming hearing on the rescheduling issue. The allegations claim that DEA officials had improper ex parte communications with SAM, which has strongly opposed the government's plan to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. SAM's president, Kevin Sabet, had private conversations with DEA officials about the rescheduling effort, according to social media posts. The judge has emphasized that the allegations are 'serious' and that the concomitant obligations to memorialize and report such communications are not 'couched in permissive language.' The initial rescheduling hearing is still moving forward, with an initial preliminary meeting set for December 2.

**We Still Need Marijuana Freedom**
Although 24 states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and 39 states have legalized the medical use of marijuana, the federal government still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance. This means that possessing, growing, transporting, or distributing marijuana is a federal felony, with violations resulting in fines and/or imprisonment. Even in states that have legalized marijuana, there are many government rules and regulations that limit the freedom of marijuana users. Libertarians believe in real marijuana freedom, where there should be no rules or restrictions on the buying, selling, possessing, growing, processing, transporting, advertising, using, delivering, or 'trafficking' of marijuana. Advocates of marijuana freedom must continue to fight for real freedom, not just legalization.

**Treasury Report: Over 800 Banks Partnered With Cannabis Companies In 2023 Despite Federal Hurdles**
The U.S. Treasury Department has released a report stating that over 830 financial institutions have partnered with state-licensed cannabis businesses in 2023, a modest increase from the previous year. However, despite this growth, fewer than 10% of all financial institutions in the U.S. provide services to the cannabis industry. The ongoing hesitation among banks stems from federal law, which classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, posing significant legal risks for banks. According to NORML, the lack of clear federal guidelines continues to deter many banks, exacerbating the challenges faced by cannabis businesses in securing banking services and investment capital. Paul Armentano, NORML deputy director, said, 'No industry can operate safely, transparently, or effectively without access to banks or other financial institutions.' The absence of comprehensive banking reform disproportionately impacts smaller and minority-owned cannabis businesses, which often rely on traditional financing to grow and operate. The SAFER Banking Act remains a key focus for cannabis advocates, who argue that it would provide the much-needed clarity and legal protection for financial institutions willing to work with the industry.

**Marijuana stakeholders walk fine line to join rescheduling hearing**
The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has invited 25 stakeholders to participate in a hearing about rescheduling marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. However, to participate, these stakeholders must reconcile the idea that marijuana should be rescheduled with the notion that they would be harmed by the change. Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), said, 'We have to show standing – that we’re a so-called ‘aggrieved party’ – and so we’re taking the position that we support the proposed rule, but we have a narrow objection.' The NCIA's filing argues that rescheduling would lift restrictions on novel cannabinoids, while The Commonwealth Project's filing notes that rescheduling without regulations would negatively affect individuals 65 and older. Village Farms' filing notes that rescheduling would reduce the perceived risk associated with doing business with marijuana companies, but also warns that the DEA could reject the current proposal or move marijuana only to Schedule 2.

**Where to Find (Legal) Weed in the US in 2024**
Despite a surge in state-level legalization efforts, federal policy on cannabis remains unchanged in 2024. President Joe Biden's announcement in May to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug is still pending, with an administrative hearing scheduled for December 2. While reclassification would make it easier for scientists to research cannabis' benefits and allow businesses to claim more credits, it would not federally legalize the drug. Currently, 24 states have legalized recreational cannabis, 15 states allow medical use with varying restrictions, and 11 states have not legalized cannabis for either use. Nebraska recently passed ballot measures to legalize medical cannabis and create a government commission to regulate it, but faces court challenges. Public opinion is shifting, with 88% of Americans supporting legalization for medical or recreational use, according to a PEW research study.

**Florida's Recreational Marijuana Measure Flames Out -- but There Is a Silver Lining | The Motley Fool**
Florida's attempt to legalize recreational marijuana, Amendment 3, failed to pass with 55.9% of the vote, falling short of the required 60% needed for passage. Despite this, there is a silver lining for marijuana companies like Trulieve, Verano, and AYR, which have seen success in selling medical marijuana. The Biden administration's efforts to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act could pave the way for an official rescheduling of cannabis, which would remove the burden of Section 280E and improve the profit potential for these companies. As one source notes, 'it's not all bad news' for these companies, as they can continue to thrive in the medical marijuana market.

**Kamala Harris Promises to Legalize Recreational Marijuana Nationwide**
US Vice President Kamala Harris has announced that she will seek to legalize recreational marijuana nationwide if she wins the presidential election. This proposal would complement the Biden administration's initiative to reclassify marijuana as a low-risk substance. Harris wrote on X, 'I will legalize recreational marijuana, break down unjust legal barriers, and create opportunities for all Americans to succeed in this new industry.' The initiative would need to pass through Congress, where it would require negotiations with Republicans or a budget reconciliation process. The US market for legal cannabis is estimated to be worth $32 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Harris had previously mentioned the possibility of promoting the cannabis industry in October, when she promised to 'boost a national cannabis industry.' The Biden administration has also initiated the process of reclassifying marijuana from a restricted substance (Schedule I) to a low-risk substance (Schedule III). This reclassification would change the way marijuana is classified under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which establishes the federal policy on drugs. The DEA explains, 'Substances, chemicals, and certain products used to manufacture substances are classified into five distinct categories or lists based on the acceptable medical use of the substance and the potential for abuse or dependence. The abuse index is a determining factor in the classification of the substance; for example, substances on Schedule I have a high potential for abuse and creating severe psychological and/or physical dependence. As the classification of the substance changes (Schedule II, Schedule III, etc.), so does the potential for abuse (substances on Schedule V represent the lowest potential for abuse)'

**DEA Judge Pushes Back Timeline for In-Person Testimony in Marijuana Rescheduling Hearing**
The DEA's hearing on marijuana rescheduling has been delayed, with in-person testimony now set to begin in either January or February 2025. According to an order filed by DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John Mulrooney II, the judge is seeking further clarification on participants' positions and eligibility to participate in the hearing. NORML's Deputy Director Paul Armentano expressed disappointment but not surprise at the DEA's decision to include groups opposed to marijuana policy reform as designated participants. Armentano noted that the administrative process is cumbersome and that it is unlikely that opponents will be able to argue against the findings of the HHS and FDA, which have determined that cannabis does not meet the scientific criteria for a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. Despite the delay, Armentano remains optimistic that common sense and evidence will ultimately prevail, and that advocates will be able to look back on this process as marking the beginning of the end of federal cannabis prohibition.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has begun selecting witnesses for a hearing on the Biden administration's proposal to federally reschedule marijuana, which is scheduled for December.

The DEA has not yet released the complete list of witnesses, and it's unclear how many were selected. The hearing has added uncertainty about the potential rescheduling timeline, with some concerns that the rulemaking process may not be completed before January.

A federal appellate court has scheduled oral arguments for December 5 in a landmark case aimed at overturning the US government's prohibition on marijuana. The plaintiffs, including Verano Holdings Corp. and Massachusetts-based cannabis businesses, argue that the federal prohibition is unconstitutional as applied to state-regulated cannabis activities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) opposes the challenge, warning that a successful outcome could disrupt the federal government's plan to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. The plaintiffs' lawyers, including David Boies, argue that Congress has effectively abandoned its effort to eradicate marijuana and has exempted it from federal enforcement in certain circumstances. Industry leaders, including TerrAscend founder Jason Wild, have expressed support for the lawsuit.

According to the DEA, a final ruling is expected to be published in the Federal Register within 60 days of the hearing, with the actual law change coming 30 days after that, putting marijuana on track to be rescheduled sometime between January and March 2025. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) has filed its intent to participate in the hearing, citing its longstanding role in cannabis reform and its commitment to representing cannabis consumers across the U.S.

**DEA could reclassify marijuana to a less restrictive category – a drug policy expert weighs the pros and cons**
The DEA is considering reclassifying marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. This move would make marijuana legal at the federal level for medical use, but still prohibit recreational use. Critics argue that the decision was not properly researched and is driven by popularity rather than science. However, proponents argue that marijuana has accepted medical use and that rescheduling would legitimize its use as a medicine. They also point out that Schedule III includes dronabinol, a synthetic version of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Rescheduling could also open up new opportunities for medical research into marijuana's effects. However, opponents cite possible health risks associated with marijuana consumption, including addiction and increased risk of schizophrenia. Despite these risks, research shows that marijuana use can have many benefits, including pain management, reduced dependency on opioids, and potential prevention of Alzheimer's and Type 2 diabetes. 'It would legitimize its medical use,' said the author, a philosopher and drug policy expert. 'And the intent of the move is to increase access, even if it is unclear how rescheduling would achieve that.'

**Commentary: Reclassifying cannabis as a Schedule III drug only exacerbates a bad situation**
The Biden administration's proposal to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug is a step in the wrong direction, according to critics. The current policy reform efforts have shown positive results in reducing overdose deaths, but the administration's plan risks adding to the 'toxic' and 'flawed' American pharmaceutical system. Critics argue that Schedule III drugs are tightly controlled, and placing cannabis in this category will only exacerbate the problems of high costs, chronic shortages, and disparities in access to vital medications. The article suggests that the administration should rethink its approach and build a modern regulatory structure that can manage the complex and diverse uses of psychoactive drugs.

Top House Democrats, Jerrold Nadler and Frank Pallone, are urging the DEA to expedite the process of rescheduling cannabis, citing its 'less potential for abuse than other drugs' and 'accepted medical use in treatment.' They align with recommendations from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, which have called for reclassification from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. The lawmakers also pushed for further reform, including descheduling, which would remove cannabis from the CSA entirely.

They emphasized the importance of focusing on the biggest threats to Americans amidst the opioid and overdose crisis.
