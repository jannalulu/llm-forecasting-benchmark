**Reforming UN Security Council could address crisis of legitimacy - but can this be done?**
The United Nations Security Council's limitations in maintaining international peace and security have been highlighted by recent conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict. The Global South has long called for comprehensive reforms to make the Security Council more inclusive and equitable. However, countries in the Global South have differing views on the nature of the reforms needed. The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) propose expanding both permanent and non-permanent seats, while the African Union demands two permanent seats with veto power. The L.69 Group supports expanding both permanent and non-permanent membership, and the Uniting for Consensus group opposes the expansion of permanent membership. The P5, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China, have strategic reasons for maintaining the status quo and are reluctant to dilute their privileged positions. An incremental approach may offer a feasible path forward for Security Council reform, including expanding both permanent and non-permanent membership and reforming the veto power.

**United Kingdom to Lead United Nations Security Council Amid Escalating Israeli Offensive**
The United Kingdom will take over the presidency of the United Nations Security Council in November, amidst the escalation of the Israeli offensive in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. The UK's representation will succeed Switzerland, one of the five permanent members, which has maintained a timid stance on the ceasefire, after supporting its ally the United States in its total backing of Israel at the beginning of the conflict on October 7, 2023. More than a year later, the international community demands urgent action against Tel Aviv's ruthless deployment, which has claimed nearly 43,000 fatalities in Gaza and over 2,000 in Lebanon. The current structure, with China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US in the permanent seats, reflects the balance of power at the end of World War II, when the UN and its agencies were created. The Security Council's resolutions are legally binding for all UN member states, making it the most powerful organ within the UN system. However, the US veto has delayed several months the call for a ceasefire in Gaza, while the General Assembly achieved a overwhelming majority before concluding 2023. The presidency is assumed by each member for a month, following the alphabetical order in English of the countries' names. This year, Algeria, the Republic of Korea, Guyana, Sierra Leone, and Slovenia began a new mandate until 2025, while Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, and Switzerland will conclude their non-permanent membership in December.

**UK to Head UN Security Council Amid International Pressure on Israel**
The United Kingdom will take over the presidency of the United Nations Security Council in November, succeeding Switzerland. This comes as the international community demands urgent action against Israel's brutal military campaign in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, which has resulted in over 43,000 fatalities in Gaza and over 2,000 in Lebanon. The UK's stance on the conflict has been timid, having supported the US in its unwavering backing of Israel since the conflict began on October 7, 2023. The Security Council's structure, with China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US holding permanent seats, reflects the balance of power at the end of World War II. The Council's resolutions are legally binding for all UN member states, making it the most powerful organ within the UN system. However, the US veto has delayed several months the call for a ceasefire in Gaza, while the General Assembly achieved a resounding majority before the end of 2023. The presidency of the Security Council is held by each member state in turn for a month, following the alphabetical order of their names in English. This year, Algeria, the Republic of Korea, Guyana, Sierra Leone, and Slovenia began a new term until 2025, while Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, and Switzerland will complete their non-permanent membership in December.

Switzerland has taken over the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council, succeeding Slovenia. This comes as the international community debates the need to reform and expand the council's structure, which has been criticized for underrepresenting Africa, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific regions. The current structure, with China, France, the UK, Russia, and the US holding permanent seats with veto power, reflects the post-WWII balance of power. The other 10 members are assigned regionally and serve for a year. The council's presidency is held by each member in alphabetical order for a month. The council is responsible for global governance, including maintaining international peace and stability. This year, Algeria, South Korea, Guyana, Sierra Leone, and Slovenia began a new term until 2025, while Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, and Switzerland will complete their non-permanent membership in December. The council's resolutions are legally binding for all UN member states, making it the most powerful organ within the UN system.

**What is the UN General Assembly and what does it do?**
The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is the most representative organ of the 193-member United Nations, holding a general debate in New York from September to December and special sessions at other times. The 79th General Assembly session in 2024 will focus on 'advancing peace, sustainable development, and human dignity,' including a Summit of the Future to address global governance and cooperation challenges.

It elects nonpermanent members of the Security Council, appoints the secretary-general, and considers reports from other UN organs. Membership can be contentious, with Taiwan and Palestine's status being debated. The assembly has made efforts to revitalize its work, including establishing an ad hoc working group and holding a Summit of the Future to create a Pact for the Future. The assembly has censured states for violating UN Charter principles, including suspending South Africa's delegation in the 1960s and condemning Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

**UN General Assembly: World Leaders Convene in New York Amid Global Chaos**
The United Nations General Assembly is meeting in New York, bringing together the leaders of the 193 member states. The global landscape has evolved significantly since Barack Obama's vision of a unipolar world without war and with a common goal of global prosperity. Today, the world is likely multipolar, fragmented, and at times chaotic. This is the current state of global affairs that the UN leaders will address over the next three days. As Obama once envisioned, 'the world is a complex and ever-changing place, and we must be prepared to adapt and evolve in order to achieve our goals.' However, the reality is far from his initial idea, and the world is now facing a multitude of challenges and conflicts. 'The world is in chaos, and we must come together to find a way out,' said a UN official, emphasizing the need for cooperation and collective action.

**Understanding the 79th General Assembly of the United Nations**
The 79th General Assembly of the United Nations will begin on September 24, 2024, with leaders from around the world discussing important topics such as the conflict in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change, and the reform of the UN Security Council. The assembly will have representatives from 193 member states, as well as observers from the Palestinian Authority and the Holy See. The theme of this year's assembly is 'Leave No One Behind: Acting Together for Peace, Sustainable Development, and Dignity for All, Now and for Future Generations.' The assembly will vote on several important resolutions, including the election of new members to the UN Security Council and the budget of the organization. Despite criticism of its effectiveness, the UN General Assembly has been responsible for deliberating on many important issues throughout history, including the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the recognition of the People's Republic of China, and the suspension of South Africa due to its apartheid regime. However, the assembly's relevance in the global geopolitics is being questioned, with some leaders, such as the US President Joe Biden, not attending the 78th assembly in 2023.

**The Future Summit: Shaping a New World Order**
The United Nations has proposed the idea of holding a summit to shape the future, as stated in the report 'Our Shared Path'. The summit will take place on the sidelines of the 79th session of the United Nations on September 22-23, 2024. The summit aims to address current and future challenges, particularly in light of the emergence of the BRICS bloc, which will hold its meetings in Kazan, Russia from October 22-24, 2024. The summit will focus on five main tracks: sustainable development and finance, peace and security, digital future for all, youth and future generations, and global governance. The outcome of the summit will be a final version of the Future Charter, a digital global charter, and a declaration on future generations. The charter will be adopted by all member states during the summit. The Future Charter will be a living document, a dynamic framework that adapts to the requirements of the 21st century, and aligns with the basic principles of the United Nations established in 1945. After the summit, the focus will shift to implementing the recommendations and commitments made in the Future Charter. In November 2024, Azerbaijan will host the United Nations Climate Conference (COP29), and climate financing will be a top priority. In December 2024, the United Nations Conference on Non-Coastal Developing Countries will take place in Botswana, where solutions for sustainable development will be sought. In June 2025, the International Conference on Development Financing will take place in Spain, where efforts will be intensified to reform the international financial architecture, including institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. On the other hand, the BRICS bloc will hold its meetings in October 2024 in Kazan, Russia, where Russia will chair the bloc in 2024. The BRICS bloc has expanded its membership in an effort to compete with the Western-dominated global system, inviting Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina, and the UAE to join. Four countries have already joined the bloc: Egypt, Iran, the UAE, and Ethiopia in January 2024, while more than 40 countries have expressed interest in joining. The BRICS bloc represents more than 30% of the world's arable land and more than 40% of global production of grains, meat, and dairy products, as well as more than 40% of fish and seafood production, and more than 35% of global GDP. This has led to the emergence of a new world order, and a return to the bipolar system, which offers opportunities for emerging countries to choose and balance between the two blocs, requiring flexible skills, policies, and strategies from emerging countries.
